Newt Gingrich and then you've got\nThe caravan and have you seen this\nAll started a down in Guatemala on friday with a hundred and sixty migrants [noise]\nAnd uh apparently they said\nWe're going to try to take the same track that they took in April when thousands or almost a thousand migrants were heading through Central America to the United states and Donald Trump warns Central American governments hey you better turn off but a flow of the migrants or else\nIt looks as if we will probably turn off the foreign aid to your nation and when you look at the amount of money that the United states gives to all these nations it's substantial [noise]\nSo what is different this time last time is the fact that now you've got hundreds and Guatemala and they're both saying hey ah you know what if you're in the migrant um march toward the north a turnaround come on back because\nYou're breaking the law essentially\nBut the big thing that bothers a lot of Americans is the fact that the borders between these nations are invisible and they're simply not enforced [noise] but now we understand from Mexico which has sent or something like five hundred security personnel to their southern border in Mexico between Mexico and Guatemala\nA unless you've got the proper papers they're not going to let people through nonetheless the president\nHas given the fact that it is just less than three weeks away from the mid turn to president realizes that this is not only an important issue for our national security but also for his turn out the vote based\nOr he did some tweeting this morning and the tweets are so extraordinary I'm going to share them with you right here in the brand kill me jump\nTwo hours go to the president tweeted this out I'm watching the Democratic party led because they weren't open border and existing we cause I'm watching the Democratic party led a salt on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador whose leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people\nIncluding many criminal\nThis large flow of people including many criminals from entering the United states from Mexico to the United states and he goes on in addition to stopping all payments to these countries have remembered it adds up to hundreds of millions of dollars\nHelpline ideas to digital companies enjoy the dolls or just people just like you you chose invent help to\nPursue their idea we're experience we are working for you we are in bed fellows for free\nInformation to one eight hundred and five four or five zero Seventy five that's one eight hundred and five four or five zero seven eight five again one eight hundred and five four or five zero seven eight five\nWhether you had an accident tangle with Mother Nature for water fresh off your cars look called quality collusion card start today\nFrom giving you a tone and working with your insurer to get you back on the road with the highest quality repairs quality collision take story out of college and my parents\nWe offer a locally owned family business service with the national warranty an award winning customer satisfaction do you can relax we'll take it from here called seven seven to six three four zero for quality clean cars are in Prescott valley [noise]\n\nShould not how we do things here in Arizona lying about our neighbors and co workers and friend Martin Nellie and her Washington allies keep lying about ... years in and among with all sad show\nDirty hope your children and grandchildren aren't learning the true facts cinema voted for hours penalty against anyone who write down our children\nYoung girls are more than they could dialing nearly no wonder fact checkers already warmed and ... and her mom and local news media and all these latest attack ad Molly ... manning ESPN as low as you can get\nAlong now dean at the ... still think about it is Martha McNally one line just to get elected and Gmail lie about anything I mean I don't know how their rent and do things here in Arizona\nI'm here in Santa Monica candidate for US Senate and I haven't heard of that ... me more by ...

I couldn't sleep left [laughter]\nI was just open you know what am I going to do for the first twenty four minutes and tell a rich Lowry comes on the\n... yeah okay or out bail you out [laughter] it'll be radio magic now I\nSo far so good uh what do you think about uh the president and how we said you know let's not be too fast\nPresident and how we said you know let's not be too fast to blame the Saudis regarding the missing guy\nSo I I don't mind you know the attitude let's wait and see all the facts what I Do think a president has seemed to be too eager to ...\nI'm a cover story from the Saudis yep so I don't I don't think that's the appropriate ... posture\nAnd a apparently Pam compounds reporting in ... was quite tough than his private meeting with the ... so I mean this is the difficulty it it seems clear they deliberately set out to murder this guy and the most hideous way out of the Quentin Tarantino\nMovie yeah and what he should condemn them there should be some sort of consequences\nBut you don't want to destabilize the regime because although I think the Saudis are bastards is probably the best we can help or\nUm in terms of the government and Saudi Arabia\nAnd to their an important ally and you know forced to choose between the Iranian and that's how it's which we are you know on a daily basis you go with the ... even though they are imperfect and repressive and murder is but I I just this is such an addition to being a crime kept blunder I now know figure I got to come into your conflict\nAnd not leave and no one's going to notice well\nAnd it makes you wonder if it's ever happened before this happened to guide to simply aren't where an apple watches and and somebody's rolling tape on him\nYeah I mean whether they kill dissidents all the time uh they usually don't do it and there's a brazen a man or a overseas so it's bad you know the the reputation the crown prince will never be the same\nUm but you know where we can't overthrow the Saudi Government and create a liberal liberal government they're just the conditions aren't there for that I don't really have to deal with reality as it is and that's where I think you know Trump has represented a correction to an over emphasis on idealism\nYou know in the Bush years he just has to guard against going out swinging too far and the other direction\nSure and of course everybody's hanging on everything he says because we are less than three weeks away from the midterms in you know the Republicans are\nTerrified that they're going to lose the house there's certain it looks like they could actually pick up some seats in the Senate but that's another story regarding the midterms what is on your radar as something that could break a either way for either side and the next three weeks\n[noise] I I don't know it would be inherently in some sort of surprised what about the Caribbean\nUm it it could yet could could help energize the Republican voters um did you see the question is clearly that the gap in the cabin off by was galvanizing Republicans increase their energy which is hugely important and transformed um a couple of these\nSenate races where it looks almost impossible to me now that Republicans could lose nominal control I think they have at least you know the worst case is that ... ... tie breaker\nUm but the question is does that energy you know last that the next three weeks so if there's something like you know crisis over the care of and maybe that\nHelps the problem in the house is just the these districts that Clinton won that are occupied by Republicans are really endangered\nThe ones where they're Republican incumbent has retired there by eight of them are basically gone even Republicans admit they're they're gone and that gets you you know eight eight seats towards just twenty three and a neat that's holding the house will be the Republican somehow managed that it'll be near a miracle and I'll do it you know by Syria to\nWrite a we had Eric Trump on Fox in front of this morning and he said look if the Democrats when they're going to be a lot of investigations into you know\nThe Trump Administration the Trump family everybody he said but then again when you look at what the Republicans have been able to achieve with a Republican president\nTheir record it's spotty you know the president really wanted to do the wall the you know they're barely building the fence or you want to get rid of Obamacare So it's not like a Republican led Congress is helping them\n[noise] yeah so they just ... which is which which is a big deal but otherwise it's most of the important things have happened through executive action and through\nRegulatory actions so that the downside of Democrats taking the houses on you you know what the other party to take our period but um as Eric I'm pointed out they'll you know Pete spend all their times of painting the president said Nate minister Asian and investigating and try to make everyone's life miserable as possible\nThat's just that they have a one majority and see if there's any kind of majority\nIf they get you know Fifteen it's like a wave Fifteen votes they're going to impeach\nTheir tune you you're probably right hey rich Lowry thank you very much for joining us today here on the brain ... radio show\n\nWhen you know what are we will pass the word along folks are to the people in the computer department and see if they can fix that Marie thank you very much for joining us today from Orlando\nShop the only time it's been asked to watch it\nYeah there's a lot going on or who knows it could be\nWatch it you know there's a lot going on or who knows it could be just one of those darn grim ones that technological stuff can help him one of my kids were kind of keep joined us right now he or she is in a college in Massachusetts Keith thanks for joining us on the brink kill me radio show hey how's it going\nIt's going okay what are you what do you make of one of the other things we were talking with a rich Lowry about a little while ago is uh what's going on in Saudi Arabia and it looks as if\nThey could be covering up the fact that uh the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered that he's Hickman decapitated and take the fingers off of and then just kill a Washington Post\nCorrespondent rather a columnist in Turkey ... what do you think about what is going on with that dynamic because so many people here in the United states Keith are asking the printed in the United states get tough and do something about Saudi Arabia\nFull and what happens unfortunate if it happened we need to get to the facts of course however I think a plane sanctions in this situation would be rather inconsistent\nI mean if we're going to do it the one we should do it at all I mean just this past August we at Iran order seven journalist to be jailed and flogging the wake of their coverage China just in February contained the relatives of three not as they can journalists and the U.S a green card holder for their coverage\nA serene a sham she was an American journalist who in twenty four team was killed by the Turkish government the ... regime after the two days after the accuser and being a spy\nOn I mean in fact turkey under their German regime they've been one of the worst offenders when it comes to journalism and now are we supposed to really expect an honest investigation from like the turkey if so that would be akin to giving credibility to Russia's investigation into the poisoning of Sergei scrape\nOff what do you make an interesting point do you know the president's in a pickle it's it's um damned if you do damned if you don't we're gonna have to see what he does he think he very much for joining us here in the brain ...\nMeanwhile over on the news maker line we've got congressman Rodney Davis he serves probably the thirteenth district of the great state of Illinois Republican and he's on the house committee on agriculture and the chair of the subcommittee on biotechnology congressman or thanks for joining us here on the brand kill me Joe\nHey Steve thanks for having me are\nIt's a real pleasure hey listen ah I hear that the vice president was out at a rally for you or what I'm about a week ago right\nYou know he was he came out to Springfield, Illinois to land of Lincoln it just did a great shot rally the troops and really I mean you can't made a nicer guy that vice president Pence caged wants to help every Republican get elected but we got to get everybody the polls and he knows\nHe does know it and that's why he said this about you listen\nTo the people of Illinois are you going\nTo make no mistake about it is not just a choice between your congressman and his phone but also it's a it's a choice between two futures seemed to Congress itself I mean the truth of the matter is that the Illinois Thirteen may be the district that decides whether or not we have a Republican majority or whether\nShe flew she was speaker of the house and the next Congress and I just knew in my heart here in central Illinois you're going to choose results you're going to choose more prosperity and I know in my heart\nThe people of central Illinois are going to support Rodney Davis [noise] will\nThere you've got the vice president some very nice thing you know congressman so many people think oh Illinois a that's a completely blue state that is not the case there\nThat I absolutely not downstate Illinois is negative on many states throughout this nation where Republicans are are winning or winning seats in areas that\nThat even Democrat or legislators drew to elect Democrats than we've got to get those voters took a cold and it's going to hear a vice president Pence say those words a kid I was there when he hid it of course but\nHere again a kind of you know tears me up a little bit but also it puts a perspective on the site reinstate eh we're fighting to make sure Nancy plus a rapper get set speakers Gabriela cat\nAnd I know that is one of the things you're seeing out on the stump what when you talk to people I Know you've shaken a thousands of hands over the last couple of weeks trying to get out the vote for November the six what is the is there one motivating\nFactor for Republicans or independent to lean your way who are Democrats even who who may vote for you on the first Tuesday in November something that's going to motivate them and issue in the news right now\nWell a lot of it boils down to the local issues issues that affect each member of Congress sure as hell when I go shake hands and in whatever town that I'm blessed enough to represent I meet folks I just sat down with a group of senior class students at ... below it away\nAnd the issues that they're most concerned about are usually won't go to that but when you look at the national issues that they move on to the facts and a lot of it has to do is fear fear of Democrats taking over and what is\nWhat is Congress going to look like it's ... below sea as speaker is Jerry ... is chair of the Judiciary Committee\nBecause I don't think there's any way with the flood of ... dollars coming in by the billions even in my district that they're going to hold off from teaching the president and in ... the Supreme Court justice and that is not how we keep the economy moving forward impeachment for only stalled progress that we've seen or can ...\nCongressmen I wanted to ask you about a there's an ad that is being run by your democratic opponent Tibet the blond hair and a cat is centrally I Know you feel it crosses the line because it takes shots at your family\nYou know it really does Steve my you know my wife is at night to your cause cancer survivor\nI sat across the table for the vice president the president while we were trying to reform health care and my number one concern was making sure we added a layer of protections but pre existing conditions have been attacked by my opponent for wanting to take that away from Americans and our allies and\nAn ad that was just recently brought\nIt took pictures up by a wife and my kids then you see it in and they get out of gas hey you can say whatever you want about me I stood up and ran for Congress to keep my kids that's just something that cross the line and I don't think any candidate for Congress Republican or Democrat deserves what what happened to me like their\nNew kidding you know um that is over the line and that's just one of those things that so many people are disgusted by\nUh my wife is a cancer survivor as well and\nFor instance on this book tour so many people have come up to her and said I I ... story I just wanted to give you a hug I'm sure you've gotten it from your wife but she's not public figure and she and\nI I don't know of any Republicans a congressman who we're talking about it as we try to do something about our health care situation to get rid of the uh pre existing conditions provision say our our insurance companies have\nNo none of us are in now and it's a matter of fact the American health care act has has a line in there that says nothing of this actual take away preexisting condition coverage I mean it's in the bill\nAnd it's been scored a for a ... by fact checkers and it's just an outline and my opponent or allies have doubled down on the sly\nAnd it offends people like my life\nBecause health care isn't just a political talking point to us it's just like you and your your wife it's personal\nAbsolutely cars when I Know you're in a fight out there good luck to

my pleasure to be broadcasting\nFrom New York City you know we've been talking about all sorts of things so far today on the kill me show the midterms of course the caravan as well we're going to talk to share Carter in just a moment about the latest\nOn the you know the swamp and how dirty things are at the department of justice and the FBI but the breaking news this morning is apparently our secretary of state Mike Pompeo who just concluded a\nPress briefing after he talked to the ... the United states apparently he told the Saudis you know he just returned from Saudi Arabia you said you've got Seventy two hours to\nFigure out exactly how this guy wound up dead and uh if any Saudis are involved he gave an ultimatum to the royals I told the U.S media we should not rush to judgment and he told the prince Mohammed to own the situation and wrap up the investigation and\nOur secretary of state said this\nGuy told President Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that we do\nWith understanding of the facts surrounding that which we can make decisions about how the United states should respond to incidents surrounding this show I think it's important for all the number two\nWe have any long thirty two long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia to continue to be important to terrorism or did\nTo be able to holy site there and I'm forty changing\nAlliance of the United states we need to be mindful of that as well\n[noise] okay so uh it's pretty clear from what the secretary of state said right there the direction this is going\nIt sounds like it sounds like according to what we've heard so far the crown prince uh was involved in order to take out this show you a Saudi citizens are us resident who worked at the

know like your your prior to come out support mark Callahan you know how can raise some money away it's a winnable district\nThere you go All right Rob thank you very much now let's go to Larry\nHe's retired military Larry what do you make of the president's suggesting today that if the country of Mexico doesn't stop the four thousand migrants the president should use the military and close our southern border\nWell thanks for taking my call you bet well first of all I'm we know that first of all we know that he has the authority to do so I'm as commander in chief that article two of the constitution a sexual one I Believe based on his oath\nA particle to section a three says he'll uh take care of that the laws are faithfully executed\nUnder under under the tenth amendment he also a there was also written decision concerning Arizona if you recall the business of immigration that belongs to the federal government\nAbsolutely and that's why that's why it's so important that the president United States enact and enforce the laws on the books unfortunately and you know this Larry past presidents simply have not done that\nExactly yeah so I think what under Obama what's called the something to do is discretion in in that forcing the laws\nRink and and President Trump is using his discretion to enforce them or are you so you're a hundred percent okay with the military going down on their southern border\nFor certainly certainly and and that individual and made a comment about really throwing more money and then to Central America that brings back in the middle saying that one that won the premise is false everything that follows that must be false and believing anything that that individual or any of the Democrat but politicians say about immigration\nIs really the like put shoes on a dead horse\nIs still there you go All right Larry thank you very much for the call and thank you for your service now let's go to a Columbia South Carolina Rick joined this he listens in on W. cue X. L. Rick thanks for joining us right now you feel the same way about uh the president using military at the border right\nTotally I'm totally in favor of that as President Trump's number one job is to protect the board so the United states to protect our country and with regard to the ... incident um\nThe bottom line is to show he was not an American citizen and that a crime that alleged crime did not even take place on American soil so I don't even see what we have any legal standing to get involved with that sure it's an outrage and a terrible\nThing to happen but ... not an American citizen and I don't believe in a slap in sanctions on\nA country like Saudi Arabia and hurting the American economy I don't like going to the gas pump and having to pay three or four more dollars per gallon of gasoline into that conflict of its own volition\nIt was a stupid thing to do well there's not an American citizen I well I don't\nThink humans are counting on getting murdered in there but uh it it is a quandary for the administration to figure out what to do Rick thank you very much and let's go to Jerry in Nashville Jerry um you you feel the same way what what what's the deal with the show the right\nExactly I feel the same way you know Russia to the ... by shooting of a reporter over there and we didn't have to\nPut on a bunch of sanctions would stop Kim Jong il and Charles is older relatives and and you know we didn't have to get involved with that China is actually currently chili CIA operatives some sort of know your your theory look it up on the Internet\nFor it is quite a situation and um it'll be interesting to see what the president does Mike Pompeo told the president give the Saudis a few more days to investigate because they are when our our most important allies which is kind of what you guys are saying All right\nI'm Steve you fill it in from Frank ... we will return and a couple of minutes right here on the radio\nWhen there's no consequence no deterrent to this illegal activity why would they stop becoming so\nThis is Congress ultimate failure and and that's why it's so important that you know Republicans maintain control both houses ...\n... it's only going to get worse because I think the majority Republican support Donald Trump in his immigration policies or another car seats that dresses she asylum all black people come to claim asylum and a ...\nThat they're coached by the cool organizations say a few key phrases which gets approved at the border\nBut once they show the court ... court eighty percent of the ... so what Congress needs to do is raise that asylum part or so it can't easily meant so much thought\nYeah Tom Tom Homan a former acting director about this Caribbean time the president of Honduras sense that there are unnamed political groups that have organized they'd say other sectors who won a deep stabilize the country but we will be decisive and we will not allow it\nShe suggested politics are involved to make a Honduras look bad but at the same time people are doing the political calculations here\nBad but at the same time people are doing the political calculations here in the United states and they go and let's see there about a thousand miles away they maybe they could be and our southern border around time of the midterms and then we've got that whole separating families thing all over again\n'cause I've I've I've been doing a story for years I surely don't believe in coincidence which I think I think there are certain ... a political a site ... looked him but I think it's going back far out of the American people are paying attention this isn't Trump's a President Trump's failure\nThis wasn't Republican Congress scarier this is the Democrat show you're so you know bottom line\nIt's President Trump he wants to do the right thing he wants to close to the polls you've heard him say it many times over speeches each species eighth back Congress to close loopholes he said many types of the worst thing like racial laws in the world log that is true so this I ... I think it's going back for I think the American people pay attention are Porter\nRight now is not secure and I think if you listen to those on the hill in all the way to abolish ice a ... it's all about family separation at least some type of family separation\nNo one likes to see families separated I get it but because of what's going on right now if Congress don't make the change of these people do get our border either we just open the border up a little keep coming back in the hundreds of thousands in the past year full always what we do prosecute those enter the country legally\nAnd separate them just like we separate American families when their parents get arrested sure I mean that in ... and let me tell you that during the family separation only a couple of weeks to tap the numbers on the border dropped twenty two percent\nSo you know it it does work it shows a consequence at deterrent still illegal activity works and the church thing when you talk about is Congress hasn't funded by a proper levels\nThey need to Fifteen thousand died right now the proposes forty thousand beds but they're getting an ice ten thousand less ... which means the people that you do get a recipe book Joe\nAllowed not going to be released so there's no place to put up you know so Congress has failed on all sides on this\nWill you know because he is a political issue the Republicans are saying look a\nCome mid term it's a binary choice to either a wide open borders vote for the Democrats if you want a strong security at the southern border to vote for Republicans and I think Democrats Tom realize that because they've been telling their members whenever you do let's not talk about immigration because\nUh you know we don't have a a really good story on there to counter the Republican saying do you want a strong border or not\n... I I I don't think the American public's don't be fooled by this law if they want to abolish ice they're not talking about right now\n'cause I Know it's going to hurt them but bottom line is a policy I should go open borders because you're lucky to get by the border patrol indicating two states no one's looking for you to there is no wife so you know I I think that the curtains can fall back on them they're open border agenda\nAnd they can talk about it\nFor their actions speak louder than words or the member states better or not action speaks louder than words it's American people want to secure border and American people want to know this is a a A R summer to remain then they got the right parts of the doctors and they need to make sure that like parties in August to maintain a presence suggested [noise]\nYou know the president does have a lot of discretion when it comes to immigration as we've learned over the last two years going forward in the last two years of his first term of Donald Trump Tom Homan what can the president do to a\nPerhaps tighten up some of those loopholes or get rid of him or or just make the seat the our southern border a little more secure than it is right now\nI think we I think uh the wall to wall is necessary every place I've been around a long time I was in the ... elections that back in eighty four eighty five eighty six and we used to wrestle thousand aliens night\nOn the same she'd go without the soccer fields once it put a border barrier up those numbers draft where decrease they put a barrier in El Paso at that wanted to sign that don't want to ... every place that build a barrier that illegal immigration has decreased so that you know\nDespite all the rhetoric out there that wall actually works as ... illegal immigration responsible jobs but like I said this morning I don't care who Republican or Democrat every one of them have a responsibility to protect just ... just citizens there is no downside\nUnless drops in this country there's no downside unless I'm a Christian scriptures truly for low level low low level low skill labor bin ... worker visa but to keep paying throwing the criminal organizations to smuggle these people's United States is what\nWe're doing that that's something we don't talk about this is just an immigration problem Steve who did this when when when\nIt was immigrants are a criminal organization to smuggle them to work on that very lower station that was smoke\nJohn's us all the ... the I'll Try to pay a tax when they work to Charles plaza when when a criminal organization smokeless people to the plaza ... owns that area you got to pay the cartel taxes so this this is not just yeah it was the immigration issue this national security as\nWell and the other thing is and this is something that we don't pay enough attention to because it's like it's a political thing they tightened the border you don't [noise]\nBut it is about the tens and thousands of men and women in our southern border who put their lives on the line each and every day when you go to do their job and you know if there's a cartel trying to smuggle people across the ... they don't mind killing a border patrol agent\n... matter of fact you know the\nCause of last night or the night before last I was actually at a blurb Joe foundation dinner in Washington DC 'cause I I still are bought them twenty thousand American pages says you set a stand on my everyday protect this country or state and I met a lot of families up on both ... and so like I said last night\nThat people don't want to build his wall or close loopholes for president\nThan certainly do it for the men and women who died a defining destination there's there's over there there's a couple hundred names on that national off to a moral\nWall Street mall we work and to anybody questions the integrity and the brave men and women a pork chop simply walk that lawsuit them and they're so this is about protect this country and and then taking care of the border to like just get so much and then\nThey know that wall works they know what they need that in southern border they want these loopholes closed and one thing I'll add by these ... are tied up changing diapers taking care of these families the cartels will will push of a large population of families across one sector the border draw the boar chose
