I. B. acts in little falls New York Tom\nSo go et cetera KCUR powered who wrote that worries and the management\nIs quoted as saying this will not of course include person born in the United states who are foreigners that's a pretty clear a explanation that people who are foreigners have their children born here would not have citizenship\nTom so you're just tobacco track little because I'm not a constitutional attorney or historian so you're saying when the fourteenth amendment was written a the author of that amendment was ratified or said they did not include foreigners\nThat tried to exact quotation I have is this will not of course include person born in the United states who are foreigners and I got from a website called [noise]\nColorado alliance for immigration reform they'd be on all kinds of quotations and examples and how people all of a sudden started ignoring not praise\nTom thanks you are you really you really helping the show and now the update you the president tweeted this so called birthright citizenship which costs to our country billions of dollars in very unfair our citizens will be ended one way or another it is not covered by the fourteenth amendment because of the word subject to the jurisdiction there of\nMany legal scholars agree Harry Reid was right in Nineteen Ninety three before he and the Democrats went insane and started with the open borders which brings massive crime stuff don't forget the nasty term anchor babies I Will keep our country safe\nThe case will be settled by the United States Supreme court [noise] it's not a crazy argument it's a legitimate one pot is people can do for a you know what the hate the person were labeled a person can we come back Karl Rove on this debate and of course keep your calls coming\nWhat do you think the president can do with these eleven appearances in six days\nWell been a Lebanese ...\nYeah he could do a lot of good any good do not so much good it really depends on how he handles himself in what he says I'm loyal to president was at a high point last week and then the uh the I eat these being said to Democrats\nAnd then the uh the I eat these being sent to Democrats and then there was this anti Semitic massacre in Pittsburgh\nOr hurt the president's ratings because of the way that he responded by he said the right things at times and he said some things that rubbed people raw and I could see it and the data it's affecting people around the country this is an election is going to be over so very close and because of that if the president says something\nGood and handles himself well and and keeps it puts his numbers back up to where they were like Tuesday or Wednesday\nOf last week than Republicans are going to do better than if they stay where they are because there has been a slight diminution other presidents standing largely because of his responses to these events\nWas ... was his response to the other day right so he's response is one thing I Do is scripted and they were fine\nBut when he when he looked at the television and I know George Bush really never did we lose the cable news and so I was being ripped and blamed he went back at him\nDo you think he would be how do you think it was he was being fairly treated windows I ... well whenever you want to call them went to his enemies by that do arranged character living in a band in Florida do you think he was being a a adequately characterized oh\nNo no I think it was being unfairly characterized the question is how to respond to respond by taking a two by four going after your critics are to rise above it\nAnd cause people to say well you know what I hear what I hear what Schumer and Pelosi are saying but I see what the president is saying when he goes on television and I I hear what the critics on CNN and MSNBC and other places have their say blaming him about it but he seems to be focused on\nConsoling the victims and setting the right tone so it's the contrast that people do derive in their own minds rather than necessarily he what he has to say look\nPeople you know he's the president when he punches down at the media\nHe's he is the most powerful person in the world and he is picking an argument with somebody who has a lousy ratings on cable TV\nSo I Would much rather have him be the person that we saw at that rally in Wisconsin who spoke so eloquently about what was going on the the the president who called for unity the man who raised the tone I'd rather see that and I think the persuadable voters voters who are up for grabs in this very close election\nThey want to see that person rather than the guy who's taken a slug\nThat somebody who is mouthed off on some panel on on a cable TV show\n\nThe let the target was right on Trump's relentless rhetorical playbook the bombers enemies where his enemies he has said so again and again and again\nWe should stop pretending that Trump doesn't really know what he's doing\nUm when he when he says the things he knows exactly what he's trying to encourage Donald Trump failed the country he doesn't just felt Democrats he felt Democrats and Republicans and all of it all Americans in between he's\nRefused to in any way acknowledge what role his rhetoric may have played in cultivating the current political climate has an obligation to stop hating on reporter the president has created Colts are on ...\nFor violent rhetoric and an actual violent\nBoy got a point I've been watching some of it there was for people for all have the same view he's horrific responsible and he basically everything's have pulled the trigger\nYeah the let's let's let's look at a thought experiment here let's turn the clock back a year and let's substitute the word Bernie Sanders or the Democratic resistance or Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer for it and have those people say the same things about the Bernie Sanders supporter who shows up at the Republican\nCongressional baseball practice with weapons and bullets\nAnd list in his pocket and kill and almost killed ... and if it were not for the accidental presence\nOf to a Capitol Hill police who who accompanied Scully says a member of the leadership we could have seen a dozen or more Republican legislators are assassinated and and and could any one of those people did any one of those people said Bernie Sanders or Nancy Pelosi or the resistance or Tom star\nIn with their hateful language about the president and then you know it Clapper color was Clapper or somebody else\nRented gives them a tree in the Brennan wouldn't get anybody's step forward out of that group and say this is this is inciting people to violence and they're responsible for further Bernie Sanders supporters showing up and trying to kill Republican members of Congress plays for God's sake put our country first and stop this\nI agree I I was done by the president got his man to be better if you had to do that if someone like you actually write would do that exactly especially somebody that's not ... but somebody who's calling balls and strikes like you to be honest so Carl a couple of things I just want to go over some major regions it surprised me first off why is me love\nStruggling in a in Utah\nWell first of all this is the most democratic district in the state it includes the city of Salt Lake people think of Utah as a conservative state in it is but the city of Salt Lake\nI grew up part of my childhood in Utah or if you're a liberal you live in the city of Salt Lake or and so it's it is the most democratic district and second she's never been affected fundraiser so she's got a she's got a ... a former mayor\nA who's a capable of raising money then they got them\nShe struggled there yeah and she's and she's she struggled but it's it is the most democratic district in the year like this um and remember we'd have a weird thing going on in the Mormons the Mormons are conservative by nature but they also have a certain set of\nStandards are at the core of if you will that they expect of their elected officials that's why Donald Trump brand so poorly and in Nevada are actually in Utah\nAnd and a third party candidate got a significant slug votes from nominal Republicans who said I Can't support the president's personal behavior so I think she's okay at the end\nIn part because it's it's it's Mitt Romney time in in Utah but she is she's in a bigger reason people expect to\nGet it right now the last polls hazard down by six points stoning we'll see where that goes by the way that has a lot to do with why flaking Ann Romney for the most part can't stomach him a and even though Romney says he'll suck it up and go along when he can\nWe now have new Marsha Blackburn seems to have solidified lead over ... over\nI I don't think so uh Bredesen is running a very smart campaign they're attacking Marcia unfairly here at the end\nBut um you know she's she's she's made some you know she is irritated some of her fellow Republicans over the years in the state I don't think it's over I think she wins I'm involved with a superPAC that spending a vast sums of money to help get\nHer in Senate leadership fun watching the race closely we've got to continue their executed\nThey've got to continue to execute a there's the question is going to be our suburban Republicans in the Nashville area going to a going to turn out to vote and vote for bread arson or are they going to stay with their party and vote Republican and then our\nShe's got a a an awkward relationship over in the western part of the state with the Shelby County Republicans and are they going to turn out in the numbers that need to I think at the end of the day this state is the president's approval rating is pretty darn good at the state and I think at the end of the day they pick her but I don't think it's over\n... of the ... has her up fifty one forty six we'll see how that goes now\nFifty one forty six we'll see how that goes now the biggest mystery to me with what's going on in Arizona\nHow could Martha ... judging by what is the fighter pilot in the first female and the me too movement a Republican looking to replace Jeff Flake aggressively campaigning why is she wrestling again Christian sooner in the last poll she's trailing by two or three points\nAnd yet she has come on strong and send them has been exposed to somebody pretending to be a moderate who isn't who's like story is not holding up\nWell sentiment has worked the last five or six years to convince the Phoenix business community that she is a business moderate and uh she's joined the blue Dog Democrats she said the right things she hasn't voted right that much\nBut she said the right things and she has cultivated that crowd and she comes from Phoenix which is where most of the voters are [noise] and uh and mix Sally us from Tucson which is the second largest media markets\nBut but pretty pretty small I Will say this again looking at the early vote as of last night four hundred and sixty four thousand\nFour hundred and Ninety One Republicans had voted early versus three hundred and fifty six thousand Democrats at two hundred and fifty two thousand independent other party voters that's actually as a Sunday night this represents a increase the geo care of the turnout\nVersus twenty six days and a three point five seven points\nAnd a democratic decline of almost two points so it's a five and a half points wing towards Republicans is state that they won twenty six team about three and a half so that's good news for Mick Sally and do see as long as that includes ... Republicans who are coming out to vote for mix Sally and not to just cast a protest\nLast we really have a few minutes about a minute but I Want you to your Hillary Clinton cut twenty five\nAnd that is that child quite know how I felt I adore anything about him thank God for that I have a lot of their colder air ... yeah I Know they all look alike now they\nWe're there to talk of Guam Sunni eleven thirty AM cage you in a press your belly and on Ninety nine point nine F.

relations tell us why\nSo we are now just a handful days for all of the sanctions to the previous administration had relieved against Iran snapping back coming back into effect it's having a real impact on\nA rainy and leadership that is the secretary of state Mike Pompeo was kind enough to join us at the top of the first hour talking about Iranian sanctions how he's trying to get the world to go along with it how private businesses already leaving that country they're trying to hurt that country economically to force them to the table to become\nA normal member of the family of nations that are trying to pressure them\nOr the problem is there's a lot of people around the world who are mad that the U.S pushed them to sign onto the field and now we're backing out of it but that was John Kerry deal not Donald Trump steal the\nNumber that you\nHave a birthright citizenship if you're subject to the jurisdiction you're either a citizen or a legal resident but not if you are undocumented or a diplomat or a tourist\nCan we have an honest debate about anything instead of labeling somebody a racist or sexist\nBirthright citizenship looking back at the constitution the fourteenth amendment\nEnding it is it possible through an executive orders if possible through legislation\nOf course you could put an amendment on anything if he got the two thirds vote but it never happens but the president brought up a good point today worthy of debate why is everyone saying these anti immigrant our entire static or anti anything\nIt's called the debate that a lot of us are having and a lot of countries have already sided with the president on the number one\nElection house today like what happened today that changed that now and hanging on way do you want to say that\nSubject to the jurisdiction there of either leave it out or they say something to the jurisdiction just means you have to obey the Law Order ... if you're a tourist coming from England or Canada or anywhere you have to obey and US law while you're in the United states and make your children a citizen or a U.S citizen\nSo there's an argument why can't we have a good faith argument Martha ... just walked in more than about to go to a break but I just want you to weigh in are you amazed that we can't have an argument an excuse me a a debate on something that's really a gray area in the constitution you have to live with someone racist or is in a phobic\nYeah I mean I don't know how we move forward at the country if you can't have substantive discussions about evaluating things like\nThe constitution the whole purpose of the Supreme Court at U. of I. weight questioned the constitutionality based on current events and based on what's going on in the world and you have a conscience debate over how closely to adhere to the letter of the law and the constitution or whether or not it should be adapted\nFor circumstances but I was fascinated last night when you look back at the history of the fourteenth amendment how much did speeding discussion there has been over the claws are in you know with regard to the jurisdiction thereof and I found it really interesting history lesson for myself and I think it's something that is worth discussing and it keeps you can't demonize each other just out of the conversation\nMartha ... back in a moment she's on the story at

discussion I actually uh you can go out and anyway Charles is always right but you can go out anyway you can go birthright citizenship and expand it from there or you could say we're not gonna have to deal with that because we have control of a of the gate\nEmails and both are issues that fall under the very tricky immigration discussion that we're always having the country but the problem is what you touched on before the break is that you can't even have that it's because of that with President Trump that brought it up\nIt's toxic right it's like you can't discuss that everyone is horrified all across channels that are all over America instant Har right that this is some kind of um you know just like me into grading take on how this issue should be handled\nMe while I mean I I'm pretty sure I haven't seen pizzas on other networks about these places in San Francisco where there have like you know places where people can calm and have babies just to have them in America\nI remember this whole story that was done about the sort of nice kind of apartment\nPlaces that people come and have babies\nMostly from Asia with that story that was dealing with that\nSo that they can be American citizens we all know that you know the anchor baby which has a controversial term\nI'm meeting a child who you know whose mother came across the border specifically for the purpose to be born or we all understand the inclination that desire to have a child is born in America and have them be an American I think everybody understands that but the problem with all of the immigration issue is that we've lost the process that's involved yeah and\nThe thing is I feel for people who want to cross the border and have their baby born in the United states I understand that motivation\nThe problem is that these people have become pond\nAnd they're very vulnerable and they're being used in that situation by Republicans and Democrats who refused to come together\nIn order to know the process and pass legislation to seed and help these people in the process and nobody wants to come from I ... I forget what it was showing the caravan and I feel that as a country we have let them down and we've let\nAmerican citizens down because we have no orderly process for doing for taking care of these before we could open up the refugees a we have room\nHas a isolated cutter\nHe temporarily kidnapped the prime minister of Lebanon we know that he's had passively using our weapons and bombing in ... Yemen I'm not a who the rebel fan nobody who's oh I could understand there on the doorstep but they have not been careful about how they're doing it\nAnd then when the locks up all are all these other Saturday family members into the ah rich Carlton he seems to be a guy that is a little bottles who say the least so I asked uh the secretary of that you just told me you're not going to break but are you going to reevaluate that relationship because of his recent actions\nWere and we got to see where the facts ultimately lead us\nAh we we we truly have a responsibility to America to the American people to ensure that we have a good relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nOr to the general Hayden pointed to people of Saudi Arabia um are an important partner for the United states\nAnd World War working to make sure we have the right the facts right I've spoken to the king a couple of times I spoke with MBBS I've spoken with the foreign minister my direct counterpart to bear on numerous occasions I think the Saudis share our view they understand that they've got to get the facts out in the time was not on their side and doing so\nSo the factual ridiculous else comes out they strangled him but the minute he walked in the question is what did he have the most thought about what did he have did Saudi Arabia besides being a critic did he have something specific that the Saudis will take it\nDid he have something specific that the Saudis so that they can take this type or risk and risk a relationship to kill him and ham handed way and Britain didn't file and destroy his body maybe burn it was an said\nWell you know I mean to me that question is\nIs it because they're on the radar for being you know for this young leader of being a reformist that this kind of behavior really stands out and is this you know Middle East justice that has been carried out many times before without any other country really bad and I left\nI I think it is very interesting it feels like there ... there was a very deep personal dig against ah the crown prince that may have led to his really divisive action against this individual if indeed he was aware of it\nUm there's this is an amazingly fascinating character or on the Saturday seeing here who has gone down her so much attention\nFor being so forward thinking when it comes to allowing women to drive and women to the theater but then when women rise up they're cracking down on them as hard as ever so it is um I think this is this is someone who in some ways um pull the wool over a lot of people died in terms of of what kind of leader he will be um\nAnd I think that we need to be very very careful we cannot you know if if you want to be a a reform around the world stage and then you have to give up you know the the kind of brutal activity that it's not indicative of the kind of leadership that we we can really obviously be on the side of\nIt can be forget how bad relations was in Saudi Arabia and the administration with a prisoner Obama\nTo basically you couldn't have been worse and allowing a Mubarak to get out did when he sewage deck and if you're going to allow that to happen you know what I'm going to watch your back and that was a bad message said with the Arab Spring the Arab Spring was a disaster this president said\nA U.S in a I'm not owned by the U.S hopes for the best um whoever you want to lead lead we're not fighting your wars and that this person is pretty good of consistent on that but open to stick it around in Syria we're leaving would be disaster\nWeaving right now in Afghanistan would be a disaster so he's instincts were to get out but the reality is he can be convinced that you've seen that Martha\nYeah I mean I think that when you look at that situation it's clear to everyone that not having a good relationship with Saudi Arabia is not an option and obviously the crown prince or if he was aware of what happened to democracy so he knows that but you know I think that that when you listen between the lines of what secretary of say palm pilot saying\nI'm you know that's the relationship is evolving and it needs to be clear that we cannot abide that's kind of horrific murder and that that needs you know that kind of relationship needs change but as you point out\nThe dynamic that we had under the prior president was a you know a very Iran leading dynamic and we have had to recalibrate back to\nThe alliances that we had in the middle east over over century over hunting decades\nAnd um I think the relationship between Saudi Arabian Israel is is also one that really cannot be jeopardy\nAre those who are going to do it more to know because Martha needs to lighten up you're going to be all serious\nWe're trying to keep our nose to the NATO for more down and do more to know and I'm and we're going to find out if Hillary\nClinton show did you play all kinds of shows 'cause tonight oh yeah you do yeah I I cannot believe she's getting away with
