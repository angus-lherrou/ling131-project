documents out tonight or they are released them on their public information five of all and they reveal have resigned that there was an investigation of comments allegedly made by the deputy director Andrew McCabe about President Trump and when we don't know anything more than that\nBut that's unbelievable Andrew McCabe is leaking things about president elect Trump's newly formed cabinet as he's putting together Michael Flynn about what he may or may not have said about meeting with Kislyak of Russia wasn't going to be sentence in December but this thing has been ring\nWe will talk about

a\nKatherine Harris who's with us began to Capitol Hill a lot of people focused on the taboo Saudi Arabia and of course amid terms that one's leaving some judges were confirmed just so they can get out of there but Katherine going Simpson arrived I understand on Capitol Hill\nGlenn Simpson president the head of fusion GPS is there any doubt in your mind he's going to show up and take the fifth\nWell he already indicated through with attorneys that he was going to take that to questions about the dark PA ... he got it to the FBI and uh the spring and fall at twenty sixteen\nAnd then after the election using a Justice Department official and what role it played in securing the surveillance warrants for Trump campaign aide Carter Page and then had hoped to avoid today's testimony on the basis that he would take that\nBut the committee insisted on having him appear under subpoena and he's now going through that very laborious process that going question by question and then taking other steps so they have\nAn under oath paper trail of symptoms are fusing to answer these questions\nTo where is the contradiction from its original testimony who's ramping up\nOkay go burn or at the Justice Department official and he was used by ten cent and former British spy Christopher Steele at the back channel to get the ... the eight to the FBI\nAfter the election November twenty sixteen and you can see and Bruce or the emails and know that there was contacted since then\nAs early as August twenty six people\nBy Glenn since then told another house panel that he didn't get involved with or until well after the election so that's\nA big disconnect but Glenn Simpsons problems are much deeper than just a disconnect with Bruce or what we've been able to see in our reporting\nIs that more than a half dozen sources connected to fusion GPS out or the law firm that was working on behalf of the DNC and Clinton campaign and others\nHalf of the DNC and Clinton campaign and others for shopping the dog to the FBI almost creating what critics call an echo chamber so every time it came to the FBI to another source it would lend more credibility credibility pardon me to what was opposition research quite a\nWhile and of course a James ... basically said didn't really think the dogs you played much of a roll\nCall it that that that may be his position but at least when you look at the surveillance applications that have been declassified you can see that the dossier was one of the top line item\nIn the application and that it was not the only item but it was certainly a significant item that was used to secure the original surveillance warrants in October of twenty sixteen and on the way into the session today\nI shouted a series of questions to Glenn Simpson including\nWhy was he taking the fifth but also more specifically whether any parts of the da da ... been verified and he did not answer that question nor the final question which was as someone who has worked in a ... as a journalist in the past how was refusing our question today really consistent with his own experience\nNo but it doesn't budge on this but I guess he's hoping the Democrats get the house who ... stops right\n[noise] well this is I'm certainly the view of Republicans they say is very uh locally that they think\nThe goal has been to run out the car\nWith the hope that the Democrats take control and that's the end of the um investigation or the other issue that's really up against the clock is whether the same medieval issue with the Pina for the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein to secure his testimony over these allegations he discussed\nRecording the president or removing him from office\nIn twenty Seventeen that's being Rosenstein denies but even even more importantly\nWhat he knew about uh the dot CA and other intelligence when he signed off on one of the surveillance weren't renewal a in October twenty Seventeen so it's not just um what he said about the president but it's also his role or in the surveillance of a Trump campaign member\nBy a couple of things now I understand that any material is being looked at all because he might have or you might have leaked information out about Michael Flynn's not telling us not telling the truth about whether we talk to kids we are are not where's this story going [noise]\nWill new records or had been released and what's been happening in the background that there's been an inspector general's investigation that's been ongoing at the Justice Department we had\nThe review about the Clinton email earlier this year\nBut the inspector General Michael Horowitz told reporters at that time that he was also looking at political biased in text messages he was also looking at whether there were a regularity and securing the surveillance warrants\nDuring the presidential campaign and then also specifically a leaking of classified information and based on the record that were made public even then you could see that there were multiple strands to the link investigation going to a very senior people within the FBI so McCabe really has a lot of\nLegal jeopardy right now it appears with the leak investigation\nBut he's also a in front of the grand jury here in Washington DC\nOr lying to federal investigators about a week of Wall Street journal that dealt with uh the Clinton Foundation\nBut yet he's still releasing a book so I don't know if that's going to help his goals are not\nGo that route that's been that's been a delayed review by by the FBI on but what I Would say not as offensive McKay but a contacts on one of the takeaways I Am from\nThe last six months I was looking at this issue is that not the only one who may have been using leaks for Strategic reasons I mean director Comey testify publicly you specifically leaked memos\nTo the Columbia University professor to kick start a special counsel on the Russia probe and what we know from our reporting is that it leads to wind up those memos contain classified information so the question is whether director calling me will be found guilty of mishandling classified information\nAnd by the way we should struck in low Lisa Page and Peter truck also going back and forth about how they put stories into the pros and celebrating it\n[noise] ... it's going I think it does I think Brian is going to be one of the big reveal a when the inspector general is finished which is the extent to which\nUm and I emphasize a senior leadership within the FBI and not not the rank and file by executives within the FBI during the political campaigns used makes to try and former crap the gotcha sessions\nJudge an average year the best how you keep it straight I can never know back in the moment\nAll the facts that lost that great advice that brought it up and just about ... to kill me working against that I can tell you a lot of smart so you'll do great that are like [noise]\nI got one eight six six eight seven six six and we're talking about three things really oh we're talking about what Katherine Harris just leapt off where Glenn Simpson is now behind\nJust leapt off where Glenn Simpson is now behind closed doors taking the theft on every question answered by this but by the Republican committee\nKeep in mind this investigation stops if they lose the house and if you're smart you do these two things\nWe talked to John McLaughlin was opposed over Donald Trump and by far the best thing Republicans could run on his something they're not and that is what will happen when Nancy Pelosi is your speaker her approval rating for the country thirty percent\nIt was less than that when she was actually speaker runs through what she did last time how we'd affective she was and polarizing she remains\nAnd then you say what is not going to get done if she's there one of which is to find out what the FBI was doing it is higher levels to stop the president being from winning election and then once he got the election\nAnd now we find out what McCabe gone call me gone a Baker gun struck gun page gun who's left Bruce or suspended or excuse me demoted\nYou're getting closer and closer to the answer\nAnd what I Will be running ads on what's been revealed already and what stops in its tracks and who's going to stop\nSome rogue agents next time and the FBI if they have a political agenda and they want to stop you or Kennedy and I'm telling you I Would be just his teed off it but I found out that after Hillary Clinton won the election they're working behind the scenes to set her up for some type of scandal\nThat's what they were doing President Trump there's a cooling with Russian next thing we got a special pro we're starting to understand how the heck we ended up with Robert Mueller we still do not know\nSo that all stops quarter page is one that they fired got ... or I kept getting a renewed and they were following him because he thought he was a Russian agent even though he had worked with the FBI because the ... spoke in Russia and he had some contacts there\nBut Carter Page is suing keep him on they had a ... or quarter page keep in mind they kept bringing it and they have no charges\nIn a probe that puts an ankle bracelet on Rick Gates put a put a Paul Manafort in jail a ruins the career of Michael Flynn up put fat but apple it's in jail for a day but destroyed aside for the last year and a half inches off the top of my head\nAnd die told these Russians were never going to show up until their indictment Carter Page was followed surveilled by the highest ranking people and I got up to thirty five\nYou know it goes beyond any damage as or any you know financial aspects I mean there are it's just been so many lives as you're alluding to and\nYou look at the damage to our democratic systems and you know our institutions of government uh back in twenty sixteen I'm just trying to get some justice in terms of getting closer if you look at some of the prior dodging dot CA cases like Mr who bar as\nHe's the one that actually got some of the biggest uh information out there that you know Senate Judiciary that committee and house intelligence committee Evan Bayh thing a lot a lot of things on international era is over ...\n[noise] still keep in mind to ah George Papadopoulos on Twitter find out this whole thing started when Papadopoulos decides he can come out and blast\nSo blessed prime minister Cameron for blasting Donald Trump so Papadopoulos says is on the foreign policy committee for the Trump and he's twenty eight years old and he decides because you've got some power he's going to blast back a camera and on behalf of Donald Trump they don't like that Britain started looking into it\nAnd it seems as though perhaps you could put these two and two together they set him up\nAnd they give them some information from professor ... who is meeting with that professor ... we thought it was a multiple passers teaching at a London University now defunct and then at that time because you know this whole recount an email thing is getting big the Russians got a whole bunch emails already to drop it\nNow Papadopoulos gets this information and the ... down or of Australia because to me they started talking about a few drinks\nAnd he says what are you know about the Clinton email because I hear that's going to be big things coming out of Russia now down or keep that information says he told them Papadopoulos now who told Papadopoulos ... now miss it why would he carries a multiple Petra teaching in London both turns out not really\nTurns out mixed it is not a Russian agent doesn't that Russian contacts he works for Britain so if you give ... information and then sent somebody up to ask him for that information it looked as though he's leading intelligence with Russia\nRight combining to find out that Russia's got Hillary's emails and they're about to drop\nDown to earth but given millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation myths it works for Britain who is vehemently against Donald Trump we know the government is which is now the pose and treat somebody probably hates him just as much but that's a side park so they asked was do you ever give up information about Russia to uh to another agent\nNow they got you know why\nBecause bats are down and says you did in retrospect it so yeah I made a mistake you got one day in jail now he's realizing how he was set up he's going to be coming in and I hope to drag 'em up the radio on the twenty six after he testifies and he's going to expose what's been exposed to him so far but if you look at all these things that took place in all the people that are around\nYou wonder why the mullah ... was even among other pro and now it's gotten totally out of control and how the Australian so work with the Brits to set up Americans who actually work for Donald Trump why the president got word from Britain not to unveil the way that the the information\nThat led to the investigation they said it would jeopardize your relationship with our good allies Australian Britain\n... how are they showing the loyalty the will to us time with the listening on up and new talk Ninety seven one eight Tom\nCarrying this thing to do is go out for a dog here about ... the on the bed works or cry all my money spent on this I'm like ...

Facebook ads but the whole premise of Donald Trump being illegitimate because of Russia I Hope we understand that that is not legitimate\nMy sense is she getting to the president you know what the British he never going to like the president is fine but but those who are waiting for him to be productive and change of tone you seeing it\nHe's not perfect he's Donald Trump but without the Russia probe hanging over his head new GMC being questioned every day by a by dozens of members of the press maybe a hundred\nHe's able to function campaign and do what's best he can to defy the odds and keep the party in power in power for the next two years of his presidency\nIs pretty impressive because they're both in play considering all the things that they said that Donald Trump is done that would destroy his presidency and his party it's pretty amazing that they basically locked up the house ... and picked up some seats choose me Senate and they got a shot at the house\nI'll come back and take your calls at one eight six six eight seven six six now and you're listening to the brain kill me show\nComing to you need to know basis because Mandy you need to know your way of Brian kill me either\n\nHi I'm Jeff Lunden when I needed to find senior care for my mom I really struggled to find the right fit until I found an advisor in someone who had been through that the more\nI recommend played for him on the nation's largest senior living referrals during the Manhattan for it and then we'll help you at the right question and find the right in my column place Vermont today\nTo speak with a local senior living advisor column leads belong at the number two to five nine three zero six feet under two to five nine three zero six\nAnd my mom has helped over two hundred thousand families find the right in your care and their parents and listening to independent living even ... care and have the ... that can help blame your option at no cost to you\nTo speak with a local senior living advisor call a place for mom at the number two to five nine three zero saying that the number two to five nine three zero six call today\nIndividuals and businesses with tax problems listen carefully do you feel like you're losing control over your finances if you over ten thousand dollars in taxes arrive on file tax returns we can help you take back control\nOf the IRS is the largest and most aggressive collection agency in the world and they can seize your bank account garnish your paycheck close your business and file criminal charges take control of your tax problems no by calling the experts at tax mediation services and take advantage of a fresh start program and new laws that may allow us to\nNegotiate a settlement for the lowest amount possible\nOur team of tax attorneys on the road agents can stop collections and get you protected so you can take control of your financial future direction mediation services is accredited by the better Business Bureau call now for a free case review and a price protection guaranteed quote called\nTax mediation services now at eight hundred three one six four nine three five that's eight hundred three one six four nine three five eight hundred three one six four nine three five\nPolitical cronies paid for by a door for state representative\nWe're there to talk of the quad cities eleven thirty AM cake you in a ... and on Ninety nine point nine F.

miracle really\nRochelle bowl along the way they stop at Mount Vernon you say the first time in six years his Washington and he goes into I Know when he was going to burn recently and they showed me the table that he reportedly opened up the map on and they are kind of devised a plan do you does your research is say that oh yeah no\nIt's it's amazing what an emotional moment for Washington you know he hasn't been home and six years\nFor grandchildren have that he's never seen have been born in that in that time\nAnd he he walks in the ... um Mount Vernon I'm Rochelle bowl with him and they know that there's a huge fleet of friendships in there and they you know pull out the maps and start planning it he's only there for a few days but it's the beginning of the great victory that when this\nSide no we're just talking about this I was just reading some excerpts from your book\nAnd one of which is Washington's got some problems not only is he trying to win a war that seems impossible when he writes home he keeps finding some some disturbing news one of which was to British come down to the Potomac and they start burning every plantation they can but they don't burn Washington's why why well his his cuts in London\nOr in Washington so why why well his his cuts in London who was a caretaker of Mount Vernon goes out to the British ship the appropriately named Savage and says uh here would you like some provisions a suggestion [noise]\nYou know if if I give you the don't burn a the plates and and if they don't in Washington here's this he is infuriated you know how how could this happen to the leader of the American army said I'd much rather lose all of Mount Vernon a than here this news\nAnd so do the enemy he basically offered a bribe and here he is trying to destroy the enemy and his a caretaker of his nephew yeah nephew things he did a good thing\nYeah yeah no it was yeah ... you know thanks to that we have Mount Vernon today but it put Washington a difficult position and you know this is one of the things I I kept realizing in this book you'd like Washington to have that high five moment you know I've done that we've won one this thing but\nAt every turn he's run into issues that make it very difficult uh at the great victory Yorktown\nA step son Jackie customs died of cabin of of camp fever and you know so instead of\nYou as the rest of America celebrates he's in the morning and uh you know those kinds of things it was really tough on washing tried to he what he does surrender ... how does it get cold while as his surrender\nWell are they surround a siege and so ... what they do a series of line in which they they move the artillery closer and closer\nTo the British position in Yorktown until finally um they're just pounding the British to pieces at night lord Cornwall is tries to escape by the rowing across the river but a huge storm comes up that doesn't work\nAnd eventually they have no Cornwall ... I've got to surrender and so he surrenders and Washington is very insistent that the terms of this treaty be in our favor because when at the battle Saratoga under her ratio gates it was just the opposite\nA Washington was a very tough negotiator are finally it's it's the the the ceremony to surrender but Cornwall is doesn't show up ah he he pleads illness and and uh the the voice of the public humiliation [laughter] having to turn a sword over to Washington\nPhilbrick are ah he's our guest right now so if you have the headquarters in New York and that to a general Clinton had its Cornwall surrender anything but the south in the south like how does the transfer\nRight well it's interesting you know you think Yorktown the war's over actually\nIt would be two years before the British finally evacuated from New York this was one part of the army a very significant part seven thousand soldiers there about ten thousand up in New York and so this meant they were still significant army in America and Washington worried even though we won this thing the British are going to come back\nAnd there was a naval victory they won in the Caribbean all this stuff but finally the British Parliament realizes that people no longer want war\nNo matter what we just have to get out of it to us in a lot of money to cost them a huge amount of money and uh you know the ... the French just as much and you could argue and many have that the French Revolution in less than a decade was a result of the fact that the French were bankrupted by their supporters of America and the revolution\nAnd about five thousand in New York you said in particular uh the the French no no the uh the British the\nBritish had a over ten thousand pretend to have so that Washington wanted to attack New York before he wanted to check back the Chesapeake but the French felt it was much easier to say on to the Chesapeake the newer right and they were right hey you know and they shifted getting Washington shifted gears I mean this is the thing about Washington he would\nWhen you realized you know they're not going to do it my way okay shift gears what can we do to make this happen\nAnd he and he did it in a very decides is a brilliant way because he made his preference for New York make the British in New York think that that's where he was going to attack until the very last second when they realized whoa a Washington Rochelle bows army or on their way to Philadelphia and ultimately Cornwall it's in the chest\nAnd they ended up just two years later just leaving on their own reconnaissance\nRight it was the evacuation of New York or in in November of Seventeen eighty three and a you know a huge huge symbolic act if nothing else than Washington rides in um as a a you know a writes in it's it's it's now um\nYou know we have one and it's it's one of the major moments in American history\nYeah we went down to ... where she had his final drink or the report is a with his soldiers here he was overcome with emotion\nI couldn't really speak but he says come up and touch me and basically it would take to make shake my head aches my yeah and they did and they watched as he walked out to a barge there was waiting and took him down stream\nAnd then you look out and you go to ... to do was make a turn you could see with a barge would be Oh absolutely I mean it's not as if it's been covered up by building you can see the path to Washington talk\nSnow it's amazing when you go down to that Wall Street section of New York you know the it's a village or ... when you look at the historical buildings and it was all very intimate\nAnd when Washington left and he was on his way to Annapolis where the continental Congress was to surrender his commission from ... you guys can have a lot of the country going to be alone you know in King George when he heard that this was Washington plan to retire to Mount Vernon\nHe said if he does that he will be the greatest man in the world because you know ... it was inconceivable to surrender power I mean you know so many dictators had had refused to do that in the past and the polling in the future but that's what Washington did\nAnd he made it possible for republic to spring up from this great victory right but at first it will be no president no there was no president if there was a dysfunctional Congress or without an executive\nAnd it would take you know almost five years before the continental Congress would uh with the the constitutional convention would begin to create a system that we have\nToday I done if any can you stick around in shorts OK yeah we're going to have a few more questions because\nThe other thing that's happening now since the last time we left more than ever use
