expertise of FBI agents we were only given five minutes to questions judge Kavanaugh\nFive minutes every single person Eighteen people and then of course you had the prosecutor from Arizona so Dianne Feinstein isn't the ultimate delay a game I Know the people on the Web to might be saying that she did a good job because she delay the process and it was really a later time bomb and everybody's played an id\nBut to me I think overall most people don't respect what you saying don't respect glad she blew up the process\nAnd certainly don't by the fact that she wanted she agreed to limited and

complains Dianne Feinstein they didn't get all the documents but it has to do with your the president you work for the things that are still top secret in confidential right\nRight and look that's also an exaggeration of what his role worker staff carry it was not your job to be a policy advisor it was to look at the documents going to the president and make sure that they made the strongest carpal argument on behalf of everybody that doctor who's advocating different options\nAnd that they were accurate and complete an air and you know it it it it may be a democratic ministry trip that the staff secretary puts their finger on the scale and as a policy advisor or they're not they have a more important job which is the impartial up our\nAnd make sure that the document that's going to the president is the best document it could be regardless of what the argument is that it's making\nYour friend towns in a person you do reach back to is also unhappy ... secretary and advisor to President Bush who's also unhappy that the FBI did not interview a cabinet or Ford cut twenty eight\nA cabinet or Ford ...\nI personally don't believe at a profit care that ain't going to have a credible ankle played in that fashion without an interview a doctor for it now I think what they're going to hear from the FBI is that they weren't going to train a headache and talk to Scott than that fashion\nAiming to take that on face value that they were called ... allegations of sexual assault that still doesn't explain why don't area Dr Ford thing they already have her testimony and they

we think is a ... a FBI or interview with no power that they're going to be any more for the company for some reason or another doctor Ford's lawyer's Deborah cat\nAh the lead lawyer refuses to turn over those documents that have weeks so look at it but I I I agree with Fran it'd be nice to have them but they're the windows FBI agents walking do an interview nodded dot there not that they don't

Jeff Flake voted said look yeah he's an extraordinarily April person\nAnd I and I but I Want to I Want to have the FBI have a chance at this look at the Harris or the Harvard Harris Poll was very revealing for me which is why I put it in my column was forty in the wall Street Journal at the end of the hearing last week\nThirty seven percent of the people said confirming forty four percent said do\nEighteen percent were undecided which a big number for issue like this but then when they said\nIf there's an FBI investigation which at the time to poll was feel that there was no FBI follow up ... investigation but if the FBI conducts an investigation and there is no cooperation should he be confirmed as a number of flips it's sixty percent for forty percent do\nIt all day so I Will pick up

agree\nThat's probably while you're up in the polls you're up by bill Brett to known as a moderate I just haven't known any moderate whether it's a Coons or imagine that ever voted against their party\nAnd the tendency is to ask themselves or be comfortable with the senator there would vote against Kavanaugh because that's really what it comes down to\nYou going to make that case\n[noise] well we had been making that case because I've said all along I with the I guess like protecting our\nAnd my opponent issue yet to say how he would vote on death than I have to tell you do you know

Saddam of National Review melting pot or civil war a brief cogent book rate review in City Journal\nAnd that's a very that's a great title melting pot or civil war that's exactly exactly right\nSo his parents greyhound's parents\nCame from ... dash and we're talking about this a very important to you taught me something it's a very important distinction not all immigrants contrary to what I had implied not all immigrants\nFrom the end of the nineteenth century went to their own\nEnclosed communities in the United states\nSo what changed in the Nineteen twenties\nFor what changed in the Nineteen twenties is that when you put in place immigration restriction legislation it really changed the landscape critter immigrants were already in the country the less competition from newcomers\nAnd so it was somewhat easier for them to climb the economic ladder that's not to say that that restriction was motivated by purists motives in every case\nBut the upshot is that do have some breathing room particularly to those working class immigrants so they could enter the American middle class\nI'm all for their kids wind up living in the suburbs\nThey wound up forming these more integrated communities and embracing an American identity they might feel a you know clean to some aspects of their older ethnic identity it but it was more symbolic rather than a live the experience that separated them from other Americans\nAnd I think that that's the important part of the story of why you wound up having more unified more cohesive\nAmerican middle class culture and those years\nThen specifically that they're more limitations on immigration in other words\nThat I Want to know if I'm summarizing your point accurately fact is much more likely to ensure a melting pot than separation if there are restrictions on immigration is that correct summary\nYes I Do believe that having control having some limits\nAs opposed to having an uncontrolled policy can make a big difference it makes that melting pot more likely to happen in the United saying we should go back to the policies of the Nineteen twenties but it does mean we need to be mindful of the context\nIn which immigrants arriving to us All right to look into are rising in a in a context of racial division in which your identity politics and identity politics extremism it's going to be a very different\nAll the way that so I was just going to say that's the second part of your title you made the case on the melting pot but your title is melting pot or civil war question mark so the civil war comes when everybody has their own identities\nExactly when you have the situation in which you have people who are fighting over not Jeff class differences but also over ethnic differences the danger is that you might get some kind of group that sees itself as a marginalized excluded underclass\nAnd that the ethnic and mentioned it out and get demagogue politicians who are claiming that hey wait a second the reason you're in this position is because of the other people with their wealth\nAnd with their power that's why you need to pare down the system that's what I fear is going to happen in the years to come you're going to get this kind of a dog or a pit bulls identity politics will become even more extreme he'll get even more\nSocialist politicians will and grace this kind of identity extremely\nSo I the reason I asked you earlier about what language was in your home was I I Do not at all oppose in fact I'm for immigrants teaching their children", "show_name": "Brian Kilmeade & Friends", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "04"}
