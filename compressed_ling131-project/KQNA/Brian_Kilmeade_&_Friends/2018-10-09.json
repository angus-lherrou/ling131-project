Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman think the world that we're sort of John McCain she did a lot of that work and go into battle field to be in the two years after Lieberman left so that might make sense\nI don't know if she'd be willing to do it but clearly she wants to run for the Senate again didn't work why wouldn't she accepted position like this again\nYeah to ... and the important even Nikki Haley had ah some early as soon as President Trump\nAnd even then that's where all of the ambassador to the U.S and she was never afraid to speak your mind or the push back against the White House 'cause she thought maybe there was a difference a ... so so all of this in mind\nA and considering how how parents are we are in a certain relationships particularly with the with China but also North Korea or Iran and they're even our allies on certain things\nAnd this is really going to be critical isn't an Brian\nI think so either the secretary of state overwhelms the position or works with a position now she was their first upon pale and they did they respect each other but that's why you got to pick the right person to go in there to see that he or she has to have the respect of Bolden and the secretary defense as well as the secretary of state\nAnd therefore if they do have that the seat doesn't shrink she didn't shrink with um Bassett her Haley a crew but there are a lot of ... nations I have to think twice and we do this every day who are they\nI mean Susan Rice was there she was invisible Samantha Power was asking people more than she was actually pick me up for America internationally if you asked me\nAnd then you have Nikki Haley came in there and every ... statement she made every policy she trumpeted seemed to make headlines because this president is a disruptor he's a ... balance or and it's not going to be having this position unless you believe what he believes what about governor Mike Huckabee in that spot\nIf you talk about uh the synthesis of thought that would make sense\nYou know what I mean you get a lot of great things out there\nAre really helping your show shows when they were probably more to it in a president's press conference on right now we're we're finished this with you\nThis segment on our foreign somebody brought out of time and you were fantastic Brian thank you very much either I think right stuff you see Mali nice to Charles [laughter] I said I if I ever meter [laughter] more lives are coming out or they think you have anything\nAll right when they take to explore all eight seven six six and I've got some calls to make we just have to go on at the end and do some wild speculation I I Know Charles was reading something I didn't want to look down on camera Alison could you read to me with the early ... doubts are are you getting the full report\nNot going to pour it part of what I see here is Trump said something along the lines that she told me not to do that maybe at the end of the year she wanted to take a break she was governor perhaps even more intense\nAnd they have to solve a problem with the gathering North Korea is moving along ... around with Nikki Haley I think they get the tape andme overall attack um but yeah that's what I'm saying so far\nWell when we come back I Want to be able to bring it to you so maybe if I take a break now we'll have a a long enough to do it also get aboard one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine it ends the best way possible Bowen Nikki Haley steps inside that's a big loss for the Trump Administration your thoughts next Brian kill me ...\nCurrent event news max you Brian's got a lot more to say with Brian till made [noise]\nHave you ever looked at your credit card statement of been shocked by the interest rate did you know you can actually roll all of your credit card debt into one monthly payment at a lower fixed interest rate ... credit card consolidation loan from five point eight nine percent a PR with auto pay lower than average credit card interest rate of over Eighteen percent a PR\nGet a loan from five thousand to a hundred thousand dollars and you can even get your funded soon as the day you apply for ice cream plant a tree by the way with every loan they fund\nI feel great recommending to my friends and my family because it's like a dream my listeners can also get a special discount on top of ice creams already low rates the only way to get to sit down and go to light stream dot com slash kill made\nThat L.

killing each other\nSo I'm used to have said to get your take on the brake cabinet struggle to get his confirmation through and to see how the president has managed by sitting back through most of it\nI really gain an advantage you remember when the number one story in America was about Paul Manafort cutting a deal and about Rick Gates testifying against him and now we're you know Papadopoulos gets sent in ... coming up in December and everything looks so grim\nAnd now that's a lifetime ago because now everybody's talking about cabinet\nAnd Brian you notice the ... the news cycle move so quickly so fast this president is accomplishing so many things people can't keep up the fight with Brett Kavanaugh lasted\nTwo to three weeks and what we're going to know in two to three weeks from now is that people say boy that seemed like forever ago but what does fight has done I mean this is unified the Republican Party from the establishment wing\nTo the to the outskirts and everywhere in between that their unify because now they see the playbook of the Democrats what the Democrats are talking about is not only if they take over the house will they impeach the president of the United states or attempt to they will trying to teach justice cabin on now\nAnd the states are temp to they will trying to teach justice Kavanaugh now this is what's on their agenda and the Republicans are waking up to election for weeks from today realizing exactly what is at stake I think\nThey were a bit complacent there were so happy with a three point seven percent unemployment rate and the economy doing so well in our national security homeland security all doing better than it's ever done and so they were complacent and now they see\nIt as a reminder of what these what the Democrats want to do which is not just impeach\nDonald Trump and remove him from office but now they're talking about potentially impeaching justice Kavanaugh for nothing and this is not motivated the Republicans and we've got four weeks ago early voting starts a very very soon and there are some key battleground states where this president is on the road reminding people the success tonight you'll be in Iowa\nOkay I Want you to hear how this whole thing played out will try to see and he used to run CNN a big town biographer of Steve Jobs Benjamin Franklin major projects this is how he sees this thing out of the president play the ...\n[noise] that's\nWhat President Trump does he turned psycho in the ... the reality shows\nAnd that's what he knows how to do [noise] uh the problem though for Joe and people like yourself is is successful\nIs somehow articulated what a lot of people feel which is boy I guess everybody gang up too much on this guy it was unfair and I think it was a time and sharing that Donald Trump\nAlmost with the help with the Democrats have been married uh made something that should have played very strongly and we've Democrats hands\nAnd it's something that is going to on balance help Republicans as fast running for the Senate because by paving it as a notion of mobs of people who tried to destroy those nice man uh somehow or another he changed the narrative\n[noise] and I think that some students houses and I'd probably paying bills or I shouldn't say that\n... the writer what this president did is he allowed the Democrats to overplay their hand you've seen the footage many times though on Fox News banging on the doors of the Supreme Court the sit ins hundreds of people\nAt a time being arrested at the Capitol the screaming during the confirmation process look Republicans don't do that whether you want it you know take it on the court or you want and whoever it was you didn't see that with the conservative they let the process play out the Democrats\nAttacked him and his ... his reputation went after his family this is a man who in his spare time unbeknownst to anybody else for the last dozen years goes down and feed the homeless services to poor he doesn't do that so he thought someday could get them onto the bank she did it because at the character that he is\nAnd no one wants to talk about that and everything that they threw at him\nHe returned fire and I mean that in a positive sense when he made a very impassioned statement his opening remarks on his second confirmation process at at that second hearing but what was the most stunning to me of everything that judge Kavanaugh said was that his ten year old daughter\nSaid dad we need to pray for this woman who said these things and we need to make sure that we're praying for her that that type of value that he has distilled on his children and that talked about the character of the man and I think the turning point in this confirmation process\nIs when Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said you know what I mean this is not right and he made such\nA moving argument between him and senator Collins and ultimately Mitch McConnell lose three individuals helped to change the public opinion of what Brett Kavanaugh did and the flight that Donald Trump put behind him 'cause I Believe Brian\nNot any other president if it wasn't Donald Trump would have stood behind that nominee in the way that he did and far from the way he did and Donald Trump has proven to be successful because of the\nHuge with the president said to judge Kavanaugh daughters cuts six\nMargaret and lies or your father was a great man he's a man of decency character kindness and courage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens and now from the bench of our nation's highest court\nYour father will defend the eternal rights and freedoms of all Americans\nThat you right back at the kid do must have heard some of the negativity the horrible allegations from Michael I've been out of you know others and I thought that was a great part of the speech\nHe'll Brian I I've seen it so my own life where I was attacked mercilessly during the campaign and my children are old enough to watch the news and go on the Internet and see what happens and I remember then candidate Trump and ultimately President Trump calling\nMy kids and you're saying your dad is doing great work and that goes so far you know and and saying nice things about me and it wasn't just me he's done it so many times to other people because he knows\nThat the media attacks individuals who are associated with Trump in a different manner then if they weren't and we've seen the double standard time and time again we seen it with media reporters who say one thing if they're liberals and get away with it and if they're conservative they are chastised till the end of the earth we saw just this week with a CNN reporter\nWho use some discussing language on Twitter and all of a sudden all of those people on the left to fend her use of that language and say well it was a a childish mistake but then the same one to chastise Brett Kavanaugh\nFor drinking beer when he was in high school thirty five years ago the double standard\nIs out of control and the American people are tired of it\nRight last week where do you think of a idiot and we're just chances in New Hampshire in the first is tricky new New Hampshire well a he's a navy veteran gradually the FBI National Academy in Quantico former chief of police of the town in South Hampton chances does he
