December and\nFebruary which which we do plant year round I mean we have our planting crews are putting plants in the ground every month of the year landscapers come in there planting\nThe first come in there planting twelve months out of the year\nAs long as the ground is that frozen were planted but you need a plant that has been acclimated or used to our climate if it's used to that freeze thaw cycle single planet right in your yard be perfectly fine\nAnd so you're seeing this buildup of inventory right now at your local garden center where whether it's Kingman to pine top to paint send to\nSedona camp Verde or Prescott we're all kind of building up our image tore and if you're going to front load a lot of it with your evergreen stuff\nBecause it looks so good even in winter and this is when people ... most people most ever Granger planted\nNow through march that that's when that's its peak window\nAnd so we're building that we're having more him in ... you've got more choices as a consumer when you have your local garden center and an ... shop for evergreens say it's a big spruce are you on a big a maple whatever it is you're you're you've got more choices now and they're larger sized\nSo we're trying to bring in uh for for us as of water skirts and in Prescott, Arizona this is just us um we are looking for big evergreens that are in containers that are easier to move around easy to bring into your house and decorate\nAnd then take out of your house and planting the landscape for living Christmas trees meant so that's a tradition many we sell more living trees than we do cut trees in the month of December because we've planned out we've we've got enough to get through and we showed them off and\nQuite honestly I'd rather have people planted treaty then cut one down and use it and throw it away I think that could be that might be considered wasteful and its way better than a plastic thing you got from China so it's just kinda I we've that's our niche in the marketplace and so we\nWe grow and we purchased and we ship in the month of October to accommodate that why do they even get on that track I lose track you see now see I Am anyway you're seeing this fall mixture of plants at your garden center\nThe crate models were not going to order another one of those until next summer a rows of Sharon is not going to be ordered again until\nNext summer you better grab if you want a summer blooming thing they're starting to show some color down so they go there get that typically either orange or yellow kind of Aspen gold color\nIf you want those if you want a blooming Russian sage view on a cell via Greg yeah autumn stage you better grab it now because it won't be at your local garden center here in ... with ... and other three or four or five weeks\nSo then the evergreens will come into their will come into their place so could Tony actors and then dean as that kinda stuff\nSo we've been busy I mean my back kind of hurt from unloading hold the truck but it's exciting to see the new materials coming in so it's kinda fun so and that's unique to a a little bit more temperate climate you folks from the Midwest\nThe east coast you're you're kind of go and he's talking he's talking some foreign language to me it's Latin I have no idea what he's even saying because we've never planted before in the winter\nWhile you're not you're in you're in a warmer climate because it's so nice here year round I mean in January\nA week after major blizzard it's all melted off and his feeling good and you're outside of that could take a hike within a entered into layers you know and a vast you're not ... ... ... you don't need any more [noise] ah for for if you're a garden center odor there are several of us we're all friends friends if there is a major blizzard\nIn Flagstaff gets buried alive we all have agreements we just call each other we're hoping the blizzard will ... mid week\nSo that we got we can can work the weekend to take the mid week off and we rented the flags that before anyone else and go hit the slopes new skis so [laughter] that's great [noise]\nOnly in Arizona can you do that and then then you'll head down and play around a golf in Scottsdale so it's just the Arizona is the most awesome state ever\nWelcome all you knew folks ah to to uh to God's Country it is a nicer here mainly because we were just the weather is so nice I mean it's not southern Californian ice but we don't have the pollution they got either so it's just better here\nSo this is the season when you're seeing a lot of that transition\nInto fall color you folks from Palm Springs in and southern Cal and Tucson and Phoenix is is that the desert you know\nA L passes wet west of of of Austin those areas you're just not used to four seasons you're used to Amano season tropical it's all the same time all the time here we actually have four very distinct seasons\nUntil the fall season is really for our fault color and this is when the the the flat landers is what we call him the desert dwellers come up with the mountains and they want to see all the spin ... oh it's so pretty\nWell you can grow one in your own yard you don't have to go anywhere you can just have one right there and it turns color here in the month of October just has that beautiful fall color has that trembling it's a a populist ... is the Latin name for it happens or trembling leaf\nPopular or troubling leave aspens that's our native Aspen that grows here would that beautiful white bark a that's the one birch you folks in the mid west you're used to more birch trees and Aspen\nTrees and there are a little bit heartier but they get that white bark they've got a little bit more pointed leaf to ... leave\nBut definitely white park a little bit more of a weeping pattern not truly weeping trees but ... it kind of grows out kind of wispy and then comes down\nThe the leaders don't Trimble but the branches do and what I find is an heavy clay soil the birds are actually blew tougher and he got to maintain both of 'em but they'll grow it almost any elevation\nIf you get 'em at let's say if you're going to grow those over in in cottonwood camp Verde I'm not sure about kingly your next time I flew through there I'm going to look for aspens over there I think they would probably grow if you put them on irrigation I had asked ...\n... when we we lived out there that's four thousand foot forty two hundred feet somewhere in there so that's I think ... are down about five hundred feet lower than that so yeah here I'll bet you could grow aspens out there\nIn the trunks of trees and then grubs in the ground\nAnd so it's really easy to kill and we've got a grub killers called grub killer I mean that's what's your sprinkle it on like a fertilizer water it in wiping them out an application will take you through\nYou know next spring so once they're done kind of thing so yeah they're very important I Would do not just those few moms you just planted I Would do that entire bed\nAnd I might even test they test all just to look for other areas because it's such a problem here they they attack plants by the hundreds and so yeah serious grub killer killed scrubs\nAnd they even go in your containers ... was it last year we were had this beautiful\nUm [noise] ... not ... and it was just starting to look and\nUgly and I'm like what is the problem is that thing and went to go kind of look at it and touched it and it fell out of the pot\n... Ruth yeah so it can happen anywhere pots raised beds trees shrubs and it's something to\nKeep them on their ... beetle larvae ah so the Beatles black read all the floor roam around they're laying eggs and things and so the exit hatched now and now they're actively grow and these are this year's grubs you're seeing\nAnd so they'll tripled in size before next spring do a so they'll they'll eat actively through mid December\nThen they'll go real deep underground gets cold to hibernate down there and then they'll come back up and eat your spring groups\nAnd then your plant blow over in the wind you wonder what happens or your who grow fades sorts looking terrible you pull up no roots left grass will get big brown spots and um those are all grub issues and need to be dealt with a serious

things are named five you'll reap huge rewards now welcome to the mountain Gardner\nSome things that I did personally in my own personal gardens at my house not hear the garden center at the house\nIs right before that storm hit last week or I fertilized everything in the landscape this is truly the the most important feeding of the entire year\nNow you can do it any time of the month of October I Would just simply taking advantage of the rain that was coming\nSo I get that food on the ground and then in the ground I mean it's actually the rain which would dissolve submitted wash it into the grounds the plants can start to pick that up it'll do two things if you do it earlier in October rather than waiting till\nThings are truly dormant maybe do it now you can actually change the ph of the soil if you're using the right food now\nI'll go into that in a bit ah how far I before I Want to go with this\nUh what what I Do is I put my own food it's it's got cotton seed meal and some sulfur and you're putting that on the ground now\nWould that sold for ... it will actually lower the ph of the soil you're changing not just fertilizing the plants you're changing the peach the structure of the chemistry of the soil around the plants so it makes it more acidic\nWhat that does for you that brings the color out it there'll be intense or orange intense or purple more intense red showing up by fertilizing earlier rather than later\nSome of your your your red maples they aren't read at all your red ash it's not it's not purple or read at all your your your your yellow and that's all because the ph once the ph creeps up to a certain level the colors lost your fragrance what will disappear\nOn some things like roses are so we were flooded ... flower things ... ... your mom don't have the same you're paying these ones that same fragrance of that they're ... they're noted for it if you're a lie lax\nHaven't bloomed the last couple of years the only reason that is is because they're ... they're starving and so when a plant camped\nDoesn't have enough food to access it will negate the flowers are just go I Can't spend any energy and the flowers I just have to keep my full of July 'cause I'm\nIt's been any energy on the flowers I just have to keep my full of July because I'm worried about starving to death\nAnd so that's that's indicates you need to fertilize and for those bring blooming plants you really need to fertilize now in the fall it's using that food to form that bud through winter to show off next spring that's why it's so important\nSo if you're that this is where we have very heavy clay soils very alkaline water\nAnd not much topsoil you this is super important this is more important here in the mountains of Arizona than probably any place else in the country and its has to do because of our clay soil\nThe other house has to do with our monsoon rains pick up what little bit of tops all we have and it flush it washes it or or has it float downstream and so you'll see these beautiful like against Kirkland creek or\n... you'll see these beautiful big washes with sick topsoil 'cause all the mountains there soils actually wash it down into these\nSilky or a basins so especially the rich tops you know soil no soil equals no food no food equals no flowers ... more often so you'll find in the mountains of Arizona you're going to have to fertilize I'd say at least three times a year evergreens for\nEaster if you'd say thinking holidays this is one where you probably do want to pull over\nIf you tuned in and you're driving down the road ... now the time pulled over bought that pen and paper that get that cell phone app yo notes here we got him a fertilize three times a year most of my landscape evergreen store and here are the holidays that I use is markers Easter is my\nIs my spring feeding fourth of July independence day\nIs my summer feeding 'cause it's right before the the rains hit that point and then Halloween October sometime in October you need to fertilize of landscapes especially for the spring glimmers and might evergreens out fertilize at the new year and so that keeps them green and lush and dark\nSo they don't fade and get this winter coat roses that happened and so I encourage you and the and the most important of all of those for feeding ... fall fall absolutely is without doubt the number one this one you don't want to mess\nAll those different kinds of foods that school recover that I got a minute and a half year let's see if I can go deep deep I can go\nI like organic foods I'm an organic guy were organics shots are our plants are organic our\nOur vegetables or non GMO our trees are all organic me everything is that's a big thing and the reason I Do that is that yes my customers like it\nBut mainly thinking what a garden center owner after a lifetime of just spraying chemicals around the deal with chemicals what's the odds of getting through the end of life without cancer about Lizzy rough now I'm going to have melanoma and stuff but I don't want internal structures because I was selling round up and metal by on and die as an on and\nAll these other nasty things a lot of them off the market anymore I tried to organic and I find my customers appreciate that as well or at least their dogs do in their birds do\nSo we organic we've got to organic fertilizer\nSo we spread that out it breaks down slower over the next three months the plants absorb more and more of this food it changes the ph or lowers because we make it for us the mountains it actually has a lot of soul print it lowers that ph changing the chemistry of the plankton take up more of that fertilizer\nBut this time of year the point being fertilize I took advantage of the rain but if you didn't just get it on there you don't have to work it in just get it on and Mother Nature will send us more moisture will do all that work\nHaven't even started showing color you may be another month they'll start showing some color and their stunning rich red meat deep fire engine like I Want the lights on fire engine red that's a color that tree\nYeah very pretty um if you're medium country they

challenging but with Ken hip strengthening our name five you'll read huge rewards now welcome to the mountains Gardner\nRight let's just see if I can share go deeper into this tree thing we was on to 'em what kinds of trees can you grow your what what let's go from a small\nTo medium to large\nAnd I'll focused mainly on the leafy things not so much fruit trees are fruit trees I'll just mentioned that real quick yes we grow exceptional fruits\nWe don't grow any citrus or avocados that's more of the southern Cal desert kind of thing but here we do grow exceptional apple hairs harvest has been tremendous Egypt oh my gosh\nCherries cherries grows so well the higher elevations of the mountains or are they really do well\nUm I Would say apricot nectar Marines actually will grow in your backyard and there are so fruitful only takes one tree and you're done uh plums oh my gosh the best plums you've ever tasted coming out of your own backyard\nThis this is your time to plant those and so those are your fruits that you can grow what you're looking for with those kinds of trees are chilling hours\nYou want a minimum absolute bottom line minimum you want six hundred six hundred and fifty chilling hours on that Tagalog she tell you\nA late bloomer highly blooming it's going to be what we want is a lot of chilling hours so that what that is with fruit trees is needs um any so many nights the coldest before it triggers it's bloom and so a desert variety might have\nTwo hundred the chilling hours it needs some cold but not very much so it's blooming by February January up and even at the higher elevations appearances got an a chilling hours to bloom that's more for the desert so low altitude a kind of stuff\nHere we want a minimum apples I'm looking for apples that need at least nine hundred thousand eleven hundred chilling ours are they're not going to bloom until the end of April May before they start waking up so I get them out of\nThat risk frost by then we're hitting our our last frost date usually and noble and like you can get a a paper cuts the biggest mistake ever anyone ever makes planting in the mountains so planning apricot know do do a desert variety and so they're blooming in February oh my gosh first of march\nWill our last prostate here in Prescott his Mother's Day\nThat's the first we can make you get two months\nOf exposure to possible frost so what's the likely to get into an apricot a desert variety apricot virtually none the tree is not affected at all it's the fruit when does it blooms set fruit and if that flower or fruit gets it gets frozen it dies ... the fruit falls off\nThe tree doesn't die but the fruit will\nShrivel up and fall off so you want\nWe've got a Chilton heart cots tilt an apricot they have eight hundred ... hours they're getting out there getting real close to that last frost date\nSo you have much more consistent fruiting and that type of apricot that the point being I don't want to go any deeper than that\nDo your homework know who you're buying it from what variety and how many chilling hours it needs a minimum of our six six hundred and fifty hours even that slow I Would say seven eight hundred is what I Would do for my own self\nI wouldn't go any lower than that uh but you'll find all kinds of stuff in the mountains zero just find all kinds of this desert influence coming at you so a lot of folks plant the wrong variety of fruit tree especially if you're shopping at the big boxes they're bringing the the ... that every one of my stores and all of Arizona\nSo from Dallas to Flagstaff ... up everything in between you've got the same variety of desert fruit tree that doesn't grow anyway get embarrassed\nBy what I see other folks selling their garden Centers for here\nFruit trees so if you're talking about smaller uh trees in general just ornamental trees not fruit trees ornamental\nOr you've got red buds we're famous for red buds a western red bud grows wild eastern red breads thinks that grows wild here they just do really well crab apples or had the show ... all of the fruiting spring trees\nA you've got right now is a service Barry or or what is that what's a botanical on that any where there's a wild cherry a choked cherry kind of thing that grows wild here it doesn't permit chariots got a white flour and spring but it's beautiful orange and read the colors and the fall of the year does it's a smaller tree\nYou'll see a tree just brimming wild a white out in the wild and that's usually that that that type of cherry\nA purple leaves plum of course is probably the most almost over done of all of the trees but a lot of folks come from green the country and they've never seen a purple treat\nYour I Want all part of our number my bar brawl slug oh little bits good but a lot of it it's a good one to enter mix from design standpoint puts spots a purple with your greens and things and and it looks good\nI'd say the same thing with your purple birch are you're purple a cherries there's several trees a purple foliage on them there's even a purple red but of all things forest pansy read but\nVery interesting because cheaply but the foliage is purple so that that's another small if you're a medium sized trees I Would really we're getting into some definition but I always say dingo\nYou you California folks you love gained goes
