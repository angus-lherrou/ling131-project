they\nWell Hezbollah the Lebanese party of God is the Shiite um religious militia [noise]\nI'm a underground Iranian proxy group that was of formulating around the time of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in Nineteen eighty two\nUm Lebanon as as you know of only split between the Sunni the Christian and the Shiite population for domination of the country and the sheer were always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy eight or one of the Shiites spiritual leader of 'em was was murdered in Libya and left the vacuum in the country and and that coincided with the onset of\nAyatollah Khomeini and Iran and the Iranian Revolution and they ... the uranium for a possible fertile ground to spread the revolution in Lebanon and they ... they send some intelligence specialist somebody said revolutionary guard was going\nTo have been on with theory of blessing and they said of faith in Lebanon and they established almost that many state within in many states that was very obvious to many\nInside the country for them I interviewed a few people who are journalists at the time in Lebanon and they said that the Iranian influence was everywhere I'm sadly the the

that have a vested interest in keeping with um the Iranians way out of Lebanon\nFred is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as al ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a

investigating the attacks on the u._s. embassies and the hijackings and the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping at the CIA station chief which\nUh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a kind of put them history\nA never been done this was an organization that had a literally a snatched or the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild\nA all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing uh so uh this is unprecedented its time and um\nIt was certainly shocking for us uh then it occurred uh but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because uh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley\nUh we we just simply could not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us exactly where he was so\nUm [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are certainly um I'll never

region\nOr why we need a footprint in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy\nAnd uh uh take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil\nAnd that's the critical

regime in power has been transformed from an underground for\n'em in the Nineteen eighties the period we're for them I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of um the fundamentalist

cities um it involved the narco terrorism is one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm I'm tropical in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with\nThat we cannot ignore a specifically because it has a week or so from operatives in this country has for many years\nAnd it is an arm and extension of Iran was um a desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world but if I'm all for important to us national interest\nAll countries of course worked in straw parties we worked with a little Schama bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets out of there\nGiving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah why are we getting talk with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions why don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stop supplying them well we're going to ... why don't we do that Sam\nI think that this country has been very apprehensive about engaging Iran militarily\nOr hostages were the ... the U.S embassy in Tehran um many many years ago I think there were numerous um declarations of war by Iran has low against the United states\nThe bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and the the the bombing of the marine barracks which was um on the thirty five years ago to this day out\nOn hold on for a second set and we'll come back to this point and we'll talk with you and Fred as well about your book be rude rules next on coast to coast that you\nNever miss a detail on a show or get to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter for free it goes to ... am dot com [noise]\nNo I don't think so I think come we haven't gone after Iran militarily because we're not really sure or a direct military conflict with Iran might bring I think the Iranian youth groups like Hezbollah to export terrorism throughout the middle east\nAnd the rest of the world is daunting enough for 'em policy planners in this country\nFor generations it was um directly responsible for a lack of response to it with a truck bombing of the embassies marine and the ...\nSaw a truck bombing of the embassies the marine and the kidnapping of a figure your station chief from things that was unheard of in the world of espionage up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only\nStation she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered in the history of the agency\nFor burden tell us about what you bought\n[noise] a bill was a [noise] a a true patriot Georgia and he grew up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening to this is not to journalists were talking about\nNo it's not there's actually a funny Side Story to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA ... and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years wrote them and uh our bill thought it was pretty funny and\nA thought about a cashing them but I'm a bill grow up in the Boston area a salmon I were lucky enough to get the cooperation of bills a family he has a\nElderly companion or that he's lived with for many many years and a sister\nWho just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up uh [noise]\nI'm In he went off after high school into the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea as a young kid and um where he was a silver star recipient and\nAlso a Purple Heart I'm an which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into\nWhen it comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates gets a hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties it was very murky\nA as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find anybody that can tell us specifically what he was up to 'em but regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things when you you know didn't surprise me because of\nUh the nature of it as a curiosity and his languages and you know ability to\nTo just I'm a study history specially military history\nUh so uh in Nineteen sixty or he joins or the U.S army again a and goes into special forces a and I'm also a associated with the CIA and that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter and recruiter and I'm Bill goes off or\nTo Vietnam and where he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire\nA so this was a man George that was always running towards danger and uh he he reminds me of the NYPD a cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers I don't\nKnow if you show no they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um and and off the bill uh was uh\nUh the only guy to raise his hand to to volunteer to go to Beirut a at the CIA or after this devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station has wiped out so um that was to Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nNow which is assignments bread in Beirut clandestine war was it pretty well known by people\nWell ah the station chief or um is usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is\nA although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the uh the CIA officer the cheapest station and of course the other ... intelligence liaison services know that to\nSuch as the Jordanians the French the Israel was and so forth so I'm Bill is not in a undercover position during that time period\nSomebody read it on him\nNo doubt well uh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period um you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about\nMeat sources meat snitches and so forth and so uh you know bill was that kind of person\nAnd I'm In essence are leaving his apartment one day a in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles are and Hezbollah grab them and um they're begins his time in captivity\nWhy didn't you have security around\n[noise] it's a good question or I can tell you a first hand from that time period a it was an unusual for station chiefs and not to have security uh salmon I did our last book on bin ... uh where you had a whole Qadri a professional\nUh security personnel to specifically watch a CIA officers backs are in that time period uh they really didn't exist you could request security you could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but\nUh you can't really do your job as a as a secret agent to use that phrase it with an entourage so ah the nature of the job and not in that time period was you were a single time you were kind of like a a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for a while about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\nHe was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and um I was part of the hostage de briefing team where uh we were assigned to at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out to who was a wonderful man\nI spoke to him and ... and visa Biden Germany after he had been held in captivity and and he told his bill had died and bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because we had devoted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so\nThen it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWill must have been like looking for a needle in the haystack for\nAll my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was a time period [noise] um you know we had a ... we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then\nUm we we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but um it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a person in a building or in a very barracks\nI'm ... and we literally could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge a intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating [noise] ah I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was\nA at one point or the FBI believed that uh\nOr the FBI believed that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran a and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut while I'm which I'm not you certainly a smoking gun\nOr as to who is directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam wouldn't let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time jak Anderson wrote an article about ... William Buckley simply saying\nHe was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but where do you think do jak Anderson's call them accurate or not\nI I think if I'm fairly safe to assume that under torture I'm Bill Buckley a revealed information\nI'm a very classified nature I'm a station chief um he was the supervisor he was the um the branch manager of the ... the U.S intelligence apparatus in Lebanon\nSo he knew the names of the other agents he knew the name of their sources and he had all that information I'm In his in his mind because he has a controller on the basis that he has to supervise it I'm One of the um\nYou know one of the things that we reveal in the book is shortly after bill was um confirmed that he was abducted um personnel in the station um retreat of out of the ... out of country very very quickly because of their identity as would have become known", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "24"}
