Lamberth lying under oath because I had him testify during the Clinton years in a deposition in fact try ... may come back Stephanopoulos was one of the heads of the war room alone with Hillary Clinton James Carville and himself\nBase near the number of women they did that\nAt the direction of Hillary and Bill Clinton and they did it\nTo protect the president\nSo for him to be talking about you know how cabinets defending themselves and how the president is backing him up\nUh you know he never take the side of the accused I mean that's terribly hypocritical and of course it is but one would expect from George Stephanopoulos\nTell me the women you represented and tell me what specifically are stepping up all is there to malign them\nWith regard to Jennifer flowers and he they were all working together stuff in the opposite is Carville\nAnd the rest of them they broke into her house and\nThreatened her terrorized here\nThey had to buy the last ... it was a mess with regard to

relationship Twenty one years so you know there's a scorched earth policy to try to keep these women quiet\nAnd you know for stepping up all the way in at all your system believable and I might add Laurie at the time that Lamberth will says lamprey Stephanopoulos have lied under oath\nCame into that deposition unshaven did shovels insulted the judge this was about ... the illegal attaining the FBI Files and nine hundred Republicans and others Stephanopoulos\nWas caught by the judge or not telling the truth and at that time Sam Donaldson who was his co host\nOn NBC's last week called me up and he asked me about the monopoly is whether he had been found to have lived and I said Sam how could you leave this guy on the air when he's now a certified liar and of course now you know he's a multi millionaire and he's riding high ABC\nAnd now he feels a duty bound to take a shot at the president simply because he defended judge Kavanaugh\nLarry claiming a you said you had a step monopoly under deposition twice did he ever admit under oath to doing some of the things that you claim you've done\nWell I had a very good memory [laughter] you know the the favorite phrase of the Clinton people was I have no specific regular recollection is I remember something I Can't remember now on the front of the\nRhubarb justice so no he wouldn't admit to anything and like I said he he was going on to a blight on the low\nWell given the fact that he won't admit to anything how do you know that he himself has done these things how do you put his fingerprints on these things\nThat's been widely reported him in Reno because actually ... you wrote a book called the war room which became a documentary where in that book he admitted to working with a very quick to address\nFalse allegations by his accusers\nBy Bill Clinton's accuses the women that I represented now ironically Laurie in today's world would convert these left his judges who are out of control heavily denying an allegation is enough to say that you think someone in fact the correct that's got to lawsuits right now because he denied\nThat he sexually harassed or any women he's probably less destructive allowed to go forward in time to change\nAnd we now are and what can affect the civil war between left and right and the judges are furthering the civil war\nMarried claiming as the founder judicial watching freedom watch Larry I was having a conversation the other day with a buddy of mine is about my age\nAnd he said he told a friend of yours about George Stephanopoulos rolled in the mining these women she ... the the

slept strategy on aware of it so if this guy's a middle aged guys unaware but imagine what people in their forties thirties twenties think of George Stephanopoulos they have no idea he was involved no

mentioning climate we would just wrapped up in New York wow and what do they do anyway\nWell they they had a lot of people there are a lot of dignitaries or their goals from the website where that they were run it to a race ambition reduce climate change and accelerate climate action\nOr some big notable Tony Blair former prime minister England spoke bond Ki moon from the United nations um actor Hugh Jackman\nUh-huh ... the man overseeing\nSpoken a so quite a quite a big group also a big public relations steel claim a five hundred thirty five million people were reached in three hundred and news articles written\nSo a a kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would uh and and a lot of the folks there I think believe\nThat if they change a light bulbs they can save polar bears ... if we all drive electric cars we can stop the oceans from rising\nAnd if we build a wind turbine towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe and George we live in a in a modern age of superstition or there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo they are definitely man made global warming proponents aren't they they are well and I've never been a fan of that because you know I think one Steven I think you agree were polluting the planet there was no question about that and we need to fix that\nThere's ... showing it affects that's correct\nI don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think we're in solar cycles a I think this this planet or has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbons in the atmosphere and anything like that\nThere were at least for periods over the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist eight thousand years ago and we've been gently cooling since then although the temperatures go up and they go down\nAnd uh you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were so many people are conflate ing what are called real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment\nThings that carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide so for a day I'm the mercury particulates with carbon dioxide which is a voter lists harmless invisible gas\nAnd what I speak the groups I like to say to them what to cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that there are so many proponents for man made climate change\nWell it it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress and ... it was on a very hot summer day and he said it was Ninety nine percent sure\nThat the earth was warming and humans were causing it he was a computer model or and within a year and a half the United nations form the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change\nAnd just three years later we had forty one nations on the European Community signed a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases so in my opinion that the first thing is that the world kind of jumped to a conclusion quickly on this\nBut uh you know for the last uh the thirty years or so the computer models of in predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it the temperatures have warmed just a little storms are stronger the polar bears are doing fine\nAnd then the second factor though is I think a much of this is being driven forward momentum by money mhm uh we have a wind and solar and biofuel industry so we'd have deans of sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability uh corporations\nAnd there are over there is over two hundred fifty billion dollars a year sped every year on renewables to try and stop the planet from a warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second is there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nAmazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days they've been talking about fears of one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nOne or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nWell you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee governor of Washington state just a post an article on CNN called how to show Trump you care about climate change\nAnd he's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer and that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well we've had\nOne degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years one degree yet\nAnd I think it came from the sun while I Do too but\nThat comes straight from the climate research unit at East Anglia in England they the number one authority on this one degree so so in the last decade maybe we've had a tenth of a degree in ... in Washington for us to say that all these forest fires are caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work um the way we take care of our forests ah for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous Smith allocation of resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved\nToday eighty percent of the world's waste water is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago in Brazil the swimmers they don't want to swimming in the water\n'em and they're just building the first water treatment plant style and Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\n... electricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease\nYet we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming and the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun\nIt's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things they're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that the you know the the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change keep butting heads\nBut I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to feel the way you do that we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\nWell if you again if you look at ... at any of the oil but any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles you saw articles written about uh\nUm what was a Hurricane Florence mhm and the last year we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas\nAh we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida\nBut if you look back at history this has happened before we've had a twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states and these are this is really nothing new\nA hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century\nOther ... and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see this storms are either getting more frequent are stronger\nOr the U.S government also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more floods are more droughts we have more droughts in the Nineteen thirties we have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never show data comparing the past to the president\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book

[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nBecause businesses today are are really trip to the green boxer sustainable development there they're forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and uh\nThat humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction uh and the fourth is a resource depletion of those for fears\nAre really at the basis of all of a our state and federal laws about energy I'm a and they're taught in the universities and taught in a high schools\nBut if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been exaggerated to a very very big extent so\nI discuss the Fort Worth ... and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries\nOr energy materials agriculture a et cetera but it's a fun to read at say a color paperback and uh\nGot a lot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also about a a eight hundred notes in the back so people can go deeper why the way for its\nSize it's a heavy book\n[laughter] well I don't know about that but in London or even really do put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which kind of summarize with some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\nMore with climate change in with what's happening I'm a I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you know\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago me put\nThis could be temporary because Saudi Arabia is ... talking about turning out a lot of ... additional oil production but uh we're growing very fast the the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse [noise] and uh yeah we're the biggest producer of crude no\nNo I Believe in Thomas schools theory of abiotic oil that the planet is God in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs in plants\nI tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time but we know natural gas can be created by all sorts of things including a you know camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I saw I think there's probably a combination of of some that his fossilized fuel but others others that do come up from the balls here with I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase the phrase fossil fuels I like to use the communal hydrocarbons instead\nOn who you know what am I simple theories on why the abiotic theory is the probable theory is because most of the oil that is pumped on this planet each way way down there oh yeah Lance dead animals get down there\nAnd they're finding now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah some of these very deep wells they find oil and you've got a kind of wonder the other thing is that a lot of it has been you know found in the polar regions too and and those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but\nI Know we have shipped shifting to the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I I Do think it's a\nIt probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the ... of the earth what\nIs the argument about overpopulation and then it's a major problem for all of us\nYeah so Nineteen fifty um we've had this huge population growth rate or across the world and up and until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy you know the big reason for that was we had declining um infant mortality we had a declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems\nAnd so a bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death from the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties\nBut they didn't uh first we had a global agricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled or by two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output\nBut the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping the fertility rate the number of of uh children a woman will have in her lifetime and back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average is having five children during her lifetime will today that has dropped down to two and a half\nThat said dropped in half and the reason is we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological a sort of a state we have more women entering the worse workforce there waiting to have children and they're having smaller families\nSo all none of this was foreseen at all occurred and the great news is that uh we're probably going to get the global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years and so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nA benefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles for the red cross and or feeling you can't fly in a as we were driving to get to the venue I saw things that I haven't seen in years and you know because I spend a lot of time in St Louis\nI saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in June ... strewn all over the place\nOr is that was his ... in Los Angeles yeah I mean I'm looking at all the homeless\nPeople in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so that really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call\nWasted dumped everywhere\nUh it certainly is it it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though if I might if I might comment the government to California keeps making housing more expensive\nYou know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand they're they're gonna twang everything they have a electric car plug in\nSo he just had about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California does isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right what would you recommend that people start doing personally to combat this situation\n... people and businesses or you know actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going in the land fills a that piqued about Nineteen Ninety in the United states in this now starting to trend down\nWe're doing more recycling um but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we've touched on before um nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide particulates et cetera not carbon dioxide\nUm so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide\nIs what they're pumping into greenhouses in California to make their cannabis crop grow a bigger and faster its its plant food and it's right or the idea that ah that CEO to as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these\nPictures that were you have this dirty looking air over China\nIf you can see the error that's not causing global warming all of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gases number one is water vapor but it's the biggest greenhouse gas to his carbon dioxide three has nothing\nBut it's the biggest greenhouse gas to his carbon dioxide three has a methane those are all invisible\nSo if you can if you can see the air you gotta clean that up but the greenhouse gases are are really not causing air pollution or so we need we need to get our our uh aims at the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nSteve you've talked about in people coming in energy and climate regulations what kind of ... isn't it\nYeah well we've had a basically a rate payer revolts now in Australia just this last summer in Australia um we had a\nA Scott Morris and take over as the\nUh the new uh ... minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out and leading the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is called for withdraw from the Paris accords\nUm the prime minister Morrison says this is number one priority is to reduce power prices while we keep the lights on wait a similar thing up and Ontario by the way both Australia and Ontario electric rates have gone through the roof more than doubled over the last ten years\nUp in Ontario a premier dug for took over and within a month he had cancelled more than a hundred wind and solar a contracts they eliminated um ah for the fourteen thousand dollar Canadian electric car credit\nAnd now we have five provinces opposing the Canadian carbon tax that California has said so we got to write a paper revolts going on in California says they want to be a hundred percent renewable from the power plants\nAre electricity rates right out there right now are are fifty percent greater than any other western state in the in the forty eight states fifty per cent fifty percent nobody you guys are fifty percent higher than any other state\nAnd um it's going to go much much higher deep deep carbon is Asian many studies have shown is going to increase your rates double or triple so I'm predicting within the next ten years of rate payer revolt California as well [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "03"}
