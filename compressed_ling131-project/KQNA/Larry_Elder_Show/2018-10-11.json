[noise] well\nI I don't have the the stats on white women in front of me but that's not what she said Sean she specifically said that the Democrats have not taken the white vote in sixty years or one being Lyndon Johnson the other one being my husband and she was wrong\nBut earlier in that if you played the clip again it said women have voted for me okay so\nI heard I heard her say I heard her say that and then she made a second point in the second point was false second point was that a two time the last ... years the white voters gone to the Democrats when in fact it only gone one time and that would limit Johnson a Nineteen fifty four she also said my husband was the second one I play it again\nLike when all women went for me and [noise] look white women had than a voting against

already or a Republican president whether decades I mean again I Would have the fact that she was white as far as like what\nWill Sean you're being awfully generous I Would like that people give the

supremacist on both sides he was talking about the argument about whether or not the Confederate statues memorials ought to be in the public square there are good people on both sides and argue my mother and father didn't think they should be removed that what you're talking about so we're going to hold 'em\nOr Donald Trump to be very precise\nAnd if you said something of imprecise and you can interpret it the worst possible way why can't I Do that with Hillary\nWell when we met was a white woman that's not what she said she was very very specific she said the Democrats have not won the white vote in last sixty years when you do that again\nLike when I when I went for me and [noise] look white women had then a voting against democratic presidential candidate for a decade now or the
