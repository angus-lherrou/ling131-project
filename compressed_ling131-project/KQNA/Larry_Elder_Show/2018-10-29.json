Florida named Andrew Gillum who has said that police in Florida are similar to slave catchers and that police or an occupying force how do you elect a guy like that to be the governor of

taught ... see what I don't understand is why the United states military\nCannot roll tanks at Fort Hood and all the one stored in Arizona and just play some on the border is kind of hinder the stars on heroin Akin's across there\nOkay they're not touching anybody yet but American image the TV cameras are seeing it in both directions glass thing though that I wanted to ask the point that I was calling about your producer brought up on your screen [noise]\nWhen the first kid started showing up on trains absence of mothers [noise]\nMy kids were about that I'm a young father I don't know how to and I'm not young but I'm I'm new at just ... to the point that I was getting at it's like this doesn't sound like mommy style mommy I couldn't understand what was going on [noise]\nIt was recorded but at one point and the federal registrar there was a century ... after you put out that in Ninety Days they wanted bids on watching companies to move kids\nFrom unknown places unknown cities but on the southern border the United states to unknown destination to be better ... which are the ... century like we'll figure that out later you tell us what these kids are because they had the polish shutting the register\nOf course in ... under Obama now the wide open borders dispersed around America you know one third of all living out Salvadorans live not in El Salvador they live in America we have every week about two thousand showing up on our southern border\nTwo thousand a week yeah put in the numbers it's a hundred thousand or more\nAh I'm Sorry not a week two thousand per day we have seven hundred thousand a legal showing up on the southern border\nThe great majority are given due process hearing are the three to five years from now and will never take place they melt down on the southern border with diseases in what skills we don't need with individuals who are illegal and the Democratic party is shift completely in twenty six Obama voted for a border fence\nHas that Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer what twelve years ago the Democratic party wanted border fences to be built they want it illegal was out of the country when he started losing elections\nThey figure it out well let's make Texas a blue state let's flood Texas with illegals make them legal to vote and then we can win Texas it paid O'Rourke wins taxes and that guy is a pool in a clown\nOver Ted Cruz something is wrong in Texas have taxes become a blue state Republicans will never again when the presidency continue with more coming up in about six minutes NYPD retired officer\nInvestigator detective Thomas rush can will be here to talk about the investigation of what happened in Pittsburgh later on or Sam Nunberg will be here works for the ban on his way out to Nevada to talk about the Trump media a respect or lack there by CNN later on as David Wray affair federation of American immigration reform\nTo talk about the medical conditions happening on the southern border and more of a line becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven the Boston Red Sox world champion taking on the Dodgers four to five still counting undergrad Americans\nNor a vibrant own Warner even touch the mega had he goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing\nThe president is one of many causing it so when you went and then why do you go back right now the Pittsburgh Police are back in time and say\nWhat did he do when did he do it who didn't send these messages to and investigate them as to why something wasn't done and about the guns right now according to meeting accounts three fifty seven magnitude since and blocks that were legally purchased and they are Fifteen they're still trying to think down and see what it is\nA ... if someone is posting anti Semitic slurs and saying I'm going in and they have guns now isn't that another tempted something's about to happen\nThat's what you would hope you would hope being from the polish Pittsburgh Police departments\nStandpoint you would have gotten that core or the FBI would have gotten a call and then if you dropped the ball is a law enforcement agency [laughter] and it's on you but in this case nothing nine I'm seeing about ... hours showed anything\nTo indicate that he was becoming radicalized than he was becoming won't we call lone wolf\nAnd they was going to do something other than his ramps till right before he went in yesterday when he said I'm going in and policemen went bad and that will come to light if they didn't they don't know why didn't someone else who saw this alert police\n... can you some doubt how many other Robert Bowers are running around this country and I would assume there are several thousand just like him\nIn the nation at three hundred and forty million people and let's face in America is the most pro Jewish pro Israel Israel\nEspecially with with Trump in the White House nation on the face of the earth and then this is the place or where where where were Jews do well and there's about three million or so three and a half million Jews in America disproportionately successful\nFaith and family because of connections some hard work because of academics disproportionate six that\nAnd so those who are jealous or whatever they got to have a scapegoat for the failures in their life and you look at someone successful so many Jews disproportionately succeed in business and entertainment in finance and the law in Madison and I found it so it lost her job that\nThis afternoon on CNN there was an interview of a doctor who treated Bowers who unfortunately lived in that doctor is Jewish at the Pittsburgh hospital\nIn a couple of the nurses who treated him and saved his life or Jewish he isn't that unbelievable that that that somehow powers were saved by by Jews in the hospital unbelievable\nCould have been a Jewish cop who responded to the synagogue to to save other people people in their ... doctors lawyers\nOr the emergency areas paying doctors police officers firemen\nDon't look at what they're saying what they've done they know what they're sworn to do and that's what they do it and that's where the doctors in that hospital even though he had killed eleven Jewish people in a synagogue with their prey\nSaved his life and that's what they do and that's what cops too and that's what I Am and do and that's what these doctors and God Bless them for that\nWas talking about seasonal or say who was the uh mentally ill deranged individual they ran around on the white van I guess his fan was he was an attempt to bomb making factory some have said when someone in a white man\nHas those kind of a a Heidi Asians on the side CNN sucks also had scopes on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama that something should have been done in your years in New York City as a cop Thomas risk and how many unusual situations like that did you observe\nMore than I can count\nBut I Will tell you this that you know there are laws and there are reasons for stopping someone and questioning them and maybe he didn't violate them on the fact that he's expressing his First Amendment right to express speech on the outside of his car doesn't necessarily give you a right\nTo pull him over and or questioned him I'm less he violates some other kind of law and that we don't even know if the police had any interaction with him relative to his fan as of yet down there but you know at the point in time I'm sure where it went down to about ... aka a Florida\nWhen the bombs had been sent prove that distribution center\nAnd then in the area plantation where he was taken into custody I wouldn't be surprised to certain people start to make calls on him prior to the police\nCome into contact with him or learning his identity through his finger print and that was tying in simultaneously with them identifying ... is the potential bomber\nAnd you know the acts of terror are taking place sadly quite frequently just on Wednesday hey criminal who sent a rise in light materials\nTo the home of US Senator Susan Collins was arraigned on the Trump children the adult children have received numerous\nNumerous rise in a ... or attempted to look like rising and blows who powder in the mail including us defense secretary James Mattis and practically every\nHigh ranking Trump official has been threatened with death Ted Cruz and others changed completely out of restaurants you Senator Mitch McConnell in Louisville, Kentucky chased out of a restaurant\nMcConnell in Louisville, Kentucky chased out of a restaurant you have a ... a United States a congressman and Republican\nIn uh in California had a switch blade pulled on attempted to stab him running for the Congress the candidate clobbered that would be assassin before the man could get to play it out of a malfunctioning\nKnife and there are numerous examples in the last several months where powder scent where are the candidates are sent with their heads decapitated and I I Can't recall a time other than the late Nineteen sixty sixty eight when the country repaired almost to me to be coming apart the Drudge Report\nSays the usa on edge do have a sense that something is different about the political climate now than it's been years ago Thomas risking\nThe rhetoric on both sides of the oil have become this rural and have become terrible and we have to dial it back I mean I've said in numerous appearances recently that if this continues on a leash so it'd be busier than they've ever been before and it's not\nJust Donald Trump and it's not just the right is\nEveryone has to understand some of the McCain way of thinking that we have to work together we can have a political views and we can look at things\nFrom different lenses that are different experiences and we were brought up for all Americans and if we're not able to work with each other and help each other or save each other the way that they do after a hurricane and the way the police officers around this country to every single day\nThey don't look at the color whether religion or the person that they're saving they respond because that's what they're sworn to do and they risk their lives to save anyone that they potentially could save because that they're calling\nAnd I I don't know I like the president I loved the guy spent time with him we speak now and then he's a great political character I look at it as a result more than look at his words\nBut I I don't recall words being used by him along the lines and the words at least as president then I hear on the left but the media covers the Trump words differently and then they covered get democratic words\nAnd uh and I I Wish there was a quality between the two but as you said the election now is only a little more than a week away at at this point it would all of us to lower down to ... rhetoric a little bit\nBecause there's hundreds and thousands on the left and on the right now they're waiting it'd be triggered by some event in many are mentally ill and many have guns now that doesn't mean any of us\nTom rescue needs to stop exercising or free speech rights on their constitution\nBut it does mean that that the media also plays a role in this one I've been watching CNN the past two days all I hear about is Trump and the Republicans responsible for almost a mass murder of two former presidents plus the killing of twelve or fourteen others along with the attempts to\nTide Donald Trump to what happened in Pittsburgh\nEven though he's the only president in American history you have Jewish grandchildren the only one\nTo end today CNN tried to tee up the U.S Israeli ambassador the Israel and the Israeli ambassador to the u._s. I'm Sorry\nAnd he said that the best friend Israel's ever had has been Donald J Trump and that he's been wonderful for Israel and Trump is not responsible for what happened there the president's going to go to Pittsburgh and the next couple of days\nTo me but those that have been wounded summer mortally wounded not likely to survive the number eleven\nIs likely to go up and the president has said that it's time to lower the writer rhetoric just a little bit but the other side doesn't want to accept it in fact CNN and the Washington Post or indirectly accusing the president of the murders in Pittsburgh and that is despicable man we we've got a calmness down\nAnd they look as if that was a little over a week from now we're going to have an election may want to gin up the numbers to hurt the president hurt Republicans I Hope it doesn't work\nBut but Tom what you said about calming down relaxing a little bit when you're in New York City when I had my TV show the for five years completely different I live now in Cincinnati completely different culture a completely different things are going on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nWilling to both of my\nChoice to go to Roger in sales are certainly go to the whole point for my choice to go out and do some man to recognize you leave you with this one but two Marconi Ron [noise] one in the [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I've\nOnly counting on the great American drone us now is Sam Nunberg is an American public affairs consultant\nBased in Manhattan and he was a political advisor to president Donald Trump on the twenty sixteen presidential campaign he also serves as today is a political consulting and Sam Nunberg welcome again to the dough Cunningham show Sam how are you\n\nDoing well let me share with you a a choice put out by Sarah Sanders about five or six hours ago press secretary she said the following is there any tragedy the Washington Post it won't exploit to attack President Trump\nThe evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because he's such a on a public defender apologetic defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nThere was a headline yesterday in the Washington Post that said bomb suspect found inspiration in Trump and most of today the media is trying to tie Trump to what happened in Pittsburgh even know his grad Trump's grandchildren or Jewish or his daughter or vodka\nOr came and observant Jew\nA course a Jared Kushner is an Orthodox Jew and so Trump attend many Jewish religious functions and this afternoon I watch CNN try to pay\nThe Israeli ambassador to America by asking about whether or not the president and somehow responsible for the climate the cause the horrible\nMass murderer yesterday morning Saturday morning I'm Sorry Saturday morning and the Israeli ambassador said no way he said this president is Israel's best friend and that and that but it's wonderful\nBest friend and that and that and it was it's wonderful to have them in the in the oval office have you noticed the attempt the last two days to time the president not just to Pittsburgh but also to say ...\n... you know it's absolutely disgusting but it shouldn't surprise us fill the the media and of course the Democrats are so invested in in the Republicans losing the house [laughter] impeachment proceedings starting again since president\nIn investigation after investigation that will make ... confirmation hearing looked like a dress rehearsal\nThat the fact that we had momentum and I say we as Republicans we as the members of the party of Donald Trump the Republican Party we have had momentum heading into these late final week and they just want to use a ventilator because it has to do anything they can for that last bill ten percent\nFive percent of the electric who's going to make their minds up in the final days but I don't think it's going to work\nBecause at the end of the day Americans are going to the ... are they better off than they were\nTwo and a half years ago it's not a question yeah look with Donald Trump inherited you know it's funny we had also on Fridays do they announced I Believe three point five or three point six GDP right we haven't had two consecutive quarters of\nTo office for the first one in modern day history are we going to let the Democrats take over and really hang out at the same time in twenty ninth team you know it's not that far around the corner by around march or April you're gonna start came democratically dates for twenty twenty\nNo God can you imagine it will be like a bar scene from Star Wars when the Democrats started announcing in February March and April of next year getting ready in the media then we'll stop complete coverage of all the positive things Trump has done foreign affairs and for the military\nEven sixty minutes or tonight and I did a story about ISIS being killed that ISIS says didn't exist in the last remnants of ISIS will be taken away\nThe media doesn't report on that do they Sam Nunberg dinner report on ISIS they don't report on the American economy\nMental report on the unemployment rate they don't report on public affairs Foreign Relations that are going so well they keep looking for the call Joe the club they keep looking for the brass knuckles to go after Trump may find something every week or two a brand new thing arises to destroy him\nAccording to a media Research Center Ninety three percent\nOf the media coverage of Trump is negative and it goes on and on and on\nAnd how they can twist the Pittsburgh massacre\nAnd doing the anti Trump diatribe ... is a is journalist the gymnastics that would make Mary Lou Retton jealous it's unbelievable\nHow they could do how they could say that the only president in American history loved by the Israelis they're naming boulevards after Trump the only president in American history with Jewish grandchildren\nThat the only president in American history that move the embassy to Jerusalem and somehow anti Semitic when the murderer himself posted quite a few things\nThat he was again Trump anyway but then that never stopped the Washington Post ... and ... some out time Trump to the Pittsburgh massacre\nTendencies are Saudi ark and others that somehow he was involved in part of the ... unbelievable the gymnastics that go on\nAnd if they can be successful and try and tying Trump to Pittsburgh then all hell is going to break loose imagine how they're going to cover him imagine what happens on a week from Wednesday if we wake up in the morning I get up about six thirty seven I Am\nAnd the Republicans have controlled the house and Senate again imagine what the media would do then Sam Nunberg it's going to look like election night with George Stephanopoulos\nHaving projectile vomiting an explosive diarrhea it's going to be the same stuff and I'm going to love and I think it might happen\nI think right now either simple formula um the Democrats the Democrats or you know a an around June or so they they thought they had an easy thirty five feet\nOr that they were going to win thought they were coming out of California they thought they were coming out of a Virginian they were coming out of New Jersey they thought they were coming out of control and they were coming out of New York\nSimple is if you if the Republicans are able to control\nFor keep all their feet

the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began and Jeff now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that looks so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent\nOf the so called the migrants are young males between the age of Fifteen and thirty\nIt's impossible for a woman with a baby to walk two thousand miles\nThrough John goes in the heat and sand in deserts that ain't gonna happen somebody's organizing on this month like the boat live from Juba there are lumped as politicians who hate Trump didn't want to destroy America and they want to flood the southern border right now there's Fifteen and twenty thousand one hundred Fifteen to twenty million\nWell you know there are forty one million people in Central America and I bet a good deal of them have their eyes on what's happening here and how we handle it the problem is that we have gaping loopholes in our asylum laws and if anyone in this caravan no matter what even if they said on national television ten times\nThat they're coming here for a job as you've heard people say oh I Want is a job in Los Angeles when they put one toe in the United states they say the words political asylum and they are in like Flynn\nThey are here they're going to be released into the country and they're going to be on a backlog of probably as long as three to four years never showing up for their cases eighty percent of these folks who exploit the asylum loopholes never show up for their cases and simply disappear into the United states this is a gimmick\nThey're using our own policies twice this year the Republican Congress has tried to close these loopholes and they have not had a single democratic vote\nTo uh to do so and you asked ask yourself why who really benefits in the long run from mass illegal immigration\nWhen you look at studies of immigrants as they become citizens and how they vote sixty five percent of them end up registering his Democratic\nOpponent by that government assistance but\nYeah I mean you're barely making it you're going to vote for the party that hand you the most goodies and ah you know twenty five percent a vote Republican but if you think about you know twelve million illegal aliens a sixty five percent of them would end up becoming citizens and voting Democrat\nThat would that would that have thrown every American election to the Democrats and the last Twenty years and everyone for probably the next forty\n... and the other issue you read and democratic literature that if and when Texas flipped to the Democratic party and becomes a deep blue state\nThe way the politics will be fashion for the next twenty to fifty years there'll be no chance for Republican ever to win the presidency and again in Texas is a blue state\nAnd you might throw in Florida because California for most of history with a deep red state run them re gray haired it easily mixing dared raised like California flip it goes really go migration\nTo the next target Texans flips and it's over but\nDavid Wray affair here here's a question Trump is talking in the way I Would like him to talking normal he reflects mid western values conservative values he's saying the army or the national guard will not let them cross in America\nHow do you physically stop maybe twenty or thirty thousand people in mass from getting one totally into American soil then blaming political refugee status how physically we're not going to shoot them there's well ... how do you actually stop 'em\nThat's the million dollar question without going into Mexico because I really think\nThat that is the question and I don't know that anybody has the answer to that I'll tell you\nHow you would stop them if it existed Trump's border wall if you had a border wall there they wouldn't be walking in the United states except through legal ports of entry or they would have to walk way out into the desert in Arizona or to come over that's why we need the border wall and some of these heavy crossing points but that's all it takes\nIs one ... in the United states\nAnd we're done and you're done and orange on the long\nList oh yeah and all we need to do is and so fair has called called we believe this is the beginning of a national emergency just like the Mariel boatlift was we've asked the Congress the president calls Congress back to Washington\nThis week to close these asylum loopholes if we could close these asylum loopholes or if we could put asylum courts with detention centers right on the border so as they came over\nSet ask for political asylum they had their hearing and they were immediately sent home because Ninety nine percent of these folks would not qualify for ... for political asylum their economic migrants than we would have in the end of this nonsense\nWe can't get those loopholes closed that Congress failed twice they're going to we think they should come back and close these loopholes anything short of that and and it's kind of a a you know a cat and mouse game we have to try to keep them from getting in you know I Would\nProbably take ten Democrats the United States Senate to move legislation right now there's fifty one there might be fifty four fifty five after the election\nWhatever the number is unique numerous Democrats to switch party line vote with the Republicans in order to say that much like Mexican Mexicans come here and they're getting one foot and the taxes they're thrown back immediately in Mexico and you're done\nWe're a loophole in the law that says your ... from Central America Asia Africa and you're making do America no matter how you get her legally or illegally and you claim refugee status for political purposes but then you begin in the hearing process that takes three to ten years\nSo and look the Democrats agree to do this\nNo changing the law will happen\nI mean Trump God Bless them I Love him he can tell tell all he wants\nBut you cannot stop twenty thousand people or twenty million people from flooding our southern border from Central America\nClaiming refugee status they have no shots they have no medical Clarence them no financial support they have no work skills that we need most interested in the third grade education and there's nothing we can do to stop them unless the Democratic party agrees\nAnd what made you think they're ever going to agree\nWell I mean at some point maybe they're going to put the national interest on their own political interests is that my pipe dream yeah no it won't happen\nNow that's why I feel bad I feel terrible yeah\nYeah I mean the president really is extremely limited in what he can do and his that that is to try to get the Mexicans to stop them in Mexico because once they get to the U.S border they're going to walk you know\nBecause once they get to the U.S border they're going to walk\nYou know five miles outside of the port of entry and they're going to step right over a fence and they're going to be in the United states I don't think that they get apprehended in fact if they see the border patrol they'll run towards them to ask for political asylum and then it's all over\nAnd until we get these detention facilities on the border with these asylum courts as we did in the late Nineteen nineties when Central American or pulling this a stick with us till we get that back\nIn turn these cases around and get these asylum loopholes a a close we are going to be stuck with this mass\nWell I I I don't know I'm filled with hope all the time but I yeah I Love Mexico says to the Trump bring the United States Army one or two or three miles into Mexico\nAnd politically that would be the death knell of the Mexican president if he allowed American Soldiers on the Mexican territory that ain't gonna happen and the other thing is not going to happen at the Mexican president was elected\nAnd I just recently under an open borders policy in what she wants free flow of information I don't know what we can do other than bitch complain and moan and at the end of the day the Democrats aren't going to agree to this and so unless they get\nHammered at the at the ballot box and Nancy Pelosi goes down hard a week from Tuesday and\nThe Democrats get hurt in the Senate ... ... ... we don't need we need about ten Democrats United States senators\nTo get the same treatment that Central American that we give the Mexicans\n... which means they're here illegally immediately or send back they'll have to go through a hearing process the liberal activists attorneys are there are the news media is their Kamala Harris and all the rest are just loving it and the goal David right there thinking strategically as make taxes a deep\nBlue state in a bad happened that Republicans are D. U. N. and done\nWell you know ... it's a great political strategy if you're a Democrat because they're scaring American to weigh less than writes your only option left as to import\nFuture citizens and they're going to do that from central in Latin America\nAnd you know perhaps that explains why they're sitting on their hands while we have caravans cut of tens of thousands of people coming towards our southern border this needs to actually be stopped by Congress until then Trump can build his wall\nHe can uh put up a the types of a deterrent that we have on the border to house families together get their asylum cases turned around quickly and then start working on the seven hundred thousand case backlog of a sigh leaves who are currently in the U.S\nYou know huge problem you know you have to have the political will to do it you have to have the infrastructure to do it in the United states has to be serious about a closing these asylum loopholes\nWell the Democratic party will not let\nThe Republicans be serious about it in the mainstream media coverage is only as women with children marching the outdoor feet they don't they don't get over the massive rape so these women by the image Thirteen gangs imbedded they don't cover the one to two thousand dollars paid\nJust jak picky when it whether it's sponsored by cable line partly cloudy today only partly sunny tomorrow and mostly sunny on Tuesday expect a little forty tonight and oppress the quad cities that high tomorrow Seventy one eye on his face sixty six\nFifty for tax for cotton with with a high on Monday eighty Seventy four on Tuesday have a great Sunday\nOn link Eli for the talk of the city is eleven thirty AM Ninety nine point nine and Ninety five point five of them have\nCage you an age community calendar is up next to buy you pick\nBiting or you the proud owner of an unwanted vehicle is taking a room where you'd like to plant a garden or is it in a spot where you just like to watch your own beer bring it to you and we'll pay cash on the farm even come\nAnd pick it up this area you pick it up and we are now accepting all scrap metal brings your unwanted scrap metal and on one of the vehicles gain some space and some cash were open seven days a week two locations Prescott valley in Flagstaff are on line a hazy dot com\nI'm telling you take your community calendar Thursday the first the new reverse mortgage how it works and what it can do to free the connection presentations immune to want to shepherd the health Lutheran Church in Prescott RSVP that seven seven eight thirty seven forty seven\nAbout health care offering free pancake breakfasts for our veterans and appreciation of their service five dollars for non better in Saturday November tense at the senior center engineer valley\nThe artist downsizing and they're facing a connection speakers bureau presentation workers next Thursday November aid from the new one it practically Christian Church or CDs or appreciated to seven seven eight thirty seven forty seven\nMinutes regroup and trade Eliezer in churches sponsoring their annual holiday crops and they failed it Saturday November third from nine to three at trinity's hall of God's word building on Valerie drive in Prescott valley for more information call seven Seventy eighty eight forty five\nThis Saturday set the table at the food drive down the salvation army ...

talk about that idea tonight with two very sharp minds gas to been thinking about these questions and subjects on a higher plane than most of us\nYou know we talk about other dimensions parallel realities on this program all the time about beings from other worlds about ... dimensional time travelers dimensional portals\nWe all kind of take it for granted sometimes that all those ideas are real or at least we think we understand that\nIt wasn't always that way for people though how do we get to this point and what does it mean for us if there are other dimensions does it mean there are people in those other places and if so can they get here\nOr maybe they're us these are heading topics but we have a great guess to help us get our heads around them Christopher white earned a PHD and religious studies from Harvard He's written a brilliant book called other worlds spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions\nWhich takes a look at how our understanding of the world around us an unseen worlds\nSuch as the future or heaven or other dimensions habit ball or how it reconcile science and spirituality and makes room for\nExotic subjects that kind of things we discuss on this program near death experiences out of body experiences ESP deja vu what happens to us when we die for Halloween\nWhen spirit supposedly roam around among us so I figured this might be a good fit Dr white has written an entertaining and provocative masterpiece and I'm really looking forward to him joining us in the second half of the program coming up a bit later\nFirst though we welcome back intrepid investigator and prolific writer Nick Redfern\nHas many of you know Nick has traveled the world digging into strange tails and dark legends and all too true conspiracies and I wanted to get them back for a pre Halloween discussion\n... and I wanted to get them back for a pre Halloween discussion about a massive\nCompendium he put together the titles says it all the monster book he's got every monster you can imagine not Hollywood versions although some of them\nMaterial to make that sort of determination but it's a you know I think the the idea of extinction was that may actually not be extinct could actually applied to a number of these so called ... she says that cold\nAnd then you get into some real weird ones and ballet and he'll in books like that and written about commonalities with these creatures though maybe the tools that were reported long ago are now being recorded at ease or aliens and it's\nMaybe the same beings that are in different forms are seen through a different culture in prison where you can do on that\nWell yeah I mean I'm a big I'm sort of follower of of John ... particularly and I think one of the things for me at least\nI mean I've you know different people get difference you know responses from from reading his books but from my perspective I I kind of tight the view that he's most important um [noise]\nRevelation they feel like all conclusion was that many of these phenomena seem to be multi connected if you like interconnected and by that you know you have a lot of reports where people have seen big ... creatures and in the same location and timeframe\nA site for example UFO activity I'm the most money point pleasant West Virginia in the sixties um when they were ... when they found was saying soaring around the\nThe skies both point pleasant he'll cut a lot of cancers with the men in black and you are following cancer so I think some of these creatures at least some of the the we're the ones like mocked mine and the dog men and things like that\nI think I'm not even sure that I should fall into the category of crypto zoology ... whole ... entirely sure that they are creatures or animals in the way we understand it\nUm you know when you get reports of saying a big ... machine in a flash of light\nOr you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing\nIt makes me think that we daily with something that's perceived as an animal that night may not be I don't think kale with um someone who is inside fling off white back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people\nJust didn't they just turn their heads I just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle and Dale with the the way the site of these phenomena\nIn this book the book of monsters or several reports early in the book the tuna blend together at least in my head you got ... men go ugh men are we're ... we're a cat she chapters are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen but also a lot of commonalities\nUm or or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different [laughter]\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has changed into a well from a regular person you know that sort of all the [noise]\nThe Hollywood imagery butts the fact that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seem to have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs\nUm I've got a lot I get a lot of reports that I've I've never gone to reports of someone you know literally shape\nShift the like in America might have over in London or anything like that\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that it's the the locations where these dog men talk creatures have said is intriguing very often these\nAncient burial mountains I'm Native American ally and um some of the the the mysterious old mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing rather than just saying that random\nYou had one a wearable case that was from a military base it's not ancient either it's more recent times remember them yes\nYeah they saw some other British a bicycle royal Airforce outcome rate\nAnd are actually was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen seven say and he was I'm an American guy but it's working I'm overseas I've already come right in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of ... which had\nI'm an American presidents this was the height of the Cold War and he he saw that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ...\nAnd ... sort of kind of look like a big foot type creature was it not put five the just the the face was there a difference\nTo how you describe an ape and it was more like a lung muzzle reporting today is very much like a German Shepherd so if you imagine sort of ...\nLike a German Shepherd so if you imagine sort of big ... a date with a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um\nYou know I didn't see any reason why he should you know create a story like federal fabric Ike a story like that he was um I was able to confess I mean it's a background in the mail a tray and he said he just wanted to share the story because they never forgotten about it and it was so it\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instances where people are report these huge dogs I mean right on a pound or the ... you make that that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic cats and the you know you can see All right maybe it's an animal scape from the new or maybe somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the ... uh the u._k. countryside\nAnd some of the encounters have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those start with the the dog when\nWell yeah I mean ... over here you know we have the dog mine which kind of looks like a a dog like animal parts you know clearly is not\nWell in England or the okay we have what I noticed find some black dogs now I'm town of accounting dog who wrote a Sherlock Holmes novel ... to the basket veils actually by his novel on a pre existing legend\nI'm of wanting to face many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k. um that typically a much longer a much larger than regular dogs are faced fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the elections traditions if he were to say one of these um find some black dog she would either made that you would die or you know a close family member or friend would die\nI'm I'm Nick and light that dog my entire often sane at the same places like um crossroads graveyards um places like that in moderation is I've got several um reports of people saying to find some black dogs\nIn the vicinity of stone circles in the u._k. not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but the you know there are many many um smaller\nUm formations around me okay and I've got two cases from Scotland where witnesses saw one of these large black dogs there and like they all ... going back centuries the dog was that one second but then quite literally gum and next second you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what based things are you know back laid out normal dogs I mean all the ice the spirits of\nDogs but once lived um I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know your mind you fight with the\nSpirit of that dog would resemble the dogs by like in real life I'm\n... and then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big cat lived there\nWell now you write in fact I become known as I said I Am big cats\nAnd ... every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the okay now the occasional sort of ask I ask I pay you know from a zoo or menagerie whatever my tax plan a couple of cases\nAnd you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a guy from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the problem is there are these large black cats roaming around the anti which simply by explanation because\nThe Shannon number of reports from the bottom ... went to the top of the top of Scotland needs hundreds every\nNow for that many reports to exist you know that must be anti colonies of these creatures roaming around about is if by a flesh and blood regular animals which not every race or the phenomenon things half the case you\nKnow what we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations in a moment talking with Nick red burn about who's the monster book creatures beat and beans of nature of this could be the rock and roll theme song for Halloween a C.
