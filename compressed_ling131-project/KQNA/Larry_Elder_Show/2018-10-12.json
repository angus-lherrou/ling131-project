is up on Larry Elder dot com please welcome to the program\nSteven Greenhouse [noise] even longtime no here from\nYeah it's good to hear from your thanks for having me\nYou're still starting them up icy or talk to us about I talked to us about what's going on with the California DMV as a result of this motor voter law\nWell you know the DMV it's it's kind of picking on the DMV it's kind of like shooting fish in a barrel I mean DMV\nAre are just a competitor across you know going to the DMV it's like a cross between a bus station and the Soviet red line you know the five six hour wait we have now so what I thought was if we're doing a motor voter\nWhat worse agency could you can you have to ah to deal with this stuff in the department of motor vehicles\nAnd you know no no government agency or that does a pretty good job with databases and the DMV is notoriously awful basically everything it it it does\nSo now we're going to allow the DMV to register voters and this was in a state where and I'm not against having driver's licenses for for non citizens just for practical reasons but it you could just see the problem coming right and I wrote a column for the union Tribune\nAre back in two thousand and Fifteen when this was proposed and of course accused of of being racist or by now we see all these sorts of problems so we've got a thousands of a\nA voter registration so you know the the DMV reported last month at a big twenty three thousand voter registration errors resulting from\nWhatever they they blame it on other Fifteen hundred ballots are potentially a you know mistakenly registered by the DMV\nOr the DMV insists that no illegal or legal immigrants have as a gotten them but it looks like some potentially some non citizens that are gotten these these dollars and then the the LA Times look at a software that either may have been Seventy seven thousand voter records that were misreported\nSeventies that well she always use me Seventy seven thousand\nSeventy seven thousand that were misreported to the DMV and some cases allowing duplicate valid in other cases um the envy seems to inexplicably have changed the party registration of some voters\nSo we've just we've just got a total mess\nAnd uh you know it's become it's a big enough scandal that even the Democratic controlled California somewhat of a scandal or\nA you know again the DMV insist that uh you know a legal\nResidents voted or whatever but you know it's really hard to uh it's really hard to trust trust what they're doing\nAnd this comes against the backdrop of you know with the ... id law which is the federal law mandating you know new driver's licenses to where people provide a you know our information so that the security go on airplanes\nWe've got these enormous backlogs and the DMV he's had these huge commercial license backlogs of the drivers\nWould go through school they get they get a job and then it would take months for them to get a commercial license just because the DMV process so how do you allow these folks\nTo be in control of a voter records\nAnd then the law when it was passed in two thousand uh Fifteen or the big problems with um you know it had some amendments to it\nUm where you're not a lot where really limited the ability of the secretary of state to check out the\nImmigration status of the U.S the person\nUh you know who who is being register and in the law said if a person as a quote if a person who is eligible to vote becomes registered to vote by operation of the California or new voter motor voter program\nThat person's registration shopping presumed to have been affected with official authorization and not the fault of that person so if you accidentally get\nRegistered and you're not eligible to be registered to vote it's presumed that it's not your fault so it's just we're just looking for trouble right\nSteven Greenhouse gases article surprise DMV may have registered non citizen voters or even I was not in favor of illegal aliens getting driver's licenses and I was called a racist you are in favor of illegal aliens giving drivers' licenses and you're called a racist so I'm not quite sure what\nThat right yeah that exactly I mean the libertarian at I'm not you know my views on on immigration are really quite you know quite a towards I lean towards bloody as many people and that's\nAs possible uh provided they follow some rules so I'm not exactly you know some kind of immigration restriction is yeah I I I get to that we all get it right\nNow uh again if somebody who's an illegal alien inadvertently gets registered to vote and he or she votes what happens to that person\nWell according to the law nothing nothing zoom that a\n... and less and less I guess you'd have to prove that they can show will fully or by you know they basically when I pass the motor voter laws and I am against those in general because a lot 'cause you can't go through the trouble of of the minor process of registering\nThat maybe you're not uninformed voter and maybe you're not to be voting ... and the state the state's low turnout we're very low turnout it's caused by a lot of things that have

A. R. A. dot com most\nMike bearer B. A. R. A. dot com story that's been all around the planet over the last several days as he seems to be getting even worse now the Turkish government\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on a trip when one of the indicators market the last two days has really taken it on the ... the concept is it just panic or ... what's happening\nWhat will will to things in and actually they both were laid back to the good old Donald hum last week you saw 'em treasury bond you know the yields on on the risk free ten and thirty year bonds shoot\nUp I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this would happen we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks up above through three point two percent\nIt's probably going to go to four point three percent in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and higher or lower it so that was the first thing that but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean is this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be cheating in a lot of ways by\nChina's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing\nAnd now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh\nIf China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a worldwide a downturn and crash and so so it was rising interest rates\nAnd um and then more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about for the last month at twenty six forty\nI'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I had this kind of limp\nRally for years and has been waiting to go back and we said look it breaks twenty six forty that that's a sign that China is starting to go down again\nAnd it it did that in the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign that there's something wrong and then again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking oh it's just more interest rates no the interest rates was the first black\nThese last two days had a lot more to do with China and Trump is really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways\nAnd Trump has been boosting the economy would tax cuts and all this sort of stimulus and stuff\nAnd that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes grows to go up temporarily and what is the Federal Reserve going to do they're going to raise interest rates that's what they do it the economy's overheating they raise interest rates if it's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous\nAnd and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I created this great thing in the trumps wrecking at no this was predictable he's not you know he's got some you know gut feelings we gotta do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences\nOf things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pulled back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose one happening like you were you in a couple more D's downturns tomorrow we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people started saying there's something wrong\n[noise] yes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this or the beginning of the year markets peaked in late January\nReal kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough we had a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent and different markets but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped to write about here you know where we are now and then it kind of like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude\nWhat happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay this things over and they start selling and shorting to market\nIt happened very quickly you'll see you know I've seen this the last seven stock bubbles throughout the history of everything from the Nikkei and the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash and and every other one in the last century including the tech correct in recent bubbles\nThat first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two and a half\nMonths with people get whacked\nThat's the sign that that's the only way you know that the bubble has finally birth the problem is by the time that comes\nPeople already in trouble and they're panicking and they get whacked hard so but there's a danger signed as if we keep going down and and and literally I the markets do look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just the balance after you know fourteen hundred point\nAfter you know fourteen hundred points and may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far but it is bouncing off a critical level we been wanting our subscribers Seventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred twenty five thousand on the ballot\nIf the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders are going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds keep going up\nThat this is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not\nFifty fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy eighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash will happen in the first two to three months typically and bats what make Apple's so dangerous\nUm uh you know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross child wants to be with somebody else what was the secret is well from the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit early\nBecause that's how this ... this was a bubble this isn't a normal bull market\nThe correct so nice staircase manner and goes down bubbles go up dramatically and they crash and and a half the time and they crashed twice a is dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this\nThis is a once in a lifetime of fat and it it the signs the mayor building we've been telling people man this looks like a top here and if it doesn't top here we only get\nThe good part is we can gauge as if we only get a normal ten Fifteen Percent or so correction by the end of the year there were probably good for one more route one more Trump rally into next year before this thing blows but the\nRight now though the odds are shifting towards a it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will be as bad as that time period\n[noise] ... well this was worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George sounded like decades in advance on demographics the baby boom peaking\nAnd then and and causing a down turn off the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries what what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and then their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nLow interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but when we were already too much in debt so we just kind of like went sideways and didn't the laboratory debt emerging countries want on the free and they added sixty to Seventy trillion more\nOn top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world [noise]\nAnd and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble\nChina is slowing and and I like I said they have the biggest that Bob ... of any body and any time in history when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so\nMy view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand I'm recession and the stock crash because they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just build a tub backup with money that was draining this time more debt\nEverything's more stretch the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have wars\nDebt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a\nFifty four per se crash looked for Seventy to eighty percent\nBox absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad here we stay with us we'll talk about that

we have the dot com crash that was a Super Bowl I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in last year and I have\nSix or seven times kind of like the coin bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies were not as well which what were the survivors\nAct in a lot of companies were not as well which what were the survivors little companies like apple and Amazon viewed upon Amazon there oh my God it was\nYou know like a you know a hundred and fifty dollars it now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies and you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued in a bubble like this but they're also\nGo down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down Ninety three percent that ended up beat that was it ended up being the greatest company in the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing so\nThat's the secret and and the other thing is even if the earnings of companies companies are so good that they keep their earnings fly instead of declining\nEvaluations on stock how many times earnings like people will pay thirty times earnings for the typical stock for an hour forty\nIn in sixty or eighty for the best taxed on those collapse just because investors get fearful and saw stock and go down to fifty percent even if its earnings don't decline and then of course most companies' earnings do decline so that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you see you have a secret indicator looking at some of the danger is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know it it's called the smart money\nYou know unless it's not a secret\nWell I Know I Know believe me Wall Street won't do this any way so you don't have to worry but\nBut what what happened that there's the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups stop and then and then when things go down there that wants to jump in and buy when when when they see the old investors are over Boston in stocks over about they're the ones that short for his\nI mean they're in the know and and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks that eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff\nWell they you can measure this action what if there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is the dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes\nI mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions in the futures markets there ahead of everything\nAnd so the market's gonna open down it opens down right at the open or it opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves there may well that's when the dumb money and most people would stop just something to protect themselves that's one of those reactions made that for money\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit in short it or do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour into the clothes so they measure this indicator measures let the smart money is doing versus a dumb money and the smart money\nHas not bought this rally in fact they've been shorting it they've been betting against this rally ever since that bottom February this year after that crap\nNow they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to January top early this year but once that crash happened they have not bought on this rally and it's been one of the steep is declines and smart money buying and that\nHas been a strong warning signal to me in in recent months into our subscribers\nAre you in Puerto Rico new\nI Am in Puerto Rico and I went to hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo where it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here\nAnd Michael both of them similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours in Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable\nUh to watch everything I mean windows blown off all around me you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stop it it's just unbelievable it's like can you know God got angry or something you know and that threw a temper tantrum she'd moved there\nWell I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and collaborate which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has the ... and collaborative two islands that are like St Thomas and St Croix or St John\nAnd and you know no passport to come there and just a U.S territory so I was building a house there in in I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family for many many years had to move from Miami and we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working on this place\nSpending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade than it was when I first started coming\nIn I said to my why don't we move here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality kind of a quarter of the price of South Beach Miami where we're used to live\nAnd and we are now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport which I get to twenty minutes an advance they don't even check your id they just wait to see how you're going to tilt\n... I'm not sure I liked that part well\nIt's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane fly to scenic I'm I'm I leave my condo doing and landing on this island in one hour and once I got down here I realized I could qualify for some tax advantages here\nWhich are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living and the crypto guys are coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses that can qualify there's real strong tax advantages so I'm living much cheaper than a man of great climate I can still fly to New York in four hours director Miami and two hours and then almost anywhere in the east coast is\nNow it's difficult to um coming out your way but I have to go out to California which I just did for a long time that that the long haul now but I tell ya I I like it down here they been in a recession there's no civil unwritten recession for twelve years\nWe're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent here and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\nAnd and I'm just going to see what happens in the next uh so many years\nThe big banks down there\nYeah yeah yeah about in in in Schwab down here I actually love the banks are buying banker popular and Santander are Spanish Banks because this is by origin more as a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but then there are George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service\nSo people either just because they think we're in Zimbabwe or they charge some huge acts and there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special pasta sauce and things like that otherwise man this is a good deal and\nYou know I'm Down here for other reasons but I tell you people ought to be Americans ought to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for for people's kids it's sixty percent lower a\nBoat in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that that they are allowed to vote in our elections\nWill most important they are allowed to freely mover immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good then they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much in that much better job opportunities and\nUs where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities\nAnd then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico\nTo put their kids to colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then sometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving\nTo the United states why\nSixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they ended up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants\nFrom Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people ... why they have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides and he goes\nIt's better to help create good jobs down here the tax advantages rather than just out now subsidize Puerto Rico because the U.S as always always robbing their best people and again it it they're more professional educated people that are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\n[noise] so I Want you to use your impressions on what you think will happen economically over the next year in this country seems to be mired right now here in\nA conflict emotion it's unbelievable I've never seen it this way yeah and I think it's going to affect the economy when\nIt does it's another reason I'm kind of happy to be here and watch what's going on this was a major theme for the first time in his zero our book\nThat they were not just seeing a major boom peak globally and a major bobble and debt bottles and all this de leveraging it and that that's going to make the next couple of years very ... what you dean leverage debt these bubbles burst I mean again somebody's stock account is worth two hundred thousand\nOne day and then a year or two later it's worth fifty thousand you know like what happened I just lost that money and it's not coming back this time in my home was worth three hundred thousand now it's worth a hundred and fifty an underwater and I can't even re fi to take advantage of the lower rates so", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "12"}
