headphones so everybody is it in their own isolation chamber and then I present Emmy sank which is a ... a ... a brain synchronization the kinds of technology\nPlus guided meditation and we do five of these uh day typically\nAnd work with the idea is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state and every person listening in their own isolation chamber through their heads up\nNearly hit like a cubicle or a and a decline or how you know it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad okay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um it's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber\nWhy is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus action\nLike I'm In many ways the same concept behind um the flu chambers exempt in this case you're not ... you're you're in this this controlled unit\nAnd all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like him he sank\nDo you have headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them in a control unit and guide them through these series of exercises\nAnd they don't feel a loner isolated right no that's the idea you are isolated and they don't feel alone because you have they had gone down on you know\nThey they're listening to headphones and exercise minor typically about a Fifteen minutes long each one\nAnd and people go on these incredible journey their friend who's been several times on wet when you get anything fictional technology is minority and when he truly data hate\nYes the idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the fate is of course\nAre ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself by Nora will be technology it's been around for a long time that it helps us to go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go on the eastern where would you and I knew that pattern that you know it's kind of a formula right\nWell there is a yeah so the relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis um there was a different progression setter used\nBut it's basically a meditative type of program that's guided often guided where you would just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experiences during even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance\nPeople have passed fly for aggressions mhm they have contact with all kinds of let's just say a non physical being different kinds\nEverybody has their own type of experience when we open up to her inner self people experience different kinds of ah let's just say ... opening a mind opening\nExpansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experience as a for instance past life or ... or regression type flashes are quite common\nAnd there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore your true self\nAnd to open up to that awakened to that multi dimensional shelf within you\nKnow you have questions to our house and then you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal and you immediately after the exercise you begin the journal whatever in whatever kind of\nInformation may have come to you or imagery because information can be\nOr imagery cause information can be transmitted many different ways\nIt's not necessarily all the boy can be sure imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways\nSo it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information but uh people have all kinds of profound experiences\nAnd may awaken to their their true self and the answer is within them\nMhm yeah so the implication their\nPersonal growth and the spiritual awakening that are happening in these can really be transformational and I like it because you guide your cells to them I mean in a way your\nExperience you William have died in in the direction that I Would have my own personal experience now\nMy friend my other friends who have been a guest on the show before she said that she has in the past encountered\nShows that need help and I think that's fascinating counts a little bit but not\nSure um we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just mediate assistance\nOr that but that will happen in um\nIn all the classes that can happen I that comes up in my class as well where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say to people that are there are people that have died but they are law store\nFor instance someone that may have died um quickly and they were just disoriented and they may need some assistance I Know that that type of thing does happen quite a bit\nAnd I'm at a month that the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focus is on the type of guidance it's called guidelines\nI'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist to others in that um [noise] and to let you say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMhm mhm so to assist him in crossing over have you ever done this after a a tragic incident and national tragic incident where ... is really no one\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences\nUh during nine eleven era\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact ah during that period of time\nUm that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way I imagine you're having coffee one morning and your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're shifting those uh people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process\nIt's done by many around the world and it it's been it's functions and different names and different cultures and other institutes we we presented in\nI think I'm more or let's just say a very grounded in a scientific waves at least the scientific as we can\n... that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical way that's a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really allow the person to have their own experience and all that\nI Want to find out a little bit more about\nWhat are the culture or does this and what it's called another culture going to take a quick break William thank you so much\nAnd when we come back we'll talk about what are their culture and just exist and and also a little bit more on how you can do this on your own on and live with that with my guest William bombing I Am leasing are and you're listening to cook because and\nFind out more about tonight yet logged on to go to go to William dot com\n\nWe allow only\nThank God I found out on no bank I don't eat that program or insurance protects you\nOh title luck will for pennies today oh title ... puts a barrier around your homes title and mortgage the instead it detects tampering there on it helping to shut it down to find out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar shirt free which\nGet your hundred dollar search free with somebody not living at home kind of luck dot com home title luck dot com\n[noise]\n\nWelcome back in ... and Langley cigar and my guest is William Bowman we're talking about out of body exploration and sell some do out of body exploration\nNot to the trauma that to an actual workshop her it sounds fun regulated type is out of body exploration thing and it's also well done very well done it in\nSomething that William boom in his land for almost Twenty years in the ... and then you can do on your own William where what are the culture has this existed in history\nOr Lisa from the very beginning of time I'm Out of body experiences are probably the quintessential I'm\nA way that throughout history people had profound experiences I mean look at a biblical like the revelations begins with I was in the spirit and if you look back through all the biblical text all the transformational type of experiences people\nThere are there consciousness was projected or extended let's say beyond their physical limits and that is in itself\nA form of out of body exploration it shifted to was in two thousand years ago wasn't called that on the way it goes all the way back to ancient Hindu Buddhist text\n'em to every culture and religion known to man if you start to read it objectively you'll see there's comments about this uh I was in the spirit or I was\nBeyond my physical body let's put it that way and there they had this profound experience\nHow can an out of body experience validate life after life\nWell it gives you that infinite number one or two shocker for many people just to be aware of the fact that oh my God I continue its a verification that you continue beyond your body\nAnd that's a that's a ... in itself a big life change or for people it's weakening because then they realize oh my God there's\nI continue there's other things\nThat are that are going on beyond the single experience\nAnd it really opens people's minds to the potential what they are think about it there's um seven and a half billion people on the planet\nAnd people don't have a clue where they're going to death they don't know where they come from before they were born and they don't know really what they are they they assume they're human being because they were they found themselves in the human body mhm but in actuality consciousness\nUh can take on any for I I Know from having out of body experiences encountering all kinds of life forms including by the way animals many people contact a law and love pets six cetera\nDuring our out of body experiences and the pets are having out of body experience the new ones that have come sooner already\nKnow or even the ones that are alive I write about this my first book where my my dog McGregor would would follow me out of body and I also had a cat that would do that ... I mean this this is we're just real events that are happening of fascinating people all over the world\nI mean we're a multi dimensional beans that's what we are and are biological body you know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very brief period of time and then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness\nAnd another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body exploration is that it's multi dimensional and that death is in allusion really you know that's been said but\nOnce you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who have passed\nAnd you're doing this face to face this is life changing\nYou no longer need a psychic the actors the intermediary you you you were in power to discover the answers for yourself and it's really to find out what kind of journey are we all on 'cause this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know what I shared that you can I just interviewed Raymond Moody unlike guy in show and you know the ... the grandfather and clean the term a life after death and um he had\nExpressed to me after Fifteen Years doing\nThat\nHe doesn't know for sure that that yeah life after death because scientifically it's never really been proven even though he's heard thousands and thousands of poor people who live here in his\nLife after life ... ... he still doesn't average scientist as a last ditch and right now I Know for sure this\nIs exactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need\nBooks study research will never give you that kind of verification you can read a thousand books\nYou could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic and it's not going to give you the inside and the verification you'll get\nFrom one out of body experience because suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour and that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards\nI mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\n... and to get away from this bickering and confusion and division I mean once you realize that you're you're not just a biological being you know you're continuing ... and beyond this temporary stage of development\nIt puts everything into a whole different perspective and I'm not the first time I mean this is not the Buddhist have been saying this for a long time that you know we're more than our bodies\nAnd that were involved in beyond the body and we are all life is evolving beyond the body this is a temporary stage of our evolution\nYeah and I meant to say that ... the term near death experience sorry I didn't mean like a afterlife that that's in let's say\nYou know when I did my own Google Search on typed in near death experience in over twenty five million searches come up on Google were not the only ones that are interested in is becoming more and more of a a phenomenon a popular topic people are interested in what\nAnd it can accomplish more interested in what beyond now I have and yeah you know sort of him as here anymore\nI mean you can see it if you were there and you had to think for you you were saying can you use this out is Bonnie ... even if we can you tell us about that\nWell in two thousand eleven I I discovered I had a serious a stage for cancer of the lymph nodes and tonsils and I it was a shock was come on very quickly out a large tumor on my neck\nA yeah lymph nodes in any way that it was a serious issue and I had to get immediate had to make quick decisions on this because it was a you know it spreads I'd ... broken and kept solution\nSo I I went through traditional ah because it was so quick and so fast I did a traditional medicine\nBut um during my recovery\nI was having some really profound out of body experiences and in a sequence of events\nWhich I did not itself initiate by the way these are just spontaneous out of body experiences which I was having why was recovering from cancer ... uh I had the ceiling and experiences and it's difficult to explain this but in one of them I found myself in this\nThis white chew it was like a twelve meter pure square cube was segmented balls I write about this and adventures in the afterlife and I always mentally told was floating in this cube\nAnd I was literally it was healing energy I was bombarded with from every direction", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "14"}
