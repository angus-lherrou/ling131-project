Bad effects\nThe reason we have a legal immigration system is because of medical checks financial checks all kinds of checks to take five to ten years we check everybody out they come in legally they raise their right hand how come the media loves it when a hundred and Seventy five thousand illegals storm our southern border so far this year\nHow does that benefit our country at all what the benefit\nPolitic crisis that they're not going to let go to waste like well I'm a manual set and another thing is a little dog story about this caravan is I think they caught a few dozen known

I don't like\nHow he got to want to look at Bill Clinton was at her high and putting them at record high welfare recipients and now he's like businesses all of this up ... percent I'm I'm\nI'm just looking at the numbers here and I'm like OK Hamilton called racist until he started running like I'll look it up and she'll be looking at what they're offering they're offering me actually filled Beck and where's the socialism ads this again is that just never just never panned out\nAnd it's true I'm ready to call it makes me a libertarian I write a column or the Trump stir and New York city\nFor twenty Thirty years received every award then Al Sharpton and could give him every award Jesse Jackson could give him he he was a humanitarian he was in civil rights act and all of a sudden he's running for the presidency certainly the aged Seventy becomes razors\nAfraid I'm like look in the middle tier life he was caught everybody here we go next to Ahmed Ali and Rosa Parks with the parents around\n... he was a good friend he knows where he was a great friend I'm older and he gave money to Chuck Schumer he gave money to Hillary Clinton suddenly become obese he becomes it's ridiculous\nLobster Oh absolutely and it seems that if we we can bridge that divide and like honestly the Democrats are now they have such a stranglehold on the black community for no reason\n... if we can if we get over that if if we can because like for example if you had horrible historic event didn't watch that the struggle to Japanese into account the ... for that reason [noise] I think it's because I'm an immigrant so it's not exactly something that\nIt was called trade and it's I mean if you go through the public schools I went to a public school the Hitler never talk about a hundred million died on the communist will somehow that history just vantage as and and and I think education is the key I definitely do\nAn average we got to go but I Want you to stay alert stay alive keep preaching the faith in Connecticut it's one of the parts of the country that badly needs the shot of capitalism conservatism the worst run states in America\nAre controlled by the Democratic party and the best run states in America are controlled by the Republican Party but thanks for your call let's continue with more\nI'm going to put a call in or to Corey Lewandowski here in about five minutes see what the campaign manager for Donald Trump for like a year and a half\nAnd I'm going to ask him about the immigration crisis when I look at the Drudge Report tonight which stimuli goal hell's breaking loose and ABC and NBC and CNN thinks this is a vehicle they're going to drive for the next two weeks in two days to bring down the Republicans in Congress and I say all contrary moons prayer I Believe\nThe three reasons Trump got elected with number one the economy number two immigration number three federal judges here's performed magnificently and all three areas\nAnd I think this is the October surprise that will sink the Democratic party come the next sixteen days let's continue with more than one becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven\nComing up in about five minutes from Corey Lewandowski top of the next Darwin Kevin ... near the blacks fear\nTo talk about why he was like oh by Fox and the impact in the black community of illegal immigration good at the bottom of the last hour we're going to have on a report from Peter Wallison who's written a book about the deep safe fourth branch of government which is the bureaucracy\nContinuous more milk hunting him the great American why would you\nI mean do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was no it was appropriate because she was an adult president of the United states and leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior\nCan you imagine for one second that was the the Congress Donald Trump had done that with her during the meeting wouldn't be saying\nYeah they would give them an excuse right away and I'm sure the media was saying well she's an adult no big deal I mean the double standards amazing\nHas always been that way but the American people have seen through it and as you referenced as it relates to Brett those Ninety two percent of the media coverage of this president negative and now I Would accept that if we were in the middle of twenty five percent unemployment a national crisis\nAll over the place for nobody working and the country would have been in the wrong direction growing at point zero zero percent I Would expect that but we're not we are we are now back up on top where the most competitive country in the world again\nFor the first time in ten years and there is no credit for what the president's done let alone but twenty in Americans who've been held hostage in other countries\nThat he got returned not one plane loads of cash to our palette loads of money but on his own sheer when we don't forget these people back you know you saw the pastor come back just a week or so ago and\nYou know that was a blip on the radar screen\nThe president has gotten twenty Americans\nEither in North Korea or an Egypt or wherever they have been home that's part of his job and he gets no credit for that but in the mainstream media bronco bottle would have been in line for another Nobel Peace prize\nWell let's talk a little bit about what's happening in Honduras in Guatemala there's at least three thousand the numbers are growing coming from a Honduras through Guatemala into Mexico and the mainstream media hates this kind of an issue percolating a little over two weeks from the from the election because\nIt reminds the American people one of the main reasons Trump was elected wants to curtail illegal migration from Central America and Mexico into our country\nThere is no I like Google this information is not a hundred and fifty million Mexicans Guatemalans Hondurans in El Salvador and hundred and fifty million now like to come to America if you throw in Venezuela and Colombia maybe Peru\nA Europe wide Paraguay I were talking to a hundred and fifty million\nCentral and south Americans would love to come to America at what point is enough is enough and the mainstream media does not want to call it illegal immigration they talk about refugee status they talking about the factors moms and dads and children there in strollers\nHowever uh four or five months ago I fell off the couch one night I'm watching sixty minutes and sixty minutes did a report on the reality of our southern border\nHundreds a dead body are found in the deserts of northern Mexico because men are killed\nBecause they will become drug meals and that when these individuals' paying MS Thirteen literally millions of dollars to transport them from Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Mexico into America when this is funding in fueling MS Thirteen dry to make literally hundreds of millions of dollars\nEvery county so to speak they pass through in Mexico has a drug war ... somebody in charge of that county and that men have got to pay with money and women have to pay their bodies\nAnd sixty minutes made the point that the majority of young girls and women are raised on the way\nFrom Central America to to the United states and when it's report it which is not done by the mainstream media but then there's been extremely dangerous route that men are murdered and that women are raped and brutalized all the way up Fifteen hundred miles\nAnd then when they get a new American ... they're not released to many times you work in a brothel and on and off you go to Baton Rouge or working abroad or if you're a man\nHe says you stand on street corners to sell drugs which is paying back you're trying to the ... there was one report on sixty minutes about the reality of what the Democratic Party's encouraging and it was disgusting why don't we have more media coverage Corey Lewandowski campaign manager for some\nOf the reality of what happened to the men and women incentivized to come to this country because what happens to them as soon as possible that the Democratic party should be held accountable for some of this why does the media cover it objectively\nThe media doesn't want to tell the real story they want to pretend that the only people who are coming to this country the porn impoverished that are seeking asylum and and look we're the greatest\nCountry in the world and not only do they kill hundred and fifty million people from South and Central America want to come here people from all over the world want to come here but we are not a country if we can control our borders or I don't want a Reagan said you know Thirty years ago we are the greatest country in the world and the greatest privilege we can get somebody to make them a citizen\nAnd everything in one way to do that but just coming in and storming the borders doesn't work but your point is much more important\nWhat takes place with these people and make this track from Honduras through Mexico and ultimately up to the U.S border in\nGusting display of gangs\nThat take advantage of these people they raped women they kill them and and you're exactly right\nEven if they have the opportunity to make it into our country illegally and those people aren't free and we have to do something about human trafficking we have to make sure that that doesn't continue to the best way to do that is you build a wall on the southern border and you say it make it to the United states you know not\nWater and you say it make it to the United states you want to make it into our country and they were they process to come here and you follow the process we're a nation of laws\nAnd we don't do as a Republican Party has to make sure that the immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have all the tools necessary to apprehend people coming across the border illegally\nI don't like the Democrats want to be fun and illegitimate wise men and women who serve an ice everyday that protect us from the animals of MS Thirteen and those gangs\nCorey Lewandowski why do the Democrats want this because there can be no change in the law\nUntil ten or so United States senators who are Democrats agree to that change which is build the wall brings insanity I think we need temporary workers to come and go when you come you or do we know who you are\n... we have a big law with lots of doors in it and every legitimate person wants to come here to to work whatever ought to be able to do it but the ... the byproduct of that would it be do eliminate drugs a heroin and math in Cincinnati in\nAustin in Tampa in Milwaukee\nBy by doing it makes it more difficult for drugs to come in more difficult for him is Thirteen what is the real reason the Democratic party does not won control of the southern border\nMe because they love the political issue and they don't want to resolve the issue look\nThis president went out and say you give me the money for the wall and all the people that are here through no fault of their own which arguably called the dream where they came in through no fault of their own I Will give them the president said\nPathway to citizenship that was a long way to go for conservatives to be very honest with you know a lot of consternation when he made that statement but he gave the Democrats exactly what they've\nArgued they've wanted for a long time\nAnd they said no we're not going to give that to and they want to have the political football they want to continue to make sure that the people coming across the border\nIllegally and going to sanctuary cities in century said have the opportunity to vote we now see this in Texas and we see in other places that they are targeting individuals who are not us citizens and asking them to go and vote and they are\nBought and sold by the Democratic party was illegal immigrants coming in here and they want to keep\nThat flow to continue it doesn't make sense to me is our\nFirst obligation to the people in this country to make sure they are safe and secure and we\nAbsolutely need immigration during jobs that we need them to come and fill on a temporary basis but you're exactly right he come through the system your check you are authorized to come in you pay whatever fair share it is there is either vacation and and when your job is done you go back to your country and that's how it works that that was always work\nAnd we just need to do a better job and forcing that\nCorey Lewandowski Leslie there's been some speculation that Hillary Clinton\nIs making a run in twenty twenty you know I think Hillary Clinton did a great job as first lady she was a wonderful United States senator she was a fabulous secretary's day and she was a wonderful candidate for the Democratic party in twenty sixteen I Would encourage her to run\nI Would help her get signatures maybe raise some money for would you encourage Hillary Clinton to become the Democratic party's standard bearer standard bearer and twenty twenty when you do a great job\nWe we're in love is looking to electoral votes two years ago that number is only going down she wouldn't be for the greatest loss of an election since Ronald Reagan's reelection effort when he destroyed his opponent and I think Donald Trump would end up with north of four hundred and\n... you know trying to beat her by\nSeventy four electoral votes and what your listeners remember but then when they woke up one election they have twenty sixteen in New York Times and all of those mainstream media outlets and Hillary Clinton as in Ninety nine percent chance of winning today Ninety nine percent when we get to more than that only two people in my ballot\nSo I Want her to run I run we want to go back through all of her email scandal all over the money that she's gotten from foreign governments when she was secretary of state in the Clinton Foundation and all the fact that she's lost her security clearance let's go re litigated all let's put it back in front of the Democratic party\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nWe're above\n\nBy choice who fail to shelter serving a double life choices out some man to die if you leave you with another one but two smart [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThe one in the [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] I totally\nCutting and the great American my friend in your Kevin Jackson the blacks sphere is in trouble\nA couple of weeks ago he uh referred to some of the sexual assault accusers\nBrett Kavanaugh unquote lying gangs unquote and he was fired more or less immediately by Fox News but somehow I think Kevin Jackson we'll survive he did quite well before they're so bad he's doing quite well now\nHe'll do quite well after this event and Kevin Jackson once again welcome to the bill Cunningham show cabin our you know are you doing OK you've been beaten bloody done bad are you doing OK after\nWhat happened and Fox yeah man I thought I've got plenty of opportunities out there well\nYou know the thing I found amazing about your circumstance is that you said tempered things compared to what others have said about Trump himself for what CNN contributors regularly say about drawing board you know a liar and he's a rapist and a lines gang would be minimal\nDefinition to ratchet they're they're used by the president strikes\nThat happened to him all the time it every\nDay I was protecting Kavanaugh and not protecting him I was just standing up for men's rights\nThey called it the guy races in worse yet they called him a serial rapist and you call women line gangs that would accuse a man with that pedigree from doing it and Fox does that offend sensibility as well you know screw you\nIt's been serial rapist so much worse term than line gangster if you're going to fire somebody for using bad language isn't serial rapists for a father and has been in a kind of life that brand\nFor a father and her husband in a kind of life that Brett it's been a lot worse to use that kind of like the bad language get somebody fired on the totem pole of bad language and I think serial rapists it'd be near the top\nNo doubt and uh but I have to the question differently because Howard Stern with lamb Kooning me on his show in a Robin quiver and I said yeah Well Howard I'd really like you know I wrote an an an article about it I really like you to tell me what you call somebody who accused you of being a not only a rape is put a serial rapists\nAnd essentially a person uh that that would be despicable and in any way shape way shape or form\nWhere it can impact not only your life your beer ... year career but it can impact your marriage chicken impact the relationship you have with your daughter's a relationship with your friends\nThat are given me or somebody who lived about that and people take it seriously tell me scanned kids hard enough for it because I'll tell you this\nWhere I'm from that is not hard enough now\nAnd and the real world it's not that bad um award and kill bacteria three weeks and all that was going on in right now is on the Supreme Court I guess are you going to do well and all that kind of stuff\nBut to love pulled out of there a bag of tricks every conceivable die drive to bring him down\nThe Kanye West Africa right now you're a conservative black male which is extremely dangerous Kanye West is radioactive according to media he he's a conservative now black male who ah five six years ago said that George Bush wants to kill\nA wants to kill black people but now he's flipped the other direction how\nDangerous in America today is a conservative black male\nSuper dangerous and a ... I don't know what he is I mean I called him a pragmatist because he's he's going to live his life on his terms and that's a good thing but we're very dangerous I mean\nThat's why when I made my comment these these these farms that go after you have to be hard they had to get me out at Fox and Fox a blight but they don't understand it made me more power from my voice actually grew\nWith that we not just black males that black women to black women are going to be a major factor in his black people in general\nBecause they're getting it and that's a scary prospect I mean they're talking about Trump having now getting into the forty percent of blacks now for port him\nKanye West has a ... awake and many young hip hop the people who weren't paying attention to politics vote or not they're going to start speaking out and saying you know what I agree with what he said so very dangerous powerful movement developing and I'm Glad to be on the tip of the spear of it\nAnd I'll say this a TI not someone I listen to or watch at all these kind of a has been rocky\nStart by all the publicity\nHe's got Maloney a Trump look alike stripping in the oval office taken her clothes off performing sex act highly\nAbout to drop an album\nYeah I mean I can you Kevin jak no one to two years ago some countries are their parents Michelle Obama stripping in the oval office and performing sex acts on the desk of the president kind of like a link or do they\nDo play these exercises just flip the script to ask yourself a question like that what is it that's the scenario every single time what would have happened at Brock Obama had recommended Brett Kavanaugh\nWould have happened in which some of the players and you get the answers were principled we're not that we will win intimate times but I don't want to get in twenty twenty that's why we're winning because we finally got people recognizing that principle and character matters again\n... ... and this an unrelated but it's related to what I've seen some of your stuff on crime statistics a day after eleven people were shot in Baltimore the troubled police department said it's shutting down administrative functions\nAnd putting on the streets two hundred and thirty more police officers because too many blacks are killing too many blacks and hunting and Baltimore and I'm reading the story thinking well this isn't a big story because it doesn't fit doesn't\n[noise] doesn't fit hey I made a movie about a bleeding blue movie dot com absolutely stunning movie had police crying in the lobby saying thank you for telling our story and look this is playing out across America not Baltimore Baltimore it's all over\nCleveland Cincinnati in Detroit it to wherever you want and the problem is it's not going to change because of the players remain the same\nAnd the media will not cover the slaughter\nOf literally eight thousand black men every year in America they'd rather cover a Saudi\nWho was killed in ... rather than ten thousand black men killing ten thousand other black men and the policies that indirectly allow it Kevin Jackson we've got to go the blackberry your wonderful you always have a home area you're a great American\nAnd once again thanks for coming on the bill Cunningham show and my brother stay strong they will you to\nBless America let's continue with more Kevin Jackson the blacks very imagine a music depiction of Michelle Obama\nVery imagine a music depiction of Michelle Obama stripping in the oval office naked and performing sex acts how would the media react to that with

will turn down regulations of um of administrative agency and we can actually get in to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time to that hot summer in Philadelphia and Seventeen Ninety seven article one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that the Congress the house in the Senate\nOr the most powerful instruments ... government because the best reflects the will of the people in reality at least for the past fifty years\nIt was perceived Congress is number one\nWas perceived the president is number two and they and the court system is number three in reality number one is not the Congress one might say it's the President's Day is the most powerful number two is the current number three is the Congress the Congress\nIs feckless foolish shouldn't irrelevant and and so what would it founding fathers saying if they were transported from Seventeen Ninety seven to twenty Eighteen and October twenty Eighteen and they looked at the situation today what when that Congress is foolish in fact\nI think they would be amazed\nAmazed but when they studied it for a while I think they would understand why this happened and I think the reason is that the courts have given administrative agencies not the president actually at the ministry of Asian which even the president doesn't control and they'd given administrative agencies\nSo much authority by passing laws that are very very general that are sort of goals oriented laws and that gives the agency's\nTremendous authority to make the major decisions that they should not be making Congress should make the major decisions the agencies should only be filling in the details\nAnd and unfortunately overtime because Congress has because the courts had not stepped in to stop this\nCongress has been encouraged to pass these very general laws\nThen they go home to their constituents and they say you see I solve this problem for you and when the constituent complains about some new regulation that's come out the congressman says oh well I didn't vote for that that the administrative agency\nAnd what the what the constituent unfortunately doesn't recognize is that the congressman has to take responsibility has to be accountable for that because the congressman did not vote for legislation that restricted\nThe independent agency in what it was a boy or what it was able to produce the laws with just two general\nAnd what will happen now if the court access I Hope they will add is that they will begin to look carefully at the underlying statutes and say if you did not have this authority you know he will not given this authority by Congress so you cannot make this rule that goes beyond what Congress intended\nAnd of course one of the things came up during the um during the hearings and the confirmation\nBrett Kavanaugh a couple of weeks ago was the fact that uh the United States Congress exceedingly weak and that really are because they're so weak the liberals the progressive want to use the court system do impose like legislation on we the American people because they're so unpopular\nWhether it's gay marriage or abortion or whether it's immigration whatever it is there are certain things that are so unpopular in America\nAnd the Congress or foolish in fact was therefore they look toward the court system to be a second legislature and that was never intended by anybody in fact one might argue to go back to your original point the administrators state is more powerful than the United States Congress and might be more powerful and the most powerful branch of government is ... is the administrator state\nSomething called the deep state that have been in existence for years if not decades and what they want to do is simply outlast as president\nAnd outlast the court and continue to exist so is the administrator straight right now more powerful than the Congress\nYeah I think undoubtedly it is it is making the rules that uh we live under and Congress was supposed to do that\nAnd there is a way to address that as I say and I think it's the courts where to step in\nAnd read the statute as they were written by Congress they would be able to say to administrative agencies you have gone too far and to the extent that they do that we have some control over the administrative agencies and the effect that will be\nTo force Congress to begin to act because if what the administrative agency has done something\nThat the American people would like\nAnd the courts have said no you weren't given that authority by Congress the American people will then go to Congress and say we want legislation that does remain is um if it's something they didn't like then Congress won't be pressured and the agencies\nWill will not be able to make the rule anyway but the point is we're a democracy and in a democracy the people's views should prevail and that's not what's happening and the under the current law system\nAnd give me an example one through four or five years ago Obama was saying look I'm the president I'm not the grand potent than I Am not the dictator I cannot give dreamers certain rights to be in this country because the laws against that\nMy mother time a president or run away president in my view Obama was a runaway president when it came to legal immigration and he just created new laws out of us out there that had nothing to do with the Congress and by the time that gets up to the United States Supreme court and takes one to three years to even get there\nAnd in the meantime the dreamers have done with the dreamers are going to do and you may like or dislike what Obama is doing but at the president is set that through the eyes or I N s\nThe president can do anything you want why why can't the next president doing anything anyone in other words it isn't a substance it it's a rule making ability or the administrators state that ... that have been they've usurped their power that Congress\nYeah well you're you're correct as long as the courts and I'm here speaking principally the Supreme Court does not act one Supreme Court lays down the rule you know um that says\nIf the as we are going to be reading statute ... as they were written\nA then it gives all kinds of people who are who would like to challenge administrative rules or even presidential decisions an opportunity to go right into the district court and get a ruling and what we've seen in the last year\nMany times is district courts have been making rulings against the Trump Administration and the reason they are able to do that is that the Supreme Court has not as not\nIs that the Supreme Court has not as not placed any kinds of strict limitations on what the court can do in fact\nWhat the what the Supreme Court has done in this so called Chevron case centrally said to the to the court you should defer to what the administrative agency and they were putting their own laws yeah\nAnd that of course has given them license to do whatever they want you know I have to stop\nI took home your book last night to to read a ... page Ninety four I don't you have a chart beginning in Nineteen Ninety three which was not a long time ago I made like twenty five years Clinton was in the White House doing what Clinton do the White House\nBut uh Nineteen Ninety three there were four thousand three hundred and sixty nine or rules forty ... rules which you know it's a lot well and twenty Seventeen the cumulative final rules published in the federal register as a hundred and one thousand\nThree hundred and eighty so we go from forty three hundred under Clinton\nOne hundred and one thousand three hundred and eighty and it's like ... at the right at three to four thousand new rules every year and bought a time another ten years go by it'll be two hundred thousand rules\n[noise] well that's entirely possible the way things are going right now of course a hundred thousand a hundred and one that that is cumulative number since Friday since Nineteen Ninety three right um but it yes it will continue to go on three thousand four thousand rules in any year\nBecause there is no discipline on the agencies right now because of the Chevron decision will Nineteen eighty four and because there isn't any a ruling from the Supreme Court says\nCongress cannot pass to the agencies its own legislative power that's a violation of the separation out of our in our costs\nI Want to share the American people want on the thought on page Ninety five you say one recent study found that the cumulative cost of regulations between Nineteen eighty and twenty twelve which is why they uh thirty two year period\nReduce American economic growth by\nOver twenty five percent which amounts to annually Thirteen thousand\nPer person in America annually and so this is gigantic it's huge it's growing and the only entity that can truly stop it and the president can't stop it that Congress could stop it but there are photos and feckless individuals the only entity in the world that can stop it is not state Supreme Court\nBecause can you imagine our economy twenty five percent larger because a ridiculous rules and regulations in the middle of the fact one other one thousand three hundred and eighty it's now October twenty Eighteen I assume another three thousand role is going to go into effect\nSo unless Brett Kavanaugh and other four justices said this is unconstitutional it will continue what we got to run\nAnd Peter Jay wall is in the book is judicial fortitude the last chance to rein in the administrators state and Peter thanks for coming on the bill Cunningham showing you are a great American\n[laughter] thank you bill\nGod Bless God

have subjects I guess tonight that are both\nEntertaining and waiting both will challenge what you think you'd know about two very different subjects\nIn the second half the night a story that involves incredible acts of heroism treasury\nIncompetence and sheer terror it is the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history\nThe sinking of the USS Indianapolis it's taken more than fifty years for the full story to emerge from behind and official wall of secrecy and blame to remarkable journalists have worked for years to tell the whole story\nI was totally blown away by their book it takes you right there into the water with the sailors as they struggle to survive shark attacks and the elements for days and days wow what a story a coauthors Lynn Vincent and Sarah ... will be here to share what is already a runaway best seller of the book\nBut first I had hinted last month when ... was here that he had something else in the works\nI'm not sure when the guy sleeps but he returns to the program coming up and just a few minutes and in a sense he is returning to his roots you know the first time he was on coast to coast I Believe it's ten years ago to discuss his first book the ... project was a typical day ... boots on the ground investigation\nThis time of the big butt legend a day but spent two years among the ... tribe to hear their tails and legends and to apply police and forensic methods to figure out what was being seen in the forests of the Pacific northwest\nAs it turns out of course similar sightings have been reported all over the world and wild Dave is better known these days for his investigations are missing people\nHe's never stopped thinking about or working on the big mystery and it's an IT is back with a book that's a great resource for anyone interested in this subject it traces the sasquatch story through newspaper reports and historical records\nThat name big for it has been around as we know since Nineteen fifty eight but the big guy himself has been around much longer than that these stories go way\nSo has it been around much longer than that these stories go way way back centuries along with related stories a wild man and giants and we're happy to welcome date back to the program\nTo talk about his original investigation and where it's led that's coming up momentarily\nI'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth and every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big story in Hooper that live ... miles away who saw one coming into town\nI started to think about my police days and they used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and uh he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements\nAnd the results were amazing but I wanted something that a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting and Native Americans and I found a diamond didn't believe all Bullock\nAn individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained for the state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met in right away we just quick like brothers\nAnd when Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery and draw the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey drew the sketch of a suspect that is how accurate this man has\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes they immediately accept\nAnd Harvey and I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends\nWe did two books than Hooper project and then we took a follow up book called the tribal Bigfoot where he went outside of Hooper and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd I'm kind of how it started\nOr you say you don't have a dog in the fight meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo uh when I started\nThe most vocal the most audacious the most vulgar are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demeaning you they will do anything to push that cause\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kind of went down that path thinking well it must be in a must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around hoop and drew the sketches Harvey myself an arby's wife Gina proud also an agent for in Oklahoma we were sat in stunned disbelief\nBecause the sketches were very human like yeah they were huge yacht I had hair all over the body that there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss and they didn't look like apes they didn't have that\nApe characteristics that you would think of in a face in a chest et cetera and I was just shocking and when the witnesses saw the sketches\nTo a lady into a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it takes the exactly what you look like and when you talk about the older they would consistently say this is another type of people is on animals these are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with them at least a college since right\nYeah it in the tribal area to one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nA and they said so that they looked at a map they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see him\nWondering about the hoop areas the trinity river like great salmon and steal headed area a has just so much wildlife and if you drive through hoop uh from willow creek you'll\nAnd if you drive through Hooper from willow creek\nYou'll notice that there are more Barry bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains that I've ever seen anywhere in the world and there's this association with berries and ... over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I\nI Know that they're seen eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nYou or I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law man as a former law man at the state of the evidence about this whether you'd say there is that there is there sufficient evidence that something is real here or that we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path I knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life\nAnd there were series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said yeah we were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you for that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a ah a PHD name Melba catch them\nAnd Dr catch him was one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs tissue blood et cetera that we bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America the test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many more were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA\nAnd then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood saliva and all of this Melbourne work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this DNA\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA and what the showed was that the ... went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the female side\nTo the ... Arab region to Jerusalem to\nA Jordan into that part of the world and this was when I was sent to a gym bag and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in this\nAnd unbelievably ... came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her white a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was ... than a crime lab completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this these samples could have been compromised yet as the paper was written before I get there so they right there in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't do this\nBut you and I work together to introduce Melba too of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her in here explained to her a proper way to go about this\nShe listen to some of this but you didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper but if you extract all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly\nWith the science which people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people I've never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth\nThe reality is that when you sit with a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten samples Phyllis tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big wild man and giants Harry noon and night night I mean big what ... hair tickets to the break\n\nYou\nKnow\nKnown meal\nIt went through so many hurdles it was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see them on TV and they said oh you know the DNA is comeback of bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that no but did that most researchers and then a so called experts are not doing right now is that when the hair samples came in they went ...\nWhen the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to the NA to ensure that they came back as big foot her now people are saying going to say well how do you know that's big for their well ... looks different than any other mammal hair in the world\nAnd I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America and when you look at a big but here it's an entirely different\nSo if if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle it never went on to DNA\nBut if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using their hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the real deal\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that Melba ... to extract this DNA and to get the results\nAnd there's a lot of there's a lotta attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes\nThat's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's going to like to UFO world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very turf conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes their take their passion to different levels\nUm to the point of Gillette material um and ah\nWill stab people in the back end will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence ... ... at a minimum um people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's humid\nBut it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part of a second says it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with a human match on gender thing and when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours\nAnd how could that be um we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and\nIt was kind of surmise that say a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart because it appeared that ... was trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something\nAnd when he broke the PVC pipe that bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples with Adam follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this that people haven't read the study they've read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia that data and read the report because it's available online and see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true in accurate I give all the credit to Melba she's a genius scientists that figured this out\nUm it's unfortunate\nYeah so the guy got thrown under the under the bus as she did as well um\nHe said that the the this was not engine bank is it now or did they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it\n\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I made a lot of times you know these descriptions and there were some amazing\nWorking here there's some really a tremendous writing in some of these old article a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading it off and making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the three different categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there is some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eight now did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seemed emit that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when they had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded is two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as the description twenty four used a gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else\nNow the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U.S sixteen in Canada\nThree in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. there were others but those were the bulk of them and then the states with the most articles about it a whirl Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana eleven\nNew York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six\nAnd then the numbers keep going down from there but again it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article in the missing\nBut I started to pay attention and I got to get some credit to a guy named Tom Powell out of Oregon palms a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot and one of the funniest things he did in his presentations his genius\nIs a lot of people say oh you know if you're overly this map with the maps of big wild man disappearances there all the same and he puts up a map of like big for the uh appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and\nAnd he goes out and like six maps and then he puts up a map but he doesn't say anything goes you know what this map of he goes from apple all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they're kind of associated in the same locations and it's a big fight [laughter]\nAnd but it was his statement about giants that were found in past centuries\nIn mountains and in a excavations that really kinda got me thinking or these giant the big for that were buried or were these something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things were already\nI've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories you're in Nevada you know the ... century shown to you have legends and stories about a big foot bones or a giant bones\nThe big foot bones or a giant bones that were stash and they came up in northern Nevada and are you ask what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find them\nWanted these articles pointed to um some universities would get them\nInto the more likely candidate where all these when and it said in the articles was the Smithsonian yet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't album\nYou look back at some of the descriptions there's one earlier in your book it's from the Marilyn good that June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three describing an ... a witness sees this on the cell for governor rubber an animal\nBetween twelve and Fifteen feet high it's a sheep resembling a human except the head with it which is an equal proportion to the body the feet are two feet long and Harry uh that sounds like our guy doesn't mean the description semi modern descriptions of big\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds I I was stunned because nobody talks about it\nBut when you like one of the quotes that article says this animal is between twelve and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being except ahead which is like you said an equal proportion to the body\nAnd so I'm thinking wow they were writing about this way back when and nobody nowadays is ever brought this stuff up\nSo one of the articles I I put in the tribal big foot book that nobody wants to talk about\nWas in Nineteen thirty four there was a series of trail said incidents in Washington where hikers and hunters and things were getting rock thrown at him and they saw this figure that looked like a big foot well then they went and told the sure Musharraf was going to get a policy together to go kill this thing", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "year":
