was I think and I couldn't hear libertarian\nI'm both I'm a registered Republican I'm also a libertarian and the reason I registered critic as a Republican is a few years ago I was going to run against I'm Barbara Boxer and I wasn't going to run as a libertarian because I knew I wouldn't get enough votes so I changed my party to a to a Republican\nAnd I was going to run against her head the Republicans endorsed me instead of Carly Fiorina but they endorse the arena so I didn't run but that's why I switched\nTo argue with that you like that but I should also a big thing I mean as a woman

for voting rights was a new push for for photo voter id was an example a pernicious racism never mind the majority of blacks want\nPhoto voter id Putin said a as another example to pernicious racism the fact that black boys or expelled or suspended from schools at a greater percentage and then the other kids in that particular school\n... a a Jesse Jackson even food an all white school board in Decatur, Illinois for cutting out a bunch of black kids were fighting after football game you argue that the all white um school board was racist a and that the policy that apply to these black boys was racist\nDecatur defended himself by pointing out all around the country where the school board is all white or school board or consisting of poor people of color close call back black boys are still kicked out disproportionately compared to other boys at that given given school why because they're misbehaving\nThe third example that a\nEric Holder gave as an example of pernicious racism\nOr is the fact that a black criminal defendant who committed same crime as a white criminal defendant gets a longer sentence and that is true what Eric Holder didn't tell you is that the U.S in the commission or that came up with that with that that also said the reason\nIs for is the fact that judges or when it comes to sentencing will take into consideration the defendants arrest record and it turns out the typical black defend it has a longer arrest record than typical white defend it as a result\nThat black defend it gets a longer sentence nothing to do with racism or the U.S sentencing

with us author partner at the sherpas technology group in Silicon valley a former investment banker with UPS in New York His world view has been turned upside down in the lead to two thousand sixteen period when he was exposed to world changing science\nWhich suggested that country the mainstream assumptions consciousness has not produced by the brain no after researching extensively he wrote this book and end up Saddam thinking to introduce all of us to these cutting edge ideas and your use on the coast to coast I bet that was really shocked you initially mark didn't it\nAbsolutely shocked me and thank you for having me on\nWhen I'm looking forward to this too I always ask questions of gas scientists and people who are experts on the brain\nDodge consciousness exist outside of the brain or not know the pure scientist showed a medical professional folks mark would always say you have to have the brain in order to have consciousness in the brain dies it all goes with it\nAnd I've always thought no there's something else here with consciousness you finally found out did you\nI did and I I was very squarely in what's known as the materialist science camp which\nSuggests that the universe is fundamentally made of matter there was a big bang about Thirteen point eight billion years ago killing the universe with physical material that we call matter and when you have enough matter in this big universe you're bound to get interactions between those pieces of matter we call that chemistry\nWhen you have enough random chemical reactions you're ... you're bound to end up with a self replicating molecule like DNA chance says that would happen and DNA leads to the evolution of living organisms like a human being the human being developed the brain and consciousness awareness comes out of the brain that the perspective\nAnd if you buy into that which I used to and then when the brain dies consciousness dies memories are gone\nThan when you think about meaning in life\nIf you take the material is perspective very strictly there can't be any meaning because once one in a dead there is no memory it there's no consciousness and that's the prevailing perspective as you mentioned in narrow science and most of science today\nNow looking at your bio I Would lose money in a bet saying that you would write a book about consciousness how the heck did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter] so it was about two years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon that I was totally material if that's what I Would call it now in hindsight\nBut I I randomly stumbled across a cast that started talking about these ideas I was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the ... was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had and at the end of that her name is Laura Powers\nShe mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers\nAnd I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula and I listen to different episodes and people there are many different people have talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities the ability for consciousness to survive bodily debt things I had no familiarity with\nAnd over time just hearing enough different people describing similar perspectives on reality I got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real\nAnd this was a very jarring and disorienting realization for me because I thought life was meaningless\nAnd here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer of consciousness maybe the brain's more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that process is consciousness and the identity that we have is not tied to the body so that totally freaked me out [laughter] and\nSo that totally freaked me out and a change in my world view completely led me down the path of intense research because I needed to rethink all of reality spent about a year of basically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in finance consulting\nAnd as I was doing that I told friends overtime at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive and these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity with the topics\nUm and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight\nSo after hearing enough of this feedback and also the thing that I had intense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened\nSo it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend and I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco and decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days\nAnd ended up writing more than half of the book is now out\nAnd then an issue over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript and ultimately a cold email bill Gladstone who's now my agent at my publisher\nMultiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents that car totally\nAmong the good people knew about Walsh a and so that's where we are\nSuper now what did you mean by an end to upside down thinking\n[noise] I consider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain the brain creates consciousness\nWhat I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing beyond space and time so instead of saying we get we start with mattered end up with consciousness consciousness comes first\nRight with out to bring those consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests\nNo with science back us up\n[noise] so my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body\nSo one example is chapter nine or I talk about near death experiences and if you'd asked me a few years ago with a near death experience I Would have said well isn't that just a loose nation that happens when someone about to die it's like a listener in mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple first of all what's described it in near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness is not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all and even more than that we find instances in which\nPeople accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as a vertical out of body experience so the person is out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back to their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that is suggestive of some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark Goldberg dot com is linked up for you and coast to coast the dot com the name of his book we're talking about\nAn end to upside down thinking let me read the subtitle dispelling the midst of the brain produces conscious does and the implications for everyday life we're going to take phone calls next hour with mark\nAnd I'm going to come back we'll talk with them so they can eat sushi pre cognition to let them see how that all works out side of the brain and what's causing [noise]\nDuring the ... page with thousands of members Greek for show up they didn't connecting with those are good at ... dot com slash goes to him and do it but [noise]\n\n\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before telepathy pretty cognition telecast now cycle ... says you you of course\nShouldn't tell them because you know cycle conditions you you of course more on a little bit about them what you learned more as you did more be research the new\nYeah absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science in controlled study that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about ... what did you uncovered and let's find out your explanation my aunt who is a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigating telepathy and uh she ... she came out with some astounding things but when did you find\nIt yeah it's a lot but these are very important phenomenon it's\nIt's mine too mine communication and just taking a quick step back the reason that I examine each of these phenomenon is that I reason that the material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain\nThat perspective cannot account for things like telepathy and the other things will talk about and I reason that if any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture does work [noise]\nSo ... the to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns held experiment and the basic design is as follows and I should say that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter as and when you combine the results\nThe statistics are very compelling mhm doctor dean rate and who just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called six sigma six sigma refers to\nStatistical odds against chance when you get a six sigma resolved the odds that the that the effect has just happening by chance is more than a billion to one\nAnd intellect to the we have six sigma resolves the guns thought experiment the study has one person in a room we'll call him Bob and very very relaxing state listening to relaxing music\nThere's another person let's call her Jane who's in another room chain is given a picture by the experimenter is an experimenter say chain and easy but I Want you to mentally send a picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room again is mentally sending this image to Bob\nBob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know a picture game was looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all that Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent right\nNow when we ... the law probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials but instead it's closer to thirty two percent so from a statistical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect is twenty five versus thirty two\nThis is a massive statistically it's suggested something is getting through\nAnd it actually conforms to our common sense our everyday experience because\nIf we were one hundred percent ... then we would know each other's thoughts all the time sure instead it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they tax you or they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two of her she's twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nWhat could increase ... percent mark who's at the center or the receiver\n[noise] this is something that that needs to be explored much more of like what we see with people who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a have had been involved in the U.S government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and\nPeople who are better ... seem to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI'm always wondered though if somebody is really tuned into certain things if they can pick up all kinds of different events without really having to send or having much to do with it\nI think that's a receiver\nMight have a better effect in changing the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... ethic or communications with the deceased\nThrough medium ship these are people that tend to be picking up information\nAnd if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's it's helpful metaphor where there's a consciousness that's not localized to the body those who are able to better configure their antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular stand or or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver the person in the room and simply not show them any of them for pictures but they just had to tell you what they think she said to them\nWhat do you think would happen\nWell well I think we'd have a distribution first of all we had just an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic than we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw what the US government\nUh but if it's an everyday person I think it would be a different more difficult study to examine because the effect is so small\nWell let's talk about the U.S government studies and the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me I'm the program is sometimes\nReferred to as Stargate Program and used psychic spies for national security purposes many I'm hearing that I've been on the show right away\nYeah during the Cold War and and the people who have more involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many remote viewers who are involved to say this was ... so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real\nI'm In my book I I have some documents from the CIA which had been declassified recently\nAnd the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was one but remote viewing\nIs the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that's far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes it sounds completely paranormal if consciousness is localized to the brain\nBut if consciousness is non local then it's at least conceivable documents um say explicitly and I am looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon this is from ag classified documents that has been released recently\nSo I mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that in my business world that I had a consulting case for example that's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me at least made me question things\nUm even further than that there's a page on a science panel and there are some very credible people including a someone who ... the next page in the document says science panel's report principle findings either direct quotes\nImplications are revolutionary evidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we have looked at these uh tell a path to studies and I've always wondered if the government really never stopped doing it which continued now I'd ask some of the people who've been involved in these studies that just that same question and they\nAnd these studies that just that same question and they said no it stopped because they would have kept us on they would've used us I'm not sure what the government has found other people and they continue these kinds of mind the studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used to find a downed Russian drama in an African jungle that they couldn't find\nSo there was some utility to the program whether it was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful\nSo you'd have to think that if it were a useful thing to be doing that organizations would be trying it\nFree cognition mark the very valuable tool for people in their life because of the ability to sense things make decisions based on those gut feelings\nAnd to react to them now a lot of people don't react they don't do it if something happens and they go oh I should have done that and I I knew what what is your view of pre cognition\nSo there are some studies which show a very subtle pre cognition known as ... sentiment towards the body it's sensing something very subtly and we need to stick to show it before something happens\nAnd there are other examples where it's much more explicit where a person has a dream known as a ... dream the dream something and then the next day it happened exactly as they dreamed it that much less subtle\nBut if we go to the pre sentiment studies this is where I think it becomes very compelling again if we look at the meta analysis of all the statistics\nThat basic design is as follows it it versus what we look at in psychology typically and in psychology the typical study as you show someone a picture let's say at the neurotic image or a violent picture\nWe know that the body will unconsciously respond to it though the skin response the people's
