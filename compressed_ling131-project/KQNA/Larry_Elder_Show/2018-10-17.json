[noise]\nExpect your magazine that but it it was wrecking the top one hundred television series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction of all television series and the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone is the only the only one it made it\nAnd at this point you know you ask the average twenty five year old [noise] they're not getting any black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone it entered the consciousness\nJust as a term you know people know that the trolley till means what you think it means I mean something you off kilter something is strange something is not quite right and it lasted all this time because of of Rob's messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written\nSo well produced so well acted a it was just a first class production from from get from point a to point you know so\nSo that I think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and I it's a Bradbury had heard about it and I had written an article about it in a what we had what's called the after dark newsletter\nAnd the bread bridges loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about my ... my shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I got and that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office\nBut what rod didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he knew right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no no listen nobody could write every script I'm Robert Ninety two hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes over five see that's pretty prolific\nThat is that's ridiculous I mean nobody writes Ninety two shows in a five year five season periods just if you know and and at the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced is just is just off the charts I I'm just convinced he never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty to Seventy five that was it [laughter] he\nSmoked a lot though didn't he yeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted here's just addicted to it maybe he got that in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of others that\nAre absolutely had heart issues and that's what's your name in you said that brought the road to well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty others the total shows that's crazy isn't it\n... it really is you know when I was researching the book it it\nYou know there's a couple of things that are really really impressive it that well first of all yeah you run Ninety two twilight zone episodes he also worth thirty eight of the night gallery stories ha ha so they do is that a hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides twice on the night gallery\nStay with us we're going to take a break we'll come back and talk more next

Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there a hundred and fifty six\nHundred wow and I know three of them for example it's a good life in prison pit long distance call with a guy Billy ... who was a kid that's here and everybody into the cornfields\n[laughter] yeah they sure yep\nAnd then as a matter of fact surprise for you Nicholas really movies with Billy\nHey George how are you man on the line Nick there you go hey bill good to talk to you it's good to talk to you too it's real good [laughter] it's better than talking to a dad grandmother so yeah [laughter] okay you give us the bad bad man\nOh I'm working for you now okay yeah ... I just need to tell you something buddy you're a bad man you're on an iPad [laughter] your voice has not changed all that much value really still waiting for puberty the strike what can I say\nIt really you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and that I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we return to it's a good life with ... and my daughter lily ana for it's still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got sick notches on my belt when it comes to the ...\nAnd we knew you were in those episodes and they were being done was rod surely around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the ... when he did as you know bumpers and intros and ah [noise] yeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast\nOn the twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer book out and we're really seeing kilo in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled\nControl from network hassling as much as they could\nUh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see Mr Serling when he was on the set and talk to them about what was coming up in the next episode her so usually when an executive producer or creator comes onto was said you know everybody gets a little uptight though that you know or when Alan's here [laughter]\nOr whatever but a recall quite clearly that a rod Serling was on the fed everybody was delighted to be around to\nTalk with you\nYeah yeah sure we went out from our her readers every night and you know\nThat's right and how old were you you were a little kid\nI was six uh six and seven and nine\nThat somehow didn't they find you believe in these parts\n[noise] um well actually one of the very first lead roles I did was a an episode of ... to young show that was directed by James Sheldon the chorus Leishman played by mom and a\nAnd the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James Sheldon he brought me and for long distance call and he also directed it's a good life\nSo having to under my belt or I guess they just you know just called me up for in praise of pet busy guy and\nYou were you were in ... now what do you do in the days really what's new\nWell Angela car right now I've just released are novel a fantasy novel I think we talked about it when we were first riding on time and go charge on purpose it's called the devil seek revenge against and all that this area has weapons\nWell set yourself with Tom uh for the show OK\nYeah love to do that and I'm ... throw an ancient aliens and you know I'm playing the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise] making music to\nYou than the capability thinks that's it you got it by George really moved me how to treat neck I was thinking George so that was great\nHe was a I did rod Serling for you on this show you never know [laughter]\nMy yeah my calling from the from the other side\nWhat inspired you to write the book about certainly\n[noise] well I mean I became a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just you know mesmerized by the show and and so that started everything\nAnd then really since then I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he had written a you know so much of it that was great\nAnd I just wanted to collect all this information about all of these shows that he had written and and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually\nI'm dumb this type of thing where for example\nYou know there wasn't even really a complete a list of all the shows that certain rod Serling wrote that were produced TV or or or film believe it or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had IRAs had gaps whatever but\nSo that had never been done for the first thing I wanted to do is I wanted to know exactly what she wrote you know for his entire career that was produced in any form whatsoever so\nAnd then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that you know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been that hadn't been commercially released\nUm I wanted to give that reader an idea of what these shows were about\nSo you know so that that was the idea behind the whole thing and then the book became you know it's part that is part you know a videographer you reference guide but it's also part biography in this part you know critical analysis of the the themes certainly was was dealing with the character types that he you know that he researched and you know delved into in big cetera\nDid you come across anything that surprised you in your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes I'm probably the most surprising thing that I found was you may have heard of a particular shall we talked about the sponsors before and how they would you know bought up against sterling whenever he tried to do anything that was remotely controversial whether\nThere's one show that's particularly infamous in that regard school to a school noon on doomsday\nIt was brought certainly is a tent to tell some kind of\nVersion of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until the fourteen year old African American a boy who was lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman and this really just destroyed route\nCertainly she wants to sell some sort of you know\nThe story and Everytime he tried to he you know he met resistance well I was able to find the ... the actual first draft of this script that rod wrote before\nAny of these um you know any of these into a interference is came into play and there have been several studies of this particular show in the evolution that ... from from you know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on television well but none of those studies had the actual first draft and I just luckily\nFound the actual first draft in that surprised me because I'll I'll spoil it for you and now it's not all that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that ... on doomsday controversy story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect rod Serling\nIt uh it devastated and he was um you know superficially he was a Kennedy admirer he was he agreed with the politics and he\nHe admired Kennedy but beyond that it was just it really you know I I came across a letter that rotted written to um to his ...\nWritten to um to his ... can't say pastor but he was a Unitarian for most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling was and he wrote a letter to one of his Unitarian a priest so to speak and and he just said how it just kind of it just took away his faith in humanity\nThat something like this could happen he felt that we were in you know in a dark age in dark ages whereas something like this could happen so it really it just yeah it it it throw him for it throw them into a dark place for a little while and strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination\nHe and William fruit that one of the producers on this while its own were contacted by the state department and ask to produce a film to introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world while it was a documented they needed a documentary they thought you know this and we got to get something quick\nThat we can just send to our allies and present to people so you know here's here's a new president and so rod Serling the day after the the assassination when he was you know depressed for sure\nFlew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this documentary to introduce President Johnson to the world\nSo he did that he finished\nYeah in fact the you know the uh\nThe the people who asked him to do this I said we ... we need to spend five days and and and William fruits have listened that's not going to happen we we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they you know as we said before rather so prolific and he was so such a fast writer he did get through it pretty quickly and they had they had it ready\nYou know ah I I actually don't do exactly the timeframe wasn't five days but it wasn't much much longer than that\nWhat is it about black and white TV shows that have a different feel than the color shows that we all see nowadays\nYeah you know it's well I can tell you specifically when it comes to the twilight zone I think that's one of the things that\nThe remake of the twilight zone have been missing is the fact that it's just it was black and white the twilight zone is black and white it's just it had an aspect the film the war to them filmed war has got to have that black and white uh edgy look to them and that that's what the twilight zone episodes had", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "17"}
