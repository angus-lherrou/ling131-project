basis so that could choking situation George I'm fortunate\n... situation George unfortunately it superseded by the economic ties to the U.S has its inter dependency on Saudi cash not only for us treasuries certainly for large purchases in the defense industry\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm going to walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loans situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school\nAnd I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have women lives right if the school provides a you know that they have the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans [laughter]\nAh but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of\nUh is that in nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most apps and of the consumer protections but I just mentioned\nWhat what if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available\nAnd they get that discounted off their student loan so you know ...\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation or something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless you are making a minimal a annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise]\nUm [noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there\nBut I can tell you that what we have now today is the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen\nA you know the founding fathers way back in the day\nOr people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants\nOr so after the revolution ... when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniformed bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war has the power to raise an army and many other very important powers [noise]\nAh so the ... you know are they require bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student\nLoan absolutely we are going to take calls next hour with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us all want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition Allen\nSure oh well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to uh be able to repay the loan in other words to default on the loan default don't\nRight if it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead\nWell that's a defining hallmark of a predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies in the service or as the guarantor ours are often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than alone the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where your credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on it the fall\nA but it turns out that uh uh the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm compelled to borrow or to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans\nThey going to ... percent commission right off the wall so you know where they can make the three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for service seen a healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four or five six years on a defaulted loans that they can build a bar or to put through rehabilitation and so the financial incentives that\nAnd so the financial incentives that are under this but a federal student loan system are just completely perverted and it's been turned mean released federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the bar or\nKnow explain the process over the faulted loan in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and led much use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of\nAnd by any means so a student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents moral fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nSure that's a that's a good case I'm good easy numbers to start with so a fifty thousand or student loan when the student graduation let's say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years\nUh they're unable to make payments they lose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise]\nUm the student can expect a lot to be thrown into default so the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably defaulted somewhere around oh let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars well with penalties and fees and capitalized interests that are slapped onto that loan\nVery quickly that would be glad to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty\nTwenty five in the power is responsible for that\nYes the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment and fall for roughly let's say a hundred and twenty five or so thousand dollars\nOh my God so what the\n... what the new system will do will say oh you're into fall on your loan big trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment\nWe can have your professional license suspended and we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nIt'll be taxed too you stuff like that that's right yeah\nUm you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other landing system has are brought to bear on the bar or\nSo ultimately they will wind up since I'm hopefully the government hopes to I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments\nFor about for ten months typically none of those payments go towards alone this just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that oh a tape this rehabilitation\nAt the end of process they wind up signing for much a newer much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars well these agents and get a sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that they compel them to do this long rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus it though it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nShe's in the in these agents or collection companies\n[noise] well yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well on these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own guarantor so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before\nA President Obama so these companies make out like bandits they would rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than\nAh than alone there remains is good said\nI should probably say here George to all the people listening out there to rehabilitate you're alone it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate they default again three to four times\nAnd they just keep growing oh that's right\nYeah and if you can imagine said a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan\nDefaults again and that happens something like eighty percent of the time then the whole process starts again\nTo stay with us Allan let's talk about if there's any recourse here and again we'll take calls next hour with Alan calling U.S Coast to coast am\nDying of no go zone or breathe email newsletter today it goes the coup am dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nJefferson one said there are two ways to cocker an inch labor nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court there's nowhere\nIn their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is\nThey will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the sun's\nThen they become subject to arrest so in the state of Texas for example uh inter around Houston one of the federal district there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and and forced to uh to come into court that way\nTo deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server the sheriff or primary process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're seeing they can go and get them any way and take them in the ... in in the court\nRuled that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly are and just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise]\nUh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was like three thousand dollar loan and they hold this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know it ... penalties interests in court costs and fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera um\nCensor debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know the uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison [noise] uh that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy rates ahead of the power to declare war has risen army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans\nThe old fifty thousand now they want to pay them the let's assume that's what they want to do what you're saying because of these deep salsa fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that and grows even more can't they just cut a deal on the ...\n[noise] well um they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that had defaulted\nMore kind of settlement isn't that for\nMost people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know if people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place uh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan when it's all that is free unrealistic for most people [noise]\nUh so that you know the government has got you where do they want you on the student loans\nThey're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice dot org so many years ago\nYou know I had worked in government lending in other areas and and I had never seen anything like that\nOr you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um [noise] I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this was a sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the green [noise]\nUh so I can only hold that the people out there listening who this is happening to will realize that you know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you saying that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there was about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to rescind revoke suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses a man across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired a from this public employment and the for the case of default to student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nTo cross a park party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what is President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\n[noise] it absolutely crosses all party all hindsight I mean this goes way beyond Democrats or Republicans\nAre unfortunately the past say three presidents really have only made the problem worse or under Obama I'm Obama essentially federalized a lending programs so that where before\nA bank such as well as I mentioned at the top of the show great legs Sallie Mae now let us after a where they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans and\nBy the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five billion dollars a year\nWhich is more than any corporation on earth on the lending program now Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before\nHe said why is the government for offering on student loans if this is nonsense you know of all places that the government shouldn't be making a profit\nYou would think student loans would be it a and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five\nYou know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans or the lending system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those uh those days\nI'm so unfortunately you know ... ... known Trump's rhetoric was really good but since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him\nA et cetera so who would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy devolve ...\nWho herself had stock in struggling collection companies [noise] ah and you know frankly I don't think President Trump is really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds [noise]\nUh so I have I hold out some hope for him a but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Nineteen Ninety eight you could file bankruptcy in a way to students that what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um\nSome of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they brought it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing and we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away\nAnd so um so yeah Congress ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable [noise]\nWhat we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening far less than one percent in fact about three tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans and bankruptcy and this is less far less than the average for other loans so there was never a good premise for removed\nTheir loans so there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy writes ah and the fact that we've had to suffer under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most ... one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing of ... this is a problem that Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against the citizens\nWere with Alan ... student loan justice dot org linked up and go to go see him dot com his book is called the student loans scam you're on some kind of a nationwide tour these days tell me what you doing\nOh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called H. are twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply um deleting a one line of federal code\nThat make student loans treated differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings so this really gets to the core of the problem and ah by by getting this bill passed\nA we would immediately see a dramatic decrease in the price of college\nAh we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality of the job that the government does administering the program [noise] ah so this bill is very important and we're hoping very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nTelling a lot of people would prefer not to have to file bankruptcy they just don't like the stigma or is there anything else that we can try to do or get past legislatively to fix some of these student loan issues\nWell absolutely and I agree nobody wants to file for bankruptcy is a terrible thing to have to do and and even more difficult thing to fight for I should say [noise] ah but it's just the threat of bankruptcy that would really help the lending system but you know there there are a lot of things that we can and should be doing you know as I mentioned earlier President Johnson\nPromise that the loans up she would be free of interests so why can't we get back to that why should why like Donald Trump said why should the government be making a profit on these loans [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "18"}
