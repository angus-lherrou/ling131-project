economics at UCLA [noise]\nHe's probably done more work than anybody else on the impact of\nNew deal policies during the great depression please welcome Mr hostile\nHanging back with Larry on the show has been forever\nWhere it's going to join you\nYeah thank you very much for taking the time professor I was fascinated by your piece that you co wrote on housing here in California is it true that the regulations rules restrictions literally added fifty percent to the price of housing here in the state\n[noise] Oh yes absolutely wow who and in fact fifty percent might be an understatement um and there is a there was a report in uh San Diego just two days ago indicating that building\nAnd affordable housing a unit ah which is not a large unit is now an al ... up to four hundred and twenty five thousand dollars um which just just seems a beyond the pale\nUm California is just the most expensive state in terms of regulations and it really does affect the price of housing and and the ability to\nPut a new construction and a which would which would bring housing prices at that California right now is forty nights and the country in terms of housing construction is very expensive to build in its time\nAnd it uh and it takes an awful long time\nProfessor my next question was going to be why aren't Californians outrage and recall studying economics in college or in in recognizing that the price of these regulations to accept that the price of a of housing but I didn't realize it was that high fifty percent and if I didn't realize that I think a lot of people are unaware of it as well\n[noise] yes um I think people are becoming more aware of that now given just how rapidly prices are rising I'm only about twenty six percent of California households and this includes households with multiple wage earners\nOnly about twenty six percent of households could afford the median price tone in California\nAnd people often think well what about all those people that make those high salaries up in Silicon valley or forty believes even worse they're only about Fifteen Percent of households in the Silicon Valley area can afford the median price Tom in that location\nSo there's no there's no sense in which um there's there's there's absolutely a housing crisis in California and people are becoming very very upset about this and they're looking for government to to put in place policies\nThat will make it easier and less costly to build a an increase supply and bring those prices down\nYou might remember a few years ago professor I I got a fact check when I was on CNN when I talked about\nUm the ... the high cost of a of a of regulations and said that if you add up the taxes and regulations are all those things government takes about fifty percent away from the American people I've got a phone call from from some fact checker\nAnd they said how do you know the cost of regulation is what you say it is\nA and I'm a I recommended them to a number of people and I recall you telling me that if anything I'd probably understated the or the number and the argument they gave me was that regulations also have benefits and and you're not taking exhilaration the benefits that these regulations produce what's your reaction to that\n[noise] well regulation exist to provide protection is supposed to provide protection to consumers\nRegulations in the housing market when I look at them I really can't see much a protection for consumers um let's take California's\nLatest folly which is to require by two thousand twenty of virtually every single family home will be required to have solar panels on its roof top\nThis will raise the cost of a building that home by about thirty thousand dollars\nFor the purpose of generating solar power we already have so much solar generation that we are paying Arizona to take solar power offer hands around around noon in one PM [noise] um that type of regulation feeds into [noise]\nA small number of people in the state who think it's just absolutely wonderful if we do everything we can under the sun\nTo be green um but it punishes people who have to pay those housing prices um so the residential housing market in California's not placed regulations really benefiting the consumers\nI'm Talking to UCLA professor Leogane into teaching economics his piece you wrote is called California housing policy reformers

it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed and starting with Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nNot Jake certainly one question for the president one question for the White House is the

about it I mean even watching a film about spirit\nIn the movie theater is almost like a ... sure Barry and certain it\nThomas Edison the great inventor was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build his own machine I don't think he was ever able to do it was you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have\nVery interesting thing here where we have people who are considered scientists the rational and it's not that they weren't the funky because they want it to just be cynical skeptical because they really want that there to be the truth is this true Houdini\nHoudini really want to take him he really wanted to find a medium could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his ear departed mother but he couldn't find on all he found or Charlotte but his but she believed that it would be possible\nAnd I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where let's just for a moment pretend even if it's just a quick ten moment imagine that these things would be possible but I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves and\nThose are new Houdini by the way we read your writing was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on the\nRight yes that's right ... gonna be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy but as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job\nThat's right if he had today's equipment do you think he might be able to do something\nMaybe but I think that he would also find\nWhich unfortunately I sometimes founded that people were using these things but if

downloaded today [noise]\nYou know ... hearing of capitalism that how can about the Protestant American Spirit is something whereby we want to\nProve our right now is we want to prove that we are loved by God by by being successful in the world by being innovators inventor and entrepreneur strike and I think that that uh\nThere's inventors entrepreneur is right and I think that that extends even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we\nAre in charge of our own salvation where we want to be right in front\nOf our experience with the divine is is again something that's very human I think that typically American often and so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say\nYou know what I'm going to do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with the spirit or with God or divine or whatever\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something that pre existed and I opened in up and re purpose in it\nAnd so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people have practiced magic for millennium right just another example of magic of\nA of a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between right right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to have this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated\nBut if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses of that tool like\nWe were you Peter in that category\nMyself yeah wow I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that um I tend to believe though that we have to be careful about how much we try to rest\nThat you know from that we have to put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer then maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer released they think they do and then others can't even get close\nYeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it on the Internet is\nYou know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this or why some people are\nBut this goes you know back to the whole idea that we once used to think that a that a profit with somebody who has special information for us and now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so\nYou know it for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce art that we called visionary art or spiritual aren't are often considered outsider artists why is that why is that people were working with these themes considered to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular\nArgue no mainstream artistic community and I think it's we live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience\nAnd what's interesting about technology is that it and this is really key here to see if I can explain this somebody takes her radio and they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio and I'm going to resign or a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world\nBut the science that made that radio possible\nAnd the science that makes it possible to the Saudi Arabia and have another effect take place the science behind that that even made this radio something that you could find the store\nWhich said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't against and yet we can take the thing this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that his underneath the scientific method and scientific understanding of the world it's it's underneath fit\nAnd divorced and turn it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can think about technologies in ways that that the science connected to that might actually be in opposition to\nWell if you didn't own a radio or have a computer where you can listen online and somebody came up to you should Peter ... are you ... over this guy at night\nTalking goes to spirit snow the strange things he taught there he's out there and you of course
