wasn't even in town then how can she be so convinced that could be a theory why what do you think Larry\nWell I think uh I think there's something there could be on it or it's up on my website Larry other dot com and I believe the story from gateway pundits and you're right she coauthored a paper about self his self hypnosis a and that may very well have played into her memory or lack there of I

computers and everything else\nAnd as well I have five signs personal all and I don't think a weapon would react to that because they want to get to the bottom of this and to the truth\nAnd they were

that can be unintended consequences of places because the\nProblem is you select one particular population in the workplace and end of the things that that population they may not appreciate it always has everybody know selected\nThat can be a reaction which is quite make it to say that he's appointed into his mission and the question is always did they get that because the quota or on their own merit and that's a bit of a sudden for anybody to deal with\nMe here quite deciding what can with the fact that they come to the law and we're very opposed to something needs to be down this I went in and force and went into ... through the pipeline and we think that needs to be down inside the needle that she as opposed to having it cut into something\nLike ... coming so I think we're in a strange situation at the moment Web rough or that he's fighting that that you think a hormone quote wet companies would be fined and science and if they didn't have at least ... percent that board that when I'm at a very\nStrange place to be in because not all competing for the same and the oil companies are able\nAnd because not all companies are saying that the oil companies are able to move to that situation anytime soon as I Do have a great concern that we're talking about legislation rather than ... either nation to war more gender balance on board\nI think we do get gender violence over time but there are getting stuck in that there's like seven companies might let alone that to get that\nAnd set in the areas where there are less than they do actually qualified\nTo take on that role inside the secretary said to me to say that we should stop that was encourage people to get on with that but I don't think legislation is the way to go at this point in time I think it probably\nSend the signal a north it that way I see get\nPrecious that down the organization the only place because we can make a difference at this point in time is not that I taught and culturally that should actually help all the way down the organization of course I Need to grow the base so strong capable of women who were actually able to see what the way through organization quickly\nAnd efficiently and effectively in all honesty we do need a pressure from the board down so that we had bought them up on the top down approach I think that going to be the most helpful way we can actually get that but we could look at different\nTools that people that we don't look to the years or so as you said at least for this and that to the more that the coral so we find talented witness no matter what they might be [noise]\nAnd the question quotas I must say that um it's a controversial one because\nI've been out there trying to make progress it especially in the natural services industry for ten years and sadly you know we haven't made all that much progress little bit now more it's most recently\nBut that having been said I think that um if you force the issue by quotas you end up with unintended consequences undermining the industry a little bit and and the gender representation and so as a result\nI I Can't say that I'm On board with quotas but what I Do think we need which is sort of what\nWe're seeing here the pay is not true because if there isn't some type of the pressure\nWith a perception that there are consequences on the back and\nYou know I think the excuse for inaction running so it's really incumbent upon us too I think with that little bit of pressure keeping the spotlight on the issue is the type of thing that hopefully in that light light people feel that the needs a new and then once you actually start to get a more\nBalanced representation just a little bit you get to the tipping point and that becomes organic and it's also selling so I Hope

political identity that seems to be polarizing the country as your report said\nWorse than ever before um but when I actually go out of mind blue range into the red range of Americans I meet really decent beautiful people\nWho and I listened to them and I can see so much potential if people would just stop listening to this ratings the rating the horrors of of a mainstream news\nAnd just wouldn't talk to each other\nAnd they don't talk anymore John that no one nobody touch screen they argue but I've\nActually found the people in the red states more willing to talk than I Do the people around me who call themselves progressive\nAnd I live in the deep blue western Washington part of what Washington state and uh it's uh it's intriguing to me because of the thing that I did back in January of this year I I put together a\nA this forecast which is the main essay at the end of ten predictions twenty eight team that you just mentioned and uh I was just reading it again after many months and I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put it in its uh that\nWas basically it happening is a a level of if you're gonna defined than planets there's two major planets and astrology and political strategy either play right now\nOne is a is you're honest and just recently come in to tourists\nAnd then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn is centered and long story short it's a struggle Iran is finds itself in the story and find which means it's dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations whereas\nThe the earth the sign a Capricorn Saturn is is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and\nSo you have a long story short it's it it favors the establishment more than it favors those who are resisting the establishment\nUm because Iran is in horses in its fall and it's in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in the least\nComfortable sign that it's translated they ... through now last time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into tourists it did two major changes in political astrology it brought the German the third Reich into being under adult Hitler\nAnd it also uh aged Franklin Delano Roosevelt new deal to\nDestabilize establish a banking ideas and things that were restructured that in in a positive sense created a this this longest a profitable wealth a period of time in history [noise]\nUh that happened because of the reforms of the banks those reforms have slowly been shipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms than Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same kind of demographics of the of the separation between the fuel\nThe demographics of the of the separation between the fuel all the and the majority who have not so much wealth is almost exactly where it was in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash\nAnd so we are repeating a cycle and a show the the issue is their Iran is if I ever I saw something that expresses itself in in the Iran is in the fall the revolutionary the innovator the person with the original thinking\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to the current situation in the White House and and it is a it is expressing itself with great passion and unpredictability but its negative it's about destroying from\nGetting a house start getting the Senate back but for what it's not really defined itself\nIs what we know what the resistance is against and I hear it all every day here because I live in the very heart of it you're a but but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if it if you follow this pattern\nWith much more energy to it then it happened before 'cause I remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said don't go a Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six\nI was on a show in Portland\nFive hundred thousand Oregonians watched it and the man who had a meltdown said you're absolutely crazy that can happen and of course four years later I said well no one will happen because if you're ... anybody but Bill Clinton\nYou're you're you're you're fundamentally a you don't have anything to replace him except your or tear him down and then what and it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before at least\nAt least and and it's being I mean it's being the people of this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media news\nThat it it's really quite and this classic um Iran is confusion and its fall and tourists you know where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud or sorry it's a muddy place to form the muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays similarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come\nAnd save you from yourself and you know I have been how long long time first with art and then with the huge orange I've been\nTalking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it is really your hair and now it's um it's not going to be when I look at\nWhen I look at the situation on the sixth of November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where Iran is going retrograde its back going backwards and in the sky which means that it's a time to recollect where you've been and go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving Taurus around or just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time although election day and starts backtracking into areas that what that means is that if\nIf red voters threat American voters ... early especially in a lot of the areas which will be in early times\nOn hold on for a second John already at the break we'll come back we'll talk more about this\nWill get into some of his top ten

really good you just put in what you're looking for and you get a number of different vendors and names and the other all qualified picked them\nDid you get a number of different ... names and ah they're all qualified pick the one you want a superb workers by the way John ... with us as we talk about process the predictions John we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen predictions how many of come true already\nWell uh there have been a number of the more the most shocking and have been my\nMy eighth prophecy what I did is is basically short um chapters that takes a theme and looks at it fully and\nWant to give us some headlines of of the ten real quick well\nYes they they were the the definition of the year being the year of acceleration\nThat definitely things as intensified that way the second prophecy was a year on us in the last chance sec style that\nLooked at the play between Iran is in Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together and have more common ground but that petered out by may ...\nAnd that seemed to happen in a way where there was also the third prophecy will Trump be impeached\nOr not in twenty eight team and it looks like that's definitely happening [noise]\nAh I've always said that both candidates in twenty sixteen were afflicted astrological we both have the danger of not or if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means leave office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this\nBut they could leave and scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January\nSo it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before that the first half the day goes to the red states and the red voters say get out early they vote early\nIndeed is really going to probably be decided in a week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots\nBut there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house representatives\nWill uh see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon so\nIt'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west that uh might see in eleventh hour or close to the polls are turned around so with that um you know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I was simply say about President Trump that\nIf he survives this um these two years he will I still see has the potential to be a two term president ...\nWhat's what's so hard for the polarized people in my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other and I'm just quietly watching this and try and make you know taking of ... and it's like ... I mean literally is a large family members and\nOther things are are getting involved and passionate about it and I'm going well [noise]\nUm every everybody watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in the fall and tourists\nUh they're they're they're just watching the news and there's a swimming that the other side is hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both sides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the little blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt white working class Democrats that really went and voted for Trump because they've been neglected for a few presidential cycles [noise]\nI Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until six fear if it's a two term president according to my interpretation of the astrology they're going to give them a chance when I talk to them and the red states I see it's very clear that they're not going to budge\nAlso the other thing that uh once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical them I said the strong very strong you know I said ten months before Trump was\nElected I said the the big upset could happen through their\nUm and so it's it's my sense is that there will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving\nIt's almost like it's it's a musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes with the Democrats at the same number of seat\nJust switching back and forth\nAnd in that there's not enough to create any significant legislative advance so it's it's just more and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more\nThis functional than anything we've seen before in it's almost unbearable now\nWell it's I I hate to say it to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not at the end of this this this crisis that's going this evolutionary challenge that's happening to the United states\nAnd the world is just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually\nThink of a way to get out of this merge and say it's going to have to get much worse and frankly astrology are saying that you're not going to see a a tide shift until the middle of the next decade when we're\nWe're we're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this trial\nYet we're not even close it's going to get much worse in what's going to happen was kind of brings me to the issue of Kavanaugh and all this all the fighting about that [noise]\nIs it I said very clearly in my back in August eleventh in my article send that Kavanaugh would be picked that um [noise]\nI I think people are stabbed pushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not the thing they should be looking at according to their needs\nIf you look at cabin on the stars and what he's done his record\nI don't think there'll be way it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset by this Supreme Court no I don't think so cry a lot but I tell you these this time with the Iran is and Saturn the\nDefining planets of next year and into twenty twenty these these planets the way they're positioning the way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two major corporate establishment will to power\nThat you're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote a hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see was creeping coup d'etat of corporate uh hedging money which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when ...\nLies by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's or sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great masses and sometimes violent\nCitizen mass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened\nAnd so it's possible that after twenty twenty with the American people or more of the working people people started really starting to get riled up about situation a there will be basically in a completely corporate elite control the United states\nAnd so that's that's my call I Hope I'm wrong I Wish I was more [laughter]\nAnd you recently were on the History Channel you know the show called the last hope in the Catholic Church of course has been under fire for all kinds of atrocities when we get ...\nYou know it was um [noise]\nIt was a unique experience and and it's put me in a position that that show\nUh I mean to you have to kind of talk about something that happened the sun for my own sake of credibility I I'm Sorry I even have to say it but I'm the show a shook\nYou're talking about the last ...\nThe the the the show basically circled in the second hour around the idea that Cardinal Ratzinger who later became Bennett's take this the sixteenth [noise]\nThat are under under orders from John Paul the second presented the third secret other prophecy of fat among which is one of the most significant prophecies in Catholic prophecy
