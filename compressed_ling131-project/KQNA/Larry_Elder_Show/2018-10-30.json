there and Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with the the hospitality industry\nAnd I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now and and uh you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room and it was about twelve people in the room and I'm sitting around a round table\nAnd and they eat their answer was you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how to market on social media\nAnd and the American express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation of why are you know how they think how they buy and held and says it's it's about new products are about making room smaller in your lobbies bigger\nYou know what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it is all about demographics isn't it\nYeah it is it because if you are market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market but you know it it for about Twenty years they could make their product fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand\nAnd all of a sudden sale started trailing off is was Nineteen Ninety\nEight and I and I said I'm\n... so you're you're ... are are going

gas\nI mean that's what that means is you know you're you're laughing gas just checked out of your hotel\nAnd airfare sales went from eight billion get this George eight billion to two and about three years while or because they're not paying attention to demographic you know if you want to count money ... money go ahead not yourself out but if you want to understand where money came from I came from people help people and you will understand\nWell is it is simple to carry on to talk to that demographic you need to go after a bench surely and find out some of the things they enjoy and look at those trends you find out that you know if there are kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people\nFind out from them what did they do what do they like where do they go do they go to movies do they not and then adjusts yourself to that\nGeorgia too smart [laughter] but but that doesn't that sound like like logic yeah common sense of not so comfortable chairs at that\nLike you know I I Do um I'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then after everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down that and I said that's the boomers everybody

to me well why everyone doesn't think about this because it precipitating almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\nWell it has to a large\nWell it it has to a large degree um the\n[laughter] you know and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that and say people are still people when when you have a a large number of people that are consumer or a specific product in a small number of people that consume a specific product\nThe large number of people will consume more now I Know that sounds ... but the the ... the smartphone has a only aged folks in their ability to consume\nSo uh it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint but you have to keep in mind that the thing that drives commerce of the thing that drives you know consumption is the number of people in the market period\nNot that simple isn't it ... it almost sounds ridiculous doesn't it ... I mean who is out there saying well okay so large\nGroups of people consume a lot of stuff and then there's ... people consume smaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause the the uh look look let me give you an example of it you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers are Twenty years ago in in vast quantities\nAnd then the the um [noise] um yeah I'm a guilt companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of SUVs to a generation X. as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing departments that have kept on firing their their chief marketing officers\nBecause they couldn't come up with the secrets to selling as many SUVs to this other group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation and I don't know if I had to make it easy for small\nGood point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to me a couple of days ago and she said pop on you know kids are age and she calls herself ... but she's a young woman now we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and in you know it it's funny 'cause I'm kinda figured that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today or the babies that are born in it and that's all about you know demographics are born outside of wedlock and they're they're born outside of a of a marriage [noise] um the marriages seemed\nTo come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture or where Seventy five percent of the kids are born outside of the the uh\nUh marriage ... it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that you know whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you change\n[noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing\nI think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do in right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh you know you go back to the forty years\nAnd ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies with the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the issue of sex drugs and rock and roll what happens in the ... the boomer hippies\nLive became Republicans\nIn all cases\n[laughter] no not at all ... but you know if if you if you look at it this this is ... let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise]\n[noise] ah [noise] between the ages right now I'm thirty four in fifty three we have a diminutive puppy a population of of indigenous people that were born here\nThey were there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five an eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million born between forty five and safety for\nWhat does that mean that means that that that particular population could not a ... support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is me making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population\nAre superimposed over where the heavy lift or should be ... where would you know our our strength should be in our population it's actually smaller\nSo the net result is a you know ... ... instead of having a you know it and they should um haves and have nots with with the cushion in between of generation actually don't because they were never born\nWe're losing a cushion yeah well we did and as you so you you'd have people saying that the the United States is is broken because we have the have nots but middle age and and I'm In a middle income\nOr our occupy exactly the same space\nSo if you're middle ages small and then your middle income is small as well but it's a demographic issue is just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this to be ... let's use Facebook as an example you know they they've got the billions of people on line a huge amounts of advertising dollars because of what they do socially\nWhen I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to do is becoming a change there were I think advertisers to begin to say I'm not sure we're getting the bank for a dollar a year or you were converting these in the seals\nBecause the market may not be what we really want to what's happening with that\nA Facebook is kind of a strange [noise] entity if you will and I tell folks listen if you're if you're not paying for it you are not the customer you're the product um as far as I'm concerned and I and I got Twenty one years experience in the marketing industry\nThe Internet are um advertising is a bottomless pit you have no idea what your pie none and there's no way to a reference any kind of success\nExcept return on investment so you you spend money on the Internet and and you just cross your fingers and hope that your sales go up your sales go up you you don't know if it's if it's\nA relative to how much money you spend on the Internet but about what what's happening with a a ... a enterprise there is is not good it really isn't\nI mean it's huge trend here and to me the trend is very negative that it\nIs involved in with negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally different\nWith negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally disingenuous I I don't trust 'em a Facebook at all I really don't I don't think I I think you have to understand George that everything that anybody writes on on Facebook can be analyzed\nAnd then the ... and and that analysis puts people into categories and those categories uh our syllable and and what a separate Berg does with that information is sell it to anybody who will pay for it\nSo there there's there's there's no security and anything that you put on Facebook nothing\nAnd well what about you know some of these wacky job so you know the idiot the shield eleven people in the Jewish synagogues ... the guy who sent these bombs these pipe bombs they use social media to kind of spoke their hatred um how can we can't catch them a little sooner\nYou tell me I I really don't know that Robert Bowers and in a a Caesar salad and they are they are truly whack jobs\nAnd um I don't know that that that's that's more um a more understanding of of of a of a psych uh graphics that demographics as far as I'm concerned\nKen what's happening in the housing market most younger people aren't buying houses they're renting what's gonna happen\n[noise] while they're renting because they had a trillion dollars of student\nLoan debt yeah\nYeah but don't worry about it now what we're what we're literally facing with um a kid says is you have eighty seven million kids that are between fourteen and thirty three years old the kids are finally moving out of their parents' basements of throwing loyal as trophies they don't deserve\nAnd and that they're starting households and getting married you know starting a household\nIs you know could be an apartment or could be a condo could be anything I'm not were twenty five million housing unit short of our needs over the course of that generation so housing ... ... ... people ask me all the time he said well if it doesn't seem like housing is all that strong I said well unless these kids are going to sleep on the ground intense", "year": "2018", "show_name":
