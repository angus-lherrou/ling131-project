Peterson the great American from Los Angeles and more but let's go to Jean in Michigan so I'm In the Wolverine and thus far ... gene in Michigan welcome to the bill Cunningham show gene go ahead\nIdeal I'm just wondering uh [noise] if we lose the mid term said already said that they were going to go after trying to teach\nCabin I you know and the Supreme Court now the only way I see that we could prevent that Kavanaugh in their laws against slander ... character he could people could come out and say\nYou know these terrain lemon they already had come out from then on anybody comes out they present their testimony is out there some kind of recourse that men don't have any like half an hour or anybody else day\nYou know under Sullivan versus New York times in Nineteen sixty four year a Supreme Court decision it said that if you're a public figure like Brett Kavanaugh basically people can lie about those characters as long as the person speaking does not have actual malice which means they know what they're saying is false when they say Julie ...\nCommitted a defamatory slander\nAgainst Brett Kavanaugh when she said he was involved in group rates and drugging him I mean that was that was a lie Deborah Ramirez who said that he shook his private parts in my face and after a week I'm working with my attorney I kinda figured out who did it thirty four years later that was a lie\nAnd then also professor Ford for ... for to every factual statements she made it was proven to be false now for him to sue he wouldn't have to be in a federal court\nFor like the next five to ten years was Michael lab and daddy and snakes like that so I don't think you're a Supreme Court justice is going to personally to anybody in federal court because it would take five to ten years there'd be repeated depositions\nIn fact the process would be such a gauntlet I don't see bread going through it even though he would have probably win because when you when you're when\nYou're if you're Brett Kavanaugh if you're married to him than I argue saying honey\nJust through your job be a good judge and let's move on with life\nAnd I think that something though they can be done about all these people coming out of the woodwork without sacrificing missions you know stopping\nYou know for them or do I answer either six hundred and fifty thousand dollars on the go fund me paid she she's made hundreds of thousands of dollars but she wasn't I'm Adele\nSaying very cabin our money\nSo I Would say you know bread can always go half million dollars to I don't know what are you going to do with it but on the one ... somebody said went up for him so I don't know what\nI wanted to bring up one other thing um I like to listen to 'em real liberal TV and radio like KPFK coming out of ... where we haven't in Grand Rapids back here we have a black out radio talk show and sometimes I Can't listen to that because they just [noise]\nAnd they're very respect for the president I mean I didn't vote for Obama that I Would never talk about no I Would respect for the office of the president [laughter]\nContent Taylor and really good thing happened day I'm like I was listening to black [noise] talk show host and he was talking about hard to ... here in Michigan and he was telling us all the liberal Democrats were running for\nJudges in Michigan we're you know I don't vote project is because I don't know them that well\nBut when he named a liberal judges that they wanted on the Supreme Court here and and I okay those are the ones I Will not vote for\nThose who are the ones that said I'm not going that way since you're in Michigan that despair but now is there a chance you might lose she she's such a clown is there are no good Debbie Stabenow is there a chance you might lose\n[noise] I don't think so she is I don't know she's telling us that we're in the Michigan I said I had to kind of half way\nThrough it in eastern Michigan is very you know we got ... population we got a large black population we got a large democratic population over there\nAnd that's where she's out of the chances are slim [noise] you know and I called up her op ed and I do not have you ever read the Koran and you don't have an answer and you and we asked for a letter back from her I Can't\nImagine a worst representative and Debbie Stabenow and she's running against a very black Republican is going to get a lot of African American vote or not\nI I Hope so although um I did not vote for him because that right side of things about him and giving\nMoney to certain people that I don't kind of agree with the cat the last time he got elected so um [noise] you know we have a Muslim lady hit that kid is running out of college for Senate because she's from Detroit and it's a largely Muslim now [noise]\nUm there's areas of Michigan and like in Minnesota where\nWe don't have any choice people are not even running against her it's\nUnbelievable isn't it [noise] and you know we've got a proposal on our ballot which is really interesting um [noise]\nBecause you know they're they're trying to get away get away with redistricting thing because I think it's a very sad Republicans at that moment [laughter] so we got a mixture of that proposal on the ballot now where they want to go to which as they're killing people that will be ... by the secretary of state randomly like\nRandom or will be you know get panning on whether the secretary of state is a Democrat or Republican [noise] and they take like Thirteen people for decided Republican and for decided Democrat\nRanchers just look at John James I think John James has a shot at winning that seat it would be wonderful if this was an upset how anybody in Michigan both for Debbie Stabenow is beyond me\nTo continue with more of a long becomes available eight six six six four seven seven three three seven coming up later as calls you sort of North Carolina Nevada and ah and also help on bill Cunningham\nThe great American why would you do the job was\nTo become allied with you every time\nThink about that though I mean what that is they they are what they they are the fastest that they are\nOne hundred percent they already here at the Democrats interacting trying trip from around what point fingers or conservative than book about what people actually offers\nNo they do and well it's because the mainstream media falls forum that's why most continue now with a Joe in North Carolina than I've been in Florida\nJoe in North Carolina Welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joe go ahead [noise]\nYes sir thank you and go in your column down here in North Carolina Thank you yeah if I could say this I think it's worth thinking about with respect to the Kavanaugh issue I I I won't say all but I Would guess that the vast majority of Democrats would be very happy to know\nConclusively that Brett Kavanaugh at salt that the swamp and that they would be very very disappointed\nOr if it could be conclusively proven that he got a call her in other words they're very happy they would they would be very happy to serve up a\nA doctor for as an operate so to speak sure to their narrative sure and ... and shame on them if I could draw this parallel through court prosecuting tooth out here\nIn this big news out here a dark hair lighter or when it was absolutely conclusively proven\nThat that woman at the Aspen rate you did not hear any expression of joy or relief for why out there that she had not been rate\nOn the contrary the liberals really obviously had been hoping she hits in right right and they were disappointed that do that she has not been\nOne of the boys had the time of the rape had a picture taken them him had an ATM two miles away\nAnd and so you know Michael nice Fong lost his law law license the prosecutor and went to jail but there wasn't remembered Jesse Jackson Al Sharpton raising money making sure the so called a rape victim and free college tuition\nAnd now she's having prison time for like murder above but nonetheless there was no level of apologies\nFor maybe see NBC CBS the New York times CNN MSNBC simply moved on to the next ... the next carnival never offering sufficient apologies\nTo the three boys who was so brutally wrongfully accused of so many it was a joke what happened to them and the Hofstra boys or what happened at UVA in Rolling Stone all of these hoaxes take place in the media just moves on to the next circus\n\nExactly people were actually disappointed that that woman had not been raped and now I'm sure probably most Democrats are very disappointed when it really occurred to them if they're honest with themselves that really Brett Kavanaugh had not a ...\nI'm not ... not ... it was proven belief falls based upon their research done\nA professor for to answer she testified every factual statement you made was uncorroborated or refuted now one thing whether it was the door whether it was the air travel was it the timing was it the event itself whether her age none of it it's none of it fit facts\nBut that didn't keep the medium ... continuing to slime in\nThe ... and the point I Would make is a shame on anybody who was disappointed that this one was not sexually assault\nThey wanted her to be sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh they wanted to be true to me\nThat's right they were hoping hoping against hope that she had been sexually assaulted and they hope that because it advanced there liberal narrative just as in the Duke lacrosse case they were disappointed that woman had not been race they were disappointed\nAnd remember the a writer named aerial do most further Stephen Colbert Meryl Late Show on CBS today she tweeted quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh's life unquote facts their mentality\nThey exactly that's where they're coming from and and shame on anybody and everybody who feels that way I Would ever my narrative it is is I Do I Will never be happy that someone else suckered in order for me to advance my narrative\nWhen the letter was happy that Brett Kavanaugh as his wife and children his mom and dad they're happy that he went through so much pain than joy from the sorrow he's feeling on these false charges that makes ... times to be quite happy\nHe's actually and shame on all of them and we've got to teach them a lesson in about three or four well we got a sweet these people out of office I don't care what\nWe got about ... to vote you got to vote normal people don't vote Joe you're a great on marriage\nThank you\nThank you

Peterson live from Los Angeles California torn my cabinet and more\nAnd now African Americans finally or why there's been some polling that seemed to indicate\nThat the president has about a thirty percent approval rating\nAmong African Americans and if that's the case the Democratic party is done it's a minimalist party from the coast from\nMajor city you'll see red right now to see the shining the\nPlaques return to their traditional\nRepublican home is over for the modern Democrats\nStill counting on the great American Boy\nShe made a promise to black people that\nThe Republicans were trying to carry on a project\nIn the in the ghetto right but she said I'm not gonna last Republicans doodads and not all that are not gonna let them turn out to project I'm going to build more for you\nAnd making that kind of ... and black voters in her district while she's living in a four point three million dollar home suburbs to have to be concerned about the climate of violence that's happening in those areas\nPossible that the worst place for an African American to live in America is in a black congressional district no matter where it is you take this twenty five or thirty blocks rational districts\nAnd it's the worst place for black folks to live anywhere in the country but there are so good at avoiding responsibility for the implementation and the results of their policy yeah there are so good at blaming everyone but themselves\nWill will blacks vogue ever look at themselves and they look at our status\nWhat do you have to lose whatever they'll get themselves in Los Angeles Chicago Cincinnati New York and saying wait a minute we're lousy education systems we have no job creation we're rampant crime ramping abortion rampant welfare and the Democratic party been here for fifty or sixty years\nAnd it's amazing to me you're going to have this little result blaming everyone else to take no responsibility like Maxine Waters\nAnd I can promise you that these are not going to get better for them until they do take a look at themselves and they can't responsibility for their own lives and until they realize that the Democrats have been lied to them for Seventy years or so\nAnd uh they never intended and they never were doing the same for them they don't want them better they want them brainwashed calmed down and do more lives because that's how you control them\nYou can't control a more personal and more people you have to be more like them you have to keep them angry and went out of the Democrats want more power whenever they want to get in a boat\n... racism because they know they could crowd is phony ideal racism that most of the ice will go into a hypnotic trashed\nAnd walk right into the voting booth and vote for the Democrats that's why they keep using that\nAnd it's not going to change until the glasses take responsibility and into why people stop being afraid of the phony words but I saw suffering not because there's a lot of racism or due to lack of moral character the destruction of the family and limit on at some point to the Democratic plantation bill well\nYou know in Chicago look one McDonnell was a young man\nWho was threatening large numbers of people with a knife and they didn't know what is the time he was with PCP which isn't a crazy drunks and then he was shot by a cop who made a mistake the cop should not a shot him the way he was shot he was kind of walking away from the committed split second life and death decision that was wrong cops are Todd\nThan somebody in the knife within Twenty one feet of your being it takes once in a second for them to take a knife and stab you\nSo now it looks like one live in Chicago can be misused to advance their political agenda which has aid comes at the same time seven hundred\nAmericans living in Chicago will be dead this year four thousand are going to get shot including now boy wouldn't have Berlin put on fire there is no marches no protests no ... none about a little boy and a barrel who wouldn't joined a gang\nLike moved on but if you can find years ago and she's going to come to me and made a mistake\nThat the company fundraising tool\nAs a matter of fact when is a black or white or black cop or white or black situation they celebrate that they love it when that happened because it opened up as you just said and open up opportunities for fundraising\nAnd it can accuse why people making a lot and just see that but I think the Kennedy White people and it's all for the purpose of more power and wealth for themselves\nThey don't care about black people they don't care about white people they don't care about illegal aliens they don't care about the children they care about gaining power and wealth\nAnd so that's why they jump on those type of situation and pushed it alive that the cops are called by led to the police brutality and they support of of like cabin or a cat for Nick\nThey can put the dinosaur Neal and then turning their backs on the fly around the country are at the football games because they want this far out there that is to why Republicans but it's about power and wealth\nFor the Democratic party and no one else\nWell Jesse ... you and I am a lot more yesterdays tomorrow yes\nAnd uh I like to think each of us from Cincinnati in from us and let's say had some minimal impact\nIn the lives of those who might want to listen and change in in Los Angeles is now overrun with illegal aliens which hurts black folk can you tell us in Los Angeles I see a little bit in Cincinnati but in Los Angeles Chicago Memphis New York what is the status of African Americans in relationship to illegal aliens from Mexico\nIt's devastating in the world really knew how destructive is over there are in South central LA east LA cops and wives\nThey and they will be here as they would demand that the the police officer and the government do something illegal alien game members are coming in and have come in first number one they're taking away day labor day job some blacks who can't get rid of a job because they're not educated don't know how to go out there and do a\nBit by less energy cross and the crime that has crossed the borders into south central LA or be on\nA word is devastate a lot of black leave his house or LA they moved back to the south they move into a Oregon and Arizona and places like that they're looking for a safe haven because Maxine Waters and a black leadership over there would not do anything about it\nIn the media and others are given a foster impression\nThat black or Hispanic again all all they are not may hate one another spin hate the fact that these people coming in and taken over their schools and neighborhoods\nAnd jobs if it's so bad that at one point but Chris ... has joined forces to fight against ... good game members because they are supported by drug laws from Mexico\nAnd the other thing in Los Angeles to the news the hotter the Nineteen different languages and dialects yes\nOne cannot function in an environment where every student who is speaking a different language or dialect is entitled to under federal law may person out there still had to translate everything happening in class one can imagine the chaos when you're in a classroom at thirty to forty students speaking maybe ...\nWhen you're in a classroom at thirty to forty students speaking maybe twenty or thirty different languages which no one has understood in behavior and norms are not followed and mom and dad don't exist in the home front to back up the teacher yeah that's the one that the reason black folks are being decimated Los Angeles\nAnd and I you know I work with a by some of those areas and a lot of them and just dropping out of school because they say that the teachers are put into focus on the one that cast the image\nAnd put it into focus more the focus on illegal alien than they are the citizens\nAnd so and the parents are not paying attention because most of the kids are coming from single parent homes ... women who were born in America those who were born in this country\nSeventy seven percent of their children are born out of wedlock so they don't have parents who are paying attention and it is a feeling I loved and ... at home and asked who they're just dropping out and hardly any goes by without a fight between illegal aliens\nAnd and the black kids there so it's a real it's devastating to build a cat fight or just\nYou're an educated men may be a lot of self taught like I Am but I can imagine being a black kid\nIn Los Angeles or Chicago or Memphis or Denver Cincinnati or New York here sixteen years old\nYou have no functional family you know you're a functionally illiterate you can't go to high school because you're kicked out or do learn a damn thing nothing's being taught\nYou have no job future you have no capability and forming a permanent relationship with a woman and getting married having a family and having your own property now the devastating and that is the light and that is the life and a lot of literally tens of millions\nOf black and brown and poor white kids in America today and I don't see do you see anything changing\nA short of a miracle from God I don't fear\nYou know my non profit organization bond the Brotherhood organization over new destination for the last twenty eight years now we have been rebuilding family by rebuilding their mass oh we've been able to help some of those boys from those areas but it's overwhelming at this point and he ... the government to you and\nMe in a CPA and others are covered it up because they did a power well it just seemed like a hopeless situation right now\nAnd in fact in most almost all the urban areas in the country Donald Trump Republican Paul Ryan Mitch McConnell got nothing to do with running the large cities in the country they're all Democrats so something's wrong educationally crime why something wrong with the welfare state something wrong with\nLike a job creation oh why didn't in the media and lay down at the doorstep of the Democratic party\nBecause they ... they don't want to they media is an advocate for the Democratic party\nLiberals they hate the contrary to hate was right to hate good and they could use by people for personal gain whenever they want to gain power they have especially agenda they pay you just terminating against us is racism you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nFrom the city of angels Pacific Ocean good morning good

including the psycho man the him which was popularized by or different of ramen moody the originator of the term\nNear death experience and let us bring in Joshua ... worn right now hello there Mr Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight it's Halloween the event oh I Love it\nOr we're going to dig into this extremely creepy thing that's like a man the mirrors I also have an update for you about time warp in UFOs\nA layer on we're going to give away some free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday and there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with you joined\nThe way I'm bum 'cause I've got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of me will be with you OK\nWell the you know what when people say that to me it means something so thank\nGod for that aren't the cycle man the of it's a small enclosed area set up with a chair dim lighting the mirror is angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd the number of other people in person in the ... technique um and it it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager because\nI started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the uh local newspaper and I found again and again\nWhen I Would go into a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and say this is the most talented room and I would look around and the two mirrors facing each other\nA it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I find a room that had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirror of\nThat magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomenon\nUm there are a number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors faith each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infant a tunnel\nRight like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light as electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of white which operates\nHas some sort of a portal that these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at the mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know what consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite tunnel of consciousness there and it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of these spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to cry by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek highly polished stone\nBut there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective of substance you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state then if your intention\nAll that and you're going to a meditative state then if your intention is to have a paranormal experience\nYou have an experience Georgia and I want everybody to understand that I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like state no no\nWhen you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect if you will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional\nSeemingly ... portrayal figure that will appear right in front of your head to toe and it's being can come up to you and not only speak to you but touch\nAnd so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho man the ... they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased um other than he would take you through a period of time that could be days\nWhere he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find the reminds you of her and he pictures and he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there your mind is charged with the intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through\nNow when this become as very scary as when you have people who experiment or you know people talk about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble or the right thing you have people who go in there\nAnd they just say I don't care I just want to see something and when you go in there with that attitude\nThat's a dangerous ... you you are well you know you get what you ask for right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a psycho Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact uh over the years I've done many experiments where you know we'll set up a camera to see if we can record they experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair\nAnd so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall\nOf a dimly lit room with a chair in front of\nIt I bought that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kinda stuff yeah I think we can get the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays LAPD laugh in the background\nAnd maybe some white noise I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through ... him experience and I would say that a lot of people chores or is it a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody\nAnd three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent\nBut I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had the full on it and\nPerhaps dramatic Josh there with us we'll come back and talk about time warps in some UFOs here's our first emerging artists Paul Rubin from Santa Barbara California was a song called the winter when\nWay to win the slowing down in\nA dorm\nSign up for ... ... email newsletter that goes to go see I'm done\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert and it turns out that that is\nOf the road out in the desert and it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in the state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred\nAnd so uh I have of course continue now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um\nI mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way it was very cool\nThat you played on a a group from Ashville North Carolina grew apart [laughter] you know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and er here that's where I have my history museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very sitting ... Nashville group [noise]\nBut anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share\nWith you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context okay\nUm and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just coincidence or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that is sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to view it\nAnd of course I never believe in coincidence stern\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe in that would mean you'd believe there can be in effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does of Jordan new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media was not it was not no I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop\nAnd this was a program that was of course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was it was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind\nUh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow\n[noise] now leader in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and saw the very night\nThat I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force so here I Am next to Harry fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announces there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around that same time Georgia nap whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in the state of\nNevada and a good one\nYes he is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine if any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings\nHe goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management in safeguarding for classified information are not sufficient\nHe goes on to say even more and this is the one that really gets me associated exotic\nNow that ... that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies\nLikely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science\nElectromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics given that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries an unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here\nSo he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified hide independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas he's saying George we have discovered an exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it right we we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nWhat he's saying is that didn't come from them\nNew right so if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic where could have possibly come from um I also want to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to Des where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project in some of these topics this thirty eight of them are one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking wormholes in space time gravity wave communication war drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientist and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there's one that's redacted so anyway\nGetting back to the timeline so that also came out right around the same time and a ... with which July twenty fifth All right so that said\nNow we move up to August August of twenty eighth team\nRight around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville joined the mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry which is very similar\nTo a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb and they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else from a beach to nail us air force base\nFrom a beach to nail us air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore guests when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my
