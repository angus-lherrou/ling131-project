sometimes as an invited guest because you could see ... the person who died\nOut right and that's what I mean in all honesty I could probably go to three funerals a day seven days a week that so many people want to talk to their loved one for the last time\nYou use she's always knew their cash skip during the funeral were or are they is\nNormally yes standing at the foot of the casket because that's usually where the life family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects\nAnd so anything that said they can hear because they're very very nosy and as to what people are saying about them or how they look or you know they they like to know that stuff\nAnd but in the last seven or eight years\nThis business where there's tables set off to the side with all these photos in and their life in pictures\nAnd if there's a group of people standing around by those pictures than the spirit will go over there and listen to what they're saying and it's funny because I've already been there where a man said see that lady with that had on over there I said yep\nHe said well she's saying that that picture happened when we were in Missouri she's out or her mind we weren't in Missouri when that happened we were in Pennsylvania and it's like okay you know I'm not going to go argue with your lady friend over there so\nSo they're very interested in what goes on it is very interesting usually well it has to be an immediate family member that invites me you just can't believe how many nosy neighbors there are no harm on at any rate I go to this ... this particular funeral home demand was standing at the foot of his casket\nAnd he looked at me he said you can see me I said I can and I told them who I was and he said I bet my daughter problems you she would find somebody crazy like you\nAnd I'm thinking\nOkay and so I said well I said yes your daughter did call me and he says I bet my son doesn't know anything about this\nAnd I said to the to the daughter I said does your brother in law you called me she says oh yeah he's really into this I just sort of look to your grandmother and gave him aside and so he said will call my son overhead her call my son over\nSo he says to me tell my son to go home right now that my brother bill as in my basement trying to break open my gun cabinet oh boy and I looked at him and I said now you're telling a crazy person that I mean you know he called the crazy\nWas it was rather than try to do so man or woman was you know just wanted the collection of gun law he wanted to just keep them from Sharm\nRight so I said to the sun I said your uncle bill is in your dad's house right now in the basement trying to break open the gun cabinet and the sun looks at me he goes no he's not\nI just saw the half hour ago and I said ... point them out to me he's lucky he says you know I don't really see him\nI Am the father said my house is two streets over I says apparently your father's house is only two streets over\nAnd he would do to stir and she said I didn't tell her and I said please go home and then go down the basement and see what your uncle's doing\nOh sure enough

when you see him come on in his house and gone his garage to leave or others grass you're sitting there in your kitchen watching him going oh you jerk I Hope you break your knee or I don't like you why don't you move\nYou know look at it this way as I said to you George tomorrow morning at ten o'clock\nI'm going to have some minor surgery say a prayer for me I Will say a prayer for you\nExactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen every time she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't debt debt\nNo

what\nGoes around comes around that's true right but I mean the the recipient of the curve ... for example oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI think if it's done with enough intent or if you actually go to someone for as cheap as five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody they pretty much know it easily\nThe three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one two or all three of them and and no particular order is health money or relationships\nAnd you know of all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problems dating and

to somebody like me or you look at my one book that he has the instructions on how to remove negative energy once that's taken off and anybody can remove negative energy or somebody you can't do it to yourself\nBut you can definitely have a friend do it\nAnd once that is released and gone you're fine the same thing with health if a person has a curse on them and they've got a bad health problem and

you they don't even have to believe that all they had to do is give me their permission\nMy grand daughter got a promotion where she was working and uh apparently she got a promotion over somebody who saw they were entitled to that job yet and she did it fair and square and you know decent and everything she's great girl\nAnd strange things started happening to her I mean things that would always go well things were really kind of screwed up and she called me up one day in ...\nI think somebody put a curse on me and and I should Ari let's let's think about this for a moment ... who would want to do this to you I mean you're ... you're a nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over\nAnd I went off and then they should look up all of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes ... and sure enough it ended up being a person who apologized and took the curse off apparently and everything's fine\nOr stop sending negative energy to hurry though that war off right exactly so\nMy question is when someone does get hit by a Kurdish mhm how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who puts a curse on them\n[noise] that's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is\nUm did you take somebody away from their spouse in other words that you have an affair with a married person believe you me a woman you know ... ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to put somebody in the nose\nA woman gets angry at somebody wins meaner than men she's gonna curse that person and because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens\nAnd but the bottom line is this who cares who did it just get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself you have to call Murray and when ... how do you get at all\nNope you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and again they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and and where to go speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nIs every buddy susceptible to a curse word about someone who's got so much energy and positivity can they put up the force field to kind of block it and she you\nKnow unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the curses removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off the end there's so many different kinds of curses\nI mean there's one that that may be has to be do something at every full moon or generational curses they just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were first\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed\nMost people as long as they you know I give them that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have a curse removed offer them again it does not affect them as a matter of fact I think about it ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's a game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York\nAnd so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time they're ... gets up the whole stadium is going to lose you jerk don't hit the ball getting out and then they clap as he does it make it an energy thrown on that person's\nOh yeah absolutely and that's why the home team is an advantage\nExactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on the airplane to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's gonna be added on every other stadium that is not his home state yeah\nDating him that is not his home state yeah so and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players will\nHim all plans on the slump let's say you know really\nGood a slum or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time and the other thing too it's especially ball players [noise]\nLook the dead fans that goes that hey no stadiums you know you couldn't walk up and stand next to LeBron James at a basketball game you would never get on the court\nThe guards and everybody would keep you away your but gee if your ghost who's going to stop you know exactly\nWhat about the dream state visiting the dead and for other things\nOnce a person has crossed into the light they can absolutely come in and out of your dreams you can talk to them you can get all kinds of information from them you can get a dog\nA kid I mean it is so comforting to be able to talk to these people they look good they kept the uh happy they look healthy and bought give the person has not crossed over you will never dream of them earth of spirits cannot get dream\nNow is an earthen spirit is in your bedroom while you're sleeping\nYou're going to have bizarre dreams technicolor Lao flashy um world wakes you up and you're breathing hard but that goes was not in your dreams\nWhen
