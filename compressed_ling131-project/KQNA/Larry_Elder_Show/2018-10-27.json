and tomorrow night when I'll be hosting coast to coast again coming up tomorrow night\nLooking forward to a season with the which it's in our first hour we'll talk about uh about Salem, Massachusetts again because we had a great show but about witchcraft in Salem a couple of months ago but in this case\nUh we'll be talking about in regard to Halloween and some of the festivities it will be taking plates and uh and then also the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nAbout the scariest story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true\nAnd also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James\nWho do the butter no as a sportswriter he writes ah he followed the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the ... he was not\nIn he's not in LA tonight\n... originally we had um scheduled I'm Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out\nHe wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to finish in after all which is great because in the tradition of like you know Freddie and Jason and Michael and all of the Halloween stuff up it's a creepy story and you're going to want to hear it coming up tomorrow night\nOn coast to coast but it won't be any better than tonight will do open lines later on we'll tell you some of the subjects will get to\nIn the news segment in a minute but but by the way speaking of the world series I think we're competing against it right now we're still in in the late innings still tied up unless something changed uh it was a great game\nAnd I don't want to accuse Larry King of being a vampire you know I'm not saying leery of empire but I was looking at him behind home plate and I'm just saying this um he may not be a vampire\nI'm just saying this um he may not be a vampire but long after I'm dead Larry King will be onto a wife number not with another round two kids and still be home plate\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's it's\nReally about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... in labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Ilan mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got a finger in this whole neural net\nA business that says the really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine this because we're already doing it with mice and in in the very near future um you know it it's pretty certain that we're going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak really what amounts to a a very fine fisherman's met\nThink of it think of it as a fisherman snatch so you injected into\nThe brain cavity of a mouse and when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain\nAnd then kind of a integrate itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this neural net has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it and the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which\nWe can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that the lawn mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you can have a wireless connection that's that's even better\nBut one of the one of the things that you know on mosques foreseen\nIs a day when we eat with the use the one of these narrow math\nWe can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't need a keyboard or anything like that so I think that is the beginning of the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts are memories are in code them digitally of it's not at all farfetched anymore\nOnce you had that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon and so you talk about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa\n[laughter] way way out there right and so easily easily a whole you know it's not just a ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold of a person's entire\nA lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistically can read about that tonight he will I I think that's the way to go not cryogenic 'cause I think ... is a kind of an old school I'm not\nSaying that it's not going to be around it it will be but I think these other technology is much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know ... and so and I'm not going to try and see what you said to me it's been a I think it's fair to say and this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward\nIs when we use terms like thinking about doing or you know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when I see the future because what we do now is the frontier\nBut that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically that's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because you know the ... if we take our science fiction movies seriously\nThen we're often reminded that starts off as a really good idea [laughter]\nCan go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\n... thank you thank you [laughter] absolutely\nI Know absolutely and and you're right there this book deals with\nWe're right at the house in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes it in for some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies ... are are kind of one foot in the presence and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it you know it isn't a naval or\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about pie in the sky want you know the sweet bind by one day\nNo these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about hey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is and mortality in any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have a ... they we are creating these are incredible robots artificial intelligence that we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at will so so yes you're absolutely right\nWell so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing is the near future but it is it's it's an ... right now it's it's crazy\nWell and so I'm reminded of the so the ... song\nUm which I inevitably come back to an subjects like the um history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla and and the ... the I think this is where I'm sort of curious about your approaching this because\nThis book is published by\nA publishing company which is known for being state based\nAnd and I think the issues in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion of\nNot just doing things because we can\nBut because we should do and the officer really important in there too so you know just because we're on the threshold them doing something on we do that and ... who how are we going to make a decision on the implications of when we decide yep this is where we're going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I have to give him credit they with their idea um and you know they said basically a you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you've been reporting science all your life and I've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about the threat\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I describe our perfect base here and there\n... it's just like you know the old dragnet series you know the facts ma'am right Andrew ... that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand what now that you can imagine\nOh no I've read through to you you're very very thorough yup\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last\nFinal chapter and I thought you know I Can't just\nServe this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so here you're my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise]\nUm I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence that really spectacular many of them are really in a a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous\nWhy I think we need now because we are at this threshold of\nCreating for ourselves a world that can either be grim or great\nAnd so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other\nIs to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist than the sense that all I cared about was science I\nGrew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA than on the Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be an export into wisdom and Buddhism and Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism\nAnd finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested either like a pie or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith faith I'm a Christian\nAnd I take my my face very very seriously and so\nWhen I say we need to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion\nAncient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist sets a phase them there are some innovations in this book that I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\nThen that's where we'll go with the next pitch the classic study so much so that the pope rodents fetus and ... on it just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael Guillen list next on coast to coast am to me about\nThat that speech in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about about the\nAnd Michael when you were talking about about the idea of preserving your physical life on this planet\nIs like ... whether that was through uploading a brain and putting it into something you know into a robot or something\nYou know even that it makes me question whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for them what is the ultimate would see in huge for that um other than our own human vanity we become immortal\nYeah I agree with you in and uh I think in another concern a in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of effect is we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening\nIs very expensive um you know never mind are trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let's let's talk about some of the technology that is being used to let's say a I'm a help treat macular degeneration I Want to just pick that as an example\nThere is such a hard way in California right\nThere's a company in California that is a marketing a retinal implants for people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff costs you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policies so a lot of this technology that that are aimed at improving our how Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving their mortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people at least eight people will I'm\nAble to to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility of there being a human revolution you know we often talk about and science fiction often ...\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility of the way this technology is shaping up right now is for people who have been kind of disenfranchised\nUm are marginalized by this technology will just be get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking in the we're taking it as a\nBehind and and and and and we're not going to we're not gonna take it anymore and so and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ring or I Know you talk like that to the people in Salem using that kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta really on a limb there you know and [laughter]\nYeah so I figured it the late night shows so you're\nNot trying to lay down and now I Know\nIt's late but you know never my reckoning I got to worry about my wife you know outside that why you said why but uh [laughter] but um\nBut I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these what they're calling bug out houses rent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world\nOn the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again but when he was stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape and this is a serious thing I Hope some I quote former Google engineers and a Google executives are and and others\nWho say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay but who knows the ... ... ... ... ... ... yes the idea of having a bug out house right yeah that's like I mean every ... every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has a has that philosophy\nRight you know ... to ... and yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that belief that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point\nI I'm thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance right they're done these you know they they ... that was there a moment\nAnd the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce said living dinosaurs just because we can\n... and the and the notion to that for example when you talk about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we ... we we could\nYou know a ... quantify society hits the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of whom and then if that becomes the ... the class that's perpetuated\nI Would say again they had their chance this it has to there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else who's going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from she will time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah yeah no it it it's interesting I by the way I interviewed ... this is just a funny aside when in fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and\nI had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere and the ... at the after party and Jeff bloom was there and\nA bunch of other guys and I went up to ... I said Jeff you know you're always like playing a scientist or not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I said show I I'm just curious I said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up for what he just\nNot just a job and you know he has the housing is appointed in his answer I thought he was going to say oh yeah you know I majored in physics at\nCollege right now you know [laughter] but no job for him\nBut yeah they ... I ... I Love you bringing that up being the dinosaurs had their chance [noise] it's really an indication of how the earth how the world works how the universe works\nFor design work is designed to work exactly yeah and\nYou know a lot you know you're somebody's religious beliefs aside for a moment let's just talk like strict the science sure um ... what what were you to learn is that\nUh these species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's a media or whether it's a\nA temperature change or or it's a rampant disease that ... that I mean you know like the woolly mammoths the saber tooth\nCats and so forth and so on and the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book you can't help but wonder why are we doing here and then I think what Arthur C Clark one set and it stuck with me\nHe said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\n[laughter] I don't know why do\nYou know and you wonder are we like outsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just thing to clarify a half with a staff thinking that you know we're going to improve life\nWith a staff thinking that you know we're going to improve life the we're going to prove the human condition and in fact just the opposite happens we do ourselves in I mean that's a real possibility\nAnd and and and you think of Jeff Goldblum said they had their chance maybe some some creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance now he blew it\nLooked down and now here's an age now let me bring up a little differently yeah there was a ... ... humans killed off species they didn't die out naturally they were killed off\nAs opposed to say evolution they weren't they weren't allowed to follow their evolutionary cycle that was truncated right by\nYou know the fact that they you know some giant bird and New Zealand lead these really big exit you know human could eat off for three days and so that move me no gun so I mean I I realize you can make a Darwinian arguments with that but I think there are some species like some\nLike some bare earth some tiger whenever that if we cloned that there and brought it back in ... introduced it to the wild not enough time has passed\nThat he couldn't read absorbed that back into the the natural flow of our evolutionary cycles um but I Do think when we start looking into the future and then we started making all these plans of who's going to beat and who's going to not be\nNatural and I think you'd get super well to use the words in your book ominous but I think it goes ... I didn't become dumb writes scary because who is going to be making these decisions once that technology becomes more facile\n[noise] yeah yeah you're you're you're raised in a good point you know I Do talk about of these the extinction effort going on right now I'm that primarily focused on the woolly mammoth\nAnd I I remember when I was at ABC News I was actually invited to come to Russia where there there there were a group of scientists I think the French guy was in charge of the group as I recall and", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "27"}
