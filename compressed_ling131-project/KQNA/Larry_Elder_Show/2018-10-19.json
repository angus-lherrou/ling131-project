in the lakes sinking in down you were going in and angel underwater laps\nRight absolutely and she said you know you could come with us if you'd like but it would be better if you stayed here because we had a lot of work for you to do\nAnd I said I'm really not interested and at that moment I don't think I had much choice because by cuts in Georgia to realize my sister and I travel can we pulled us both out and kind of an ceremony faith or with on the beach and that was back in my body\nBut I wanted to tell you that it was a glorious experience I've had many that was really one of the first\nAnd I I learned a lot from that I learned not to let my to teach me how to swim for one there probably isn't the message from that\nExactly it's just going to tell you the same thing happened to me when I was a kid except I didn't have an agility experience terms with my father's brother my uncle was the twins\nAnd we're walking in a lake and uh I'm side by side next to my uncle and a hole in this leak him just like you don't I when I must have been about eight years old Joyce and I'm On I and I thought this is I'm dead\nEnd jobs went back\nTo haunt me back up my pop right back up and then my uncle didn't even know I went under just kept walking them put it was the weirdest feeling but I thought that was it for me it was a strange feeling\nCorrect I wanted to tell you I don't know if you ever went to my website but I Would watch the times\nOh thank you I was that the world Trade Center when nine eleven occurred because my husband and I had an apartment very club through like a thousand feet from some of the world Trade Center and we moved there about a month before buildings came down a notch\nYeah we were just there a month and on the day we moved and Jack and I looked up and the world Trade Center with towering over our little building on liberty court and I I had you know we had to each other but I think that we're finished well exactly a month later they'd come down as you know and we were\nThat we had to leave the building and because it was unsafe to be there so many people in that area had to leave\nBut we came back a few days later when it was safe and I had the most the nominal experience and that's what my website where um what happened I I I actually had gone to sleep and I was awake and and tell them to go into the living room\nAnd to help people to cross over because they were coming through and they had created a portal in my building and in my apartment\nAnd the people who were had just died were coming through and being released out into the onto the harbor by the statue of liberty and that was Battery Park so that was one of the many incredible experiences I've had and thousands of people see they just kept coming coming I guess you know\nAre you still out in that area Joyce\nNo we saw that apartment when my husband passed away and then now I'm In Florida\nBut uh [noise] just like so many incredible things that people would just try to remember some of the things that happened to them I think most people say well if that's just than it was something that just happened but write them down recording her dreams as I'm sure your your next guest has got to tell us\nBut write everything down and try to analyze or you're experiencing the best way to develop your yes pay is to try to remember and to try to record what you're experiencing and really happen that way it open up more of that that consciousness you'll be able to help other people as well\nSo that's that's my primary recommendation record your dream to record your experiences\nI had a I don't know if I should if you're ready for me to tell you another one of a one my phenomenal experiences about a\nLot of money yeah sure absolutely\nOkay trucks thank you I had never heard of a thing but uh I had an odd about maybe four years ago I had this out of body experience where I did astro travel which I had\nReally no memory of doing ever before I think we all travel and we just forget it but we don't know about it but this was unusual because I went to a um a Tibetan Ramos staring at today the\nLlama whose name was ... and you know in Tibet George on the day the baby is born that's the first name he was born on a Tuesday so same Tuesday ... ...\nAnd if you go to his website it's a lobster ramp a dot org but he came to me and I went on this phenomenal trip to\nIslamic story and he had a the ability to answer my questions though this man had many walking experiences supposedly he was over many hundreds of years of age he had taken different bodies on the last one more out he took a new body on and he was living as an Englishman\nAnd it's finally carnation out here at the Nineteen eighties so I was at Islam is Terry and it was phenomenal and I came back into my body brought me back and I was waking up\nHe said to me don't forget my name and I had never heard I couldn't remember it but my husband was there and I said jak before I wake up please write this down and\nI found that out ... and I've misspelled it slightly put an H on at birth didn't belong and then he was a lot of things gone but I went to his website and that was blown away because she has written\nA maybe a couple of hundred books that are free anyone go to the political\nExtremely cell and just really an amazing amazing man and not only was he a doctor but he was also just so many different incarnations it makes you realize that we don't really have to die I said man also if it locking and George didn't believe that that's possible it could take on\nA further uh incarnation\nThink George many things are possible ... really do I mean I'm I'm Still wrestling with the living in dying process and exactly what it is we crossover um it's it's kind of ...\nRussia um it's it's kind of strange for me I mean we've got a picture up the coast to coast the dot com bubble goes on the Titanic a a strange picture you match spirit to be too don't you\nYes of course You're welcome to share it if it if you'd like to have it yet I was on I think it was challenged nine in New York and New Jersey W. A. R. and I was reading a group of people who are on the stage\nIn the meantime because my husband always had a camera on his neck it took a picture and you can see and my website that this all this spirit energy throughout the whole group and it's really wonderful spirit photography\nAnd that to my website ... dot com so they uh experiences are very like you have a lot can anyone really explain what or ups are that have you seen ...\nI Know I I've seen pictures but I mean I haven't seen them you know out in the natural state you know into a\nCrazy charge you can only pick it up on camera guy on the actual pictures but you can't see them in person I convince a celebration when my niece was married\nThere were so many arms and all the photograph because it was they were just so many people from the other side we're very very happy to be there that are came out a camera George I wanted to I'm just asking you said before about the data processing I saw my dad passed away when he took his last breath\nAnd it was one of the most phenomenal experiences because\nAll the people in the room saw this ad in the hospital the nurses and the doctors who are there he actually left through his cell or plaque says that's like a huge cloud that just came out he wave\nTo me and he said he was leaving and then it took a very big sigh and then just came out of the solar Plex went straight to the ceiling\nDid you see the spirit or the ...\nI thought that huge white men going to the ceiling that's called the actual plaza marine\nProbably or it could be a spirit body or ... whatever you call it but I had incredible experiences with fans is also where I attended them some most of them are not", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "19"}
