S. M. C. A. we're not going to call NAFTA any longer but it is a new a North American free trade agreement that will open up orders a between all three countries or it has modernized because America has a better deal and so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing a minimum wage out another country right and that's one of the things I don't like about this deal so there you got me on that one that's not you know we would we want to Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of out of business all that well that's one of the things I think is bad economics in this plan\nOut show I'm going to agree with you on that one\nSo on par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers are up for a candidate has imposed against us and Louis terriers and beer and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nYeah not just otherwise it's just one quick thing they're not just terrorists but also there were a lot of it you know as you know we've talked about this on your show before the war and more of what Americans producers called intellectual property with a new\nComputer software we produce cotton sin copyrights and and uh technologies and when it comes to some of these countries like Canada and something and certainly China and\nAnd and many other countries in Asian countries they just steal ever intellectually property and this new I'm now ... very strongly that this new uh I'll call it the U.S a CNA has much better protections for an ... an American electoral poppies all countries are going to use our products they actually pay for them\nEven more is my guest he served as a ton of economic advisor to President Trump between sixteen campaign Steven you recall President Obama famously saying these jobs aren't coming back with magic wand does a president have what do you think people who felt that way feel right now about this deal\nWell first of all you know what to actual out Obama was referring to as he said you know he can't get us to four percent economic growth and he can't bring manufacturing jobs in construction jobs back to this country and they kept bringing coal jobs back and maybe just maybe Donald Trump that was out of them I have a magic wand because we do we do have\nA job since the election one million additional construction manufacturing and mining jobs and this happened Larry because of the things you talk about every night on your show we lower the burden of taxation we lower the burden of regulation we allow companies to do their thing and got government off the back of our businesses\nAnd you know the twenty seven million small businessmen and women in this country respond to that and they are hiring more people I don't know if you saw the news today that uh\nThat uh one of the major um Amazon I Believe it was\nThere were all raised their wages to Fifteen dollars an hour I don't want the government to tell companies to do that but they're doing it because it's a tight labor market the economy is booming it's hard to get workers uh this is exactly what we tried to do when we put this plan together Larry Kudlow and I for Donald Trump two years ago\nEven more is my guess he's an economist even take the last minute and talk to us about about debt and about the economists programs and even Obama said we're an automatic planted a this president has done a lot of things we talked about the tax cuts the regulatory relief but he's also spent money especially on defense and so our debt has increased are you worried about that\nWell you shouldn't be but I'll tell you one statistic about you know because the economy is doing so well now I mean you know we've had two straight quarters now four percent growth and then Obama I never got us you know the last year he was present at one point six percent that additional growth\nFor corn is the latest congressional budget office for cash has increased attorney or a economic al ...

example I was in Newfoundland about ten years ago and I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking icebergs and part of the reason that I went there was because uh there's been a series of lobsters are the that have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are they washed up there but I also wanted to go investigate some of that and then also Spring Hill jak signing up there but I thought it was up there I came across um a place called lake crescent\nUm and it's this little you know new Finland is it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have a a like a twenty foot\nA metal sculptor thing for this thing

I'm with you [laughter] that's great stuff okay so\nI'm I'm before I go on you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween so I\nI Googled that boom towns your article that even written 'cause you you do a lot of writing your and author of course that you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too\nBut I saw this great article from you and I was like oh my gosh here's the guarantee you know it's all looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody who was writing from somebody else in the book or anything like that you actually research so\nTo tell me about the origins now we're ... we're just now learning the origins of Willis wean the jealousy origins of Halloween\nSee ... I I I Want a two hundred years from now when people were researching or he will if we can accomplish this conversation I'll love it my grandkids will be be all over it they'll be like that\n[laughter] no I Want to one of the things I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not big on the on the holidays meaning of Christmas is fun ... but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular or you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists guess all the the the conservative from time to get a little touchy about that 'cause they think it's really the the ... which is not but if it's what it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into\nAnd that's why I really love Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy as a fascinating history I'm basically Halloween a ... you know as as with most the biggest source of sort of full Couric\nThese events on holidays there is not just one streamlined back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime but basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October through your first a Celtic deal it festival called a so when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much information about just because it was that it was so long ago and there was no the film ... records or pre ... fragmentary\nBut it was basically an annual ... meeting at the end of the year of the harvest\nAnd it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the sauces and at the time when I'm you know the the snow's falling in you know plants are dying um so it had this connection to uh to darkness\nBut it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we can we think we think of the darkness [laughter] being you know something faster but to them there was a very it was ... an analyst\nPoint of view it wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons\nUm and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so it wasn't scary it was like yes there was a time to you know to a store grains and to you know give thanks\nI Am too you know to a store a grand and to give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this man [noise]\nUm and it was believed that are that are on that day that the um [noise] uh the the the separation between the world with a sexually fan and porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we weren't happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other hand you know the the folk or what have you on the world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day the the the the barrier between them becomes more porous\nUm and so this is why uh the the began talking about how parents would would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to ah the spirits and they were basically all around us\nAnd it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world are porous\nUm the the barrier between them but also um in later incarnations of Halloween it was also at a time it's porous\nAnd so what you find is that a ... point lead to become Halloween I'm there would be a it'll be a time when I Would be for a time for prophecy\nSo it was this notion that uh you know there's ... there's other world but it's also that the barrier between the present in our future\nAnd so for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different customs that would involve the holy which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them but there were ideas for example that the that are on for example woman born Halloween would be able to tell the future\nUm and there would be the prophecy and often times the prophecy was um either dealing with like people who died the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was often times there's there is very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would uh be with a way to handle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the ... with a look look in the mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection [noise]\nUm and so all these are another one example is a body for Apple you know if you're not near the apple bobbing and there was there was a particular holiday tradition\nThat if you cut a pie if you killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken and he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed\nIt would spell out the initials of your future husband so those are there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and pass the ... coming together\nOn my way may I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night actually I Do it and do it at midnight right\nOn willfully night\nThat's right will swing [laughter]\nWell what about um you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know I I get there are people that say Halloween oh saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that they're they're cool with it you know um but um you know I always see it it's fine I see it\nAs a I I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think in small whether I think of orange and black collars yeah I think a fake little cartoon\nThat we would watch like which is in the goblins and very fun fun things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it and the traditions out of that and\nAnd uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're going to have to take a break here\nBut what we have a ban Radford with us\nHe is an investigator and an end to all the things that were into a as close to the folks here that want to learn every singing um but he also you know there's a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also\nGoes hunting too so stay with the county well let's hear it's Willis wean hanging thee you don't know what you might hear tonight\nCoin 'em and often times they would care with them how to turn up of course that would lead or translate into uh the the the the uh the public and I'm looking at a candle Atlanta the candle in it and the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for\nThe idea was that they would these members go as far as to how say you know yes will prefer if you have a member of your family who's a who's passed on new with you know holding up this this turn up with a candle and I think of is light of the the ... the coach wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the tournament sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if\nYou asked me to read when that's when the pumpkins came in because the pumpkin associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and associate with the harvest and that's that sort of how the the trick or treating after I came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn now move on for months on little olive oil salt pepper um candy I guess I guess an alternative candy at one point in in that like right after the ... like you were talking about\nYeah well I mean it ... it was interesting because again it's sort of the things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what happened is\nThat if you think about it you know again there was the looming going on this and that and then uh the the during this time\nThe the genders had pretty strict social roles and so um and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween by the time when when young girls would would would tying away and with ... think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four teeth of the time who knows\nWhat they did um but you know that that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like\nDuring this time this is when people would go from house to house in the ... the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nYou would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era\nSo that was typically sort of a young man ... you know ... a mixture of this young man's project and the the girls and women would tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and the rituals in terms of you know the prophecy in those sorts of things so [noise]\nSo you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks ... was pretty well established and and that's when ah you know as as the as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they were [noise]\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold in purgatory that's that's a that's a little a little outlandish for the little little too much work for these days\nSo that's when this sort of came down to treats and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid or not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a memory out every now I get to get a silver dollar or are you sometimes you get an apple you're like\nReally really only a capital okay and I like it was it wasn't even that I like it was like some early tart apple was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple did you I didn't say that I'm like Oh thank you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go a long time ago it was great you remember the good how to get there were there were years where you get full size candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that all\nHot and house record where you heard the green in which is right and then married dark so if you if you rented if you were brave enough to go to our house you would get full size bars you know marathon bar needle a handful\nYou're the only ... I I Love the marathon bars but they were letting oil and chocolate and they they were like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're Ukraine those I I haven't heard anybody mention those in decades oh that's all you gotta you gotta you can't hardly I Wish I had been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those any more of those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and we had to go kind of horrible inhale this way money all the other way and you had your son that's when they had those nasty math that you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time\nWe would never like one hand and always had homemade popcorn ball they were delicious and the only time we ever had on they were on 'em and you know back then you can trust people\nAnd then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house that they were a dentist and they only gave away to the French and like I Want to go there you know thank you yeah trick or treat thank you [laughter]\nWell I I should mention that because of all three answers the the the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the the classic a poison candy scares and the reason the and the fact is that that I mean that's\nThat's there there's almost no truth to that uh it's it's widely talked about a friend of mine ... best wrote a book about that um and and you know so when you actually look at\nAt the cases where somebody has actually painted these sorts of things [noise]\nUm if it happens very rarely there there was one case everybody points to it was a case of a man and wrong wrong cargo Brian\nUh who killed his son by leasing his pick to stick to assign a Nineteen Seventy or on but that but but but that that wasn't a stranger that wasn't a stranger tack of that that's one yeah people remember it was", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "07"}
