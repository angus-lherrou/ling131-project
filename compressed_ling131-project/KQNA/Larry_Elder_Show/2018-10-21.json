Democratic Party forced to resign because he posted on social media I stand for the flag I Neal for the cross I'm not making this up\nOr Salvadoran that's the hard way cells wasn't simply a loyal Democrat he was the head of the Allegheny county Pennsylvania Democratic Party also a military veteran you think should be allowed to stick up for America once in a while but now he made the mistake of writing this and a Facebook post quote I stand for the flag and yell at the cross\nNo not so long ago most Democrats would've nodded in agreement that today is hate speech and he lost his job but tonight their losses are gaining marks Elvis joins us now\nMark thanks for coming on the show um did I miss state that I mean did you have to leave her job running the county's Republican rather Democratic Party because of those words on Facebook\nAnd again also a military that\nI stand for the flag or knew lived across loses his job\nWhile I was the executive director of the county party um and you know it's basically that's exactly what happened because of a post which are remind you is over a year ago that I listed that uh I was asked to resign yes\nSo you're a veteran you say you stand for the flag and you were denounced as a racist for that\nCorrect the people who brought this to light tried to tie it to the NFL players taking a knee\nSo I I look I'm confused I I'm not a democratic voter never have been but you know I've been here a long time now a lot of decent patriotic Democrats doesn't seem like that long ago\nIt wouldn't have been weird for the head of a Pennsylvania democratic county party to say I stand for the flag and yell before the cross what it had been five even\nRemember this was the the party DNC that blew the inclusion of God in their platform number that\nThere's a crazy thing to say\nAbsolutely not and and I can tell you that even just last year when the Pittsburgh Steelers decided to stay on the locker room instead of come out for the national anthem\nA one player villain a waiver who's an Army Ranger came out and stood by himself with his hand over his heart and he was not considered a racist so this even as much as a year ago it would not have been unheard of to hear somebody a leader in the party defend the flag\nSo what I mean you're the executive worthy executive director of the party you obviously know a lot of Democrats in your county traditionally democratic county what if what if your ... your former coworker said to you since this happened\nI haven't heard from any of them I understand the party line is that it was a personal matter and I can respect that however those that are elected officials or party members who are not tied with my direct sort of chain of command if you will I have not heard from many of them\nThat's not shocking what does this say to you about how the parties change\nWell it makes me wonder if there is room for moderate Democrats in the Democratic party nowadays um there were some elected officials who said that they acknowledge that they've known me and I'm not a racist however it wasn't sensitive and unfortunately\nIf my patriotism and standing up for family friends has become insensitive or that I think we as Democrats need to stop and reevaluate exactly what we stand for\nStanding up for the flag is considered racist then what happens to the country do you think going forward\nThat's that's a good question I'm a little worried about that\nWhen you're going to do\nWell um I'd like to continue to bring this to light and continue to voice concern for this

morning during the open line segment a number\nOf callers shared their near death experiences or glimpses of an afterlife tonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time and alleged after death communication involving the great American magician escape artist\nHarry Houdini Houdini and his wife best were fears the bunkers of psychic ability mediums and the spiritual this movement in fact Houdini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and there are fraudulent methods Houdini of course died\nOf a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween\nFour days after receiving for unexpected punches to his abdomen\nBy McGill University student backstage at the princes theater in Montreal Canadian connection there on his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his blood wide best he would do show\nThat more than two years after his death\nHis wife best attended a sandwich\nConducted by mediums psychic Arthur for during which forward allegedly channeled the message from Harry using a secret coded message\nPreviously agreed to by Harry and bass initially bad stated publicly and that side and witness testimony that she believed Perry had in fact\nCommunicated to her from the great\nLater however she read candidate and stated publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the say odds\nDespite this beds continue to hold highly publicized San says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nDuring all that time she said she received no communication from Harry finally after the last say also on October thirty first Nineteen thirty six bats gave up\nSaying ten years is long enough to wait for any Matt Thomas ... is a writer and passionate seeker of truth on a lifelong spiritual quest\nMore than ten years ago Thomas wrote an article which he posted online titled\nMore than ten years ago Thomas wrote an article which he posted online titled Houdini afterlife experiment did it work in it he argues it's quite possible Houdini did communicate from the grave during assailants held in January of Nineteen twenty nine\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fan just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where\nShe claimed that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\nAnd Harry's mother the spirit of his mother plays an important part in this whole thing I'm an area was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact\nAnd that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI was he sort of out or in public didn't need any ... ... yeah\nYes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNope nope the heart of\nThis debunking that that uh Harry and bats engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate against the audience was how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photos psychic act or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this\nSecret coded method that that Harry in best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody methods\nUm I think we should have turned out a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of can words and the word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one through can\nAnd number can can also be taken to zero and so this was used to point most commonly to date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry and best first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married they would do this little trick where they would\nHave someone volunteer they'd reach in their pocket political line All right what is the last two days it's on the coastline and they these were which\n... play answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sent tens like quickly area I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural them is to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins advance Salinger hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating doing verbal using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eights were in in the secret code emitted so he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right makes ties right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of the word at times to get to the letters that are passing and pretend that they have a way of doing that and that's what we're used to make this code\nSo they would've had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now ... please speak quickly look be quick and as you say all of this can be found in the ass wait let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical\nDot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry Hi and\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this code because\nAfter the message was delivered to pass and she said that it works somebody quickly said hey this was all in a book is all already published in a book this is no big deal well\nI thought and I read this on line a number of times someone would say within a book but they wouldn't say the name of the book either people are saying it's on page da da da da da da da da\nAnd then I finally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look in Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised\nTo find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county and for all of the twenty five\nCounty and for all of twenty five cents they would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out and eighty five year old book I couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just all of that may not say there's a link inside there they'll show you scan of this book\nAnd so that book does talk about those ten were and how it used to form a number but not out of form or\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book\nAnd um let's see I hear a bullet points about it that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow the clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that a secret message would start with the unnamed coded word Roosevelt that the secret message within code word to leave and the actual\nSecret ten word message none of that with in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is he also is a famous magician and he's a close personal friend of Harry Houdini so in this person says it's not a trick it's in the book\nEveryone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that forward with a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important for you to point out\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini\nAnd therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because now we get into the say on\nAnd and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit and one of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know what this is actually true but allegedly told them that ... I'm a skeptic I I I'm a ... I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way\nI can get a message to bat I Will try and then she has contacted back this several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he hounded for get in touch with that [noise]\nWell I'll touch on that and just admit it but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked\nBecause bath and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine\nAnd I think it's really important for us to think about how well we love one another and how all of a a little but we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question um Ford with a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit herring Harry's mother intrude into this session and in his on putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that's gets this letter and she responds in writing the understanding I had\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or spirit with surviving gap and sort of got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford was well aware of who d'nese reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDidn't want it so I got a jump in here forgive me Thomas I gotta jump in and got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and bats Houdini here's Jean night taking is going to the break with do me on coast to coast am [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] did\n\nThomas resentful my guess is the author of leaving the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing\nHoudini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas his website as well infinitely mystical dot com\nHis website as well infinitely mystical dot com atomic play Thomas so let's get to the other stay on a at a veterans house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nUm are there Ford shows up and he either Ford usually works with the spirit named Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show or very theatrical show where Harry would work with best the same way they worked\nWhen they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her a well he was very poetic with her it was very at times very touching and romantic\nAnd uh there were statements like throw open the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this ten key words on the table and then they decoded them and after it was decoded\nThe message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that death is a nickname that Harry used for her was Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song\nLight around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring and so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd anyone noted does anyone know did or the Ford no that Roosevelt was the pen name for best or was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends um\nSo I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet because I was trying to brush up on his kind of set up\nSomeone said that uh there was a big romance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he had he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah\nI just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other ... and\nAnd again he just he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher just didn't show the word believe they used the secret coding message that we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer ... please speak quickly look can be quick in and these all\nWindy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe\nYes yes and um\nShe declared success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on set off this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and so Beth\nThat's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary I Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence\nGiven to me by Arthur forwarded to correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only her but three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this newsletter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was the success that it happened\nI think so in effect of the newspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around fourteen months after that there is a hard switch where she suddenly started that they're now\nDenounced that anything was valid that there were any evidence whatsoever that this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBefore that before she sort of recanted there was another reporter with the uh either a magazine or a newspaper called the New Yorker graph for ROTC rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it re Jew Jew Ari I Can't pronounce the name but I don't remember\nOne name but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... writes um she had an apartment and she invited Arthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in the closet but they're hiding somewhere and they are going to witness this exchange\nWell the person that shows up is not really author Ford it's someone that's been paid to in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says off I paid Mrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because\nBass heard about at well as the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so bass responded in a letter\n'em to that same paper where she just completely denies it there she's been a party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford\nSaid that they were in cahoots he's a liar I mean she was very clear in this letter goes on and on and I had never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted on the website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nThis was written to Walter windshield the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter wind chill and he was um yes the social they go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the New York evening graphic\nBut it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these were supposed to be private letters the letter starts off saying this\nLetter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity\nYou know I'm just telling you I was no party to any fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he can fast and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further a\nMuddy the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that it happened other than she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened in one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this\nMy family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in their communication you know and so and I think that this faster and she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends being labeled and not\nUm and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nIf anyone says they get in touch with me after my death and know that it's fall side will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise]\nUm so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sale and twenty nine was she recanted and changing your position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and would also she had at some point she had offered up a an award a reward ten thousand dollar prize to allow anyone to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if he really was in cahoots with Arthur Ford\nHe could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer while that sounds you know pretty pretty iffy\nWhereas if they were in cahoots he could've said I'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress\nTo be hindered by some kind of monetary motivation you know would have been much more graceful you see it I mean but it was just days after where she says I'm not going to pay the money\n[noise] [noise] right so your your feelings are that bad\nBasically and she herself was an avowed to bunker for fifty years uh and so the the social pressure from her family was just too much and so she\nShe caved and she recanted\nYeah that's what happened um I think the subtitle of my as safe as something like that does Mrs Houdini want to be a non it or something like that it's not on the online version but um", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "21"}
