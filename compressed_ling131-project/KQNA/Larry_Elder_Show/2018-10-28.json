you so much for calling\nMueller first of all electric thank you for playing that are some audio from night storm what a great story [noise] it's amazing how the question I Believe we have the technology for financial institutions to prevent personal fund\nFrom being transferred to the United states to Mexico Honduras\nGuatemala and I'm Wondering if that doesn't make\nSense for the logical or at least a part of a logical answer to the immigration problem we're happy\nTo stop the remittances from here to Mexico\nMexico Honduras Guatemala\nI I Would imagine we do have a technology to do it the question is whether or not or would be effective are these people are already here are and the question is what do we do to prevent more illegal alien from coming here and that's what the president trying to do\nOr if he were to somehow try to stop remittances or and or remittances that its money coming from people in this country to Mexico because I Believe they're a second largest source of income after oil\nUm I don't know it seems to me that doing that would also exacerbate the problem in in Mexico I hear people say that\nIf President Trump for example withdraw the aid from Honduras in Guatemala it'll simply make conditions there even worse uh and uh would create even more so called migrants it seems to me the argument of ... up by Mexico is that Mexico's economy under developed\nAnd needs to be developed and you stop the remittances if even if you could do it legally I'm not sure how that would create conditions that would make it better for Mexicans to stay in Mexico and opposed to coming up here illegally\nBut thanks for the idea of cannot look into it Thai is in San Antonio Texas tigers malarial to show\n[noise] very love your show man thank you so much make you\nSo yeah that that testimony to collect data and then a fantastic one that as a conservative or for now a long long time one of the things I've understood\nIs that the Democratic party have had an absolute stranglehold on the black community now and the mind that uh for about six years and they had no intention of loophole is going to take the but more would you like them to get out of their cells\nAnd so\nBut but to my point you you had a caller asked you how many legal\nImmigrants are accepted into this country um\nAnd I happen to know that living in San Antonio I'm married to a Hispanic woman her family is from Mexico\nWe as a country per year except about\nOne million legal immigrants\nOf which about six hundred thousand or residency changes I don't know maybe the ... citizenship and they're moving to America I'm not sure what the situation it but that leaves you with about four hundred thousand so that boils down to almost eleven hundred per day okay legal citizens that we are accepting into this country\nAnd at this point in our history we have the most legal immigrants that we have ever had and that's thirty seven thirty seven now\nIf you if you estimate our population a\nMillion and do that math that comes up almost ... percent of our population ... legal immigration mhm\nSo you know to make the argument and this is through not only democratic uh you know presidency for Republican and they're very old and this has been going on for a long long time\nUm but you know I wanted to ask you you mentioned earlier on your show that Mexico has felony policy for anybody who enters the country illegally that's right my my bigger question my bigger question is if Mexico is and from what I hear they have obliged there\nAnd be willing to help you you say that they're they're pretty much just escorting them and kind of you know I'm\nI get hurt type where my whatever they're doing now is it that these people are not rounded up by the federal rally immediately or at least\nA medium that they can't or out of the the the integrity of Mexico's all walls themselves\n... ...\nIf they're if they're entering legal you know so why should they why should you know if they're if they're agreeing to help but then we just went on to a new trade deal with them it just seems like the third mainly ushering me people to our border and then they're going to see how we handle\nThat's exactly what's going on why do you think Trump is so upset what do you think public so angry [noise]\nBecause the Mexican government allows the so called

coming up we'll talk more about that coming up and just a second and we'll\nWe'll go around the horn 'em to a couple of places that are celebrating Halloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but\nUh we'll also talk with the GW author who's the author of the season with the witch and it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago\nAbout uh the Salem witch trials and how historians had been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim in it so it was fascinating go back if you remember of\nCoast insider and listen for it but coming up next our this is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train\nDiscovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this this is this is a great story love hearing about it with Bill James who was a a writer and not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and he was of course following very closely what happen tonight\nIn Los Angeles we are not competing again he\nExtended game that the Dodgers ended up playing last night\nUh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game but but but tonight a little different uh both socks lead the series now three to one the\nDodgers will get another shot at it coming up tomorrow night to send the series back to Boston three to two but but let me just say if it hadn't been for that error I'm In the top of the thirteenth the bottom of the thirteenth yeah uh it it would all be over now the boss will be going home with a trophy\nUp at the games over and for those of you that missed the first two hours of last night's show because you are following the game or you should she wants to go back and listen to it through coast insider it was really interesting and I kind of a closed as afraid that\nThe I guess to Michael killing a science writer former professor at Harvard and the guy I used to be on\nFormer professor at Harvard and the guy used to be on good morning America regularly appear on ABC shows uh he he probably could have gotten a bigger audience had not been for that exciting\nOver the experimental military base\nMaybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to the defense insider you'll see more about that about the the tone upon test range in Nevada um and what they had recently uncovered but but if they did\nWell then you know they would become the new Roswell\nI'm kind of happy with the old role as well and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings\nWho joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita anything so Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as a travel in and you know as a professional opportunity and people move to Roswell all the time but this time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in\nFor the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what do you do if if if Ross will kind of Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of\nAliens in invading armies and all of that if if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] um most people go out here grade farm which is a local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the corn maze\nOr the grade family ah the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that were supposedly on a UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven\nOr they can get every single year and it hit that great opportunity for people to go out and really try to experience a ... hunter milling of getting our NFL life if you're a crash\nIn Nineteen forty seven other people go out here bottom line is like an hour\nA week again and has a mystery at the bottom where and and it is our ten miles from Roswell beautiful a great place the RV camp and things like that but\nAgain on more more of the stars and the telescopes and people getting dressed up and they feel that they become one or they may come down and\nUh you know it's just that that area there is something here that landed and they're trying to connect with them especially around Halloween and during the year after the vote in July\n... so I I I'll be traveling through Roseville I'm I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to\nUh my new position I'll be teaching it to Kansas State and my my older my younger son and I was always wanted to go to Roswell right so we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way to the hunter Roswell before we come back up again\nIt seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there if anybody were interested in in being able to go to the crash site um or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the crushing Roswell where what can they do\nSo they can go to the Iraq War on international year for me in and Research Center which and there's a great opportunity to really dive into their historical and very much a part of the crash I'm definitely what check out the library for those who are really the Lakers and do you believe\nA in a different era that we have a new effort towards that it's done by a local researcher who's been doing research on the crash and your first for over Twenty years and you hear the exact location fans are cool hanging on the Internet\nAnd on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year that book or families where the crash occurred allegedly people take it out to the crash site where a knack for ourselves rent a\nHouse is still kind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land\nAnd so those are just a couple of things that Eric definitely recommend that people check out and I'm near her credit and so\nOkay so ... to use the word allegedly in there which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened to you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some for still are kind of on the fed and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nA we know that there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that people can talk to you when you go into the air for me and\nUh the locals know who the tourists are because at that her and you will come and walk down our main street and go into the area that wind which is a great store I bring your ... picture in the ...\nOr I bring your ... picture in the ... visitor center we have a meeting in every decorate our economy actually\nNow for Halloween [laughter] and cuts on a big festival with our police officers and things like that for the community but on these they're about six foot aliens or not people might be quick\nPicture and you'll hear the story of our implants and my name is five and ... and I you know people really come here searching for the truth and we ... we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you're very very\nWell that'd be great thank you I appreciate that let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in roads will for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nAnd so our population has doubled in size where where town about forty thousand on actually on the ... anniversary of the best of all\nI'm you know we hit close to doubling our size on average per year for tourism we hear a little over two hundred and thirty thousand or at your own energy on her and her\nParty good pretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts a until all of bringing our next guest next but thank you honey to and if I'm if I'm driving through time and get a chance I'll say hello okay yes please dare think they're\nCorny to Jennings is the ah the the the director of tourism or public affairs in uh Roswell\nNew Mexico but she's in with the which GW Oscar the subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a J W let me just tell you very funny book you resist great sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic and sides\nOn a serious subject because and we'll get to the second this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary played in the timeline\nOf American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people to come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\n[noise] yeah that's about right there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just telling me that so it's about a hundred thousand people um and of course I'm On a quarter million though the massive amount of people that small city to have the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this was one of my favorite kind of bugs it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked Halloween in shape the subject so it sort of you use that as it is a sort of a lens on all of what happened and and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about ... on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that a ... ... ... there are other places around the world outside the Salem\nThat had massive\nHanging in burnings or of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nI always try to tell people that federal wasn't the first trial wasn't the last one in the ... and all the trial was the biggest one of the strangest for them you know there are you know the first for trout America you know the victim was in Connecticut and in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims our interests\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which you killed\nIt isn't it honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed countries are still being being asking for being with us but the the the strange thing about that to me of course the planet that I've had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and I feel in Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that a season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween and the way um I like the rub zombie story there\nIn the book to and then coming up next our on coast to coast am I'm a truly amazing saga of the most elusive serial killer\nIn American history and you've never heard of that either that's coming up next our coast to coast am dizzy and\n\nThat's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nSo the GW locker author of a season with the which I just tend to look at some of those steps that we had mentioned\nMore vaguely two thousand eleven Largo Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt lincolnshire England a long ago turned ... incident in which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured\nTourist draw in Sweden there's which memorial to the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused\nAnd that's just some of them and not even all that happened in America but its Salem that sticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it it's really a mystery ... the even that for the big question that go with the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem has what city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing\nOh yeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it but it is about a dozen other reasons why I kinda Salem grabbed onto that monitor and kind of held on to it you know over the course of ... century\nBut it's kind of like you know it's the moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that you not usually what a town holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from Russia as well and and that that was an incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's usually for you to you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that ... the famous worlds exposition right you don't know any of these do go on their way to put up signs and it happened here folks\n[laughter] by it that is true and I think to to if I saw that one is that\nYou know the tragedy in Salem itself was basically just because the court happened in Salem right it was the ... part of the trials actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course generation are around and say on the actual the actual hysteria started next door in what's now Denver's was at the time to film village\nFulfilling itself doesn't really have a kind of kind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victim of a witch trials I mean the actual which is I Lived there today it means that cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween contest and sounds kind of become Halloween count as well so it's a term which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today in twenty Eighteen\nYeah I guess it and this is important in this ... this great distinction can't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering\nThat this this really is about innocent victims of murder [laughter] they were executed and they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah not a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy the kind of underneath the underneath there for board so to speak on the part of it that's left connected to the tragedy with more just around\nYou know the identity and all these other kind of thing just become and and twenty a team\nWell go back to the central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nWith with absolute and ammonium [laughter] he is so they they don't celebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they thought it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and October thirty first I'm really a bled over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year [noise] do you want to sound Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowd with a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras basically\nIt is it really is um I talk again a hundred thousand people packed into small down kind of the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know five or six blocks\nAnd you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes the freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars wash the fireworks all kinds of stuff\nSo you're you're definitely there for you know again my other good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans
