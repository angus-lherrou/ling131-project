I was going to be voting for Trump\nBecause I see this problem in our country but the migrants with diseases and things that are doing to our country and it's just going to countries it's been so long

do you what part of that state and he said he said he care what America should care about\nThe astronaut and we'll ask not what you use your country can do for you ask instead what you can do for your country who was the most famous line\nYeah yeah that's that's what I'm thinking I Wish you all Americans care about our country and our borders as not ... it's not a democratic it's just being an American and as Americans we should care care about our borders and our country\nAnd what why is that is a great point because you ride President Kennedy who is a very different kind of Democrat than the than the modern day progressive Democrats but that is very very true I Wonder what they would say about that that is an expression of national nationalism unlike any other isn't it\nAsk not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country\nWhat can you do for this nation we not for the world not for the United nations not for you know foreigners what can you do for this country that's your job that's your responsibility because it is about us first ... first\nNatural nationals I mean it is not a dog whistle it's not some sort of a coded language it is simply a statement of I pledge and that's why I said this before I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America anybody who's ever we sided that pledge saying\nThis is where my allegiance lies don't pledge allegiance to the flag of the United nations don't pledge allegiance to the flag of Canada or Mexico or to France or Germany or to\nUh to um uh Switzerland or to\nUh to the Dominican

you're you're friendly you care about people they know how to dissolve start for you how did you get involved in witchcraft well\nYou know I started working with a showman and she's also happens to be of I I consider to be a very powerful which end and she introduced me to magic and instead of doing the work for me because you know she I feel like her healing\nUm I'm not I I feel like whatever she does with the only just so amazing but instead of doing the work for me she empowered me and and taught me how to do it myself\nSo I just you know I picked it up really quickly and I I mean the rest is history\nI feel very very confident with with what I Do you know with the spouse that I've been executing so that's how I got started it was it was more about healing and then that's when she just introduced me to it and now I feel like I probably don't need a healer because I'm\nI'm using magic as a form of killing\nHave you ever cast a spell on somebody that\nHer and I want to make that very clear that I Will never ever ever catch a foul to hurt anyone um to try to bring love my way to try to win the lottery [laughter] isn't that what\n... what what what good are cells that if you can't win anything\nYou know I think\nThat the power of our mind because I have discovered the one thing I had to do with magic is\nThat in my mind is more powerful than I realized so I think that when we start healing on so many different levels\nThat we will be able to tap into unlimited amounts of financial attendance and spiritual ... so I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will conjure up on my knee spell in the work that but right now I've just been focused on doing the um killing and and crying and reversal\nWhen you talk about magic ... what do you what are we talking about there we're not talking about David Copperfield we're talking about something else are we\nAbsolutely and it can be\nBut something else are we absolutely and it can be used by anyone I think people you know use magic every single day with the power of their minds so when I talk about magic I'm simply chanting uh sell and when I work my rituals\nI chat between anywhere between one and two hours I don't just Trenton said resigned really long I really do I mean I think my neighbor's probably think I'm rehearsing for\nJimmy and ...

linked up at ... dot com right now we'll get to your calls in just a second with her courses and we're talking about the demonic situation and use it wasn't going well what was happening\nSo I at that point I was pinned down on my bed and\nThen all of a sudden what it felt like hours of course all of a sudden I fell on my ear going up and down I don't know if it was a pall over there were a hand for it but it was going up and down on my left ear and so it was really really crazy so at that point it was either fight or flight and I obviously couldn't sleep because I was ten down\nSo this wave of courage just came over me and I just thought you know I I I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just thought and as soon as I\nI Need that adjustment in my mind I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just peeled off of me and at that moment with my right arm I just swarmed up my arm went up and I'm not kidding George\nI felt like hairy leg that is insane it's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone\nBut it just like it flew away obviously that's right it is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't believe me\nBut I did go back to that psychic woman and look like what happened but yeah it's so freaking and I will say and never happen again after that time so I Know that this man some in that game and then sent it my way but I did not sleep without the laid off for about three months after that it totally terrified me it was\n... who is susceptible to demonic possession and in situations like that a child\nWell you know I'm not going to list that say the obvious ones like people doing drugs or having a cocktail more drawn crocheting yeah we're going to the ... the cemetery it you know and having a cocktail at midnight [laughter] but I Will say that um there is one reason I think that\nMany of them were you ever to laugh you don't have a chemical which uh which you'd have a tackle you won\nA which is actually a wise woman so that's the definition of a wage but yeah I think you [noise] um\nI kinda wanted a chemical but that's all right\n[laughter] I can do it and even if I tried\nSo one of the reasons that I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand\nI'm considering we all lived thousands of lifetimes I'm and I'm Glad I haven't read number and the other\nUm some of these lifetime so we were not the best of people and um it's very possible that this is my theory that could be wrong but I have proof or my showman who kind of confirmed um my you know my thoughts about this um it's very possible that\nSome of these people these victims who are experiencing what is known as karma so they can be you know\nHarassed and molested in this lifetime with a demon that they need to act with in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in this lifetime\nOn the demon the pet is is usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I've ever heard of a demon die unless you've like soil you\nCatch them all but they don't\nExactly there's thousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at Georgia it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demon and what's going to happen when we reincarnate and the demon is going to probably harass him and molest him now\nThat's one one theory and I can say\nI'm with confirmation that it it it's probably very true because my sharman has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days\nHas a lot of cases of people who are being molested harassed and just you know possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a shower Monica journey\nInto their past lives and nail it and nine times out of ten these people have made packs with demons or they were maybe a big\nPowerful black which\nAnd you know I don't know it's it's it's different for each of them but\nFor the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does is she just breaks that agreement that they can finally be free\nAnd um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in the situation and you know these demons or not bothering her neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified showman who can really just put an end to this\nWhat are these dark for she wants to ... ... what do they want with us\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity\nDo they feed off of ... absolutely and\nI'm sadly a lot of black magicians will cast spells against people who they feel they can steal light from and they can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and they look into us however they do it\nAnd what this does it will make their incorrect magic more potent\nSo this is why it is extremely important especially right now\nUm to to really really really really clear ourselves on a daily basis and do ... rituals prayers and and healer our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases\nOf the human intrusions in people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely um manipulate our thoughts\nTops let's go to the phones for you know jumping in Redding, California to get started I just\nGo ahead Hi George how are you are good thank you I got I'm losing my voice so I Hope you can hear me all Marshall good\nOkay Hi Curtis Hi um my husband and I both but I think curse ex girlfriend oh boy [laughter] um [noise] it wasn't but a year\nAfter he and I had gotten together that an accident occurred to me and I brought it up to him a couple months later said\nYou know do you think that this person is because I I mean just fucking out or device for her she was a witch but not a good way to know and I mean she might even have to do\nBut I told him I said do you think that it's possible that this person could have put a curse on me and he looked to me is set up so early\nWhile she obviously when they broke up to not go peacefully do you\nKnow and actually she helped him move into his apartment and it was like God opened the door for me to leave my ex husband before that you know in a permit became available was perfect timing I got in there\nAnd and part right for maintenance Kevin available for him later down the road it was it was totally like doors opening\nIn Japanese ... along you yes I Do George I fell down the fight is there room for morning\nWhile I was going for morning walks every morning before work well this particular morning I was battling with
