is the fact that the the change over had been delayed for for I think about a year because there were concerns that the the thing about\nThis is the security system that's not widely deployed to end users it's mostly the big idea is that the corporations and things like that it's gradually spreading more so they were concerned that not everybody especially not all of all the highest paid with the fairly have made the right preparations for this but there could be disruptive\nBut it was very carefully planned out and practice what happens is they they ... the roll over a yesterday yesterday

to coast to coast Georgian where you with you and what are amazing couple hours we've gotten to where you hear Jeffrey ... back with us internationally recognized professional psychic exorcist teacher specializes in the clearing the individual homes businesses a psychic protection\nJeffrey is also an expert on hunting and homes and businesses\nPsychic ability good goals such as we were guides and as well and we're tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks jurors for having me back on your show the fifth time in a big hello to everybody around are beautiful planet\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring a ghost since spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that\nIndividual in the media pay a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about all things supernatural a good and evil\nAre also in tradition that um it's harvest time and uh in the tradition of that but there's a veil of of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing that I deal with happen all the time and um but the media pay us more attention to it this time of year\nAnd that's fine anytime we talk about it and get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever using demonic spirits and we'll get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of angry about certain things do you think demonic spirits have something to do with that\nDefinitely uh we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nAnd this is a huge target for demonic spirit and also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along\nBut absolutely targets on the back of people\nThat have power and can change the world for good or for ill and uh I think that there has never been a time in our history\nWhere demons have a greater opportunity to strike at the common person\nAnd also people who are very influential and so they're around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get your take Jeffrey ... is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful\nSpirit it could be said that there was a counterpart of angels that powerful\nThey are not regular people who have died and just have a bad attitude into negative things\nThey've been around for a long time they're very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical realm or not have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful\nAnd there are known to be able to affect physical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily\nAnd uh\nWe're not looking out for it you know what we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a from Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people\nIt's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that are under the pack of ah demonic spirit\nNegative spirits and a\nSpirits are\nAre able to reach in to the cold around from the non physical route and actually produce coal effect and that is one difference between a ah demonic spirit and a negative spirit\nAlso demonic spirits are are much better\nEquipped shoots\nMuch better equipped to influence people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can see them\nAnd tell a path equally trans for information into our system or emotional system this make us angry at each other other people at ourselves to get us to do things we would not normally do\nAnd we can't see them we don't know that there are there\nShe that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many\nDemonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as ego I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of fear\nIt's also true that a demonic spirits a can change you know once they were you know positive spirits and the ego got for them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh\nThe real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible\nThan ever before to attack are so many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits on all spirits\nDo not have voice boxes they communicate George ... path equate and we all communicate color ethically it's kind of like a river that travels underneath our consciousness\nAnd they communicate on that level and they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in a day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in that's also very common\nAnd uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do violent things hurt our significant others wives husbands people are not all violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits\nBut they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and so are negative spirits people who are dead and they were doing negative things when they were alive and continue to get negative things but demonic spirits\nAre very powerful and as an extra ... when I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very\nCareful because many of them are more powerful than me that's right that's you know they can come and get you\nOh abs and they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect that when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes negative feelings negative energy is I'm looking for it\nIt's went out and not looking for it or that the attacks on me or hurt it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work\nSeven years now\nBut it does happen and so I've been attacked or successfully a few times for short duration and it's very unpleasant and it happened is very quickly the monitor spirits are able to assume any shape or form\nAt a moment's notice did you see them\nI can you tell was born with the ability to see spirits I thought everybody could it was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school and grade school\nI thought I saw spirits in the classroom some were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them schoolwork and some are looking at me\nLike how can you see me what are you doing I don't like this and these are the one I had to watch out for and they'd actually come and started walking toward as being the classroom when I was very uncomfortable\nOrange stay with us Jeffrey we're going to hit a break and we're gonna come back and talk more about the demonic spirits where do they come from what they want and the next hour we'll take phone calls all about that\nGoes to insiders the new version of that goes to go to a a map is now available for I'm going to end now Android for Don

A. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com or call one eight six six eight three six eight seven three fine\nThat's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three times\n\nJeffrey ... with us as we talk about demons we'll take calls next to our as well before we get in the open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a natural\nHumans humans they want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want\nAnd so ah they attack children in their cribs they had ... attack people at work\nThey attack everybody we all have targets on our back and we need to realize that\nUh we can see them but they can see us degenerate negative emotional energies they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand what they're trying to do they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think of it as a Hollywood myth or something like that Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but\nThe reality is is that they are around the spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them\nAnd they communicate with us tell a path to either end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money\nDestroy your business and you destroy a person's ability to make money destroy their family destroy their lives\nAnd also to change or the way we think about each other right now they have both at each other's throats right where they wanna sell they sure\nDo and we have to stop it and there's there are ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story\nEverybody I've talked to has some kind of a story of of being in a home apartment condo a party a bar and a pile of any ... any place\nWhere they seen or felt something strange they're picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy\nAnd that can\nInfluence this by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying are feeling so\nIt takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that\nI Would not normally do that and some of them were angry that's when they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them or they do know that they're there they may not believe in them\nBut they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some something that happens not everybody\nBut most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer\nNot most spirits are good summer not and so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue to hang around our world and get us to do things they would not normally do\nDemonic spirits are just experts at it they have weapons they have devices that they make out of non physical energy is just like spirits do spirits changed their forms\nLike our our parents die and it's an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating in thinking about generating\nA form of what they wanted to look like and also generating close because most people do not see naked spirits so all these things are generated on a non physical level\nEmotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well\nSo demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred and rage\nWe think it's our own but it's not always completely wrong or the under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nI'm not sure if there's one particular spirit in charge of all negative spirits I Am on experience are kind of like criminals they really don't even get along with each other they don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always the rule\nOr they do work in groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this uh but they really\nDo their best when they work alone and they take their time working on individuals and families are getting them to fight or getting people to fight with each other or getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify\nWhat would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage and they're very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them is incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally\nUh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light all come out or an attack I pull out my non physical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on but everybody is not so fortunate the vacancy them and know that they're coming\nAnd so there are around us and we don't know it around us that work and at home also\nAnd we don't know it around us that work and at home also negative spirit you know and in negative spirits can work for them essentially and and sort of modeled themselves after that and\nLike I said most people are good in summer or not and the ones that are not are also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die all the time and lots of them are not good\nUh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack\nPeople on a daily basis so\nEssentially the entire human race right now is under attack by negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier\nMay not have ever lived in the physical realm or for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred and rage\nAnd they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura and to get us to react\nTo they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially kill a child in the cradle it no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought\nIt was horrible they have they just have humans and so they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves\nAnd then our world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and we have to realize\nThat we need to protect ourselves from this we need to stop being so angry with each other because we're being used\nAnd it's not just you know I heard some talking on the commercials about global elitist and all of that and I think that's true\nBut also we're being attacked by non physical entities they wish to see the human race failed and it was a possibility that that could happen it's a very serious issue we have the ability", "show_name": "Larry Elder
