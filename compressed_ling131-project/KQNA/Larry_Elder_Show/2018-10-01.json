now are you\nDoing well all I Want to get your perspective on a Brett Kavanaugh and I mentioned earlier tonight that uh every now and then I check in with Fox which I think to an extent may have lost

delivery and those words without believing her talking about this so this is a disaster for the Republicans\nAre genuine Apollo taught him said quote I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible\nKarl Rove Karl Rove said forward as credible unbelievable having listened to that\nI thought OK done then I watched his testimony and I said that guy you call them Jimmy Stewart I Believe that guy that the exactly how you arrived ... similar circumstances that there are so many holes\nAnd the story of Christine forward you could drive a Mack truck the middle of the room on either side and I can lay out all the whole such as in her story so it kind of give me your take on what's going to happen later this week when the FBI gets done and what are we do with Brett Kavanaugh I think it will be a great Supreme Court justice\nYeah I mean I listen I I assume I and I think you'll be spring gorgeous but I don't know 'cause this was like in my opinion [laughter]\nWas Jeff Flake in my opinion this was set up shop for like the United states senator your kid to women aren't allowed to get an elevator with the United States Senate and the Capitol building how did they get in this whole thing was a set up Jeff Flake they asked them to come in that was his cover for demanding an FBI investigation [noise]\nYou know how did those two women getting the elevator that convinced him to change his mind from a yes vote to I Want an FBI investigation and the answer is that it was set up from day one\nAnd he wanted those two women in the elevator and he wanted to use them as cover\nSo there has to be a reason they want this one week delay and of course it is either because they're going to have ten more women come forward and right at all and they claim that brick capital rate them or attempted to rate them or whatever he did to them who knows what they're going to say sexually harassed them\nAnd they're gonna try drag this on forever number one number two they're never going to be satisfied with a limited the FBI investigation\nOr all the FBI does ever as jazz bread capital honestly said it's a file a form after interviewing people and they don't come to any conclusion and they tell you what everybody said and so he said no rape she said rape and nobody will ever know the answer to that so [noise]\nAnd they're all going to charge it's not enough and there's got to be more at the identification including\nFor the girl who says he gang raped them ah you know the the one is with attorney Michael Evan that either one of just an absolute fraud so look it's never going to end the Jeff Flake wanted it to never end he's a creepy the bad guy the villain in this whole thing number one villain is Dianne Feinstein and number two villain is the whole Democratic Party and number three felonies Jeff Flake\nBut in the end I came down in the idea that this was forty years ago and a bunch of women were making up stories which could be proven none of which had evidence and none of which had witnesses\nYou cannot allow a man to be defeated based on that and they decided to work with judge Roy Moore let's use it with with Brett Kavanaugh it's very clear that that's what this is if it was real science I Would\nHave brought it up into one on one meetings with the man show can you imagine if I'm up for a major job and someone gets a letter that says oh Wayne rooted tempted to rape me and you sit across to me and you see nothing but then two months later you bring it up well that means the whole thing was a farce in the beginning\nSo look here's my column basically said I Am Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh as me Brett Kavanaugh as you and if they could do it to him they could do it to anyone I grew up in all Catholic neighborhood mostly Italian part Irish\nWas number one in my class like Brett Kavanaugh I was a sports star like Brett Kavanaugh I went to Columbia He went to an Ivy League school Yale we both got out of the chief great success\nIn life and now they're trying to destroy him and I could tell you one thing guys like that do raped women there's no way it does happen find me a case of America were guys number one in his class\nAnd those Ivy League educated with the sport started a great kid has tons of women friends and tons of childhood friends who stand up for him and the well regarded judge and suddenly\nYou find out he was a rapist or attempted rapist or a gang rape is it's the stupidest Mariel I've ever heard I grew up with nothing but Catholic school boys and let me tell you we all like women\nBut we're all nice guys were like the women we don't like to read them and I've never heard anything so outrageous\nAnd so stupid in my entire like\nShow me a witness okay no problem there aren't on nobody saw it happen it didn't happen\nIn the name she provided indicate that she's not telling the truth their primaries Brett Kavanaugh as the man\nHe he's a he's a he's a father he's a husband ... female friends used to do little daughters\nThere is no credible evidence whatsoever you did any of these things there's no truth there's no fairness there's no evidence there is no facts but Fox News who's declared an incredible talented possible with record the judgment pollen turnover cruise wallet or ... boy that's credible\nCredible what the hell we been credible I Want to hear incredible\nVillages credible because they didn't break her because no one tried to break or known as the single decent question I mean here's the deal if if I was a criminal awaiting trial I Would be for that woman\nMitchell come after me please the most incompetent personally you know my entire life at least I did maybe dined by dying harder and some\nSay she worked for the Democratic party for as I'm concerned the only good thing she did it she said after the fact that there's no possible way I Would bring charges against him in a real court room well OK big deal could argue that find me a lawyer who would say after everything we know\nWhich is there's no way this there's no evidence that have happened thirty six years ago [laughter]\nFind me a single lawyer or a prosecutor in the world that would actually say I would bring charges and I'll find somebody ought to be in jail you up with that person in jail because God Forbid they come against my son or my daughter you know these are horrible people they'd be willing to say something like that they don't even know what they're doing they don't even understand the law for God's sakes\nAnybody can charge anything of anybody without a shred of evidence you cannot move forward with the word of one person no backup impossible for thirty six years ago and possible who's so she didn't even get a lot you know she didn't do any great deal with that either a ...\nPerson

Lindsey Graham stuff on there was no other Republican up there will know fabric having a\nGood good and you know Jeff Flake out in an elevator\nAs you get to Ted Cruz type assault or from some screaming woman who says look me in the ... I would've said lady I'm On your side I'm not in favor of sexual assault we're trying to find out the truth I I mean do you believe every woman who said she was sexually assaulted\nIf that's the case the ... the Duke lacrosse team will all be locked up and do you you be a Rolling Stone story never would have happened about ten to twenty percent of these stories are dishes eighty Ninety percent of legitimate well which is you know I mean nobody's going to have a car stolen\nUntil the police as a Chevy one it really it's a Ford\nSo but but in the area of sexual assault things of that character ten to twenty percent of the time is there's falls memory or false information given very motive and in this case some Thirty years went by\nUntil twenty twenty twenty twelve when she was in a conference where there has been real somebody goes a marriage difficult 'cause you wanna to front doors Thirty years later and that's the first time the therapist took notes and the therapist notes her own therapist do not confirm her story according to the Washington Post\nThen she would not give her therapist knows under HIPAA rules\nTo the United States Senate but she gave it to the Washington Post and the nose to the therapist and not contained in a bread cabinet and they had different numbers of individuals is holding her so the therapist notes to knock infirmary story in fact in obstructed or story\nBut the Senate seemed to ignore that too [noise]\n[laughter] why it seems like everybody on the left her ... wants to know our all of the holes and you cannot like he's got the ... not to withstand a court of law and any jury that would look at the testimony would not find the evidence you know I've heard a lot of the feminist the messenger is that I call them on the left\nI say that survivors must be believed well when we believe that they have been assaulted but we don't necessarily need to take their word for as to who if they can't protect the evidence how did Dr forget to the party she wasn't drunk when she went to the party\nI she goes six miles from the party how she got home she has a very selective memory and like I said I'm not saying something traumatic\nThat it happened dinner I Believe that at some point you know at some point in her life it probably did\nCraft but she did not display to me like the burden of proof that I needed to believe that it was Dr Brett Kavanaugh and also what saved his life I Do believe that this father\nBy keeping a diary a calendar of sorts and without Brett Kavanaugh's calendar it would certainly come down to ... he said she said and the Democrats want to use these weaponized sexual allegations as political channel\nI think Dr Christine for nothing more than a political on the Democrat Party while they choose to ignore other women who have come forward with crab credible evidence\nSpecifically against Keith Ellison ... these are the and the vice chair the second most powerful Democrat in the party including a candidate for and courteous general for a Minnesota has to audible allegations with police report\nDr reports text messages and allegedly a video like that because that's\nProving or at least giving us out of it and that he allegedly emotionally and physically abused no less than two women\nAnd I'll give me another part of this or you know just like the dog that didn't bark she told the committee the primary impacted event occurred during the four years directly after she said she went on to struggle academically are stronger than a ducks Chapel Hill and in college when I was Seventeen I was off to college with a very tough time\nShe skips completely her junior and senior year in high school I guarantee you if there were a bad grades are bad behavior by her her junior and senior in high school the to academic years after the event took place when she was Fifteen Years old\nThat would have been a dog that barked we would have found out that you've flown out of high school that you did poorly so how is it possible\nThat you did well in high school good enough to get into a Chapel Hill which is our school to get into did three advanced degrees including two masters and a doctorate\nRight sixty five books in periodicals travel all over the world to to Haiti and South America and Europe and uh in Israel and she went to a she went to Hawaii nine times she seemed objectively there'll be full life what she would have written Seventy five books except for this terrible event\nHow come we've not heard about what would happen or academically enter junior and senior year I made you the reason is they didn't do it but you did quite well\nWhich is the dog that did not bark and there was no objective indicator and why would she left the house with their best friend leaving Kaiser girlfriends still there if there was two purported attempted rapist\nRunning around drunk how'd\nYou get out of there who took her home why didn't you notify the girls the next the next day at the swimming club but at the country club or or the first day of class she told nobody counsellors mom and dad girlfriend\nShe kept a secret for Thirty years then had a recovered memory and psychological services counseling session because she wanted a second front door and how is it her lawyers got away with lying\nFor ten days about her wanting to drive from California to Washington when in fact she was staying in Delaware at that time and fly all over the country why wasn't that a bigger deal because you've fled outline\n[noise] and that's where the another example of Democrats using women as political pawns of tools and the political assassination and not just the politics of personal destruction they want it the political theater\nThey want it to expose her someone dead stomach exposed to the she was and so what made sure that she would have cameras and lights and the national audience and one of the Senate Judiciary committee\nThat was set up in order to try to make the old white men on the Senate Judiciary committee they're all white Republican I'm Bad you know Steve King tweeted out just the other day and I tell you this though old white man or a lemon\nPleaded out just the other day and I tell you that is so old white men are relentlessly being racially and generationally profile by the power wrapped in air quotes tolerant\nLeftist media outlets politicians almost universally profiled and stigmatized Republican senators\nBooks like racial profiling is backing style\nIf you are left us not only is an old white men that were going to question her corporate have an as an old white privilege to a guy that the Sacramento beat that when he was crying that's that's what white privilege looks like\nYou know so they they they call it the thought of that sort of crime Republicans massaging is an old white men and that's coming directly from the vicious violent violent or ask\nEnded up missing dress that five minutes\nAnd I'll say that the woman that crave unanimity demanded a public\nForty million audience to listen to her story she was never properly cross examined and uh and the questioning from the Democrats who was laughable ... and at this point uh what's gonna happen later this week do you think you're making ... dot com\nI assume the FBI Thursday Friday is going to give largely a clean bill of health\nThat will not be sufficient Jeff Flake whose last name it should be an ad should do but not a ... not a now\nUh I I guess he's gonna he's gonna vote for unless he's pigeonholed by another Ted Cruz CBGB's screaming out I'm In an elevator God Knows what's going to have to get all your crystal ball what happens later this week\n[noise] well I'm I think I'd heard ... however now that we've been on the Democrat or their weight and then you know higher than seven FBI investigation I regret having a\nI'm sure that Michael ... or by the glory alright well here with another but I mean right now they're probably scraping the Yale yearbooks to see what they can come up with\nBecause the truth as a matter of the Democrats it's simply the perception is simply the narrative and they can use their buddies and the media in order to further their fame and destroy potentially and allegedly superbly innocent man\nBut they can try to ruin him in a court of public opinion because it benefits that politically\nAnd make and they couldn't care less about sexual assault victims they couldn't care less about Christine forward that's why they all to lead to our identity to have ... they want it to weaponize sexual assault the way they weaponize the Oscars\nThe way they weaponize television shows the way they weaponize Murphy Brown the way they weaponize Oscars they way they weaponize Grammys in public education whatever it is the socialist progressive as one of the weaponized\nThan take up someone's cause as long as it fits their agenda but Keith Ellison or or Clinton or the Kennedy did not fit the agenda of the modern Democratic Party so that completely ignore the provable Keith Ellison vicious assault on his girlfriend's because that doesn't fit their agenda but a weaponized Christine forward does\nAbsolutely so they're using her as a political upon like they've done many other when I when we look out for example Harvey Weinstein remember at the at the turn down the Harvey Weinstein chain stores or he was a big Democrat donor you with a very powerful Democrat man and he could run the narrative through his media companies for the Democrats already\nWhen\nThe talk of the quad cities in

raised the hair on the back of your neck true life stories of people who simply banished to dip into thin air the circumstances in each of these cases are very specific to a pattern that was discovered by Dave and up by now he's looked at thousands of these disappearances and some patterns\nHave emerged on land around ... water and as we will hear tonight in the air as well so this evening we will hear the latest including a few cases that are on going at this moment brush mysteries that maybe you can help solve\nA David joins me and just a few minutes and we will jump right into it but those who do not familiar with the mystery we'll start with a refresher on the characteristics that make these particular cases stand out from a standard case of somebody who just gets lost in the woods or wilderness\nGoes way beyond that and we will spend the next three hours talking about new evidence of cases he uncovered and then the last hour tonight I'm not sure what we're going to do I I think I'd like to hear from listeners your ideas about what's going on here why some people are seemingly\nTaken a by whom and whether we will ever be able to resolve this so what you're thinking caps on and be ready to jump into the discussion in our for all also tried to save some time for you to interact with Dave as well in our three\nOne news note here in Las Vegas we're on the eve of a somber remembrance one year ago October first\nThe worst mass murder incident in American history unfold fifty eight people were gunned down at an outdoor concert on the strip hundreds were wounded or injured all week leading up to the date that the town is remember those who died those who were wounded those who've struggled to deal with what they witness that night\nAt a town that proved to the world\nWitness that night at a town that proved to the world but it's much more than just an adult Disneyland or get away but it's a real community that pulls together when things get tough effect that seemed to surprised so many of the national news people I I remember watching that week last year\nAnd they thought somebody with an investigative background ought to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of the freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal lead train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training they're smart people\nThey understand what should be done\nAnd ask for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any list and they don't have any of us missing people in their parks and jurisdictions and ah we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues to reef refiled and they came back in the attorney called his time and take what you want this information\nAnd explain to him I said hey you can't ask that of the determining factor\nIn for you and they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use it to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said well research and then he came back and he said well we don't have any was missing people I said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol\nAnd you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are that detective\nSo somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or accumulate list at headquarters to understand what's happening\nAnd it's only politically correct if somebody calls in and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it said no we don't have any list\nOr so\nYears ago somebody said well maybe you ought to just file a request and see how many rules of toilet paper at Yosemite National park I bet they are but I didn't and tore list [laughter] and of course they would but as it happened\nThey came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my\nAuthors status as an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books aren't enough library or to qualify Lucian of such qualifier just some arbitrary thing they said\nAnd then I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together the listener I Want to list from Yosemite and I want to was from the national Park Service and they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire system\nAnd I can't tell you how many people since I first said that years ago have tried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting ... from their entire system because they still say they don't have it\nAnd I've done interviews on other stations were\nHosts have said Dave I'll say it right now we will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets and we'll put a clip boards that every park and every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating the list\nAnd they can hire an intern during the summer there can screen that monthly reports that come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now of course they they wouldn't even respond and wouldn't even acknowledge it\nBut as you've stated in many others after you\nKnow but he believes they say that the list exists [noise]\nWell uh ... if they're going to charge one point four million more than a list exist hum you know\nIt's it's pretty clear they don't want\nTo cooperate on this that they don't want to have more attention to be drawn to it and we're going to explore and maybe some of the reasons behind it up for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the profile points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books the kinds of things that you look for\nSome people need to understand that if you read say a hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people you're not going to get a lot when you read a thousand certain things start jumping out at you\nAnd when I went through my third three hundred four hundred and five hundred read reports started making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four five six thousand then things really start to delineate out one thing that it's about Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine search and rescue they can't I Can't find a set and they can't track the person down\nNow someone who worked at a canine unit on the SWAT Team for a number of years our dogs had about a Ninety nine percent capture rate and\nProbably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week and it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be\nAnd there's a lot of people out there don't have the time to train a dog a lot there might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe the scent isn't there a bad reports where the dogs are brought to the scent location where the person\nI've had reports where the dogs are brought to the set location where the person was last seen they walk up for it they turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out for like they don't want to search or they have no interest\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change weather event if the victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times\nThe time of the disappearance high high percentage of the time is three four five you know\nMany of the victims have some type of disability illness or congenital abnormality or if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can explain what happened to him\nWater plays a key role in this if the person disappears very near water or they're found in or near water borders in granite play a big rural it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world she was Seventy national park\nOr that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anywhere in the world but granted plays much more of a role as I explained and many of the books\nThere is a location in the event called the point of separation\nYou're walking down the trail with your friends or your loved one and they walk ahead of you you fall behind them\nAt that point of separation something happened and that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that and interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report that's when it happens\nIt's almost like something's watching and when you split off from a group or a family that's when they move in\nEquipment malfunction and this this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and prayer book\nThere was an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with the searches and then people talk about other equipment there are other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this\nAnd then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that are perished\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physics is of a German heritage that have disappeared I'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and I've never been found\nIt very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared that isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a\nMedical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nAre so when when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that I'm interested in specific profile that I just laid out here\nAnd there's this geographical crushed during that I figured out what after I started putting Ken's in a U.S map when I started to track this years ago\nAnd right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada\nNow there are other locations in a weapon to other countries of the world where do you crack seems sort of thing happening a lot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book started to get rolling and people are different parts of the world read them\nAnd say hey you know I live in New Zealand and we've had a whole series of these very true Australia same thing UK same thing Canada same thing in Spain and he he's worse I mean you'd be surprised how that fits into this little niche\nAnd it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred thirty five cases and it's men to women as a form to one ratio\nCorrect my any idea why why so many more men than women maybe more men are out in the outdoors in out there alone\nYeah yeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risk than women I guess\nWe're talking with David ... about his latest work missing for one one land air water coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific cases and uh as I said before they will raise the hair on the back of your neck of the Beatles take us into the break we'll be right back\n\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the report that they generate and national park service heroin won't volunteer up any of these reports now find ... date at a time and that person has been rural to be\nIf a time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most times times they want there is a case from eighty six\nI'm an era the girl's name was or error is she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody's looked at the case in Twenty years and especially if they're told me I'll never see that case\nIt's a standard missing persons case there is no suspects there is no crime why can't I see\n'em and just so people understand\nIn law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal uh everything else in the law enforcement world it's criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against the law to go missing if you want to fall out of society you can and it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's going to emanates from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle you're somebody\nBut these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nAnd a lot of times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times that are really really good and I don't understand why there and want us to see it but there's this I called territorial behavior\nAnd many of the times they won't grant you access\nNow in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law that reports have to be disclosed to the public ... crest\nColorado has that laws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law\nBut many states known and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything um so the first thing is you got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say the storage you really can't trust the media because I Would say eighty percent of the time\nWhen I finally get a copy of the report the news reports are totally completely wrong compared to what law enforcement said happened\nAnd I like to think back Thirty years ago forty years ago when there were reporters that really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's this superficial job of collecting information\nBecause it's really not too good at these days\nI Would think that um you know reporters just regular beat reporters who get assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case\nYou know like outside of Las Vegas ever been a couple that you and I talked about before it's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement if there's a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of the scene\nI'm who tells you specific here the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take it further you you've heard of them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they'd really don't want to know the full story of what's going on 'cause it's too weird to explain it makes me wonder about the national Park Service whether\nThey don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks\nOr they don't want to give me the information because they have in a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know they don't want to have to answer questions about what do you think\nI think that the people the front line people that you see when you go into the parks heart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and\nTalking to you about nature those people have no idea what's going on it's the people at the top tier in the government that are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed and communicated\nAnd it's those individuals that have this\nThey exude this belief that it's their stuff\nIt's not yours and you're not going to get it and I don't understand it I Can't explain it\nAnd every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports\nWhen a sheriff's office helped on a search and they had some of the report from the national Park Service as well and mistakenly they just sent me everything and so I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and I got ... I wasn't supposed to get that\nBut then it gives me some insight as to what's going on but it's rare [laughter]\nLet's talk about a couple of current cases like you you sent me some information about one Samantha Sayers what's the deal there\nTwenty eight years old high performing person good athlete came from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle She liked to go to this a location a called best for ... V. E. S. P. E. R.\nAnd she went there in August first this year it's about six thousand two hundred and twenty feet elevation two miles northeast a spade a lake twenty five ... five miles east of the ocean Puerto Suzanne\n... round trip hike up about seven eight miles twenty seven hundred foot game going up in a Thirteen hundred foot scramble to the top ... so I live in Colorado I can tell you that that really isn't much here but in\nIn Washington that's a pretty good hike and the mountains there at just sixty two hundred feet look a lot like the mountains here fourteen thousand feet well\nSamantha did a lot right she told her boyfriend where she was going when she'd be back and he was the kind of guy that kept track of her well when she didn't check in with him\nHe reacted the right way he went he went out and look for her while the investigation showed that she made the summit sometime too in between two and three in the afternoon and some other individual man saw her at the ... summit in communicated with her\nWell that was the subsequent investigation her boyfriend Kevin arrived at the mountain about ten pm started running the trails yelling for screaming for eventually all the snow homeless county sheriff and the search was on\nSo that was on August first well that search went on for about twenty two days three hundred and fifty seven air operations that is extraordinary that the last\nHundred and five hours of drone time\nA three hundred and twenty nine hours of difference our personnel the family was on the scene everyday when you look at the area the majority of the time she was above what looked to be Timberline there isn't much up at the top of desperate to pretty wide open area\nAnd for them not to be able to find her under these circumstances is really really unusual dad cadaver dogs they had sent tracking dogs that everything you can imagine there to help [noise]\nWell eventually when the sheriff and the search and rescue personnel pulled out I mean that's that's a check on reality time if you're the family because you're looking at going back to Pennsylvania without your daughter and basically just Chuck Canadian with no more assistance\nBasically just Chuck it in with no more assistance but the family had a lot of gumption they start pushing harder they did some Kickstarter campaigns\nAre trying to pay for a food and things for friends that were just stand on site and searching day and night well actually and I don't even know how somebody wanted me to get to talk to the mom\nAnd the mom and I communicated and I kind of gave him this road map and it's the same thing I've said is that you've got to get these reports otherwise you're just going to be replicating the exact same effort that search and rescue stung before down a lot of instances that may turn some results because\nPeople are found in areas that have been previously search that's true but if they have a lot of area where they say that they haven't searched it very thoroughly and the state that on the reports which they do not Syria you really want to give it a big push\nBut the mom told me that they weren't getting any cooperation from the sheriff the sheriff wouldn't give them any reports the search and rescue people weren't given him any reports and they were getting frustrated now this is the same thing I tell every family and if there's one listener now there's this which you have to do\nYou don't go to the local news media and then you you don't understand is George\nIs the local news media has to deal with the sheriff in that county Dan in day out for the rest of their life they can't burn a bridge\nThey can't get 'em irritated they have to live with them but they national bureaus clock CBS NBC CBS the national bureaus you want to get one of those people in there and you want them to start stirring it up\nAnd then you want to send a family member down to the congressman or the senator's office and demand that they get more assistance and more help for you and you stay there until they realize you got to be a thorn in their side so that they get you more help or not the kind of the reality of it it's sad but it's true\nAnd there were dogs used in this one as well\nYeah there were multiple multiple times\nAnd it's just so weird um a lot of these cases you have to come to the conclusion that somebody just snatched snatch the victim just", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "01"}
