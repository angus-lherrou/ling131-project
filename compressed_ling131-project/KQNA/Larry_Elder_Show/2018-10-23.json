the show thank you so much for calling\nMueller first of all like to thank you proclaim that are some audio from night storm what a great story [noise] it's amazing that question I Believe we have the technology for financial institutions to prevent personal fund\nFrom being transferred to the United states to Mexico Honduras\nGuatemala and I'm Wondering if that doesn't make\nSense of the logical or at least a part of a logical answer to the immigration problem we're happy\nTo stop the remittances from here to Mexico\nMexico Honduras Guatemala\nI I Would imagine we do have the technology to do it the question is whether or not or would be effective are these people are already here are and the question is what do we do to prevent more illegal alien from coming here and that's what the president's trying to do\nOr if he were to somehow try to stop ... who's a and a remittances that his money coming from people in this country to Mexico because I Believe they're a second largest source of income after oil\nUm I don't know it seems to me that doing that would also exacerbate the problem in in Mexico I hear people say that\nIf President Trump for example withdraw the aid from Honduras in Guatemala it will simply make conditions there even worse or and or would create even more so called migrants it seems to me the argument of ... up about Mexico has that Mexico's economy under developed\nAnd needs to be developed and you stop the remittances if even if you could do it legally I'm not sure how that would create conditions that would make it\nBetter for Mexicans to stay in Mexico as opposed to coming up here illegally but thanks for the idea of cannot look into it tight is in San Antonio Texas tired during the Larry able to show\n[noise] Larry love your show man thank you so much make you\nUm so yeah that that testimony from that going on than a fantastic on\nThat as a conservative or for now a long long time one of the things I've understood is that the Democratic party at an absolute stranglehold on the black community now and the mind that\nUh for about six years and they had no intention of ... what is going to take the black community in general like them to get out of their\nCells and so\nBut but to my point you you had a caller to ask you how many legal\nImmigrants are accepted into this country um\nAnd I happen to know living in San Antonio I'm married to a Hispanic woman her family is from Mexico\nWe as a country per year except about one million\nLegal immigrants of which about six hundred thousand\nOr residency changes I don't know maybe they have dual citizenship and they're moving to America I'm not sure what the situation it but that leaves you with about four hundred thousand so that boils down to almost eleven hundred per day okay legal citizens that we are accepting into this country\nAnd at this point in our history we have the most legal immigrants that we have ever had and that's thirty seven thirty seven no\nIf you if you estimate our population you know you and do that math that goes up almost ... percent of our population is legal in ...\nSo you know to make the the argument and this is through not only democratic uh you know presidents for Republican and minister Asians and and this has been going on for a long long time\nUm but you know I wanted to ask you you mentioned earlier on your show that Mexico has felony policy for old buddy who enters the country illegally\nThat's right my my bigger question here my bigger question is if Mexico is\nAnd from what I hear they have a blockbuster and be willing to help you you say that they're they're pretty much just escorting them and kind of you know I'm I guess protecting them or whatever they're doing now is that these people are not rounded up by the federal rally immediately or at least\nA medium that we can't four out of the the the integrity of Mexico's\n... ... ... if they're if they're entering legal\nYou know that's the first one so why should they why should you know if they're if they're agreeing to help us and we just went on to a new trade\nDeal with them and it just seems like the third mainly pressuring me

like we're going to go to Mars when I'm either ... or one of us ... and we're one of its competitors takes a fair um space sexist pushing hard a following up their success with the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle with\nA developing their beat up far rocket which will be a fully reusable or to stage to orbit hundred and fifty tons to earth orbit vehicle that's\nEquivalent to a Saturn five but fully reusable or that will give us the capability to go to Mars uh and if they should um you know ... off the edge of the ice because you know you must like to skate next to the to the ice\nIs um they got a blue origin company by a lead by Jeff Bezos the owner of Amazon is a is a coming up on his heels so uh we've got a new space race going on and I think that one of the ... outfits is going to get us to Mars right now [noise]\nYou know NASA is does great work with its robotic planetary missions and its space astronomy missions uh ... they work in that field is epic but the human spaceflight program is dysfunctional uh they claim they want to go to the moon but they're not even planning a reasonable plan to do that\nAnd um so I think it's gonna be one of the new kids on the block that gets us there\nAre you happy that privatization is taking off the way it is and that NASA is kind of like speeding away\nI'm happy that privatization is taking off I Am not happy that NASA's human spaceflight program as dysfunctional\nAh I'm not happy about that at all um the uh you know I ... it would be disastrous NASA's robotic space flight program and space astronomy programs became is dysfunctional as the human spaceflight program but\nI mean it's really sad to see this program that I mean that storm to heaven and the Nineteen sixties doing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I was at a conference in Florida a month ago where a high level NASA official to actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said\nWe're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThe moon [laughter] what what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYou got and maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember that to die off so they can help people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who doubt that we went to the moon jumping for joy and say see I told you so\nWhen I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station orbit around the ... which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it's it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is going to be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission I mean ... let me tell you what this they called us the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay [laughter]\nThe the the ...\nHere's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal I Want to read you an office in Saskatoon now you're gonna have to pay to build the building\nAnd you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must do there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a bill to pass on that\nThey had at the end this thing is that I\nBuy the ... and you'd probably sell me what you buy the swamp lend you probably want to sell me\nA lot better off with the swamp land then with this ... well\nYou get on with measles doing what he's doing fell connects bait sex are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching now just kind of and not do much anymore with manned space flights and it's it's disappointing Robert it really is\nIt is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and ... built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon ... and ... and now we we see this thing is just is\nUh and and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible um I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we've had a a major deterioration in the quality the political class in terms of its ability to execute great projects\nOn an act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan a chaos\nAnd the the the you know so there it is but uh I got to tell you you know\nI was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while\nWould come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what what the incompetence who preceded us uh you know want it to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the mood\nI was hoping brightest Stein would do that but it didn't just went along and I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance through a witness the flight of one of the pumpkins or at night to another team back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the sky that night\nUh they didn't know what it was they thought it was a U.S for something like that but it was picked a killer to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is although I mean one might say it's about time uh because sure we started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get him to be reusable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that mosque is done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and and he's reduced the cost of space launched by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram before must now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram traumatic\nIt's dramatic it's spectacular and it was done on a shoestring compared to [noise] um what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems I mean it was done like for one tenth the money in one third of the time that anyone ugly was accepting would be normal\nAnd this thing um that the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space and a number of other advanced fields that people were helpless\nUh so okay Bezos has his own money Scott blue origin but we now have three small launch companies\nA firefly a vector space um electron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars\nA two to field a small launch systems and it even goes beyond the the space industry we now have you shouldn't power startups getting funded\nBecause people you know they were looking at future parents all this has just never going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years\nAnd but people in say maybe it's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the ...\nAnd um I gotta tell ya I actually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and I can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around the table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be at a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably a start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what he's going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours next on coast to coast to you know\nAlways on your phone you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized gr mobile users just point your iPhone or Android rose or to go to go to the um dot com and enjoy\nWell he is very driven in her yard working uh\nUh and he is a driven to want to do\nSomething great for the human future he wants to be a person for the troops he likes money he likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what it's about a now\nUh\nNow he he he really wants to do he he wants to go down in the history books for doing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that\nHe doesn't just want to do great deeds he wants eternal gory for doing great deep so he's not Mother Teresa he can be selfish and he he um and he certainly um I'm not above using people ah\nAnd you know if you look at some of the things about him that um didn't come off so well like Kim getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand um that that's the other side of it so you know uh the the you know there is\nUm\n... you know a self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it's a selfish for eternal glory for doing great the eagle ...\nIt's not exactly ego it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology like the ... had this is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth\nYou know uh uh when he gets that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core\nTo to fight the French because he he even though I mean the odds are more against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone\nSo you know that's must to AT T and um\nAnd and and so but really um [noise] you know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I think must ... hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that as a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant two girls that are you looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... that's what he's about but you know um\nHow would you ... ... Robert\nWell Jeff Bezos has much calmer a much more laid back um I don't know these cells I met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh and if you look at how the two companies are run\nA they reflect the at a mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast or he wants everything done yesterday and um\nThe company takes chances and us far um they're winning um blood is certainly a\nThere they pushed very hard being shows the model if this company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush measles strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why a limited funds that sounds like the strengths doesn't it [noise]\nUm well in one sense it's obviously is a but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space sacks is racing ahead of him so this is the you know stay sex and the hair\nUm blue origins the tortoise and ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race\nYou know measles is at least ten times as rich as mosque okay so I mean you must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the night before the richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also want a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA for the military\nBeing so it was just doing it all with his own money okay these shows you know is the richest man in the world ah and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon's stock each year or so it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has unlimited time I'm mosque knows that I'm you know in aerospace a cost just people times time\nUh the quicker you just do something the cheaper costs people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no it costs much less\nUh because uh you know a space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still or whether it's moving\nBill that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in the march ... what's going on with some of these discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOh yeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European bought all these experiments or ex discoveries by the way are being made now with a\nUm something that's not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar and his radar that can look through the ground and see what's underground\nAnd um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water [noise]\nUh and um but it it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment\nUm it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was liquid water underground on Mars has now been found and I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place\nI think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth\nSome of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth are still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the groundwater is is as it was billions of years ago and they've been down there and\nIf there was ever life on the surface of Mars it would have retreated into that ground water and it'd be they're still\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American Mars Reconnaissance orbiter\nHas found glaciers on Mars at mid latitudes fat is I'm a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA million cubic kilometers\nOf pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust measures right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it's as far south is thirty eight ... a a north and the northern hemisphere Mars which by the way the same latitude to San Francisco\nSo imagine that there were glaciers in San Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC\nAnd you know a Washington DC you know that the the latitude that these things are\nAnd what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get out of it with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people this is strange some people say that if there is life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird\nWhy well that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think there's there's\nTwo the there there's two different versions of it one is the scientists saying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay\nContamination yeah well that's\nLike saying if you go to France you won't know that people they are friends who are not I mean but the ... because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean look if if if how do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did\nWell for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower this all this stuff that they built in the past well if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and there will be fossils of it\nAnd I mean to to to say that fossils of life on Mars don't prove that the life you find there was there before is like the people who say that dinosaur bones don't prove that there were dinosaurs because God could have put the dinosaur bones in the ground and\nAnd and the world could have been made in seven days and there never was a geologic past it it's all been a a trick by tricky gods and and um I mean it's just absurd um so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "23"}
