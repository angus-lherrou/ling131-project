I think it was maybe I don't know if it was the crawling hand or just the hand but they have this very convincing hand to crawl ... different body hand crawling by itself\nAnd I and and um I Am and I haven't bothered me so much to my dad said you know if the rubber hand that they still with great jelly and you know are manipulating with wires and I'm sure there's a quotation was dead wrong\nBut when you put into this perspective a wait this is fun time they're playing\nThis is a show this is this is this is this is a game you know this is something to make a ... this isn't something that just the torture me this is this is something for fun\nAnd I think that there was this kind of an a ha kind of moment and I think from that point forward\nOr I couldn't get enough you know it was a high ... if it were and not just for all you know I Wonder I feel is is that under ... I think are under the bigger umbrella of fantasy though uh I think the horror is an offshoot of fantasy and so it's I find I I like all of that I like a\nJohn or movies I like a you know monsters and a robot and engines and pirates and all\nMy dad used to bring me God rest his soul to all these movies when I was a kid I remember him taking me to see them as Syrians when I was seven years old Mr long ago yeah and then of course the scary one for me I was nine years old the house on the haunted deal\nWhen the original one with Vincent Price right I mean\n... house on a wider blind woman and the seller man I ...\nHe would really do all these movies you know I don't know if he brought me because my mom didn't want to go for when we just wanted me around but\nI mean all these all these movies he would bring me too yeah and then the the TV shows he would love to see\nScience fiction theater in in in those kinds of shows right you know you'd have them on all the time I think he's one of the reasons why my mother is one of the reasons why I got into broadcasting and I'm you know indoor UFOs and the paranormal\nBut my dad got me into these movies and all these science fiction shows he loved those things\nI was sure you know when all of those and I think it all ties together you know because I think that curiosity you know I'm just the fact like just like a like a show like Star Trek my you know kind of brought us the cell phones and\nAnd uh you know all sorts of things\nYou know I think that the curiosity for the adults in the supernatural you know I think it is probably the genesis or the Steve although a lot of um your your guest on your show who started watching these uh\nMovies in and decided to go hey let's dig deeper than what you know are there goes let's find out\nI think so too what do you think of the Texas Chainsaw massacre Nineteen Seventy four immersion\n[noise] you know the the Texas Chainsaw massacre gifts has had the heaviness wrap everyone was trying to do the tech the strings on that so that there there is hardly a drop of blood in that whole movie\nYou think there is you think there is I think the area to write you know and you go back and you watch it and you know it's all filmed murky sixteen millimeter and is it took the chainsaw and how weird\nTheir house was with all the the mo mobiles made out of bones and you know the the psychological aspect is really what clicked with that movie and I think that everyone that went to an ass Kurt those were really I think they're really sloppy slap dash\nYou know a bunch of teenagers waiting to get swat are kind of movies but really as the original Texas Chainsaw as they were they were they were heartbroken when they got an R rating and they were trying to get a PG E because they would find no one was going to go see it\nThe Nineteen sixty Alfred Hitchcock movie psycho new shower scene you would think you were looking at ... moons every second not one in ... I mean did you see in that shower scene you\nKnow I Know at no point does the knife a entered Janet leads body at any point uh you\nYou are you there you know it's happening but you don't see\nThat this sounds I think out a lot of that and there were a bunch of other ... there were a bunch of melon but they had laid out and they were stabbing different types of melons and Hitchcock is dangerous for his chance and watching this down guy you know making all these weird hollow strange down stabbing all these different fruits and vegetables\nThat was gonna say a word and as he's walking out the door he just says ... stop a\nLear which project started with pennies but that was a scary one to\nThe Blair Witch project is really interesting because you know a a you know they were uh unfortunately I had a friend who was assured when a when that movie came out and he was cleaning up bomb it every single night job he couldn't handle it\nBecause it and it wasn't because it was scary it was because people had had become accustomed to this town footage first person you know just a just a handy cam or a camcorder filming a whole movie\nUm you know so uh you know that was kind of a first of the sort of found footage type stone\nAnd an independent film and went really big and you know when it's like okay well you can say what you want about that movie but you know that in that movie was a that was the director hat final caught and they made the movie they way the way they wanted to make it and they created this whole legend that much more I mean I live in Pennsylvania\nNot far from a where the Blair Witch supposed to happen and people still\nDrive in they're looking to uncover this thing that never happened so they really really great job of not only are making a a a found footage film but for creating a a a a story that people wanted to believe in and you know he had nowadays I think that'd be hard to do\nBecause of the Internet it gives you can't keep a secret for twenty second but in Nineteen Ninety nine or ... everybody everyone thought the Blair Witch was the thing\nWhat did you take a Freddie Krueger then nightmare on elm street\nYou know it's interesting I didn't like it when I saw it originally uh you know it just there's got to just [noise] gritty and\nCame out in Nineteen eighty four right\nEighty four but you know I I've gone back and there's a lot of humor in it and and and it's great marriage that\nSaid you know he's not just stabbing people going into their dreams\nUh which I think they pretty liberally ripped off from the movie dream skate which I think came the year before which is an excellent movie that people should seek out\nWhere someone was trying to assassinate the president inside of his dream right uh but uh yeah ... it's actually very clever movie and and uh it was any any are no more than ever they go five six seven sequels yet they're getting pretty bad\nThere was a movie out two thousand fourteen I never saw it's got a weird movie it shows up is one of the horror films have you ever heard of it the bomber do\nYes I have you know and I did not like the father just pretty much did it's Australian film I Believe a about a a mother and her child [noise] and uh they are basically kind of dealing\nWith the grief a hell of a lost all of a spouse or wherever and a father um and I think it ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "05"}
