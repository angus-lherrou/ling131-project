America is locked in a new kind of do a little Cold War with the Russians and the Chinese\nThe Russian Federation under a populist opted authoritarian leader seriously threatens the west through cyberspace and military thanks for that country heavy investment in sophisticated masks carrying weapons\nThe People's Republic of China\nIs a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on a rapidly growing use nation economically and militarily and together China and Russia collaborate\nTo dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become the catalyst that leads to the prophetic and times\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis author of alliance of evil is here for hours one and two\nHours three and four let's see what shall we do I thought maybe we could exchange some meal recipes because there's absolutely nothing going on right\nI I actually remember slower gait news dates back in the nineties\nWhen we would sit around and say wow there's nothing going on well that certainly isn't the case these days when was the last time we had a slow news day open line in the last half hour of this audio transmission of course there's the murder of\nSaudi journalist ... there are migrants on the march from Honduras there as the mid term elections in on the horizon we could talk\nThe mid term elections in on the horizon we could talk about all that stuff but but\nLet me just throw this log on the fire and I think it's the single most important question out there even more important than who wins the house who wins the Senate\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has you know really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that um they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps with the west is looking at because\nThey want to rise again they want to be a great power again and they do have them the means through their nuclear arsenal and of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that\nYou know we have a modern weapons systems that really a push against the emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the offering guard a twenty time\nSpeed of sound a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a defense system\nWeapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on it so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back they are concerned about NATO and we did violate a the initials trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves\nIn a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion handcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps smoothing over relations pulling back from the brink if you will because now\nBecause everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House or that he has to be asked to appear\nAlmost overly aggressive against the Russians how much has this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I think that it has and in fact putting said once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nAnd Helsinki this July uh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are a an not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was ridiculed reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nAh the United states I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower uh not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and the like\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of this but at the same time he doesn't want stability he does want to end the tensions I'm at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nWell let's pay the China you mentioned the trade wars are ... and how people need to appreciate how this trade war strategy or terrorists uh against China is not just economic it's also national security and that if\nI Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later in this and it tends to weaken China is significantly economically so that they can uh a cheese military supremacy over the United states\nMore clearly we have as the number one and number two\nEconomic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest to keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and the in the last year or so I have seen somewhat of a death you know there is what six and a half percent growth\nIn the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters [noise]\nUh [noise] but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property and Trump says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through your company to company relationship and company to states\nDo your company to company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is national security\nWe can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let\nOur wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president and chief said much the same but from a very different positions so are there hopefully going to meet within the month maybe in Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese media is is trying to figure out Trump you know just like the\nAmbassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans to manage you always want to keep\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does\nThis call it an alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other\nA component to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of their the Russians and the Chinese becoming a bed may exist or even by ... gene anyway are are there still vestiges of\nA communist ideology here or is this simply about hedge many\nWell a combination of things I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy if it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence and we're the nation is as opposed to what they would call an amoral west\nA and the things that they represent they paint the wife says what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and I said you don't want that in fact\nYou know potent as is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nAnd the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he you know even though he ... he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man\nIn the ... in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week you had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even started to you know hit\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent\nIn this case to serve the on twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh yeah this past march you know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that putting this doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\nNot exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing if they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion a predatory economics strategic extortion\nInformation warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there was a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just\nCome out alive and they they like blinking red lights\nAnd they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests and in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently in their fence ministers just met you know for ten years time over the on opposite\nSides of the interruption I got to jump in here will pick it up on the other side alliance of evil lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis here is Jimmy hendrix taking it to the break was booted child on coast to coast am\n\nFind out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar shirt free which sign up at home kind of luck dot com home title luck dot com\n[noise]\n\nLieutenant colonel Robert beginning the author of alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrives who do you perceive us the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard is Russia and given their provocations but also a their military capability which they're not shy to exercise around the globe um they you know the chief of naval operations I'm rich and\nYou know has said recently were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two\nThe old Cold War with the third one or the Russians have put in place a nuclear submarine and and I ... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the Atlantic the Mediterranean and elsewhere\nAnd of course they're confronting us militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines\nAre they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as we know all about the allegations and justifiably are the sanctions put in place because of their interference in the twenty sixteen election in here recently or in the twenty eighth team it terms we arrested\nA someone courses and the Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are bellicose and they're\nYou know claims against us and to a certain degree now we're pushing back you know President Trump's not a you know backing down\nAnd that and given that there's you know some given some take but maybe\nIt's not a favoring an outcome that guy is going to suit is all ah and then of course you joined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy ... an issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a way of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe\nYou know do I say Russia is more dangerous now China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] while we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas now why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic weapons that are polluting puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours\nUm but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and and the near future and are they willing to use it twelve ... says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that's in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nWhy the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen\nNow wants to fund a new counter to ah that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all of these kind of flattering around there I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nOr and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with this platforms and his uh weapons\nAre that they're the the mere threat in the long term threatened and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok\nTwenty eight team joined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise\nThese sorts of indicators\nDemonstrate that these two nations are pushing back against the former dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can come up with the conclusion I think that uh perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening\nOr certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry\nA and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course\nThough not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that clearly we don't have and they were trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to war maybe World War three ...\nWell that's a that's why you know Trump has been over there you know trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more and you know you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members to we need to all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia go in and and and disturbed that country and then as your right to make it clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been I'm On a declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked a you know in New York and\nAnd Pennsylvania and in the light can we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so\nUm no I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's\nCapability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need that may not have\nThe wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to ah you know make these tough decisions so that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps it's going to talk to his counterpart in the Kremlin next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts than NATO and and he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise]\nUh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nAnd I had better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even Paul and which is a you know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did with Ukraine these are all issues of\nIt's similar to what they did with Ukraine these are all issues of great a magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nWas talking about China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador\nAnd the president is accused the Chinese as of meddling in the mid mid term elections\nUh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states I'm a big concern is I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about a Chinese made computer chips in components in electronics they may have a back door\nOr even in US military equipment talked me about the series the seriousness of ...\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly at the Pentagon you know the defense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate said look you\nKnow even in these Chinese made yeah phones you know who you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges are you know our our stores are we're not going to buy certain items because we're suspect that the Chinese have\nAnd somehow you know put chips and these devices that can turn\nOn and trance Mitt information that we don't want to lose so it's not only impacting individuals' it's impacting the institution and of course you're right you know we're in bed with the Chinese on all sorts of economic\nUh activities building the equipment that through\nSecond and third level a contributors to a large end item end up\nIn the U.S military and that's why I think there are a lot of people are concerned you know the Chinese establish this year the strategic support force where she got her attention because it's centralized is within the People's Liberation army the space cyber and electronic warfare capability", "year": "2018", "show_name":
