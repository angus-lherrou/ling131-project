slaves why cannot crowded that freedom fries every I can play\nWhen the Democrats on this way and Democrats owned slaves and the Republicans tried to free them\nAnd then after the war the Democrats allege blacks and the Republicans tried to save them and now here we are in twenty Eighteen the Democratic party has destroyed African American and the Republicans like Donald Trump Donald Trump is saving them but ... but the media doesn't cover that why do they\nKnow they don't and I'm very upset because general either for this year I went to the journal has cable\nAnd I heard a report on land

Patsy uh some are concerned that Obama and Clinton are back out campaign\nYou might recall that Obama said my name's on the ballot this is my third term Hillary's going to continue my policies and they were so roundly unpopular that as soon as the American people living in Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin Iowa Florida Texas\nHurt Obama's say vote for Hillary we've got four more years of my policies\nThat's what caused working class folks in these so called swing states to come out one hundred percent against Obama and against Hillary Clinton because as soon as they discovered you know what am I vote for Hillary I got four more years of Obama maniacs I Can't take it\nHeld that is why Trump was elected and so of Hillary and or an Obama and Michelle whoever wants to go out and keep campaigning I say go out there remind the American people how much better things are today are you better off today than you were two years ago\nThe answer is no chose yes they're jurors hail yes stay

white president President Donald Trump\nBut why did they want to walk around ... raises doing more for black people than Iraq Hussein Obama you have president Donald Trump who's looking out for people's best interest making sure that they have job so that they can provide for their families and the people that have been in justly wrong\nAnd looking out for people that's coming out of prison so that they can have a second chance the second opportunity at life\nAs president Donald Trump that's bringing these jobs\nBack here to American for Americans to work because of lack president said does job never come back and you have to be the individual to send jobs overseas and leave the American people over here broke and broken and no way for them to take and take care of their children\nI tell you what do you when you look at what he said you might recall diamond Broncos saying Obama's in New Jersey coming back man you can forget about it they're not dumb and I just want because new trade deals again it deals with much to do the trade deals with South Korea the trade deals with Europe and the fact China's gonna fall on any Trump\nTrump dictate to the next ... months whose job in the back door the sixth sense economically African American under Trump won none of that happen under Obama\nOut we're going to say you look at the unemployment rate all time low in the history okay about African Americans look at the economic opportunity people are able to go out if you don't have a copy can create your job\nTo become an entrepreneur or yes all the ship is up I'm an African American I mean people want to thrive in this country and they are doing so not only that that's why he also gave your tax cuts that when you have more money in your pocket\nBut I don't want to look at the tax rates the Democrat Party back in the day they pushed the Jim Crow days of suppressing press\nThat day they tried to put them to suppress all threat and I think we the American people are going to fall for the American people mad\nBody that's going to tell us what was going to make sure that we live in and we are able to obtain the American dream where they told us his teeth loyalties lie with illegal aliens\nAnd making sure that this country it's it's tough to make sure that they are such and it's a place that we thought that America could no longer just the way we can go at the white listen you've got to go to the Democrats the dot com tickets they put me on the fifteenth and the editor snakes why\nGo get your tickets after I wanted to show that these people and it's not

stuff that people don't want out their time in his suitcase on bit scream\nTrying to educate people and show you what you've been missing what you've been asleep too is time for people to wake up you have the Democrats want to apologize but they didn't want to abolish slavery\nThat's that that's a shame and it should be ashamed of black people to be okay with the Democrats than we gonna do this we're going to give you stability we gotta get get that there was in office for eight years and what did they do for the black community absolutely not little lean on at the end\nUp going his way if people do not know their history they're condemned to repeat it for the party was the confederacy now declaring war the United states of America\nThe Democratic party one of the blame reached the underground party was a party of Jim Crow hey how about lynching when you\nGo let me tell you something back in the day people will be discriminated against that sort of cut out their fan but they they're bad that I guess it's going to come up that politics [laughter] what just happened to cabinet full of shit\nThat they just put it this way and in our country\nSay man woman boy cat wherever you are what are they out your own company and follow people how to get some of these\nPeople that don't have that and Republicans because they don't want to protect the people that want to try to

you the truth the Democrat Party should be deemed a terrorist group come on out there telling people to her on a human being an American they shouldn't be the no party they should be\nHow other American can be the no party it'd be the parents grew\nTo look what Hillary Clinton said the other night she she said that we must be on civil to Republican leadership for the modern Democratic Party Cory Booker Maxine Waters\nOr Hillary Clinton incentivizing encourage violence begets Republicans based upon their political beliefs don't you think the president should send the FBI and others to

when I was teaching high school\nOne of the motivators should I use because I taught in Miami, Florida American money now I tell you these students couldn't care less about history or that or what I used was personal appeal and I would look at how important for you to know this for your own right\nOkay [laughter] you know where you're going to be able to be more\nIt's because of you know where you're going to be able to be more successful and then they started to look up their heads came up a little bit I mean I personalize it to them\nSo here we have a a country the United states in two thousand Eighteen where we have a rise of evil in our own country\nAnd there's no question that's happening in kids being gunned down in schools I was in some people's shock on the streets of Chicago by drug gangs clerics abusing children yeah there's no question that there was a rise of evil\nIn America in order to understand why you have to go back\nTo the best most vivid example of evil that we've seen in modern civilization\nAnd that Germany in World War two and how ordinary shopkeepers and farmers and bankers could put on black uniforms now with the debt insignia on their cap [noise] go into concentration camps and kill babies no ordinary people yeah All right\nSo in that scenario once you start to read it and understand it then becomes a factor in your own life so do you look away do you look away like most of the Germans did\nUm you know calling a robot Irish here if you ran a a an organization a news organization that was actually care too conservative in traditional Americans those imitations would stop\nSo and you know people say oh that can't be true it is true then offered culture decades now what happens on the street with the reporters I work for CBS and ABC right I Know and it was a myriad early what it is bad and doing back then\nIt was kind of on they deny it but everybody knew what the culture was and now they're proud of that\nThey're proud of being part of the resistance [laughter] not your job in jobs to tell the truth right and you know I mean you have your job is to be part of the resistance\nThen you've got time and I I bought the words used

Donald John Trump it might have seen earlier tonight to sixty minutes sixty minutes had him on a but luckily star then showing a little or no respect interrupting them so much\nBut nonetheless a on a friday night a couple of nights ago he was in my hometown erupt Cincinnati and he got a hold of me on a on four or five days at a time and ask about what's available to stop and say hello when he's in town when the president I ask you to do something especially one who's as charismatic as consequential as President Trump forty five\nActually have no problem doing that some things schedule friday night said to heck with it I Want to be with the president and he's a warm carrying engaging person the way you or your way worse the rope lines\nAre private time together our discussion was fabulous and a and I'm going to share that the interview with you here coming up in about five or six minutes\nAnd I think you're going to find a very good because you're ... you're going to get a sense of the man and what he what lies ahead what the interview today I think are tonight on sixty minutes I thought was ridiculous luckily stole did a horrible lousy job I think my time with the president a couple of nights ago was much better\nSo I'm an air that interview or in a few minutes and the president also extremely complimentary things to say about me for which I'm most appreciative and also if it wasn't for I think Sean Hannity and my\nFriend Sean Compton [noise] and then also their friendship with the president [noise] uh I'm not sure he would have invited me to [noise] to me with him on friday night and a couple of nights ago and I also told you ask me what I thought how I thought he was doing in\nThe Midwest somebody gave I thought\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax just sort of ... percent but for the most part they don't even know like that\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair\nUh we met with them I told them I'm going to start taxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away\nAnd then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not only call me back but\nI'm going to give you one more chance than it has said that's okay I'm going to actually cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money and they immediately helped in a plane and came over and talk to and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with it but I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the other\nWay really shine where five hundred million a year five trillion over town we feel Shanghai we'd do Beijing at some point we've got to start building America that got the new airport we don't have the new airport they got the new bridges we don't have the project at some point our money's got to come back to America\nHere so right so China's been taken out five hundred billion dollars you know people have no idea what that is five hundred video we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President she said we can't do it very simple we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've got put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has written about fact not what people do say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because there's a twenty five percent\nSo we're taking and billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China where they become expensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make the products here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we used to do it\nSo China has been look China's the biggest several mall by far it's probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost\nOver the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade we lose with everybody those days are over\nBill how Leslie wherever the midterms coming up one of my favorite

Rasmussen finish ... now we're doing great and and then they say you can add a lot to it\nBecause when people hang up and they say we don't want to talk to you that means it's at Trump phone record of that's good or bad but that's what I mean it's a we have to\nDo well I Will say I think we're going to do very well on the Senate and a lot of things have happened since justice now justice cabin on fifteenth jobs at her step fifty new judge many many judges\nAnd we're going to have a hundred and forty five judges fairly so when you think about it I mean a hundred and forty five it will be close to fifty percent of the whole judiciary not only to Supreme Court justices so\nBut that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with justice cabin or because\nI've rarely seen a person treated so badly the man of great distinction a great life and the way they treated him was horrible and since that happened Republicans are looking so is everybody they see what's going\nOn under the law unintended consequences because since I've had many women were spurred my air ville I with Kevin they don't want to say publicly but if you send in a weird sense Kevin all as motivated

important and I'm here for him\nBut I just want to thank you for everything you've done and and hopefully people are going to realize that just a very important election Mitt terms I think frankly I

giving that special gift\nOne that you don't put in a drawer and forget about no it's it's the one gift that you can visit or use every single day and tomorrow and the day after that\nAnd for that singular the perfect present that's all wrapped up in a boat for this planet and every one on it it's the great pyramid of Egypt\nYou don't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving the great pyramid\nIs forty two story tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly leveled and rock pointing exactly true north of south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years\nAllegedly and yet we know nothing about it a few\nShort decades after Cleopatra's rain a sparrow any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egypt should history\nWas forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read high ... nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything and it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they would travel to Cairo and they look across the Nile and say\nYou know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that\nYou know the answer air quotes\nWe don't know you know but it's really big [laughter] that's that's it\nIt took nearly Eighteen hundred years to figure out the language and you would think that was all of the expedition to Egypt over the centuries that someone sometimes somewhere would have shown up who knew how to read write or speak any of it\nBut it never happened\nAre we speak any of it but it never happened\nAnd although today we know about the Rosetta Stone and the quest to the code everything the great and eat eat Egypt and Tunisia that was already happening and in full swing centuries before Cleopatra committed suicide\nAnd and so I started reading a little bit more and uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I had to you know I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and life and I met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shock or a few months later and um you know just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um a few a couple of years in\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website\nAnd we're going to be discussing those ads linked to night on the program and you can get to my news website by clicking add to coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the paper section everything was in the row a new is the first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight uh you and a Robert Duvall and Robert shock\nSat down and started discussing uh the the screenings and punished that paper what was it that happened over breakfast to where the light bulbs started going off that got too involved in all of this\n[laughter] yeah well you know this is a this goes back to old Ryan mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the gentleman yet the authors\nUm I I was just a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah builds the ... pyramid uh and online and and want it to align them with the three ... and they had to be some kind of record and you know it was it causes believe that uh the architect of the great pyramid to first of all of the three with him you know\nAnd so I looked at the stature I started looking at the statue of he looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceded that way\nAnd and so why don't as I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on that are on the pedestal off that statue\nUm I noticed that and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the uh the book the that they just have coauthored origins of the things which is an amazing ... by the way it is\nYeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section is developing a you know something that he knows the dreams the law which is you know in front of the policy of the ... between the positive things\nAnd there was a a so he was talking basically about the things in the sky and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about the things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the parents will build if there was a stains then it's it would have been such an amazing monument that that should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remember the line is on the pedestal\nOne thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page Robert sawed and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or at the um I think it was positive origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast at night I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than ten minutes and\nWe uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about why\nIs it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight you know why is it that the one of the games applied to in general but you had the great pyramid the grades banks\nAre two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles but he's not documented the anywhere in Egypt history where you would think well you know the ... love to write everything that you don't have to\nGo and tell their story and not only that but taxes and in accounting in seasons everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except for the great strengths and the great pyramid wind missing in history\nYeah that that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy on I mean you know the you want to answer you could give us that maybe we just we haven't found the record so the records were destroyed\nUm but it is there is that there is a striking paucity or or maybe total absence um and of course that was the problem with it stinks you know I thought to myself that if\nOf course that was the problem with it stinks you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nThe new scripture that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something at least the things I'm\nThe pyramids we um you know when you are next so that when you buy the great pyramid there was a term from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years after a you know ... was alive and if you walk into that too there's actually a reference\nTo the great pyramid and also to the ... in in in the two of his call to the whole rise of coup full and next to it it's the um the you know the the country it's great so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid\nSo they call that country is great and kudos pyramid was called the whole eyes look cool\nAnd so this was a priest that was a you know supervising other priests that were on the show and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is declaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou earn the pyramid yeah you would expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have it but there isn't even a general reference to two points in the direction\nAnd forget about the other something about our was builder who built in or the year was built you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that it can be all the way\nTo her auditors um you know fifth century but the you know this was in during Persian will um two thousand years after the fact and and what it is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know are you saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the bar too low and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years um and that we're machines that were hauling up the blocks but\nYou would think that you know just like you you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's got\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just too confusing is look great Spanx yet we also have the same issues and if it wasn't for the dream Stella well in the inventory stole or we may not know anything at all\nBut yes\nThat was the dream still or is a ... you know there was a dispute or at the turn of the um twentieth century that may be close to Fort who is the author of the dream still up between the positive things that he is the one to build it that was actually being debated\nUm but ah and there is a there is a small reference to pray but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that it does definitely does not say that he built it\nUm and so that's the dream still at the end mentors the all the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when ... when I think overall I mean key ups I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same as the ... the Greek name Cooper was the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that even towards the lead story on a critically Kuiper came to the ... already exist that in fact it was broken you repair it and then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid of his queens into it's\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leading off right now the coast to coast damn are murals tribute church or ... minute safety is a day and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nWind up more emotion ideas on\n\n\nOr ... minute say Saudi and my new uh we were talking about the inventory Joe and the dream dollar right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward\nAnd in the dreams dollar a top most for shows\nWhat a top most of the poor says mentions and in illustrates two things is there\nAnd desert Fox joke tweeted he's there as a second snakes well there's two things there I Know there Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second themes being in the sky\nI think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take\nIs there a second things\nAnd it's a great question I'm Out of it so that was that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the second sings a as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question and it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed things\nAre and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is\nA ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptian stock was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nAnd these depictions are um you know they're on unmistakable\nSo so the answer to this question specific golf course there hasn't been found there is there are stories uh Arab historians referred to an actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build mosques\nSo they're they're apparently was a physical things are on the other side of denial but is there are things buried under the sense that the west of a conference here that it's possible\nThe\n... and ... you had mentioned that a coup food shops said that he repaired the speaks but builds agreed pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the inventory della is saying that you was just to repair guy but he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why did the discrepancy\nYeah ah let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as he had of course each of colleges of most colleges do not accept the inventory steal or as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shock and I recently published a paper where we counter this argument's so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but\nJust to be fair to both sides um so what's your question\nUm the ah you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egypt shouldn't means to read it means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the with the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the ... the combination is bad for him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a a is a is a strip of ... where you know the pyramid building has mentioned and they are the verb that that this is not\nFurther a qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuilt\nHum is that a hundred per cent proof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the tires ultimate rare that was found in ... in the right to see\nYou know they are saying well you okay this is the cars talks about tour a store and being ... a ... a a but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that is correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and uh who you mean it was a ... interview you within the other day he made a good point he said that ah he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was back failed\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour I took ... that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up the courses and then you've actual later so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind about it\nAnd there was a quite a bit of relatives or a you know pyramids that coup who is dealing with uh also one of the games a plateau right could there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramid\nThere are you oh you mean in the image or as though the U.S yes yes there is a\nThere is a reference to a head Knutson\nUm hit Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who went to a new since she was supposedly has queen\nAnd uh he build a pyramid for her but the southern most of the three ah off to three a queen permits that are on on the east field it on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but in the human stories though it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting just because they're saying\nThere is no evidence that they knew it was a princess so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that gee I in fact I was a princess or at least that we're saying we've we think is the poop shows that she was a print says\nSo that was what other relatives mentioned um and then don't you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or\nA an old Cyrus other Stella and that those are much further reasons why you should probably just re check to stop because they're saying\nYou know if this were an old kingdom story or at the time of coup who these ... ah you know ISIS on a size we're not yet a working worship there were not official states sanctions or in the eighties\nAnd we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well um but you know it's it's a contentious I I don't want to make it sound like we have the outs or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nAnd then there's another ... glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids are crumbling may don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same answer with the same pair\nRight and those would be more simple to build and you would you would expect to be an allegation if even you know more complex yeah they're not and they're ... stone work is is it's just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing a A R is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just a comment that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed\nLittle bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing storms that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality of you know they're smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the parents after the old kingdom I'm a middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the word friendship definitely declined um after the old kingdom\nNow let's get to what happened last year which was the big news about the new chamber above the grand gallery\nYes after we had been told over and over again and it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there\nWell clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is one of the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing\nUm and and what I like about it is that it was non invasive you didn't have to drill holds you didn't have to you know like a\nA ... the early explorers they used dynamite sticks to blow themselves into these monuments which was awful and nowadays uh it's kind of like the German just telling us you know you wait until you have the technology to to find out about me or without destroying me and I think now we're getting to that point\nAnd that's also what I wanted to do I want us to really get some information out of the pyramid without you know uh putting my hand on of course that ... government is protecting the monuments and I completely agree with that they're making it very difficult for you know invasive studies to be done because they want to protect the monuments and",
