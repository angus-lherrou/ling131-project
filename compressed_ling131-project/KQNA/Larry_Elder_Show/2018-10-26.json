tragically passed on\nJonathan I Know how this was for you when this tragedy occurred how're you doing now\n[noise] well George I'm I'm definitely doing better\nOne of the things that's really help to me is to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the Internet and in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings has disability [noise]\nBut I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body as the finite zone and for the anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body\nAnd so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite and so in meditative thought and thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability in the infant its own were each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat'd you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\n[noise] I have to say that I I question that\nI didn't think about it much and ever since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books him to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nNone of the goals really do we'll get to them in a second but there are three strange occurrences that occurred I Want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the drivers situation what happened there\nSo about eight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want\nAnd he looked at me in a very strange stare and said I'll just tell them Ralph set it\nOff and I looked and I looked at him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said\nNo she how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] I Love it about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning [noise]\nAnd after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it\nAnd the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down I didn't think much about it\nUntil the following Monday and the cemetery called me and said we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\nGets timing in secret the city again and then you had an occurrence with some strange bedroom lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and I turned off the lights and I was leaving and the house was empty\nAnd the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me the ... but the light switch back down and put it back up put it back down and they went off the lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off and at that time I left the house\nAnd just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\nIt was a point where you got ... about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing [noise] um [noise] I don't I don't fault Tam I\nHave struggled to try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shield it themselves from any and all liability from every American citizen\nWell they're they're protected by law aren't doing\nIt there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJohnathan which was Ralph subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\nNo Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student or frequently making jokes he was just if you ask his friend they would portray just the most honest\nI'm likeable young man you could you could think

to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the\nOslo I I think I think he was vomiting profusely there was a lot of blood and he went out with his friends who are all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that call\nWell I got the call after the medication had been given to him about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOkay let's go to some culture for your job let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington questions story Hi Patty\nHi I I've got a little story and I hope it's relevant to\nThis thing can entities that I think I've got more and then you can shake a stick at\nUm it started with my pen a you know the incident he was taken away from me when he was born we somehow managed to to make a connection\nAnd that we can look back for each other on day he was born on my birthday three minutes apart from the same time I was born in from near the scene Korean cities just roll in um um we\nWere both born nine fourteen I was nine fourteen fifty two he was nine fourteen sixty eight and every
