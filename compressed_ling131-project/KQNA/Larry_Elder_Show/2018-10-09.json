lot of people are concerned that that the world of robots is going to take over the planet take you take our jobs and do everything else is that something for us to be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people jobs\nBut I'm not a test on my website you take to try to figure out if if your job is at risk and it did record all the answers and very very few jobs actually cut a robot\nTakeover of and you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or any of the thousands of other things people do and and I'm not\nSure no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think we build these tools to increase our own productivity and when we're all kind of better off because of the\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence or exactly what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[noise] well that's a great question what is it is is more complex and you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means but what what they what people mean by the time or two very different things that may have nothing\nIn common so they either me or what you see in the movies so commander data upstart truck or ... or a that would be an a machine that can do everything a person could do it created it can teach itself new things\nAnd we don't we don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and that's called a general intelligence or\nIt is a computer program that can do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email that can route you through traffic and now we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it and make projections about the future and that doesn't sound all that interesting\nBut that's in a sense of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are faster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things to really look\nSmart um by just using simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just curl us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we all have some amount of privacy or just based on the fact that there are so many others can't follow every person you can't listen\nOf us can't follow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation unfortunately with artificial intelligence the kinds of tools were developing to do very good things like but then of cancer or something like that\nCan be used to to to to follow people voice to the to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded and it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans are reading lip so every camera\nEven doesn't that audio can read lips as well as a human um\nYour you know you have a a device the trucks where you are and they get all of these things that ended up themselves are technologies but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile every one and you even have places in the world\nUm you know China has implemented a kind of a social score yeah that's right you\nWrite run a red light you lose the point if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and if you if you went up you don't fly on airplanes anymore and you don't um\nAnd and do you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't get\nAny may not even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but they're just shows that these technologies really are uh have the capability of of of being misused of course hopefully in in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a Republican but this governed by laws the price of liberty is utterly vigilant so that so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and forced\nThat don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nByron is every tell them telephone conversation smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even though Ninety nine percent of them were probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I just said the technology is at a point where they could decipher you know what what what that many people are saying and then it can\nAh it doesn't have to understand it and the way the human understand something that just has to look for patterns in combinations of words along with um\n... and and and just kind of Bill Bill obstruct profiles on people I mean oh I'm saying is is it is it is a potential way to use this technology which can be can be so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand\nOr a let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about ... something and the computer you know is is set up to pick up code words like bomb terror or whatever\nAnd so it finds this uh on one hand it's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy\nOn the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian ... by run in terms of if it's OK or not\nIt is it and it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have a societal consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know\nFederal is paper that addressed that topic or an hour that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAll right well stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Reverend Reese with us his book is called before the age we're talking a lot of high technology folks and what it does his website is his name linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com we'll be back in the moment don't touch you\nDial never missed a detail on a show or against sign up for the ... ... email newsletter somebody looper pre it goes to ... dot com\n\nAnd then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm probably cost about it I I find that the one person in twenty ... doesn't believe that and yet only take surveys on my website asking essentially the same question\nOn my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe your machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are\nJust machines then no than a machine could never do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence working the way you guys just with chips in the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering who really is um ... the thing is is that when a computer can play chess someone to computer complete go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but\nBut there really is a quote anybody home there's nothing there\nBut does any thinking at all it's it's ones and zeroes manipulated in memory turned on and off at the speed of light um it's done with what's relative it's interesting the techniques we use foreign official intelligence we'd been writing about for\nForty years since just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere is a thought experiment called the Chinese ruin problem\nAnd it's about ... it goes like this series is there's this room a ditch all these books and there's a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to know the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese\nPeople outside the roof slide questions written in Chinese under the door to this Chinese to this library in the library and picks\nThem up looks at the first character on the question goes and finds a book with out on the spine looks up the second character that turns into another book to another book to another book to another book\nUntil it gets to the end of the message\nThe last book says write this down any copies these\nSymbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door and the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since perfect and so the question is does\nIt was the librarian understand Chinese\nThose are those the library and understand Chinese did turn to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense to a lot of people\nKnow that what Brian doesn't know if they're talking about Colorado or coffee beans and the analogy is an apt one because it's all computer does it runs a set of determining stick\nProcesses in memory it spits out an answer and it doesn't know it's playing chess it doesn't know any of what is talking about it doesn't know anything and so you kinda have to ask is the computer thinking or not there's a computer understand anything or not\nA by my way of looking it doesn't it doesn't understand anything but other people other people say if they can do everything that is that something that does understand can do then you just have to say it does\nIs just mind boggling and it's getting even better or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers do this thing where it in a very simple short and they double in power\nEvery couple of years but on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's Fifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can I collect data\nThere'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all of those who may have all this data coming enemies faster computers and so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it if you think about it the Internet the mosaic browser cannot twenty five years ago\nA literally in Ninety three\nAnd all that did was like computers talk to each other and that was hit and that somehow changed our world and that created a twenty five trillion dollars and well a\nMillion new businesses it up in ... I mean it did everything that that a marriage and\nA technology that effectively makes everybody smarter than they were before you go to bed tonight everybody on the planet wakes up with ten more IQ points that is going to be more transformative than\nThe mere Internet which just connected a bunch of machines together this this is machines think\nWill they show emotion Byron\nThat is an open question a it is even an open question whether you want them to\nI don't I'm not sure I Want them to\nSell the first question is do you want them to simulate emotion\nUh there there was a couple of different sides to that you know\nI have a desktop device that I talk to and I interrupted and I tell it to stop in a way I wouldn't do a person\nUm you had you had student had kids in Japan and there was a a robot they let loose in the mall and these little kids would bother it would beat it and the robot learned benefits all bunch of short people kids without a tall person around an adult it needed a run off to a tall person because\nThe kids would abuser now when I asked later the kids said\nThey thought it was feeling distress so they even felt like it was internalizing it and you wonder about\nAbout a kindergarten teacher you know that it's robotic that\nUh the raising children on fake empathy and you you you you just start with that do you even want them to have human voices is that the noble the machine somehow or does\nYou know we've had the car away to these things called human rights a to a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do to any human being because there's something special about a human being\nAnd and do we kinda want to make things look like humans that we do abuse and throw into a scrap heap and and and destroy without\nA second dealt with that is certainly had ain't nothing effect on people now the question can they feel emotion\nA that is an open question we\nWe have we have something called consciousness which is that we experience the world we feel more on a computer measures temperature that difference whatever that is that you feel the warmth of something a computer right now we don't think\nUh can we can measure temperature and even if you make a program that plays a person screaming at the temperature gets over five hundred degrees nobody believes that computer\nFeels pain nobody believes that sent shaping up or ...\nNow the interesting thing is we wouldn't know it if I'm if they did really well you wouldn't know if a tree tall painting you share half your DNA with the with the tree you should know DNA with a computer and so we wouldn't really even know if they ever if they ever developed a emotions\nAnd even if they claimed they did that could just be in a way a program running that you know the\nThe program reasons that it\nCan can achieve whatever objective it launched by making this claim I'm so\nIt it's an open question it it all boils down to do you think of motions in the end are mechanical I mean our our ... again it's a punch\nOur mechanical I mean our our ... again it's a punchy back to the original question are we machines and therefore our experience of emotion is just something mechanical\nWhat happens in these machines Myron go rogue and they started doing things to watch to screw up our lives on purpose\nA little like ... from two thousand once the sun\nIs I mean look\nIf it ever happened ah we're completely vulnerable of course\nYou know if there were eighty billion devices attached to the Internet\nYou know smart other news just turn all alone and override their safety protocols I mean\nThere are so many ways a malevolent machine would want to um would be able to inflict harm\nThe interesting and and so you kinda have to say what would that happen and it can happen to one or two scenarios either through countless programming the machine just does that it doesn't have any intent at all um\nFor Kendall machine somehow developed\nGoals of the tone that are different than ours and perhaps in conflict with ours and and pursue those goals against those they're um\nThey're open questions I mean right now though\nIt doesn't feel like you know\nI ... I remember when the calculator you know how to calculators a kid and that was great now I have not a smart phone I don't it doesn't feel like that so long some progression of something that will eventually have a wheel or the tone and and I and I want to inflict harm on\nIt and I I honestly line rural and I thought I was something I\nWill but even that's the same thing is just that is just the machine and and we would have never said well what if your cyber all turns on you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "09"}
