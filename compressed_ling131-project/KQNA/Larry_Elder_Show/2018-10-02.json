the highest housing prices gasoline water electricity\nWe've got bored buyers threatening our homes we got a rising crime rate we've got the schools that are forty seven of the nation or the political

Nineteen seventies era helicopters\nA lot of them have bullet holes in 'em from Vietnam I mean this is really obnoxious and people are sick and tired of it\nNow John on Europe policy agenda your first item is or the repeal of the fifty two billion dollar gas tax increase their limited last year and I assume that the repeal of that gas tax increase will be popular the measure is called the proposition six\nIt's on the ballot to repeal this gas tax but it turns out according to a poll that just came out a couple of days ago the majority of likely voters oppose proposition sick they want to keep the the gas tax what's what's what's the deal with that\nOr is this the same polling firm that predicted that we'd have to Democrats and the race for governor I'm not sure about that uh now I think just repeal is wildly popular Larry it's because the\nPolitical class has mismanaged Caltrans Caltrans spends twice what taxes does to build a mile a road and\nYou know the the roads in Texas are far better they are that better than they are in California so\nYou know they are the politicians are drafted the pilots summer in a way that is going to make it a little bit tougher but I'm telling ya for anybody paying attention uh they're not happy about this about gas tax and that's going to be repealed up I promise you that\nMy guest is John Cox he's running for governor in California as a Republican his website is John Cox for governor dot com John ... for governor dot com John Cox a a superior court judge recently ruled that charter cities cannot be forced to abide by the century state law that was signed by Governor Brown explain that to people\n[laughter] well yeah and this was a monumental decision because the sanctuary state law for basically protects MS Thirteen I mean that's what I was there to do it\nAnd the avenues that it was all in favor of that but I got to tell you that the mothers and fathers of young or Hispanic kids as well as other kids in this they\nDon't want I must Thirteen and California recruiting their children and uh it's going to be repealed or when I'm the governor but right now and I met the young uh Huntington Beach a a city attorney who mounted this lawsuit\nAnd very gratified that the courts held that charter cities don't have to comply with the uh sex or a state law\nAnd let me tell you it's going to be a non issue after I'm the governor because we're going to going to get rid of it\nJohn Cox before this happened I didn't know the difference between a general city general lost city in a charter city he turns out that the largest cities in the in the state\nUh San Francisco or LA San Diego Fresno these are all so called charter cities which gives them a lot more control over things like I'm a police authority and therefore they can uh cooperate with a with the federal immigration authorities make him if they want to\nEr during routine traffic stops and Corey about the immigration status of people uh this is not what the governor wants to happen but apparently if you weren't charter city and there are about a hundred and twenty starter cities in the state coming about two thirds of the population you have all these rights but you don't have as a general law city\nAnd uh but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for San Francisco to do anything about this or I mean the you know there there are in the process of trying to get the state to approve a legal injection sites where addicts can shoot up in a nice the you know clean environment\nWhich I think it's it's certainly are ridiculous and it's\nNot going to solve the problem of the horrendous drug addiction that's afflicting California John Cox when are you going to debate your opponent next\nMonday at Pan Am on a public radio station

maybe that's why he's been able to get away with some of the stuff you've gotten away with this is the guy who had an affair with his best friend who was his campaign manager the wife of his best friend who is this campaign manager who does that it can still survive\nA I don't know that's the broke called people ballet or listen no Larry I've got so many issues or people in California don't

of astrological consultations\nAnd mark welcome back to the program\nI think George glad to be here\nLooking for is that your only website or do you have others\nDo we just started a great their enterprises\nThat that's what I refer to ah the heavens stars of the great parrot very exciting state of the art very beautiful which one do you prefer that we use a grape Eric prizes my daughter has just been on the Web\nMaster and Web designer with very very beautiful and all kinds of new things on their super what do you run up to lately well that that's what we've got a full time right\nWell pretty much um and getting into the world of pod cast beginning thing was with a book and other kinds of things that we've sort of been wanting to move into and suddenly now with the state of the art website we're really getting going with that\nYou were with me years ago when when you were first on with me ah our executive producer Lisa line who thinks the world of you says I'm going to give you a special guest teasing mundane astrologer right and I went like what what are you giving me somebody who's mundane for\nIt if it's actually uh I I guess\nIn the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much it's it's really earth astrology global astrology\nIf his relative nations and world leaders thing with like eclipse is new moon is full of major planetary alignment in other words that's kinda the opposite to doing personal horoscope readings although I've I've been doing that\nJust as long um for the word again now people think of mundane kind of just ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results that same mundane astrology impersonal horoscope type readings\nNo I mean well you're dealing with the same plan a\nFine line there there's a fine line isn't there\nWill again kind of it's the maker cause them rather than microcosm and so\nPeople who are in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things that they prefer to look at the big picture of national events current events the way the world is and when I was growing up it's just kind of where I was they read the the ... the world book\nUm you know the almanac the world ... book affects every year we'd come out back in the fifties and sixties still going after a hundred and fifty years actually\nMostly for sport like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports baseball football and so on\nSo I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course a President Kennedy came into office\nWith the with the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was I was a young teenager and then we know it happened you know in the sixties there [noise] and I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation and the world probably because of that particular event\nMarch tell us exactly what is ... is\nWell aware as before as above so below this goes back to ancient Egypt the idea of a of being called ... or the the thrice great ... which is the actual\nInjection Greek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly that was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and mathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know I'm a modern astrology [laughter] we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy\nWho is also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so much and I also studied all kinds of things we regarding it laughter or when I first got into the whole field I got into reincarnation\nMeditation metaphysics\nLived at the pinpoint community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about retrograde planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just if we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective he Leo nothing the pilots to keep going the ordinary cycles mercury has an eighty eight day forward moving\nMercury has an eighty eight day forward moving a orbit around the sun um we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away and the astrology we use is what we would call she centric\nEvery so often all the plot of snow this has not found our moon towards but all the planets\nWill tend to appear to go in reverse from our vantage point uh it's kinda like uh this is a perfect metaphor you're at a train station and you're in a train and your training is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours\nIs going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you end up kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're kind of moving your in your direction but there are like going the other way and it's like confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde motion\nSo what most people have tuned into all over the decades\nIs mercury going into reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth perspective for about three weeks at a time and what's amazing now into that I was at Eighteen if you if I went to Google or safari one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde year and then you click on images\nIt's filled George with all kinds of things like stop signs and road signs saying mercury recreate don't go here don't go there because people are actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going to reverse\nIf you have five different astrologers would you have five different kinds of readings at any given time\nUm well let me answer it one way if people who really studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades very intensively if you had say a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same chart of somebody or the same event\nAnd you ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and\nOther things over the years because I've been on during the election times and often you know people want to hear a prediction sure it's going to go however astrology really works best\nIn terms of ... as you said and he's study that I'm not just psychology and UFOs and ... dollars and everything else\nBut he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I use this call before whatever is born at a moment of time has the qualities of that moment of time it's because time should not be thought of is like I'll meet you at ten o'clock in the morning at such and such place\nSo that people think of time it's kind of a convenient system it's really a power and so when a person is born and they have a particular astrology charts at at their first moment that they take their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around and the great circle\nAnd they're in different signs of ... in the stroller ... puts it altogether and reads it as a kind of I'm almost like a spiritual genetic code\nTo interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but ... ... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of\nSolar energy lunar energy and climate or energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above and below so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most ... kinda who've been around the horn a long time will come up with a similar result\nAre use psychic too or just in Charlotte\nI'm Glad you asked that question I okay if I say out to the public my my son is in Pisces which tends to be at least as I understand that signed rather reticent to to be a for instance do well kind of planet earth for Twenty years I'm not\nSomebody who likes marketing and advertising and commercial stuff I'm much more focused that's why the mundane astrology on our church will things\nAnd so I'm fundamentally um I it is interesting you ask me that because I have been very psychic\nAnd the two of them but I don't broadcasted but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most\nScientists in sports Russia logically psychic like can you stay with us mark where the break we're going to come back and talk about world events probably affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with stroller your news Web site great beer enterprises dot com more and more\nTo watch a TV show young dealing with George or you\nJust log on to beyond belief dot com\nWhen the American revolution was one of the same year that Iran is was provided by William Herschel and ironically and bath England um but at any rate that planet has just gone into tore okay and tourists is the main line of money\nAnd the New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to may Seventeen\nThis used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two\nAnd so not yet but in all five years\nOr Iran spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional soda things coming out of left field shock some surprises your audience will cross over the sun\nThe solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back\nWhich takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six he get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three\nAnd that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers\nOf my field people look at these kind of thing with like a a nation's chart nations are born like people if you can locate the birth time of country cities have\nCharts states of the union have charts but Americans definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in the number of years including I'll probably market changes but I don't see it right now\nWhat about criminals\nNow crypto does this this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology\nIt's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay that's actually seven hundred and Ninety four years\nThe ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which of the largest planets even actually looked at by people going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were charging believe it or not because they didn't have\nA all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrologers they were astronomers they just didn't have the scientific kind of things that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ...\nBut basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water to make a what's happening is in Eighteen forty one every Twenty years\nJupiter and Saturn and have been an earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know it\nBut what is going to happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now\nThose two planets Jupiter and Saturn merged together at the beginning of Aquarius and then for the next like a hundred and eighty years all the Jupiter Saturn so going to be an air sides and the point here is that crypto currency is are more connected to the air element of things that are more\nA theory that are more on the line that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties of the banking world the corporate world and all that so that we're we're ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes\nYeah I guess you could say that's\nA very stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new and my daughter was created it really beautifully it's called astro flash and it allows me to do some shorter things so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit so I've got a couple of things on great parent prizes in our or a earth Aquarius news zone so now earth of course news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius new segment and grape or enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening\nWith Brett Kavanaugh and and Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this will send you can you predict if he I mean today one of his college you know Lincoln says I Can't call um a friend who said that he was drunk\nI Will you know it's interesting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother dying from alcoholism\nYou know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum\nOr the president have certainly speaks his mind sometimes some people too much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not um he could withdraw I mean you know it it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday\nI don't think it's I think it's going to be hard to prove anything\nThrough um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big and when I did is I looked at the charge for the moment of Thursday when the session began and you see that's part of mundane astrology always look at the heart of a person although you can do that\nAnd I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an international thing with the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a charge just like a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart\nIs very descriptive of that whole tunnel last Thursday\nDidn't put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed asking logically speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus in the science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexuality Venus is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it\nI don't think it'll happen but well\nYeah well the thing is is that there's too much unknown but if I open hazard a guess you know I Would just say there are certainly pushing forward it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal is if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative with somebody else who's going to be nominated\nIn in his ... and there's probably so it's not as if something like that would be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there that is squeaky clean well\nI think that would be because they've been saying that uh\nA lot by you my question was do alert you think you'll get confirmed it on um\nLogically speaking well astrological\nYou we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control\nThem use hazard a guess on that side of the equation\nYou still didn't answer me though I think it will get confirmed that you do okay All right that that that I that might be one I I I'll be wrong on but uh well it'll say now are you at least you took the stand\nRight because when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um were so many of the predictors and you know these forecasters were were all looking at everything\nUm I was on I mean I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably win and she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan Wisconsin\nA Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million and that turned the election to the electoral college in Trump won\nSo amazing work now next stop let's talk about Kim Jong un on and his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think what do you think is happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this all this will be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other or people who come on often about Iran and the world situation\nI think it's a done deal that they are going to have nuclear weapons and when and they're never going to get rid of them but what's gonna happen is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing um in other words it'll be like\nTrump is doing this thing um in other words it'll be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false whether or not a kind of you do these kind of things that no other president would have ever done and you try and just sort of like make things nights\nAnd then eventually you know right now they just said the other day uh the secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize by the end of of the president's administration I don't know if you've caught that did you see that\nNew Hampshire did it was like we're wait we want them to do it tomorrow last week why they're dragging their feet and then during so I don't know if it was a late friday or something oh you know as long as they do it within the next two years were fine what you know and so I just I've seen this all the way through the danger I think I'm In all of this\nThis personal diplomacy we don't know of Kim Jong un is going to be the leader tomorrow the next day in this country at least we have a succession of ...\nAnd you also don't know what are you doing this a trek\nExactly so you got the tricky thing we did the other thing is uh in astrology and this is very important Donald Trump's char President Trump's choice is known we've known as exact birth time for decades it's not a mystery\nHillary Clinton's birth time could have been twelve hours off nobody has figured it out it's not talked about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it\nSo she was kind of an unknown quality in terms of her chart okay we didn't know whether she was morning or evening we don't know the year of Kim Jong un on\nTheir reports he was born in Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five he's definitely a Capricorn son we know that we just don't know the year and I think that the north Koreans\nAnd people in that part of the world they're really into astrology and things and they want to keep it a mystery\nMarketing tell me something with regards to astrology are we going to have a good year for the rest of this year but I mean people are uptight or unhappy I'm Talking about general not everybody\nI'm so glad you asked me that because right after the election of maternal on November six which is doing what we called the dark in the middle and an ... interesting days those who the heck knows what's gonna happen on that day with the votes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "02"}
