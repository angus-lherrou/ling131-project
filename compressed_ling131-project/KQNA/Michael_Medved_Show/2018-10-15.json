interview which was big news last night\nHere was a when I think was a fairly interesting inappropriate question from Lesley Stahl with the president's answer right at the beginning\nYou are the first president in the United states who never had a political post or for worse never served in the military you come up here and you've been here for almost two years what's the biggest surprise and what

defending freedom\nOf talks about the origins of this organization\nOr it was started by people like James Dobson and Marlin medics and it was really just a response as these gentlemen and others like them looked out and saw there were a lot of challenges to religious freedom and they didn't see anyone out there to defend it so they said we're going to address this problem by putting together this new organization\nUntil the last twenty five years we've been defending religious freedom and defending freedom of speech around the country\nOkay and that is an ongoing challenge and an ongoing

they're operator standing by nice folks that ... our phone number is eight six six nine five four three three eight eight\nA President Trump\nI and I I'm sure he came out of this I'm annoyed and probably annoyed agreed to do it\nBecause what so peculiar about this and and honestly you can go back and you can look at every single interview that bronco bomb and did very much including the interviews with bronco bomb and did to his credit with Bill O'Reilly and he did and Bill O'Reilly was not a fan of President Obama he ripped him up and down and sideways\nBut when he spoke to Obama he was eager to be in the president's good graces and I think they have them that have a relationship that wasn't so much true with Lesley Stahl of sixty minutes who who clearly made it very clear while she was speaking to him she didn't respect President Trump\nAnd uh I look I I\n... is this the end of the world the fact that President Trump has a bad relationship with CBS\nI think it's it's it's not necessarily the end of the world but uh they got into discussing the future of Jeff Sessions would suddenly as a matter of grave concern to establish a media all over the country what about\nThe attorney general Jeff Sessions well we'll see what happens you come to terms but [noise]\nBut everybody thinks he was appointed senator reaches some self and many people like I was right on that I was very disappointed [noise] why should have recused themselves very disappointing to me what happened and I assume he's gone you know because of that well you [noise] um [noise]\nWell you slash\nYou will not shut down the Mueller investigation I don't pledge anything but I Will tell I have no intention of doing that I think it's a very unfair\n... because there was no collusion of any kind of ... [noise] I don't want to pledge why should I pledge to you if I pledge all pledge not to play she was like wow I have no intention of carrots\nOkay look at it it's a reasonable sanction and and by the way of course it would be a tremendous disaster iffy shut down the cellar investigation\nBut he's right to say I'm not going to pledge not to shut it down is it possible that the more vegetation would step over the line at some point so clearly or that would be exposed at some point so clearly\nThat he would have a a justification to stop the investigation it's very unlikely because Bob Mueller is their own professional and I think patriotic\nBut ah is is there something wrong with President Trump's answer one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six chat and Chester, Pennsylvania you're on that show\nUh yeah I just think it's a little hypocritical of the media it's a really kind of go after ... after Trump and accused them\nAre accused at least the Russians of meddling in the election I mean it's naive to think that the United states has not had an added toppling of any government and the patch or even had any kind of influence through the intelligence agencies just to try to sway elections or to influence our one way or another\nYou know so I mean in other words the United states is a a world power that has wide ranging global interests and we certainly have played a role in toppling of some very evil foreign governments including a foreign government\nUh in in Chile or under a Salvador Allende which actually I think we were justified in and taking some role and I know that very controversial\nBut what does that has to do this in other words if the United states is looking after our own interests uh we we oppose Russia's\nMeddling in our election not because it is profoundly wrong and some kind of cosmic sense but because it hurts the United states it's a hostile act and we want to stop\nIt [noise] so what's what's wrong with that\nI don't think there's I don't think there's anything really entirely wrong with us trying to watch our own morality in ah in our current role in the world today but just ... just a thing or not governments that are trying to influence our our because we are one of the most powerful countries\nNow of course there are governments that are trying to do it but uh and we are we are right to call them out on it and to try to oppose it and then again I think people are right when when a country acts abroad as apparently Saudi Arabia did\nWhich is why I Do think that what people are talking about about this being some got a rogue operation that went wrong that they were actually they're not to kill his show gay and chop them up into little pieces in Istanbul which they did\nA but to actually just apprehend them and take him back to Saudi I\nI think as relevant as well and yes there's a difference appreciate\nYour call I'm President Trump inevitably was asked about the border by Leslie stall there was this interchange\nWhat about the for separation of children from their migrant children from the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same thing it was on the books but he didn't have ... percent you and for us to launch that pop the zero tolerance policy\nTo deter families with children and everybody decided and courts don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate when you\nAllow for parents to stay together okay when you allow that\nThen what happens is people are going to pour into our country are you gonna go back to that well we'll look at that a lot of things really what we want to do is changing immigration laws because they were there were a laughing stock all over the world are you willing though I think you're saying you're it's under consideration I Want all the laws change\nBecause I was just Leslie for coming into our country illegally\nOkay ah I think that President Trump has very strong agreement on that from a a majority of Americans your responses to President Trump's\nBut said thirty four year old woman that has been in a car accident I suffered from severe neck pain shooting paying down my arms and legs that would often cause me to

Washington Post because both in New York City and then the next night in Portland, Oregon over the weekend\nThere were brawls and people injured and fighting one another with the um the so called Proud Boys\nAnd on she saw what they call anti fascist a fighting each other now\nThis is so horrible and and again it what would it puts you in mind of\nIs the days of Weimar, Germany that is Germany before Hitler took over a when you would have broiled on the street between communists because there was an active Communist Party is Spartacus and others a Communist Party in Germany\nAnd uh and Nazis and this is not to say the Proud Boys are Nazis they're not but really what are you trying to accomplish but says here let me read you one of the descriptions\nI'm\nIn Portland which has long seeing clashes between the far left in the far right for two weeks they've been consumed with Brett black lives matter protests over a fatal police shooting in September\nThose protests in turn provoked right wing groups when video emerged last weekend of demonstrators blocking traffic and beating on a passing drivers car\nAnd those videos were horrible and\nIt it's completely what was so amazing as a police didn't break it up these people were attacking motorists and ... and by the way most of them were white most of the demonstrators are white and they were as a tank and motorists were being white people\nOkay uh\nPortland police apparently had been expecting trouble and managed to prevent it for half an hour or so by lining up and tactical gear along the street I'm sure they love this\nBut after sundown things kicked off the anti fascist may provoke violence according to a freelance reporter who documented and swimming Malay on Twitter\nOne of them burn an American flag as the Proud Boys and company we're leaving causing the Proud Boys to return another quote anti fascist and out the entire group with pepper spray\nOkay and then it went down from there\nI might might question to folks is what you accomplished with us on either side and do you really want to make the American people hate you is there somebody out there who sees the Proud Boys broiling with the unsafe up people and you think wow\nThose on the five people are really braver go let's hear it for the Proud Boys they've done such a great job I honestly\nThis this is\nThis is the worst of what's

two hundred and ten different rivers are represented\nSo just like Arizona it's a very small portion of the total rivers that we've got within the country and what\nWhat differentiates them what what makes them protected the rivers protected water bodies\nWell I think states have come together state representatives have come together in each of those designations I listed off wild scenic and ah there's a recreational category as well a wild rivers are those I tend to think of them they're they're sort of like wilderness they're very inaccessible they're very untouched by humans over time\nI'm In in ... a lot of ways I think that wild designation is kind of you know it's it's the penultimate designation that you could get\nA scenic rivers are also rivers that are written really good shape or don't have impound ... uh the shorelines and their watersheds are still\nLargely primitive uh but they may be accessible by roads where the wild ones you can't get to buy our roads explain impound and for me uh employment would would be a dam or or ... or things like that where water is held back those can be big ... big game changers when it comes to how river functions\nIn so with this wild and senior designation it's really looking for those rivers that don't have those kinds of impediments on them\nI'm In the recreational would be that last category um they can be accessible by road railroad they may have some development along the shorelines of but they're still worthy of recognition and and uh you know good good rivers to to get people have to and\nWhat what kinds of recreation you consider healthy for the river and the watershed\n[noise] ah I tend to go more toward passive recreation of things that really aren't taking away the rivers resources or leaving things behind a I tend to to walk and hike and do a lot of photographing\nUm so that's kind of a one of those things where we don't have a big impact on the river ah but you know voting kayaking\nCanoeing those sorts of activities I I think that as well I'm In that I think as you get more into motorized those those types of things start to have a wider impact and\nAnd I'm not here to say that those are good good recreational activities but I think in the context of wild and scenic a it starts to become less less uh compatible\nI can still recall I think for the early nineties of some of the a pickup truck manufacturers were showing commercials showing people tearing up riverbeds going through them you know spewing mud and water everywhere that's not the kind of recreation indoors for this particular region\nThat has a big impact on the river and it's not great for fish and in those sorts of things probably not\nThem tell us how are you in Michael gotten involved in producing these movies\nUm why don't you carry that one sure uh I I think there's three organizations Prescott creeks friends of the river and see where all kind of came together to celebrate this fiftieth anniversary of this act um in you and I think each of our organization\nThis act um in you and I think each of our organizations have a mission that's focused on rivers and water resources and specifically on the Verde River system that is right here in our own watershed\nUm so the Verde River begins at holding its headwaters if you will are in a call them and then it flows downstream through the ... valley before it joins the salt river in the north the north east Phoenix area\nSo I think with with each of our organizations we've been looking for ways to\nUm you know kind of work together um to take act actions to help protect the river and highlight what's happening with with our river and so this is a great opportunity to to celebrate something that has been going on for fifty years some a very impressive things have happened\nIn addition to our to our bodies that are designated here in Arizona\nThere's actually a proposal for a third designation to add about fifty miles of wild and seen it to the Verde River\nWhere would that be a it would be a centrally from the headwaters at Paul ... only downstream to clerk Dale that would be the the biggest stretch and then there's a smaller section on granted creek were joins the Verde units and waters\nAnd then ah another portion within a sick more Kenyan on sycamore creek and for anybody who's been out there are those are just really beautiful areas of the river\nFairly inaccessible um but there's just\nBiologically there's a lot going on there are a lot of different um a endangered and and threatened species that are worthy of protection and you know so you know we would love to see that move forward\nA it was originally drafted in two thousand nine but hasn't been fully moved forward quite yet a dead water some of the films you're excited about\nWell there while they're scenic the F ... so they collect many award winning gorgeously shot well narrative sounds that focus on water beverage in my life and we at church and\nFrom down that relate to water supplies in Arizona such as mining damn removal grass restoration on ranch Lance bird migration and light pollution\nAnd one of the shows that are kind of explains why between designate Timothy called better connections and that's up to three thirty screening they get back down to a screening\nUm mythic connection it's ... designated partnership while the scene of critters connect communities by fostering collaboration among local river management partners and it's dumped on his record stewardess on three letters and highlights inspiration complexities in July behind communities coming together to protect the hours and then I'm like what we're all doing I stick partners\nAnother one in the first screening is called Salem\nAnd it's about data than better from churches chicken and he devoted his life to restrain neglected in over grace ranch in Texas our country and he started the natural ecological function is filled he'll find out the first brought springs back to life created by carrion habitat and inspired landscape movement mhm\nFrom that six thirty screening a couple\nThat we like our one is called the while president and it's about chimney Carter's first paddling chat down a very powerful law better another one called last and light\nAnd um [noise]\nThree ... minutes at night skies from different cities with varying levels of light pollution labels the numbers and you can get to a good idea um\nThere's one called a letter to Congress which is ... sixty letter to Congress about the importance of wilderness and it's a beautiful town palm ... and ... both the programs that closes out both of the program ...\nWhat do you hope viewers will take away after seeing these films\nPeople might get a little motivated to protect these pristine places and protect our water supplies and a lot of quality for generations to come and other people to enjoy it because it's a good place to clean your mind and relax and we can all go on about how many reasons are to the ... to ...\nYou mentioned water supplies do any of these provide drinking water any black or these protected rivers yeah the ferry the ... not ...\nYet diversity provides I Can't remember the exact number I Want to say it's it's it's a significant percentage I must say I am forty percent of the drinking water for the Phoenix much while I'm In you know that's our population center in the ... so well places like Prescott\nOur polling water out of the ground not directly out of surface water\nUm it's you know legally those the surface water and in groundwater not connected but\nPhysically out in the field of you know that ground water recharge recharge is the river and the river contributes to the groundwater and so everybody's chocolate and peanut butter all mixed up when I chose to come to that water and I think in response to your question about what my hope is that people will go away with\nIs um [noise] you know a lot of these films are they're small films that are independently produced um they really bring a tremendous amount of heart and soul to telling the stories um and I think that folks are going to walk away feeling inspired or I Hope they do\nA ... ... ... wherever you stand on the land you stand within watershed yeah here in Prescott in the quad city areas and then over in Verde Valley\nWe're all in the same watershed that's the ... river when\nYou have so you know whatever you do in the landscape wherever your job is wherever you're driving around we're all contributing to the issues both positive and negative that that watershed hole and so our hope is is that folks will start thinking about um\nHow they're living their daily lives and and how that connects to the river\nExpecting overnight loaf

ranch animal rescue in sanctuary Stacy are circles been around for how long do we are in our eleven year right now take me back to what got the whole thing started now now you've been there how long yourself\nUm I started as a volunteer I've been there a total of about two and a half years and just a little over a year as an employee now\nAnd you've had some changes in the last year or most of them very beneficial I understand\nYes um we moved just about a year ago to the property that we are currently on\nI'm located on coyotes things are dogs are still located at our property on ... road and no it's going great we had a wonderful set up things are very streamlined\nIt's wonderful for tar as um a lot more wheelchair accessible so we can bring groups like helping hands and and I'm excited to have them back this Wednesday into a toilet em so a lot of things that\nFor those who've never been there ... the different variety of animals you have\nHow we've got dogs horses goats sheep donkeys pigs keys rabbits duck a name something why yeah\nPretty much out of every now I'm I'm just amazed at how many different kinds of skills you have to have to be able to take care of this variety of animals for one thing where does all the food come from\nWell we're mainly supported by the owner and Dr Deborah Wilson and er\nYou know very grateful and whatever we do get donations or feed will actually be going up a little bit in the winter we've got to feed a bit heavier it takes a bit more hey mhm so uh we're always\nLooking for and grateful for any donations that we can get their out all the animals end up at the ranch\nI'm In a variety of ways sometimes we do get calls from animal control and those are usually cases of neglect abuse of band and men are hoarding um thankfully that's not very often a last week I actually got a call from heritage Park Zoo in Prescott and somebody left to ducks in a box and their parking lot [noise]\nSo pretty heartbreaking and they're wonderful ducks and very adoptable so anyone looking for a sweet pair of dust by and then quite often we get calls from owners of animals that\nFor a variety of reasons can no longer care for them whether they physically can financially can't or they may be moving and they're not able to take their animals with them and unfortunately sometimes people just don't want the animals anymore\nDo you think sometimes people think it it sounded like a good idea to get those kind of animal let me find out the roof over their heads\nAbsolutely you know I mean a lot of people do buy a pat on impulse especially something small like a rabbit or you know you've got a tractor supply and you see the cute little chicks and it's very easy to spend three bucks and take one home and then it turns out to be a rooster and your woken up at five o'clock every morning and\nI'm you know you need to give it some thought\nI Would imagine to when they move a big movie comes out featuring a certain kind of cuddly animal the demand for the animal goes up and not everyone should be getting that animal correct very\nTrue and it's actually even holidays like Easter all checked ducks bunnies\nMhm and yeah really show or all of your animals available for adoption\nAnd many of them are um several of them are sanctuary animals that live out their lives with us at the ranch and those would be for either health reasons or sometimes behavioral reasons but we've got\nA whole variety of animals that are adoptable\nShow when it comes to behavioral reasons what kinds of things can you do with those animals\nUm sometimes there are those few out there that you really can't do much with and then kind of need to just be alone can't be with other dogs or are people aggressive and we just try to give them space in love in a safe\nComfortable place no and then there are some animals you know we've got a couple of horses that just have a little bit of an attitude and need consistent training and work and need to learn some manners\nAnd you know there'll be adoptable but we want to make sure that we put in the time so when they do that to a home and they've got that chance of being there for good\nShowing someone comes to your your said where he wants to adopt an animal\nSo when someone comes to your your ... where he wants to adopt an animal what kinds of questions are going to ask them\nI'm for farm animals\nAre really we focus on are you looking for a pet we do not promote you know adopting animals for months for breathing for dairy for meat um they're just meant to be loved and spoiled and pampered\nAnd you can often tell just by a person's demeanor when they come in and what they ask and ah\nSo we often will do home tax they want to make sure that there is adequate fencing shelters um make sure that they know really what they're getting into ... um and just do the best that we can to make sure that it's going to be a permanent home for the animal and they don't have to come\nBack of all the different animals that you've been involved with a circle el who's any one particular stand out as a surprise you knew what a good pet it became\nA turkey turkey for male turkey honey I'm and she we actually had a story in Prescott dog magazine and a little title of her article was too sweet to eat [laughter] and she is melting right now so she's not super friendly right now\nBut they're leaving for others over the place ... yes yes um fourteen cockatoos hills farmer I understand birds and Milton so\nYes and they can get very moody during that time they give them their space and you know in all be okay to target for except we've got a really sweet goose I mean really the poultry is is kind of blowing my mind we've got three hands that love to be pat and held\nAnd they just started laying eggs in July [noise] um they're all up for adoption but they would have to go together sure so yeah it's all of them actually it's quite surprising just how loving the goats the pigs a chicken any of them can be\nWhat kinds of reactions do you get because we get a lot of people moving here from from big cities and I assume when they walk on the property you can tell over city people or what kinds of what kind of surprises do you see when say their kids are mixing with a lot of animals for the first time\nIt's a beautiful thing to see um I myself I'm from Los Angeles and was a city girl until I started volunteering at sort of Iran's do and a half years ago um so it's amazing really how naturally it comes for a lot of people that when you as soon as you walk on to the ranch\nI Belong here ... and to just be able to give that love and receive that love for from an animal\nJust because they want it you know I'm you know they're not well they may be expecting some treats or something but her guide from that\nUm it's just it's a very pure thing and to watch the child be able to interact with the animals like that and learn compassion and patience and respect and um it's really quite a guess what kinds of animals that you have is a little girl had bunny always had dogs um\nSome tortoises parakeet and then my aunt had horses so once in a while I
