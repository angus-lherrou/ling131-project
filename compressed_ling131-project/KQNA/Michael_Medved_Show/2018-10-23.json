the President Trump and I think that Trump's antics as a personality that depressed part of the Republican base\nBut the Kavanaugh hearings brought out the ugly Minnesota left\nTheir complete

the national affairs columnist for National Review he worked for more than Twenty years for Wall Street journal and a is also a contributor at Fox News we're talking\nAbout the the upcoming elections ... one of those things and and again you made this observation before John we're both admitted political junkies follow this stuff a lot uh but the house races with four hundred and thirty five of them\nAre so confusing to most people mind strong gas is that most Americans most Americans and I think probably an overwhelming majority could not identify who their representative in the house of representatives actually is couldn't even name\nSo ... what do we do about that or just basically live with that and try to break through somehow into people's consciousness on these house races\nWell incumbents have an advantage in when Ninety percent of the time because they do a lot of constituent work\nFor their people and they also get around the community shake hands and become well known so while not everyone knows who their congressmen is a lot of people in the middle of the independent voters or if they've met their congressmen or there's gotten their mothers Social Security check taking care of who the congressman's office\nThey liked the congressman and the the the job of a congressman is two fold if to represent the people and also of course vote their conscience that it's a balancing act\nAnd ultimately voters have to decide what's important to them\nSadly the vast majority of people don't vote well about half the people will not vote in this election of those who do vote a lot of people will vote by party down the line but you will have some people will say well even though I disagree with my Congress man or woman I like what they're doing and they have integrity and they're honest person\nI yeah and uh whether it's it's the same kind of thing if you ask people in general do things that Congress is honest and legit it's usually very very low approval rating people don't trust Congress an institution\nThat then you ask people what about your own congressman congressman Smith I I happen to have a congressman Smith whose\n... are representing my district as as it happens so what about ... and they say oh my congressman he's the exception he's really a good guy it says the normal way people feel and they talk about public schools their medical care anything else is that I'm the only one who's fortunate [laughter]\nIn an island of dysfunction and the wealthy and there were some Republicans\nKeep the house it may be in part because at the last minute people who are really mad at Donald Trump will say yeah but I Am really so mad at him that I Want to get rid of the guy that I've liked her met and shit or shaking his hand or help me out\nAnd that's why in general you never bet against incumbents so some of these Republican incumbents me in the end when because they've built up goodwill over the years\nSince the real problem is the forty empty seats right there were forty Republicans ... or more\nEmpty seats than in decades and that's why I think the Democrats do have to be favored to take back the house because at an open seat a basically you're much more able to vote party strict party line\nSo I'm In in terms of I Know that the Republicans\nHave a good chance of knocking off some democratic seats I Know there's a district in Minnesota where the Republicans actually now favored by the cook Political Report\nTo win a democratic seat um ... where do you think Republicans in place the emphasis in these last two weeks in a campaign in order to try to hold on to the house\nWhile I think that they have to emphasize three things one is you know even though there are problems in the world were peace\nAnd frankly we are more respected now than we were two years ago that the number one to the economy is really good and that's not an accident or bronco Palmer back Obama's policies having a delayed reaction if you want higher taxes and want to pick a risk with picking the economy backwards vote for the Democrats the takeover Congress\nAnd the third is you know uh there's some basic things that Democrats don't seem to care about one of the rule of law as proven by Kavanaugh\nAnd to why are they saying nothing about this caravan this mob whatever you want to call it that moving up from Mexico as the wall Street Journal reported today which is very pro immigration\nThis is outrageous that we have these people encouraged to move to the United states that influence our election and at the same time the Democrats are completely silent but a fundamental issue of national sovereignty\nAnd apparently this is the work of a former president of Honduras and his henchmen or what's the wall Street Journal is written about and the Daily Beast has written about that this really started or as as basically a means of undermining the currents center right president of Honduras\nAnd to hold the American people hostage to the vagaries of Honduran dirty tricks campaigning\nDoesn't seem a good idea\nJon or of the Democrats need to step forward and say this is wrong and I hear crickets cricket\nWell exactly what they have nothing to say because again they would much prefer to a run on the the and the ... the family separation issue which they tried to make a great deal of apparently sixty two percent of all democratic adds a feature health care isn't that a mistake don't you think\nWell let's put it in lots of eggs in one basket and you know I think pre existing conditions are important I don't think they're that important to that many Americans\nOkay and Republicans have been very emphatic that we are not going to endanger people with preexisting conditions that those guarantees will remain a we are speaking with John John John appreciate your insight and I hope that maybe you can come back again\nBefore we have the occasion for a a post election let's hope celebration on John funds new

rate how do they hit you guys\n[noise] well um there's no direct connection between what the fed does and mortgage rates which is a huge misperception but generally speaking they're raising rates because there are concerns about inflation and anytime we have a inflation they're trying to rein in the economy from getting from overheating [noise]\nUm and anytime that is something that's going on where our rates are tied which is bond bond market is also seems to go on so but actually short term that day or raped got better that happens a lot when they raise the short term rate the feds\nAre bonds or mortgage rates get a little better\nBut in the bigger picture the the thing that's driven rate up the trend for a couple of years now it's been up in ... and we're at the highest rate do that in over seven years they're still historically good they are you going to be talking generally about rape in the fives for most people right now\nI'm which anything under seven historically as good but um when you look at the last year that's over ... percent higher than where where it was a year ago\nAnd um and that's a fairly rapid rise in a short period of time the main reason the fed for many years coming out of the recession was buying our bond and treasuries to artificially keep rates low so the separate program from their normal interest rates [noise]\nUm and they've been for the last a year and a half weaning off that\nAnd beginning of October was the last uh wean so to speak\nBeginning of October was the last uh wean so to speak and so that's really it's still stuff the feds doing but they were artificially low to begin with\n'em so now we're off of that stimulus\nUm the markets trying to find some stability here but quite frankly for homeowners you look at\nThe appreciation that's gone on a yeah by county for the last five years the average appreciation rate has been just under eight percent per year she's pretty aggressive wonderful feeling home um but you combine that with um with the rise of a little over a ... percent and the last year\nAnd it's significant so I'm the affordability factor is is is definitely kicked in there's still plenty of demand for people that want to buy homes um but they can only afford what they can afford you take those two things I happened to run a payment um before I came in wanting to do a comparison\n'em and taking so let's say a home was worth a ... you could about a year ago for two hundred and fifty thousand which is a little below the median income a sort of a first time homebuyer price range right now\nSo if you could if you bought it for two fifty a year ago compared to now you get that almost eight percent appreciation it'd be two Seventy now and plus the rise and rates year over year that a hundred

you information on our new classes and where we're going in the program we'll have contractors there who can talk to you about how they got into the industry what it's done for them\nUh that Korea that they've built and then get all their questions answered all even do a little short I'm interested assessment to see if it's the right field for them\nTo be interviewed so many local employers\nAre in the skilled trade to say they're dying to higher qualified help they can put you to work right away within a year you'll be making near the top of the field and these are stable jobs they're not going to go overseas or you're not going to have a whole bunch of student debt why aren't more people taking advantage of it do you think\nI think a lot of is it they just don't really understand the industry and like the opportunities are I think we lost an entire generation of skilled trades people as the people who are running a skilled trades and subcontractors and the contractors told their children to go get to go to college and get a degree and now they're gone darn\nKnow I'm Glad you mentioned that because I can recall an awful lot of advertising campaigns from years past that almost put the stigma on blue collar careers when in fact a those are doggone\nBlue collar careers when in fact a those are doggone good careers if that's what you're suited for correct\nOh absolutely I mean I'm I'm a very hands on person and I love working in Korea and technical lead because you see the results of what you do you do you create you knew you build things you grow food you just the you know it's something that teaches you to skills\nThat gives you a trade that's going to give you a career for a lifetime that you can have a lot of satisfaction over or didn't previously have a construction program when it happened without well during the housing boom or bubble or whatever you want to call it that you talked about previously\nA houses are going up like crazy around here and\nWe had a very um robust program we probably had over two hundred students and that program and that was a construction management because there was so much going on in that boom that we needed people\nTo be at the top level and to be managing the huge workforce that with here and the demand that was going on and when that industry crashed\nThat all went away now the economy's coming back the housing market is coming back and a lot of that I think is because we have a lot of more people moving into this area now their retirees they need homes it's not like the bubble where people were just throwing homes up everywhere\nUh people need homes and they're coming here and they're asking homes and ... asking from having them build\nAnd now the contractors this thing we don't have a workforce\nAnd you know the nation needs skilled trades people this state needs and desperately the county needs them we have this huge skills gap and we're saying hey come on folks let's come back to this let's come back and support this country in a way that you know make something happen\nYou know I've spoken to educators to in the show who say they worry about what they call a brain drain of very talented skilled young people in all fields Vicki may have to go to Phoenix or Denver\nFlags you have to find a good job when in fact if you have those trades that Kim or you have those skills in the ... that can be developed boy you couldn't laying them right now cancer in this area and keep the young traveled here\nYes we have employers coming to us on a regular basis now saying please give us a skilled workforce develop this program start up a class that's how this got started on the contractors came to us and said\nPlease help us develop these skills were hiring people they can't read a tape measure\nIf they don't know how to do the basics and that's where we started with this that's why we're starting with basic carpentry 'cause right now we need to get the basics get those basic skills then and then we'll just keep developing in adding courses to it as the skill need comes up\nI think it's great to factory work so closely with the employers because that means you're figuring a student's not for books march but for what the industry here needs no right\nThat's exactly it and that the courses that courses that we developed where exactly what the contractors asked for\nAnd they looked at over they approved it they had some modifications put in and then we put it out there the employers are working very closely with us and they're hiring the students with paid internships while they're getting the training\nAnd in some cases employers are hiring the students ahead of time hiring them as a full time employee and sending them to this training for their two days a week and then the three days of paid internship\nIs there any financial assistance available for students to take the course was\nWell our workforce investment board which is ... here in Prescott is has this as a certified course so the students can go to Nick hog fill out the paperwork go through their process and get their tuition fully paid and their books\nUh we've also had some scholarships that have come both from the contractors and from the college foundation and by next fall this should be an established program that will be available of are eligible for federal financial aid as well\nI was out at the sea took campus a few weeks ago for a weekend remote broadcasts we did\nAnd I was looking for somebody who had gone the white collar business route waited in line for jobs faced huge student debt and I have to look no further than Rodney drink and he is exhibit a that's exactly what he went through so he is one of your best spokesman fours\nYeah he's one of our new or vice presidents and he's been out in the community and he definitely support SARS Korean technical programs he he sees where it's at he stands what the needs are the community and um it is definitely given us support that we\nNeed if we have a high school students um who are interested in a career like that what kinds of courses should they be taking your high school before embarking on most at she took\nWell a a technical math course is a good one because they're measuring and things that are going to require them to be able to do basic things um\nBecause it's still measure choice cook once wrote that's\nCorrect her a they also need to make sure that they can communicate well so you know speaking and writing or are important um and anything in the science fields and help get them that mindset because there's a whole lot of critical thinking and problem solving and the trade industry\nAnd I would imagine because of a labor shortage if you are exceptional raptors you can move up the ladder pretty quick capture\nMhm you can um most of the contractors are telling us that they got their start just working on a cruise ship coming in at the basic labor level they start working on a crew they start moving up you know supervisor foreman and pretty soon they're running their own business\nAnd where do you see this program going in the future\n[noise] well I think ultimately um we can end up with construction management again but right now we really need the workforce so we're starting with the basic carpentry skills\nAnd then we'll probably look at electrical and then plumbing\nMaybe age back some masonry will just keep at it you know right now desperate need for famers we'd get those houses up then there's going to be a lot of their needs and even today I um had a meeting with 'em so no one's a landscaping business and of course they're working hand in hand and their businesses coming up along with the homes being built\nBut it's a state representative David Stringer maybe getting tired of the election ads on radio and TV with this was an important time for our state in our country every two or four years of people you need to come back and reporting to you on the job they've done\nThat's the beauty of our system of government and I'm happy to report that in my first term and the state legislature I've been keeping my promises I promise to foster economic growth ... new jobs and Arizona is now a national leader I promise to support more funding for schools particularly\nFor teachers in classroom I kept that promise helping to pass the biggest increase in school funding in Arizona history without raising taxes I promise to work on a fixed price Seventeen and just this spring the department of transportation announced a plan to build new lanes on ice Seventeen without\nAttacks type or toll I kept my promise is because that's the kind of representative you deserve it votes during the dot com to learn more get involved paid for by conservatives for stringer\nYou're listening to you and I on the talk of the quad cities cake you once again here's your host DJ phone or do their real names are no\nOther show well when you have a stage play right in with us today a Mickey Sheldon or you've been rather prolific uh at the art and you've got a wonderful group of actors who will gather next Monday at seven o'clock\nAt first congregation or church or in Prescott elope Esther J uh for reading of your very new one act play tell us about seeing Agnes in agony\nWell saying accidents has been a she's now a saint um she was a little girl\nWho believed it that she was married to God and I don't want to give too much about the play away but um because it was during a time that Christian persecution um her father felt that she should marry someone in order to be safe\nAnd there's a lot of other things that went on but\nUm I learned to well I was drawn to her anyway uh even though I don't have a Catholic background but when I was in Rome I went and sat at her tune and read a little bit about her life and um that was back in two thousand Thirteen but\nThat story has stayed with me and eventually\nMonth ago [laughter] I decided to write a play about her\nNow I understand that this was going back to the third century the Roman empire almost collapsed due to near anarchy caught correct\nThat's correct that's what I read I'm not a a history major but yes yes it did\nSo tell me about the details of St ... that really stuck out with you and prompted you to write a play\nWell I started writing this play in mid September and just a\nHer commitment to God for one thing I'm her unwillingness to compromise her values\nAnd her a willingness to uh to take whatever that punishment was for not following what Ron wanted her to do and she was only a little girl and she did so much\nFor someone that young to be that accountable rather strange isn't it\n[noise] it is and yet sometimes I Do think I Will admit this says sometimes young girls and young boys are more committed to their ideals than when they get older and the world sort of imposes on them and they need to make compromises\nAnd when they become adults they learn to be learned guile don't they\nThey unfortunately too many of them do they don't all\nYou know I'm reminded of a quote I Want to see it's by Mark Twain and he said uh a man is the only animal that can blush or needs to\nKnow how after so why is this how many great things\nSo far ahead of his time to you got some very familiar names who're appearing in a uh now this is part of a night of fewer each correct\nYes it is it something started by Tiffany and toning and people have followed the arts here in Prescott for a long time especially theater they will know Tiffany ... name\nUm she did a lot of work at Prescott Center for the arts and uh during the Kavanaugh hearings um she felt that uh\nWomen were not being represented the way that they ought to be and it made it very angry and she decided that she would put out a call for people to um do something whatever artistically in response to how they were feeling\nUm so I since I was in the middle of writing this play anyway I think that was the first one to sign on and said I'll do something\nUm but uh there are other women that worked with me on that scale ... miles I'm Julie Harrington and Kate hawks from Sedona\nAnd we decided we don't want to do something that just is angry because that doesn't get us anywhere and um what we want to do is take a look at the kinds of things that happen to women and kids\nThose in the audience men or women and opportunity to respond to a story\nBecause I think you know we can shall we can talk we can do whatever but it's through art that we can take something in side and um that's why when you ask me tell me the story of ... kind of hard to tell you because it's in the play in the\nPlace where you know you you mentioned are watching the hearings now those hearings were really hard to say well where you are for for everyone regardless of your gender regardless of your political beliefs but you know one of the things that come out of that is we learn words in terms that don't have English equivalents sees\nAnd one of the the terms that I learned from reading a columnist ... take on that hearing because you know there was a lot of elite good old boys thinking you know they they own the women's stuff like this week we heard a couple of instances up it was very disturbing and one of the columnist I rubbed\nUsed a French term to walk this and you're doing that is I guess back in the days when they were feudal lords who owned land or the rented the property to vessels who would build a home on their property but he's still owned they own the house but the\nOn their property but he's still owned they own the house but they were indebted to the lord\nAnd the ... senior was the right of the landlord\nToo shall we say here first crack at the on the wedding night I Do know that I usually the other word wow I mean and I think that describes some of the stuff we heard pretty well mhm sometimes you have to go outside the English language to address like\nThat and so many of us didn't never had heard of that actually my minister and California has one who taught told me about that um but yeah so what happens in the play some of it happens in three oh two to three or four C. E. Clinton era\nUm and some of that happens in the twentieth century twenty first gives me twenty first century so the play goes back and forth\nFrom um that time in Rome to the present day in the United states\nNow you've also got a a a cast for this show that is going to be very familiar to a lot of people who are used to go into strange places around here\nAre and I I cannot tell you how thrilled I Am\nThis is going to be a reading reading and um so it's important when you have a reading to get actors who are really skilled\nBecause they may not have had much time with the script at all and in this case I could not ask for better actors um I have arid Matthew Jim pie doc Alastair McDonald\nBill of rights and Clinton sleigh those are the guys and then Julie Harrington and her daughter Georgia herring and can heal you probably also seen on the stage at PTA is playing act now\nYou know and when you're doing a reading like there's more to different demands on the actor as opposed to the more physical role the standard stage where all\nThe main thing is they have to really get to know their character\nSo that the inflection in their voice the way they react to something that somebody told them\nOn has to carry everything there is no physical movement so you can't sort of a if it's a funny play you can't take a fall or something like that you can't do physical comedy\nUm we've just been listening to all the the woman who played a Suki on Gilmore Girls who had such a fabulous a a physical actor well you can't do any of that in your building so it all has to come from inside of you\nYou mentioned Gilmore were you a big fan of ... fan or a lot of action took place in the coffee shop right a lot of it did yeah we've visited that set it on the Warner Brothers last night oh how old you would have been in your glory I mean what if\nI Would have been well I was kind of a single mom and my daughter and I had a relationship that\nTouched on their relationship a little bit yeah but can you imagine being a writer yourself there was a lot of dialogue in that show and very quick and very quick you're talking about timing and you're talking about very sick scriptures that he had to learn a lot in a short ... and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "23"}
