past when he was a senator from Oklahoma\nOr a list of some of the most outrageous federal government waste and and it's tough to know where to begin a Adam do you have a personal favorite of all these wasted government programs wasteful government programs as you of spotlight a\nWell Michael thank you very much for our interests that are in our work and open the books dot com I think my favorite is that there are literally is a federal grant for everybody in this country in fact every single year the federal government doled out six hundred billion dollars worth of grants\nAnd if you're a prostitute and California one point four million dollars funded sex education for California prostitutes who could probably teach the glass\nOkay now which which way which department of government uh handles the U.S actually had for California prostitutes\nThat's health and Human Services\n[laughter] there is that they have a different world domination of Human Services right um so what what is the point how do they just how much money for sex ed for the prostitute\n[noise] well it's probably a pilot study 'cause it was only one point four million dollar only now overall every year ha Jeff doled out about four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of grants\nTo put that in perspective the U.S military every year at the department of defense or total budget is six hundred billion dollars\nWow wow a at it in terms of what you were talking about was open the books dot com\nYou have a a basic approach which is the transparency is the only way to solve it is letting people know what's going on and President Trump doesn't have to get this through Congress he could do it on his own right\nWell and that's that's the plan with a strategy that we outlined first that the wall Street Journal than at USA Today and it's a three pronged attack and as the commander in chief at this moment that our nation's history when we feel that spending is a crisis\nThe president can take the three pronged approach and he should lead by example he should post all White House expenditures and then step to\nCut the federal agency waste and step three and this was my favorite part Michel he should report for the American people\nShow us how he's defending the American taxpayer by cutting waste fraud and taxpayer abuse and we believe that he should do Twitter to do the reporting\nI think it's a great idea and by the way you also suggest year that there should be an across the board cut in every federal department beginning with a White House and this was something I wrote a book about the White House staff years ago\nAnd man is there a lot of waste and ridiculous nuts in terms of the Fifteen hundred people who work in the White House staff at President Roosevelt one world war two\nWith a hundred and six White House aides total and what is it that we need Fifteen times that number for today\nI I don't I don't give that at all what what about can you give us some background on the um the two hundred thousand six hundred and one dollars that our government spends on a new condom design with a additional lubrication why why does the federal government spend on that\nYou know the economists industry it's a very competitive industry\nBut I'm a two hundred thousand dollars flowed into a Boston, Massachusetts is a private company for a new condom design this is just one of the grants now they're obviously a small company\nWe did identify Michael that the fortune one hundred these are our most successful companies in the entire world certainly in this country that over a three year period they received three point three billion dollars worth of our money American taxpayer subsidies and they cannot argue that they need our money\nUh there's another one here

host DJ far and we're back\nLie to twenty two with Susan and Joel Rubio with the free wheelchair mission or Susan and where does the free wheelchair mission go from here\nWell as you mentioned there is a need for Seventy million people in the world for a lot of mobility and it took sixteen years for free wheelchair mission to deliver the first million wheelchairs um bear in mind we didn't have any partnerships and very few people involved\nOf course that's changed dramatically over the last sixteen years their goal now is to raise enough money for another million wheelchairs in eight years\nIn half the time who manufactures these wheelchairs they're manufactured um in China okay\nAnd um you you wouldn't normally do your fund raising in October joy is that\nOctober is what we call matching month\nWe have individuals or corporations are willing to match up any wheelchair for another wheelchair switch times to call it and [noise] generally speaking whatever we raised locally will be raised\nOr will be doubled example um with the four years in this community of Prescott we've raised a two ... two hundred and twenty thousand dollars and the incumbents this this whole uh Prescott area\nAnd it costs roughly only average how much to manufacture and distribute the wheelchair\nEighty dollars that's amazing ... it's just amazing and\nThan a million wheelchairs distributed now you've also had you've had dinner fund raisers and of course pick up all tournaments which you know several of our listeners\nAnd of course pickle ball tournaments which you know several of our listeners are really involved and where do you have to this year\nThis year we decided to keep it a little simpler I guess I Would say we're we're not going to do a dinner or we're going to just ask all of our people that we have that are have donated to us for free\nWill share mission in the past we're asking them if they'd be willing to donate one wheelchair\nAnd that's what we'd like to ask your listeners as well if they would be willing to donate one wheelchair and when you think about it that's about the cost of going out for a nice dinner and a bottle of wine to think if we could give that up once and write a check for eighty dollars a year will change your life\nAnd when you change your life like that I Wish our people who could donate could see first hand how that life changes yeah you know in addition to the mobility this provides described the dignity it brings their lives\nThat's huge for the first time they're not up on the floor ... up or on the ground or on the ground yeah there are sitting up and they're able to really since ... part of the community\nAnd that they've been Iceland so long now they can attend school mhm potentially work\nDuring a church or service or some kind who are truly part of the ...\nAnd you know this being a largely a retirement community we all know first hand what happens to people when they lose their independence you're providing independence aren't you\nAbsolutely and these people most of them have had not had independence for a very long time yeah\nIndeed Joe we've we've actually covered in dust June vigils who um modify the wheelchair and put some kind of table a surfers to put the items that they're going to show on street\nOh isn't that wonderful well now we have I often get emails from listeners who say you know I Can't actively take part in what your guest is doing but I Would like to help if they can help by writing a check what can they do\nWell they can certainly write a check 'em they can also go online and the um the Web address is give period classy dot org\nSlash Rubio's\nUm they can also read to check if they prefer to do it that way because he did the other way and you'll do a credit card but there's also information on the website to give the address where someone can send in a check and the website for free wheelchair mission is pretty basic free wheelchair mission dot org\nAnd it's a wonderful website with some some pictures and videos it'll just make your heart worm\nReally well that's a really good way to become familiar with the organization go on line see a couple of videos that maybe the closest they'll get but you'll really get a first hand feel for what it's like to put someone in a wheelchair\nAnd what you guys are doing is you're thinking globally in your acting
