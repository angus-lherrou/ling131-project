California congressman tablets playing an MSA MSNBC last Sunday and here's what happened McDonald's has and that is correct in two thousand Fifteen they charge a Asian of American University conducted a sexual assault survey twenty seven selective college at\nThe vast majority of survey responding to me a you researchers classified as sexual assault victims never reported their alleged assault their colleges rape hotline sexual assault resources centers\nOr title nine officers much what the capital city police\nAnd the overwhelming reason he alleged victims did not report is that they did not think that what happened to them that Syria at Harvard for example over sixty nine percent of female responded to check the box or penetration by use of force\nAnd not report the incident ... most of those ... report sixty five percent did not think that their experience was serious enough to report she said our boost field hook up culture has made relations between men and women messier than

in the evening with the war cabinet hearing will presumably have seen women and girls take protective actions such as of late and frat parties and flocking single sex schools none of us protected actions has occurred however either women are two coolest to avoid patent danger or the epidemic of sexual assault the fiction\nAll evidence points to the latter consideration\nTo that piece by Adam McDonald and she is in large part correct\nRight so so philosophically in and psychologically I Am an intuition is that means I think in tuition is where the action\nIs into it more our moral intuitions come first and they drive our reasoning afterwards that might make it seem as though we therefore can't agree because we're all just driven by gut feelings but it's more complicated than that because our intuition come first but they are actually a couple they are changeable\nWe can't change each other than tuition just by throwing reasons you know last time I talk to each other well you know\nDon't you care about you know respect for your parents you can't just throw things at each other\nBut in relationships\nWe we come to listen to somebody we can we talk with someone our minds can now this is an amazing ability that humans have that no other animals that we can nailed our minds um if we're open to that and then we can actually hear each other and that's what happened to me when I said I understand conservative thought I actually\nMet a few conservative I mean there were not many in my world I talked to some people and they were\nVery decent people out so through relationships with the right kind of relationship we actually can open our minds and hearts a great novel can do that\nA great that's not what if he can do that and one of the tragedy of our national life is that while we used to be fairly mixed politically and we were more separated racially in another way\nWe've gotten more mixed along a lot of athletes but we're getting more and more separate politically we live more and more and more surefire shelter bubbles and that makes it harder to emphasize it exacerbates our political divide and it damages our democracy\nSo that brings us to the new book the coddling of the American mind was really talks about the ramifications of exactly the sort of divide and in the in the ... the American mind you talk about what you consider three big problems in American society today if you want to just eliminate those I'd be fantastic\nSure to the book is based around us three great untruth a my first book happiness hypothesis with actually about ten insight that you find an ancient cultures all over the world psychological insight and so uh one of them is\nWhat doesn't kill you makes you stronger neat that was neat just formulation uh but you find the exact same idea in ... in China you find it all over the world that kids need challenges human beings need challenge obstacles failures step back in order to grow um so that's a basic truth that's a psychological true\nBut what we're finding on campus or finding in the lives of American Kids is an increasing\nThe increasing presence of the idea that what doesn't kill you makes you weaker\nThat is in fact that my father has just recently um it was an article making the rounds ah kids are our mobilizing in high school to ... to to end the practice of regular public speaking\nThat uh we you know some kids had anxiety around public speaking that's very common one of the article one of the lines in his Atlantic article quoted a high school kids say nobody should be forced to do something that they're not comfortable doing wow\n[laughter] wow can you imagine raising kids were that tipped him how would they come out\nIf this is true that we need challenges that back even fear we have to be afraid and overcome it and realize oh I can do that\nAnd if we get into this idea that no one should be forced to do anything they're uncomfortable doing\nWe're setting up the next generation for failure and that's exactly or subtitled how good intentions and bad ideas are setting up a generation for failure more briefly the second grade on truth is always trust your feeling and the third is life is a battle\nBetween good people and evil and our contention at the in the book is that if we can successfully teach the young generation all three of these great untruth almost guaranteed to fail\nWon't let let's talk about that that last week in Alaska in front of me the most dangerous one of all the attendance in favor of feelings that I think had along suggest in history and and it's always me tie into the the intuition isn't that you talked about earlier I made a human suggesting that basically we're creatures of passion\nAnd then the reason sort of ride on top pretending I Would would ... with all that said when it comes to the question of young people in each other's is good and evil do you think that's bringing more from one side of the aisle than than another do you do how do you see that chain of causality moving well\nHold off on the question of who's to blame or who is more guilty of this um let's start with the basic psychology here which is that human beings evolved for tribalism is is actually a great secret uh uh the the chimpanzees hunting they they have ... that they have troops and they controlled territory so they're able to do this and they're able to have\nBattles between groups but he went to the masters of this and while that might sound bad I'm actually it enabled us to cooperate it enables us\nTo have a a a shared moral world so we are by nature tribal and that's what got us into civilization\nBut modern liberal democracies are brilliant at turning back down to allow people to live more peacefully humans go very quickly the tribalism\nBut we can also tone it down with very good trade were curious about other groups as well and so a good modern society is one that find ways to turn that down allow people to live near others who are different from them with no hostility no violence\nAnd we did a pretty good job of that in the twenty century and there was a huge wave towards democracy swim meet a lot of progress in the last few centuries overcoming tribalism and the problem is that it's so easy to turn it back on and a lot of what's happening in our politics between left and right that and accelerating since the Nineteen nineties\nCross the partisan hatred keeps going up and up since the Nineteen eighties or nineties and unfortunately now in certain forms of identity politics were finding these\nThese tensions between groups in the United states and I just read it there's a new book out called the tribes something like that in Britain very much\nAnd there's a new book out called the tribes something like that in Britain very much the same time it's happening in the u._k. so I find very alarming that our our society our politics social media are turning up our travel is\nSo where where do you think that increase tribalism coming from because my theory would it would be that\nBased on sort of Robert Putnam believes in in diversity of of any being led beneficial than for example\nA solidarity with regard to opinion meaning that diversity is is great so long as we all share a common\nGoal but it's like we don't share a common cold and everything ... pretty quickly at the the goal oriented nature of the United states a common culture that we shared and basically disintegrated since the Nineteen sixties in some ways that's been for good on issues of\nSaxon race for example but in some ways quite bad in terms of traditional morality in my view of the stuff that eldest social fabric together and things like that but it's been praying most of the social fabric and what that's done is it brought people back into the the\nTribalism that that you're talking about what would you attribute to rise and tribalism too\nYeah so the way that I think about what's happened to our country is that in a large secular society there are a lot of forces blowing up part and there are lot holding us together and if you go back to the mid to late twentieth century everything was lined up to pull us together we'd had extraordinarily high rate of\nOf um immigration and the elite nineteenth and early twentieth century that's when my grandparents came over from Russia and Poland um\nThe there was a wave of anti immigrant backlash and in the twenties the gates were shot immigration went way down um and as you pay immigration has many good effect and many bad effects yet you have to look at it honestly and try to maximize the good\nSo we had by the seventies and eighties and very low rates of foreign born there was the dominant culture it was the wasp culture or David Brooks has written brilliantly about how the ... set up a meritocracy within which Jews and Asians and other groups were able to succeed\nUm we had a common enemy still in the Soviet Union um we had a functioning political culture in Washington but there's a lot of bipartisanship and immediate system um\nThere were three networks and so there was more a ... a common source of the news to all those things were lined up and this was the center of American greatness and all over the world people look to America and they said wow we want what they've got let's copy their constitution lets copy their culture um we were the light of the world\nObviously it's funny that the American isn't too but there's a lot of admiration for us\nAnd then one by one the the centrifugal force is pulling us together began to weaken\nThe media environment obviously but first beginning with cable TV all the way through to social media now its production eight in us [noise] um the uh obviously immigration greatly increased beginning of the sixties and again many good things the economist or clear immigration is good economically but as you say\nThe issues of social trust and cohesion apartments work and others\nSuggest that that that drops trusted others drops and to have a functioning democracy it really helps to have cross group trust to not be suspicious of each other so in so many ways things are kind of turned around and we have to do some serious thinking\nWhat is it going to take to restore the the social support for an effective democracy\nMy main criticism of of the left these days is it the left has fallen into a sort of tribalism networks to even acknowledge that another try to exist or that there are other there are other people who perceive problems differently so back to your question of the various valleys in righteous my jet that\nBasically the political laps bases itself on a couple of values fairness and harm well it's still going to be deluged base yourself upon them by necessity you have to\nBe implying even yourself at the other side is for unfairness and for harm by that in order for that that there cannot be any bridging the gap because he only value that matter are harm perceived as anything bad that happened to anything I disagree with\nResults in a certain number of people getting hurt and fairness in that a person who
