all boys school wasn't that much we can do you [laughter] well I'm well acting and helps you understand other people a lot because you have to put yourself in other people's shoes and sometimes it's easy and people can just read a script in and become someone else but I\nIt took a lot more for me I I very often play the bad guy which we didn't really helped me I played a familiar with little shop for it I was a dentist and there's not a lot of humanity can search for it's hard to put yourself in the shoes of somebody who is a psychopath\nBut you know I I got\nTo know to me that [laughter] but I I'm\nYou know I developed a deep empathy for my fellow human being that I that drove me very very passionate emotional stance\nThan my school gets shot up and I say okay I've heard of Sandy Hook I've heard of combine I've heard all these things and when you're in a room and you hear about those schools everything gets island everything gets awkward everything gets\nMelancholy I Can't have that when I when people hear Stoneman Douglas I don't want them to think about people crying I Want them to think about people taking action no matter what that actually might be\nSo take me through that day what what exactly would that day like for you\nSo before the shooting I was in my drama class you're halfway through song that I was doing again that sounded like garbage\nBut I remember the special needs kids at my school I let out a half hour before everybody else because they are picked up at the bus loop and they have to be picked up before the buses come so on days riot school and my mother was at work I picked up my brother and I brought up the drama he loves it he got attention when the girls seem even like you know he felt like a\nCool guy which he is and I it was about two twenty and I was supposed to pick him up to ten so I said oh crap I got to go I rush out of the drama and run over to pick up my brother 'cause I have to be back from my song\nAnd suddenly there's fire alarm and I'd say ... it and the buses are about the time and I'm with a special needs students and we have to go in the ... to avoid the fire\nYou know there are a lot of very high functioning students in the ESE programs have someone that I was there a lot of lower functioning students but it's it's a hassle to get in the parking lot and I was just like okay this is annoying\nEspecially being outside of the class you're supposed to be entering a fire joke and then you have to tell the teacher they have to walk either staff to make sure everybody's counting for\nAn hour out there waiting this getting near me says shooter I look at him and I say well what if that's not cool that's not cool at all I said something very inappropriate you know if this reaches a younger audience when avoid it\nBut suddenly everybody starts running back into the school and there are teachers that getting us inside of my initial thought is okay wherever the ESE gladden and several other classes but we're with ESE class in the middle of the of the box loop\nAnd there was a they must have been a fake fire drill on the buses whereabouts comes there like everybody get inside so you don't get hit by the message\nThat were sent into a classroom the lights turn off and I say something's going on here took me a couple of minutes to realize that there was there was gunfire I heard conflicting rumors there was mass hysteria and the room but it was the type of area where you are hysterical but still have to be quiet because you don't know what the government is\nHe could have been you know rain right next door to us I no idea\nI didn't hear any gunfire I thought I did but when you know there's a shooter and you hear something you think it's on fire it's natural\nAnd everybody was telling me conflicting stories and this is just the people next to us they were whispering they spend fifty people were killed two people were killed\n'em this teacher was killed that wasn't that this person was the shooter this person shooter and I spent the whole time thinking I really really really hold my brother doesn't understand what's going on\nAnd and that some lesser moral Kwon do I tell them what's going on because these are the truth or do I allow him the ignorance of the the blend of ignorance for the time being but there were also a lot of other special needs students there and some of them were non verbal but non verbal doesn't mean you can make noise\nAnd some of them are yelling and some of them are making loud cheeks and hollers and fortunately the special needs specialist at someone dug this rebel to keep everybody together and it was\nIt was a problem that we saw quickly but\n... we ... we were able to be released the SWAT Team came in the first thing we saw his rifle and the glass cracks and we thought we were toast\nBut in the SWAT Team came in we run outside I get picked up by my parents at a hotel a couple of hours later and and then came a week of chaos but also pizza do all of the laws of physics kind of didn't exist in Parkland it was a day of\nThe world and stopped and there was this theory calm but also there's fiery madness it was it was a time where I said\nIn this in this lack of ... well nobody around us knows what's going on I have to step up and say here's what I think I I couldn't have the ... they're the cameras game and I couldn't have them come in film people crying\nI had to have in common I had to have people stand in front of them and say we cannot have this anymore we demand the change we are not Parkland is not the city of people who are going to encourage you to join our melancholy Parkland is this for the people who are going to encourage you to take action\nIf you had your druthers about how the media treats these sorts of situations obviously you know ... the media does what the media new which they cover the news when it happened but if you had your druthers emotionally I just\nPolitically in every way what would you what would you have the media how did you have the media cover these sorts of situations\nWell it's a male edged sword because on the one hand I was on national news while there were body that we're still warm and people I've been married yet\nAnd and I didn't do that at the time I didn't really think about it but in retrospect it makes me question\nWithout appropriate on the one hand the cameras are going to leave and I want to make sure the message that I Believe is right to get across while the cameras are still there on the other hand people are dead and and I know I I don't regret anything I did because I Know the what I was doing I did because I believed it was right\nAnd not the best I can do\nBut in regards to other media coverage and I think that sit in the names of shooters should never be released daily wire covers that very well I Know that there are multiple\nShould never be released daily wire covers that very well I Know that there are multiple pundits as well that do not named the shooters I think that there's a lead making the shooter celebrities is flipping the appropriate and I think that I think that I was very often treated like an expert when I'm not I'm not the expert on anything\nIn the days immediately following obviously there are a lot of cameras there people are looking for comment Lyndon Jew and and the other members of march for our lives really start to consolidate into group\nSure so February fifteenth we're all separated\nAnd it was February sixteen two days after the shooting that I was able to kind of see who is ready to speak out and get them together and we all came to my house I thought of doing the march in DC and like it was such a pajama than my bathroom and I and I said OK if the whole nation in in one way or another has galvanized right now what can we do\nHow can we materialized and I said let's get everyone to DC and let's demand a change so quickly the team started to grow more and more people became part\nOf all my friends from the other thing I knew where well spoken and eloquent joined some people just showed up at my house and then some of them ended up becoming very passionate and well spoken advocates for what we're advocating for\nBut it was by what I Would call February nineteenth our team was together\nSo that the tactics that much of our lives used came under a lot of president ... criticism including from people like me because obviously the very beginning particularly there was a lot of focus on some of the stuff he talked about earlier\nOr there's an implication that was put out by particle members of the team um you know in in public settings that if there was a disagreement about politics but this was a reflection of lack of of care\nAbout what had happened um what do you think could have been done to mitigate against that\nTo be honest with you a lot of that was me\nA lot of that was telling my friends you know these people don't agree with us that they don't care\nNow they they they care more about their guns and they care about is getting killed\nAnything I'll criticize about march for our lives really comes from me uh I started it I was the my I was bringing my friend's here's all the time\nI Know I Know the people in my ... and all of them pretty much like the back of my head I know that these are people who really just one of the world to be a better place and a lot of our areas and messaging particularly if you don't like us you don't care came from me and I believed it and I believe that until relatively recently\nI'm embarrassed certainly but I'm also I'm I'm not losing sleep over it because I believed it\nWhat do you think change that for you I mean he talked about being in Texas but\nObviously they didn't for for those of us were watching from afar the first time that I saw you on TV I think was probably during these CNN town hall about which was obviously got huge ratings with with the big TV event I predict that Jake Tapper Fort Hood I suggested that the media really should've if they want to have a discussion the issues they should or discussion of the issues as opposed to sort of an emotionally driven event\nUm you know what changed from from there to where you are now which is a somebody wants to have discussions based on the issues\nI think that I I reached out for a bit I can tell you the exact catalyst there wasn't really a moment where clicked on me that I Need to start opening this conversation but I realized\nLook into the less never going to get rid of the right the rights never going to get rid of the left they certainly of all the parties change over time but there's ... as long as we have a binary system it's a binary system and\nAnd half the country doesn't want the world to be a bad place I thought that I thought that half the country the Republicans were legal I think that there are some grade and the people on the right and left are are both lovely and people in the right and left are both\nAwful I don't want to say there's very find people on both sides that had been used in ways I can never accept\nBut I I I learned that there's a such a that we're all people I mean I I said that you have to a lot of people are politicizing nine eleven and and I said look we're Americans today and I learned that overall we're Americans and we have a ... there's a ... there's

remarkable the level of detail that could be acquired by anyone who doesn't have subpoena power the detail that goes to her and by the way someone looks to me this hour has already suggested that but in New York state has indicated justice of obligation that they want to look into all this\nI mean the detail in here is really revealing and I mean if you look at for example a ... they I think the biggest episode they're discussing it\nA ... they I think the biggest episode they're discussing is when the father's assets had to be transferred to the children and they talk about it in great specificity to\nThis thing schemes that were used the value those assets and doesn't minimize of essential estate tax one was to create a sham companies and pay it insulated appealing as a way of kind of fly down the assets of transferring the money that goes that way and even more explosively they argue there were systematically\nA fraudulent ah or at least a highly misleading appraisals Don of all not\nTrue yes see he was as father was paid him money\nFull time he was three years old at first the first mechanism three son who's three yeah the first mechanism was his father had built in large apartment complexes and who gave the land under those apartment complexes to his children to cooking the president who is three and then begin pain than\nRent on that over the course of his

... Larry my pillow dot com and again just comical Larry\nThe montage just played you involved they punted on CNN\nAnd other put it on CNN another punted on CNN\nDavid Cay Johnston his investigative reporter who specializes in tax issues\nAnd one of the reporters in the New York times who co wrote the article that we're talking about Trump engaging suspect tax games as he reached Richard from his father my next guest\nIs a partner with the Beverly Hills law firm she specializes in personal wealth transfer in a state\nTax planning including estate planning and trust wheels probate personal income tax planning charitable gift planted nonprofit public organization that private foundations demand is well qualified yeah they'd be asked and economic masters in accounting from Wharton\nLaw degree from University of Southern California please welcome back to the program Reid should read thank you so much for taking the time I appreciate it\nThanks Larry it's always an honor to be on your show\nRead you read the New York times article very very long article fourteen thousand words did Trump or his father or other members of the family engage in something illegal\nWell you know what I'm I Can't tell a you know I haven't looked at the water hundred thousand pages of documents that they seem to provide\n'em you know there's there are a few things in here which is a proven to be true that was probably beyond the pale of law\nUm what what what bothered me about the uh the article is the the authors obviously showed their bias in several places I'm One of which where they say that uh the rich never really pay their full freight\nUm and ah there's a couple of places where they're under explanation allows them to make some rather crucial accusations which\nIf I knew all the facts I might be able to disapprove so I'll give you an example if you if I may sure um suppose that I buy a house for half a million dollars I put twenty percent down and I borrow with a mortgage the remaining four hundred thousand dollars of the purchase price\nNow what is that worth to me what is that included in my network is like if I gave it away at that point what would the value of the gift be\nOne of the value of the gift will be a hundred thousand dollars because it would be subject to that mortgage and so now let's say there's a downturn like there was in the Nineteen nineties or two thousand three or two thousand eight when everybody lost value in the real estate and now my real estate is worth only four hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nAnd like a lot of clients of mine decided when the downturn came that was a good time to give away a real estate to their children so now it's worth four hundred and twenty thousand dollars I give it to my children what's the gift that I report on my gift tax return\nWas four hundred and twenty thousand dollars minus a four hundred thousand dollar mortgage that's twenty thousand dollars left that would be the value of the gift\nNow a decade later\nThere's been improvements all around the neighborhood knew Tony retailers developments of of of various sizes\nAnd I sell my children's sell that house for seven hundred thousand dollars or have to pay off the mortgage so they keep three hundred thousand dollars I'm not even going to talk about taxes at that point\nBut they kept three hundred thousand dollars and then one could say that it got Fifteen times the valuation of the gift\nBut you see that was perfectly legal they didn't but the article doesn't explain the leverage of real estate so as a result I mean you you can easily said my gosh how could that ever happened how could you ever invest in something and then sell it ten years later for Fifteen times what the value was when it was given\nA real shot reach out his my guess he's an attack in the state planning lawyer or read you said there were a couple of things that that jumped out at you and if they could be proven to be true it would be problematic what what's the most serious one\nThought well the one that I really found to be a very serious is there's this uh uh there's a statement that when Donald Trump's a casino was in very bad shape or you know just ... drowning in debt\nThat apparently his father a sent an emissary to buy three million dollars worth of shift\nRead them and put you on hold for for ... for for this we're going to pick that on the other side I remember when that happened\nSome some guy went in there and bought three point five million dollars worth of chips giving simply the casino amount of money in cash and didn't cash the chips that basically gave a Donald Trump a three point five million dollar loan from his dad as far as I can recall uh we'll find out what the problem with that was with reach

wealth has spread over I think it's fourteen or Fifteen family in the ... now but the most important thing is those trucks were created before much\nThing is those shots were created before much of the tax laws that credit Mary trust marry a Trump were subject to a were passed so for example the the Kennedys died before the uh Nineteen eighty six\nA generation skipping tax was introduced so they could pass wealth down to their grandchildren without a an extra\nLevel of a state tax at every generation but I'm sure that they had some dental Joe Kennedy was not exactly the cleanest a a living person alive and I'm sure that there are there were problems or ways that he skirted the tax laws um I just don't know\nNow the article the New York times ... says that ah the statute of limitations has run on many of these transactions but there is no statute of limitations for fine for civil fraud that is ... is the president or in in jeopardy\nWell I mean the IRS has been scrutinizing the Trump family for many decades I I just I just can't imagine that suddenly they're going to say oh look what we found\nAnd now they're civil penalties there is one thing that you should know though and that's if if something if some gift was made and no gift tax return was filed to report it in any way there's no statute of limitations on the assessment of tax on that gift mhm\nAre you uh went to

what we used to call in Latin class at the lower them they're based upon the value at the date of death or in the case would get it on a date of the gift and so there are techniques which are used to diminish the value of the of the gifts so for example\nIf I were to give you a twenty percent\nUh ownership of my house just a deed for me to Larry Elder over twenty percent interest\nBut instead I ... that that's one value twenty percent of whatever the value is because in California we have the ability to pursue to sell the property if you are a partial owner fractional interest on the other
