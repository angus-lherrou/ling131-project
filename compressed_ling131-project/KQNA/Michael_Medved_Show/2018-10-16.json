what that means\nBut uh the DNA tests that she underwent that showed that she may be\nOne out of one thousand and twenty fourth war\nAs much as one out of sixty fourth\nA Native American\nReally ... by the way let's take the best case analysis based upon the DNA test and everyone should understand that that no one can accept these DNA test because very often they've shown that different companies do different tests\nAnd they come out with wildly different results that's even why Elizabeth Warren had several different tests taken here and all of them show like most\nSeveral different tests taken here and all of them show like most Americans the overwhelming majority of the European American and by the way also the over ... well Ming majority of African Americans there is a little bit of Native American and most people whose families have lived here in the United states for many years and that is true for Elizabeth Warren's family\nBut the best case analysis for her the idea that she is one sixty fourth Native American means that about a hundred and fifty years ago she had one of her sixty four great great\nGreat great grandparents who may have been Cherokee\nAs she says family lore suggested\nThe entire thing was a ridiculous claim to begin with and wouldn't it be better for her if she's just back off but no but she won't she basically insists that uh this is the way she's going to set up her presidential campaign my question to you\nWould be was she thinking why is this a good idea\nIt makes her look ridiculous and make sure looked like a liberal racist why do I say that because for goodness sake if you grow up in a situation where you never affiliate with the tribe no one in your whole family within memory is ever affiliated with the tribe\nYou've never go on the Indian events you haven't raised with any Indian culture you know nothing about Indian history or background\nYou have no connection no affiliation no participation know communal involvement with the Native American community\nAh then when you get hired at Penn or Harvard you put down that your ethnicity is Native American because that qualify as you as a diversity hire\nI mean the whole thing is sad now is it\nThe end of the world no it's not the end of the world but she is making at the end of her campaign she is blowing herself up and she chose to do this that this would be a good idea

F a U X of course and means phony false like people talking about so Perls phony pearls their imitation\nSo this is before President Trump started with a book on and stuff they're number of people in writing including me who use the term to describe Elizabeth Warren\nOf so called upon us right get it as in ... it sounds like Pocahontas but its FAU accident and caught us and I guess President Trump must have heard that and he dropped the French part and just made it Pocahontas in any event is why is it a racial slur\nRedskins is uh I I understand that can be a racial slur we won't get into that issue ... but I'm sure we will at some point certainly if the Democrats win the house um she uh uh there's a second clip of person powers on CNN here she is\nI think it would have been better if she would have just originally said you know what family lore this is what I thought and made a mistake I'm you know as Michael said actually I don't think she probably has much more\nYou know of this this um you know in her than a than most Americans so just you know we all hear stories in our families and you say I I heard it wrong and said she said something about her grandfather great grandfather having high cheekbones which is a racist stereotype and so I think she actually has legitimately handled a sadly Donald Trump\nIt that's not his motivation and it's not about he cares about her misappropriating costs are have just acting badly and making racist attacks\nIt why is it a racist attack I I don't see that I don't get I think it's an attack on a political opponent and yes the president does a lot of it um [noise] let's uh go to Pam in ...

heard that million dollars a pound way I Am wanted let me let me play it for\nYou okay I just want to be fair here listen to what President Trump said here's President Trump's original offered over Elizabeth Warren\nIf you take the test of the shows you're\nOkay is it shows you're an Indian and my point here was that there is no Indian tribe in the world in the country\nWould accept her as an Indian based upon this DNA tested chose that she may have had one great great great great grandfather who was in India that's my only point\nJust want to say that I'm Trump your color and uh and the previous hour said Trump has brought us down to the gutter he really had and I mean you guys I I'm just so\nAn age limit my way to let me ask you\nThis okay do you think that it is honorable of for Elizabeth Warren to have a promoted herself as a diversity hire to have contributed to an Indian cookbook to have gone through this masquerade for all this time\n[noise] no I don't think she should have done that I don't get out of it it was trivial and she shouldn't have done it but I'll tell you what prompted calls out women he called he'd said Dr forward it doesn't matter and she was lying or not we want and what do you want it that's all he cares about winning and he doesn't care who he dumped on\nOkay look I Believe that President Trump those sometimes go way over the line I think it's unfortunate and I said it already on the show\nI think it was a big mistake on his part and it was inappropriate for him to attack Stormy Daniels who was made accusations of intimate kind against him two attackers horse face at who put that in a tweet today\nUm it's probably we probably reached a point in our world where if you're going to be attacking a female and he's going to attack or the way

called called to the forty fifth president President Trump deserves applause and support and backing when he leads American the right direction\nAnd I think much of the time he does\nBut the idea that

people don't want an impeachment crisis\nAnd and do you have Democrats and now we're promised that if they take the house are going to try to impeach President Trump they're going to trial and preach

statement in a statement that he'd been in dollars it proved that she was an Indian yeah he was one one thousand twenty four days or should be about nine dollars and thirty eight that\nI'm I'm sure you've done the math that the problem is he he basically said she needs to show she's an Indian and what that means is how do you define who is an Indian\nNow in the URL Nuremberg Laws and Nazi

doesn't close to that one sixteenth Jewish background means what is it it means a great great grandparents she has to go back to great great great great that's for great great grandparents a hundred

talk of the quad cities cake you and what the here's your host DJ phone we're\nBack to two Twenty one and continuing with the theme about health we are bringing Kearney is the executive director correct yes yeah granted creek or health in rehab a tell us about uh uh what's going on at granted creek these days\nYeah so grainy creek we are a skilled nursing home\nAnd for those that don't understand what that is that is\nA we have short term care those that go may go to the hospital or maybe since yeah non valley\nThey may be a mountain valley but they need a little more care before they at home or whether they fell and broke their hip or whether they had pneumonia at the hospital hospital discharge they just need a little more strengthening we have fulltime physical therapy occupational therapy speech therapy\nOr or whether it's maybe they need ivy antibiotics those things that come to our facility uh for two to three weeks or whatever they need and then our job is to get them home as soon as possible and then the other half of our facility is long term care for those that are your typical nursing home\nThat are are unable to care for themselves at home or they need full time twenty four seven nursing care in one way or another whether it's physically they can't do things or mentally or they need assistance so the long\nTerm care you're not expected to return to your home after that right\nMost of the time that they don't sometimes they do sometimes or they get qualified uh sometimes it's getting qualified for Arizona long term care access long term care program\nAh which will also provide care in the home sometimes they come in they stay for a little bit and then a family is able to take them home and they can still get assistance at home but majority no they don't usually go back home they usually need assistance or nursing care systems twenty four seven\n... take us back when you first got started in this profession what got you interested in it\nSo it's kinda funny I started my career I don't know many people that started their career in nursing homes are skilled nursing homes my career I and I studied and did\nIn homes are skilled nursing homes my career I and I studied and did was hospitality and I worked uh for Marriott Hotels\nAnd resorts and I had a good friend that was in the skill nursing environment and said hey you'd really like this it's very similar to a hospitality you're dealing with a you know gas in customer service and managing people on running it and so\nUm and I enjoyed it I really enjoy a seeing people come in get better go home and dealing with family members and it's it's a usually a lot of times can be a very crucial time in their lives and usually something critical it's happened\nSometimes a life changing where they can't go back home um and so this is what what next what do we how do we deal with mom how they deal with that or whether it's a spouse or what do we do and we have the ability to walk them through that and help them make those decisions\nI spent five years myself in the funeral and cemetery industry and people would hear that and go oh that must be so depressing I go no no not at all because I considered us in the healing or transition a profession and you guys are pretty much in the same thing aren't you we\nAre a in sometimes you know our first responders get a lot of love and a lot of tension but sometimes the last ... responders [laughter] which I like to call ourselves a you know we we that's what we're doing is providing quality life at the end of life\nOr to those weather like I said whether it's a physical ailment or mental ailment\nBut also the skill part of them getting recovery getting back on their feet going home Senate getting them set up with home health and those things are it's it's a lot of fun it is and only part of your job is about the patient how much of a job has to do with the supporting family\nYeah that's it's a lot of it the majority of it is the supporting family and it's a because the patient ah we're able to communicate with them they know what's going on they have the nurse to talk to every day and the CNN and those things that's\nIt the family members especially a lot of times because Prescott a lot of people didn't grow up here in Prescott or their\nTheir family members are out of town and so it's a it's phone calls keeping them informed of what's going on keeping them up to date or helping them with information to help them make decisions and and whether it's you know getting I'm In touch with financial issues or whether it's medical issues it's it's the family members yeah\nUm and ah it that makes the biggest difference in the family or they just want to know that their family members being taken care of being loved\nAnd uh we've had some really good ah results or our last uh we had you know we get inspected by the state every year our annual survey was a we had a deficiency free perfect survey um it was very good and then we're we're a five star rated facility by Medicare and Medicaid\nOn that note uh when you train new employees how important is it to instill in them the knowledge that when you're dealing with a family who was head of a sudden injury of sudden illness\nVarying tenet are going to be out and they're going to remember every single thing that they see or do er here when they encounter you correct\nCorrect yeah and part of a orientation when the biggest points I Try to make is\nIs family members in ... patients they don't always remember what you said they're not going to remember maybe what you did or your name but they will always remember the way you make them feel ... and if they feel loved and they feel cared for and they feel taking care of\nThen those other things are are aren't as important and and not only that do want to come back\nOr if they have to come back to the facility because Arizona and especially\nNorthern Arizona we skew older than the rest of the country's population how much attention to you have to pay to ah what's going on in Washington whenever they talk about cutting healthcare cutting Medicare cutting Social Security that much to get your attention either one way or the other\nRight it does because that is or how we're able to take care of sure are these folks and in if we aren't able if they're cutting or the support in the funding is not there for Medicare Medicaid 'em then it's going to come to a point where where did these people go who's going to help take care of them\nAnd so when you think of it you don't always think of hey this is just a an access program a free program it's it's really you got to look at Medicare Medicaid and that's taking care of our family members are elderly or in their last stages of life\nUm because a lot of times and\nFamily members don't have the abilities nowadays or to take care of their their parents it just ah both parents are working they don't have the capacity to bring in mom and dad into the home on and so the our facilities like ourselves that's what we're built to do we're built to take care of\nAnd when you have a family or when you have a patient who is leaving and going back home what kinds of questions do you have to ask their caregiver about adapting the home and being prepared for this new responsibility\nIt is and so when we meet with them and get ... try to get set up by and we were always planning for the discharged from the day they come in a on such are skilled patients are short term patients\nBut um our therapy is working with them what kind of what do you have a home who do you have there to take care of you to how many steps do you have to enter what ... what's your home set up like\nBecause if it's not set up in the conducive way whether it's for a walk her wheelchair or a walk in bath tub with those things that we can advise them\nAnd say hey this is what insurance is going to cover this is some of the equipment that your Medicare will get you but these are some of the things you need to do on your own and it's giving those those resources so that they can have the home set up\nTo take care of mom and dad or make it easier on\nIt was a year ago this month I blew up my knee and I was on crutches for a while then a wheelchair than a Walker I started noticing things in the home a whole lot more I bet you can identify with that\nCue and they will continue after that's on link Eliot for the talk of the quad cities eleven thirty AM Ninety nine point

Louis got then\nCarol kings um daughters and then re downtown and ... and ... John ah Tommy Chong daughters\nAnd um I don't know there are I'm Alex a rock those kids went on the air and\nFor those who don't know who Alex Rocco is if you remember the scene the godfather where the guy with the horn rimmed glasses looks up from the workout table and gets the bullet right through the glass and lands right yeah it was Alex Wright ask\nOh my goodness holy cow and so you were growing up around people whose idea of a day job was to go to a studio either to singer correct that's it yeah and ... now having associated with these people in everyday stuff where they just your neighbors and friends and coworkers and stuff\nYeah we just hung out together we um my father and a limousine company and so one went Halloween I'm Sherry ... than I'm Kim Washington um oh gosh I Can't even remember who else what's with that but my mom pilots is all in the car we went to Beverly Hills\nAnd it was so funny nobody answered the door they had buckets of money out in front of their heart and so we just all our bags up with money and put them in the car and then\nJust go from house to house and collect money no candy says\nWell you know it's funny because I Lived in the valley and uh we used to read about the Los Angeles times in a big story one day for Halloween about Bob and Dolores Hope they had a house into awake\nAnd on Halloween Night ah people would line up down the street parents and kids especially with the parents because the kids knew they would get done only candy but also silver dollar\nAnd the parents would get Bob hopes autographed picture so he had this weird scenery Halloween the parents and kids lined up down the street just to hit the hope to state\nThat is going to put it but you think about you know from your associations with these people are going to school with them and everything do you think it's really tough to grow up the child of a really famous person\nYes yeah because you're exposed to more things and culture then are you know whether it's just the typical teenage person in these days you were working with\nWe'll teenage person in these days you were working with our friend bread Newman oh you're the house parent I understand for why the eyes women's home right oh that's correct that's all about\n[noise] um well it is a five thousand square foot home and we have six women one of which is my daughter Stephanie who has Down syndrome\nAnd um we do every day um things the girls have their choice that they do ah we all eat breakfast lunch and dinner together on the weekends where I'm offering males together and they go to work from eight to fourth Monday through friday why and you know that's our\nOur day to some of the special challenges and benefits blessings of being a Down syndrome parent\n[noise] well you know um when we first had our daughter we didn't know she had Down syndrome and so when we went to the ... the doctor the doctor said that er nurse had said you know had suspected that she might have Down syndrome 'cause she had very I'm white features\nAnd um the doctor told us that you know you're young you can put her up for adoption and you can have more children because it's just going to be a challenge for you you know this is not something that you're going to want to probably do at this gentleman age\nAnd I don't flip dinner I'm like oh my gosh I carry this child nine months I in this is my my baby and she has turned out to be the most beautiful and giving passionate I'm woman than I've ever been around and I just I'm so grateful that I get to be with her every day of her life\nI interviewed a Down syndrome parent a couple of years ago and I asked the same question what are some of the differences and she told me something striking she said downs babies are born lacking the mean Jean\nYeah they're not they're not if you're if you teach them that there'll be mean sure but naturally they're they just love everybody and they just want everybody to love them\nHow does it change your own life what does it do to you personally how does it change you as a person it makes me more conscious of how I treat others really yes how interesting because you know it would feel like to be hurt by\nCrude comments right oh yeah when I was growing up I it's if I thought somebody teasing somebody that had a disability I Would like in their face like okay come on [laughter] yeah\nYeah so when you go back to Los Angeles what what kinds of or place to go to all kinds of friends do you still meet because when I hear the term Laurel Canyon I'm thinking of Steve Martin Joni Mitchell Carole King James Taylor George Clooney people like this it is a special place isn't it\nOh yeah oh yeah well most of my friends don't even live in Hollywood anymore I mean they I'm Kelly I'm Glen Campbell better she lives in his house that he was born and raised in Arkansas\nAnd so I'm actually going to go visit her because we are going to go to that mind that has um the diamond mine it's at the park and that a national park in Arkansas where you can just to get diamonds\nAnd well and she says it's like eight minutes from our house and she's never been there so we're going to do that but when I go to Los Angeles I usually go by and look at the houses that I grew up and just because I Want to see how they've changed and", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "year": "2018", "city":
