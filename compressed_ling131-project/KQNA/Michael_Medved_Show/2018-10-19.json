I Hope that all of them lose this time they want all lose because we have a two party system in this country but the point about this is it there's a difference between evil and foolishness or even corruption\nHere's what the U.N Nikki Haley had to say about this the Al Smith dinner and she said it so well that well let's just have her say it herself\nWe've had some last and I can find at ourselves and our political rivals fat really they want to share something I Believe is important\nThat they had a lot when I speak to high school students and ...\nAnd our toxic political environment I heard some people in both parties described their opponents as enemies are evil\nAnd America our political opponents\nIn South Sudan or rape is routinely used as a weapon of war\nIn Syria where the dictator uses chemical weapons to murder innocent children that is evil\nAnd North Korea where American student Otto Warmbier was tortured to death\nWith evil in the last two years I've seen truly [noise]\nWe have some serious political differences here at home\nOpponents are not even\n[noise] we are blessed with a political system that allows us to resolve our differences peacefully\nWe recognize that we are all Americans and we are stronger and healthier when we are United\nOkay I think it's tough to disagree with that\nAnd particularly in the context of what I began by talking about which is the case of a Christian Woman whose name as a C a bb she's illiterate\nBut then a lot of people in Pakistan are particularly women\nAnd by the way that's not an anti woman comment that's a pro woman comment I mean one of the things that is deeply dysfunctional about a lot of the Islamic countries in the world is that that they don't provide any education for the women\nDrug laws do save lives and but my point David Stringer wrote legislation to weaken Arizona struggle off a terrible idea here Mr sugar doesn't get most addicts just want to get high they don't want treatment\nFor use tough drug laws to put them in treatment and keep them there they wake up to what they've been doing patience telling me they hated tree for the first\nTo save their lives [noise] stringers plan to weaken our drug laws would cost lives and make the opioid crisis worse so let's keep tough drug laws and use them not to punish but to get drug addicts that help they need a doctorate guards are proven to say I've paid for by Edgar for state representative\nOld water shock makes sense when you dive into the pool not when you're in the shower [noise]\nThat's where our review plumbing comes in we know water heaters and we'll give you the right system exactly\nWhat you need to start the day off rights or wash off along with a refreshing shower ... water problems gets you read in the face you have already the plumbing a call today seven seven to Ninety to Ninety six that's seven seven to Ninety to Ninety six or you can always find this on line it's already the plumbing in ... dot com\nThe docket quantity Kate you in a\n[noise]\nLike like I said that you do for radio than what high definition will ever do for television is though my limited Joe\nStand on my iPhone that that show we were just talking about a horrible horrible threats to religious liberty\nOr in the name or sometimes of religion and by the way I Do think militant uncompromising secularism has become something of religion in the United states we're talking about Saudi Arabia\nTurkey hockey's done well how about the catered Georgia there's a case in Decatur, Georgia that is just unbelievable as an assault not only on religious faith but on the common sense\nAnd it's one of those cases that I think should convince you about why you have to get involved the alliance defending freedom\nBecause they're standing up for people who are victimized by this kind of insanity and one of the people who is doing the most to stand up to this kind of insanity is our guest his name is Matt Sharp he is a senior counsel for the ATF the alliance defending freedom\nA man thanks very much for joining us thank you for having me okay we've played tape before on this show of ... Thomas maybe you can explain who she is and what happened\nTo her five year old daughter back a less than a year ago in two thousand Seventeen go ahead\nThan a year ago in two thousand Seventeen go ahead\nI'm Sorry so cautious daughter\nOr is it a school that had with little notice the parents adopted a transgender bathroom policy with essentially said boys if they identify as a girl\nCan use the girl facilities can use the girls restroom showers et cetera um and so what ultimately happened is one day posh his daughter in the hour we're going by our national to protect her privacy something the school didn't do here\nWas excuse to go to the restroom I and a boy in her class that identifies as ginger fluid was also excused and ... daughter was using the restroom devoid came in\nAgain allowed under this policy and sexually assaulted posh his daughter a ... hour that evening I learned about her daughter telling her what happened\nAnd was shocked as any parent would be to hear that this happened to her daughter and she talks to the school officials and finds out that this happened because the schools transgender policy specifically allowed this boy to use the girls facilities\nOkay is there a is their policy is the schools just basically any restroom you want to go to that it is it's fairly fairly easy for a boy to go into the girls restroom\nThat's right and all it takes is for a student to assert that their gender fluid or identify as the opposite gender and they are allowed by the school to use these facilities a play on sports teams whatever they want to that embraces that gender identity that's different than their biological\nSay okay I assumed that when you say that the little girl's five years old was molested she was touched was more than just a her feeling uncomfortable\nThat's exactly right that this was a um touching in a private area I won't go into a lot of the ... hills but um and it's something\nThat we would all the above I of course with the pollen anybody who has children or grandchildren is going to be appalled by the so so what happened Pasha went to the school authorities are looking obviously for some justice and probably looking to correct this policy what the school authorities say the word\nYet no justice was given you would think the school with the very least would reconsider this policy um they refused to do so you would think that school might at least say well let's\nTransfer the boy to another classroom because remember they share the same classroom the school refused to do that as well so Pasca was left with no choice but to do with any parent would do take her doubt daughter away from the harmful situation and that's when she reached out to us and and we've been involved in in helping or seek the justice at the school district refused to offer her daughter\nOkay now let me make clear we're not talking about Portland, Oregon or Bennington, Vermont vicious Decatur, Georgia wouldn't you think that there would be more upholding of a a traditional commonsense values\nThat you would think so schools everywhere have a constitutional duty to protect the privacy and safety of their students and it's just common sense that girls going to girls restrooms voice go into a boys and if you've got a student that's struggling with issues you can accommodate that you can allow him to use a\nTeacher's restroom a single use their facility but you never allow them into facilities of the opposite sex and this demonstrates why but this common sense even in places like Georgia is being thrown out the window because of this gender identity ideology being forced on our school kids\nOkay and so Pasha Thomas who by the way as African American not that it matters but uh and it's usually you things that people on the left would have sympathy for an African American mother who is doing a beautiful job trying to raise their children\nUm what what happens next here ... alliance defending freedom you've taken this to the education department is that right\nThat's exactly right so ah the school district was relying on a an old guidance issued under the Obama department of education\nThat has since been rescinded and we brought this to the attention of the department of education and they have now launched an investigation there were encouraged by that we're glad to see the federal government taking this seriously looking into whether the school district has violated federal law as a result of this dangerous transgender bathroom policy\nOkay it's so a ... in the best case scenario or what happens next what happens to address the concerns of this brave mother indicator Georgia\nI think first we're hoping the department finds that the school was violated federal law and hold them accountable for that and to the school has to revoke this policy this is not working and it's causing harm like what happened to\n... daughter there are better solutions but the common sense solution should be never allow a boy into the girls restrooms or vice versa those are supposed to be private intimate places that are reserved for students that designated sex they're better solution than what the ... the cater school district did hear\nOkay I'm speaking to match they matched sharp who is a senior counsel for the alliance defending freedom\nAnd he's one of those terrific attorneys that I've told you about who um I give heart and soul to this cause now not everybody is in a position to give heart and soul and legal skill to this cause but everybody's in a position to give a donation\nAnd it's really important because right now\nEven with a much more sympathetic administration in Washington DC\nOr religious liberty is still under assault and it's under a song um by

the Baker jak Philips to defending pregnancy care centers and most recently cheap Cochran also in Atlanta getting a one point two million dollar settlement after he was fired by the city of Atlanta

some corrections I've I'll give you an example a lot of people may not know this but I've actually seen the original form of fantasia\nAnd fantasia for those who don't know it's a movie made by the Disney people in ... was very personally involved because he loved classical music and he loved his film\nAnd this film took great classical pieces of the boss prelude and few can D minor and they drove in the rite of spring and Beethoven's passed around symphony\nAnd it created sort of cartoon animated uh bringing the film bringing music to light and it's quite interesting\nIn the past around symphony section or they went to ancient Greece and they are dealing with guns and goddesses and him since ... centers are Half Men half wars\nAnd they had one really offensive little scent or\nWho was black in it and was ... ... and I honestly I'm not making this up this was in the original movie and it's a time I guess it was considered funny but it's profoundly offensive and racist and you'll pardon me I'm not endorsing it I think they did the right thing to take it out of the film\nBut they had this little black scent or shining the laws of the of the other centers and it it detracted from the movie and it was horrible and they changed it\nBut I I don't believe the kissing\nAnd by the way when I was mentioning cure a nightly criticizing the Little Mermaid was ... a cure and I lose that she was on the Ellen DeGeneres show and you'll never guess what she said her favorite Disney film was\nOn Allen's show\nOn Allen's show can you guess Greg\nDory of course because Elon histories use the voice of dory\nSo um she said a\nChair and I didn't like Cinderella that's banned in her home she says she has a three year old daughter\nShe says um because you know Cinderella weights around for a rich guy to rescue her don't rescue yourself obviously\nAnd she added this is the one I'm quite annoyed about because I really liked the film but Little Mermaid I mean the songs are great but do not give up your voice for a man hello\nUh okay I I agree there are some and I've written about this I mean I think that that part of what I found problematic and live a Little Mermaid which is a wonderful film\nWas a the idea of the kids know best which is a very regular theme and a lot of films for children that parents are daughter and foolish and ridiculous when should be taken for granted but okay ... kids can still love the movie\nAnd I don't think we should have a problem with it nor do I think that suggesting that people might take names that can be comfortably written now that don't have to be spelled and sounded down\n... one of the things about the name id that is I before I knew how to read and write and almost three\nI had learned what's your name is Michael method that and what's that Medford no Michael Melville no it's Medvedev me DVD and you learn when you're a little kid and you have a name that to a little bit more difficult\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nUm meanwhile they're a\nVery it's continued discussion about Elizabeth Warren\nBut that hasn't touched on the Disney movie Pocahontas we can get to that let me go to Tim in Pasadena Tim you're on the ...\nWith Michael up or they could come pick Michael are\nIf you if you don't like probably telling people to go out and get people and get a base in a restaurant\nWhich I think directly led to the shooting of that guy at the baseball field if you don't think that's evil and the question that said that is an evil\nOkay well you know as a Tim you're totally distorting things obviously the shooting at the at the baseball field was evil a Maxine Waters made that comment about getting in people's faces months after that happened and after the I should add that\nPhilosophy all along anyway I don't I don't have a liberal for years okay just having admitted it took like OK Germany cowardly to admit it you don't cut me off on this\nI have a lot to say that little girl in the bathroom you don't think about what happened that little girl now that that comes from politicians politicians are going to be able to do that now you know God's now\nYou know God's Nell as evil but does now is a killer and and he actually went to prison for being a killer look or Tim the the idea of equating one thing and another\nIs is simply wrong and I I Do believe that one of the terrible things have politicians do sometimes they don't take evil seriously enough and I think that's true with our whole criminal justice system we had here in the state of Washington\nA a terrible Supreme Court decision where the Washington state Supreme Court\nAh basically said that uh they couldn't give life imprisonment to people who had committed murder before the age of Eighteen no it's the life imprisonment that's the more reason they not only struck down the death penalty for people who are convicted of murders as adults\nBut for people convicted of murder as adults who are convicted for crimes committed before they're Eighteen you can't give life imprisonment anymore\nNow that is a a manner of coddling evil and then you hear some of the stories of this\nThen I think it's profoundly wrong\nBut see we we lose the battle to him if we lose the language\nAnd evil loses all of its meaning if you're talking about silly stupid are irresponsible Maxine Waters and equating her with a these people in Pakistan who were literally committing murder\nAnd wanting to execute a woman\nBecause she said that uh Jesus died for the sins of humanity and the profit didn't I'm OK you could argue with her and that's fine but the idea of putting someone in jail and are threatening to execute her and then murdering politicians want to defend her\nThat it seems to me is a very different manner\nAnd this is also one of the problems that the people had an and there were people of this nature a stolen was evil Hitler was evil so why is it that we sent\nMillions of dollars billions of dollars worth of equipment and support and supplies to Scotland so that he could beat Hitler answer because it was necessary for saving the world\nAnd uh there was one danger that was more immediate at the time that that happened a meanwhile uh there is a a new TV show that tries to focus on God and social media [noise]\nDidn't know you could find on on

film one of the most successful films in terms of a return on investment it was a low budget horror film came out in\nNineteen Seventy eight it was called Halloween and that was a debut film for Jamie Lee Curtis\nA she played a teenage babysitter who together with other teenage babysitters is managed by a an evil mysterious psycho\nHe's supposed to be Twenty one at the time of the first film forty years ago named Michael Meyers and there's all kinds of stuff in movie history disconnected with the first Halloween\nAnd we will get to that with its fanfare from highly aware\nAnd yes Holly weird it is pretty weird that a film like this in today's dollars made about two hundred and fifty million dollars\nA and cause they estimate maybe two million dollars to make at the time\nSo that film the original Halloween was called a minimalist classic well now John Carpenter the director producer writer and film composer that first film is back\nWith this sequel is not the first sequels following it's not the second sequel following\n... of all the way this is the tens sequel there've been eleven and these movies\nBut you know what this is the best ones in the original I was just clearly is it's it's it's really a shockingly good film why well basically what the film sets up the original film is a fright\nTension psychological tension there some\nEvil evil psycho\nWears a mask and implant cuddly and inexplicably he's going after people one of those people is played by a Jamie Lee Curtis she's playing Laurie Strode but now she's a grandmother but determined not to let\nShe's a

time it is not safe to be on the street tonight\nIs a killer that he will be killed tonight happy Halloween Michael\nOkay happy Halloween to everybody by the way there's no ... or ... there is an implication in this film that Michael could be the Boogie Man but basically he uh he has a psycho with a back story in the back stories alluded to here also which is that he murdered his sister and the first film\nWhen he was six years old so it was a troubled guy um look if you like this kind of movie at all\nThis is a terrifically well done what's interesting is John ... is one of the producers but the real guiding force is a younger director named David Gordon Green has directed bunch of independent films and the pineapple express with Seth Rogen\nBut nothing preparing you for the expertise of this one one of the things that is really astonishing about the film when you think about it is it's incredibly creepy is very disturbing is the kind of film my wife would hate every minute of\nBut it does what the best horror films do is get you to forget about your own troubles whatever they may be I mean if you're thinking about politics from Albany are annoyed about uh the Senate race or the governor's race in California plenty of be annoyed about there\nAre at all of a sudden now you're thinking about wait a minute what's lurking behind that door that's been left a jar\nBut the brilliance of the film is it is minimalist filmmaking this is not a body count movie there aren't that many people who get murdered and you don't see blood gushing forth with big ... blood\nIt's subtle one of the most disturbing images in the film at one point you don't know what's happened to a character and then you see someone dropping a bunch of removed bloody teeth on the floor and you can hear them rattling on the floor\nIt's scary it's disturbing it's rated R A N Jamie Lee Curtis has outstanding she plays a grandmother or ... oh yeah Kyle Smith over a National Review\nSees this as a right wing movie because it's about certainly has about gun rights I mean this is part of what the film is about\nEnds about defending yourself and about how foolish it is to believe that the world is all full of sweetness and light and everyone is well intentioned\nThere's also by the way of very surprising twist at the end involving one of the main characters and I won't even hint at it because the surprise when it comes to shocking to give away three stars for Halloween\nUp by the way it it basically clears away all those other inferior sequels in the middle",
