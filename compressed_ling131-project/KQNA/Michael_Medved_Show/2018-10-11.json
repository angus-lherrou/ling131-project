earth where if you want to understand where Donald Trump comes from why it is he is touched such a wrong nerve in American politics\nAnd there are so many people haven't been involved in politics before who say they are enthusiastic about President Trump's he speaks to them he speaks for them [noise]\nThere's a fascinating perspective that is very much worth considering and it's from Ralph Nader\nA Ralph Nader is not someone on the right\nHe is somebody who has run as a green candidate party candidate for president of the United states he uh did very well for a third party candidate in two thousand and in fact there are a lot of people in the left to blame him for making George W. Bush President but in his new book\nIt's called to the ramp parts\nThe subtitle is how Bush and Obama pave the way for the Trump presidency and why it isn't too late to reverse course a Ralph Nader has very harsh things to say about President Bush and about President Obama and about\nAnd about President Obama and about President Clinton and al ... personal things are coming on the show we always enjoy having you walk but I you you are a much more than from kind of the ultimate outsider politically\nI you don't you're not a big sport as Trump of Bush and Obama or Clinton or who do you like in presidential politics recently\nWell I mean I took Bernie Sanders did very well are raising money from small contributors in two thousand sixteen she doesnt return my calls for Twenty one years but [laughter] he's done very well\nAnd the only way did you voted for him but it's important in\nWall Street by Senator Warren Wall Street is out of control\nA say so he was Senator Warren Bernie Sanders did you did you support Bernie Sanders last time\nI don't say who I support I just go on the record so if he does good things of other politicians do good things are bad things that I just comment on\nYou acknowledge that are there are some things and you you do in your book surprisingly that there are some things that President Trump is addressed a where you think he's on the right track\nWell it does but he doesn't deliver for example we need a big public infrastructure investment in this country he made a big deal that jobs jobs jobs repairing schools so words drinking water systems public transit roads bridges on that\nHe took the trade issue away from the Democrats and Republicans isn't that interesting\nBoth Democrats and Republicans that didn't pay attention to all those hallowed communities all those unemployed blue collar workers\nOr with the industry shipped to China and Mexico and he grabbed it from him and he got a lot of votes as a result but is that him or is that the fall of the Democrats and Republicans\nDo you ah have you looked over the new replacement for NASA and the new deal because I knew you were a big critic of NAFTA\nYeah you know until my son\nIn final form Michael to the Congress\nWe're only getting bits and pieces we like to have the whole formal a proposed agreement but it looks like it was twenty to rather than reforms in other words a little bit here a small amount of dairy products going over the Canadian border the Mexicans got a little bit the U.S got\nCheck out the calendar romantic ... dot net are called seven ten and two thirty three thirty seven for more information costs to add to the ... center pets galley celebrating thirty five years of excellence and community service where there's always something going on ... center [noise]\nMovies have thrown with your cage you a nation a minute you know showing it harkens fourteen in Prescott valley a star is born the\nFifth version and the best coverage showbiz couple one career shores the other crashes with director and co writer Bradley Cooper as a country rock\nGod who discovers a shy ugly duckling singing waitress at a drag bar and provides her her big break and romance sheet shores Hi from is sinking shadow yes Cooper can sing Lady Gaga can act\nSongs are great most recorded live actual concert teams were shots guide coach ... staged coach the chemistry leaks off the screen for Oscar nominations for for the thrilling star is born that she were Jay Chou a nation minutes\nUN age and I'm In a movie review has been brought to you by the cops are senior center\nWhere ...\nAnd all of Michael Mann that show are joined by Ralph Nader he is the author of a new book or that has enough and into a fan just about anybody or it is called to the rampart how Bush and Obama paved the way for the Trump presidency and why it isn't too late to reverse course\nI'm first before we get to this issue of the electoral college Ralph Nader\nNow you're very harsh to President Obama and President Clinton both of whom are heroes to a lot of people on the left uh what was the biggest failing you found in the Obama administration what do you have most against it\nAnd it's called empire George W. Bush is our drone attacks special forces in international law federal starches\nYou topple delivery Enron which granted incredible after this African countries on salaries war you overrode secretary of Defense Gates who was your topic or do you start to play ball with western countries contracts company\nAnd then you're ever tribal society you're gonna get a war [noise] and that's what happened\nAnd of course in front of Afghanistan the way you want it to the bone at the time but ... ... ...\nAnd he brought to the military budget put any and I think back in repairing America back home which he promised to do with all these politicians you know they talk a good game Clinton\nTalked to a good game a button set the stage for the horrible personal behavior mismanaged for Trump versus women or he got away with Clinton and so you know Trump is watching as he's watching always watching what these presidents are getting away with\nAnd he's an expert and getting away with everything and he said hey I can run for president and win\nOkay what uh what about uh you you basically charging the book that you think that both Obama and Clinton not to mention President Bush and President Trump or in the pocket of Wall Street\nWould that be saying it too harshly\nHuh yeah well ... wants to get more money to President Obama in two thousand eight than any Republican candidate has ever seen\nRight they gave them a lot more to Obama than to Mitt Romney or or or to John McCain yeah yeah so\nThe Democrats soft on Wall street they talked to a good game but\nYou know nobody wants to jail for two thousand two thousand nine I mean is it ten years earlier in the savings and loan Twenty years earlier that hundred businesspeople were prosecuted and convicted and sent to jail so you can see where the trend is you know I'd give people hope\nBecause in paying twenty five to forty eight oh Michael\nI have the summons of the citizenry bringing the centers and represent back to the citizens on town meeting where the citizens own agenda and the public on her tour him like a school auditorium\nAnd I write it all out in this book to ramp parts and I don't care if you're a liberal or conservative when you're working and living and renting out family back home you're on a lot of the same thing you want health care and you want clean air clean water you want decent school do you want decent public facilities\nYou want for the uh properly liable and that's where you can get\nMonth if you vote your conscience number on your party you vote your believes for better or America as it relates to you know we're getting we're working ranch your family regardless ... conservative or liberal a label\nOkay ... you are also a big advocate for abolishing the electoral college of the reason that will never happen and you know this is because you need the approval of three quarters of the state legislatures\nRight now we have sixteen states in the country that has five electoral votes or less\nThose are states that will never ever be visited um if a if you make it a population only the popular vote only so where are you going to get states like Idaho on the one hand or Hawaii on the other hand\nTo vote from limiting their own influencing their own safety though and electing a president\nCan educate Michael ...\nIt's not a constitutional amendment you're right it's a constant reminder about electric cars\nBut under the constitution the states have the authority to set the rules of the election and what's going on now is what's called national popular vote dot com\nResigning by a businessman steam Silverstein the San Francisco he hired a few years ago six full time lobbyist who went out around the country\nAnd they've already gotten California\nUh Maryland kinetic bark know Illinois or an interstate compact and he's up to a hundred and Seventy two electoral votes ... the guts to two hundred and Seventy\nThen for all of the electoral college votes to whoever wins the national popular vote as a presidential candidate\nAnd it up to a hundred and Seventy two now and then from Democrats who've lost two presidential elections two thousand two thousand sixteen were they won the popular vote or and Clinton and lost the electoral college vote or not even support in\nWell I I I understand what people are talking about here with the electoral compact and I am aware of it but part of what that means is that the or is it states the various states who signed onto it or would be pledged\nTo actually get ... electoral votes in their states to not to the person who wins the popular vote in the state but the person who wins the national popular vote so suddenly make the electoral college would still exist I guess but it will become irrelevant\nWhich still exists better being event neutralized\nOkay I Do you know I I Do think there are people who are already preparing legal challenges to that compact idea plus right now all the states you mentioned are very very blue stage very liberal state do you see any support for this compact idea from some of the more conservative states\nYou know the next time the Republicans won the popular vote for president and lose the electoral college vote then you got the rest of the states in a landslide\nBy the way you know that's never happened the only popular vote losers who has ever been elected I'm actually are a Republican or in the end up in\nTwo thousand and poor because I carry it got sixteen thousand more boats in order to carry Ohio and won the electoral college battle or even know it got more votes popularly\nSounds true that's what it was a danger I I like the idea Ralph and I've talked about on the air before of everybody going to the Nebraska main system that you break it down by congressional district but in order to do that you would have to really make a nonpartisan not gerrymandered\nApportion men of congressional districts what do you think about that deals I entered\nA step forward it doesn't go as far as the national popular vote dot com yeah that is a step forward I mean it's ridiculous when you come in second in the popular vote in America and you're losing ... ... and you're winning the presidency ... what country does\nOkay well our our country does and it's actually historically it's worked out a okay I mean in President Hayes was into disaster some of his name President Bush wasn't a disaster\nAnd are certainly hope that President Trump will continue to enjoy some of the success he's enjoyed so far\nRalph Nader has enjoyed grade Sixth Sense with his literary legal and even some political endeavors his new book is called to the rampart how Bush and Obama paved the way for the Trump presidency and why it's too late to reverse course\nWe're going to not reverse course but change course the Supreme Court in one state just declared that all of the people\nWho are on death row cannot be executed why not we'll get to that with

not true\nNow let me let me go over some of the people who are on death row in the state of Washington and all of these people have been given quite literally a new lease on life\nBy the nine justices of the Washington state Supreme Court\nThey are virtually all ultra liberal and that should not be a decision that is made by the court if the legislature wants to eliminate the death penalty then

expression of ourselves can look like and how we can be the most of ourselves and not the least about I think so many of us think that we have to change in order to him again and really what's required in order to find our path to tap into a deep sense of self fully\nFund in order to do that we need ourself\nYou talk about the real life stories from inspirational women who have been there and succeeded to tell us about peer review Lardy\nSays oh Pierre a she's a cheap creative director refinery and twenty nine which is a very big\nMedia sites are specifically for women and she is somebody that the first time I heard her speaks she was talking about how she feels lost\nAll of the time and you know one of the key takeaway is from her and just knowing that we all have this and our critic and our had given us a really hard time about you know we should be farther along by now or why\nYou know why haven't we got and there are when are we ever going to get there and just knowing that you know we can hear the voices without actually believe in um\nIn your book you talk about accomplishing three big milestones the first one is ditch what does it mean\nAbout dropping the mindset are keeping up feeling loss and you know I gave one example of that just in terms of\nLeaving that we need to change in order to again but another really big one is believing that we have to have the destination completely figure it out before we start and so it's really letting go of that idea that we have to have the big picture all sorted or that we have to have [laughter]\nYou know X Y and Z in order to be successful and really did change all of that and being willing to just get in shape and which is going to help create a sense of self fully if it's it's not the opposite\nAnd the curry is the second to the three big milestones describe that for us\nWe are creating is the small stuff so it's up in ourselves you know what are all of the things that like me up what are all the things that gives me energy\nAnd then what is the absolute smallest thing that I can do about that ... to ... again and creating is about creating this stopped about beginning about who we mean around us in order to do that\nIn your third a milestone news Ron ...\nSays the ascension it's about what happens when we are getting into action and you know I think a lot of I think that when we start to figure out our path that's going to be rainbows and sunshine and it's not always like that you know women have\nStretch marks when they expand humans have growing pains when they expand and so there are some arts in some comfort that comes with getting on to our path but it's about re framing and knowing that we're not our feelings that just because we have", "show_name": "Michael Medved
