Saturday morning to him which was the show\nOn the talk of the quad cities geeky winning\nWelcome back is Shapiro show every week here on the program for your educational education we go through the federalist papers you know what the founders were thinking let's get into it were all at the federal is forty seven written by the by James Madison and this one is really fascinating because it talks about the original concept of deprivation of powers\nMadison says the charity is a failure of the separation of powers has quote\nThe accumulation of all powers legislative executive in judiciary and the same hand when there are one of your money and whether hereditary self appointed her life to make jokes we mean pronounce the very definition of charity in other words if you have a branch that had ever dated to itself into power executive power and legislative power that would be a tyranny\nAnd he said that if the constitution were really charge but what the humiliation of that sort of power but no further arguments will be necessary to inspire a universal representation of the system\nYou know say within their part wedding decorative Doug legislative stuff in part for the legislative and executive stuff inside toward the judiciary does legislative stuff but\nIf they\nIrrigate extended and exclusive power one of the other branches that a charity called monster skew in front of a lot from skip\nWho was the progenitor of this idea of checks and balances meaning and nowhere in Port and still more conclusively as illustrated by the example and die an amount to know more than that\nThat where the whole POWER UP one department is exercise by the same hand which for the whole power of another department the fundamental principle of a free constitution are some bird it would've been the case in the constitution and down and by him if the king would they told executive magistrate and also the complete legislative power or Japan administration of Dr\nMartin askew objected to the merger on the executive and legislative to here is a quote from August ... when the legislative and executive powers are United in the same person or body that can be no liberty because the apprehension may arise let the same on our Senate and an ... a lot to execute them in the tyrannical manner\nAnd one of the power of judging joined with the legislative the life liberty and the subject would it be exposed to arbitrary control\nFor the judge would then be the legislator or join the executive power and the judge might behave with all the violence pressure\nSo the argument right now in the United states is whether this is what actually happened with the executive branch the executive branch basically legislation not basically they do the regulatory power the executive branch is legislative power now you can argue that's not the whole legislative power in Congress can hope that\nCongress has failed to Trump that he actually would like to see check and balance again Congress has to take back some of that power how are they is doing some of that under President Trump they were involved in in a legislative move where they basically were knocking down regulations that are pretty rapid rate\nThat good unnecessary executive power has also gained judiciary power\nGiven this rate of agencies with their own hearing board this is one of the reasons why there's been a lot of focus on a case called Chevron Chevron is a Supreme Court case in which the Supreme Court suggested\nThe judiciary has to grant administrative deference to administrative agency the other case in front of the EPA go to the a P board BPA administrative born gives you a judicial decision the question is whether the judiciary confirm that decision ... in many cases no\nThat's what I should have around his wrong it's justice Gorsuch has opposed Siobhan\nIt's why the Kavanaugh opposes Chevron Chevron should be struck down jobs for these checks and balances to be restored\nIrrigation of too much power in one branch is the essence of charity that remains true today as well in the constitution was written so if you feel like everybody is taking crazy though that because they are so I'm about to play for the worst add in political history\nThis thing is hot garbage minutes is an ad that is currently making its way across the ways in Arkansas and it's targeted at black voters the editor on behalf of congressmen French ill\nFrom this kind of an unnamed group it so bad it's great to hear the ad for a congressman from black Americans for the president's agenda\nHusbands fathers one white girl on girl why Democrats want me to mention black folk again turnout always told mattress don't mess around with that if you get caught she will crime rate\nI'm voting to keep college my French and the Republicans because we have to protect me envoys we can't afford to the white Democrats take back the bad old days raised verdict life sentences and\nUnless you want to white girls screens right\nOkay well in the French show to his credit and to hit a necessity came out that data bad I have nothing to do with that at the salad stopped there we think are pretty spectacular ads in this last election campaign and we had the guy was doing cocaine Mitch which was just amazing this top cocaine mentioning about rather than cocaine ... coming\nDo you think is natural to you because you're talking that won't lend hearing is obviously you guys tremendous initiative from a very young age mean the gene and be for a place where nobody goes in the military and he's joined the military takes a lot of such as my folks who say that sell ... ... do you think it really is the leadership is its borders of bread\nYou know I did ask his question all the time and so it's both it absolutely both ... and you as a human being\nAre going to get certain characteristics that are gonna make you a good leader and you're going to lack some characteristics that would make you a good leader if you add them you don't get tens across the board you know it's like the\nLittle video games you see kids play where you get a a nine and strength Senate seven an intellect and a and an eight and dexterity and you get to as a leader and you don't get all tense show some leadership\nCharacteristic that make a good leader for instance obviously it's going to be articulate if you can express your message clearly to people that's going to help you from a leadership perspective if you have some natural charisma that's going to help you from a leadership perspective if you can look at complex problems and you can simplify them\nThat's gonna be helpful as a leader because that's what you're doing so they get prescriptive is all kinds of things that will help me as a leader and you're not going to be good at all and so\nAs a leader if you look at the ones that you we got you can improve um that's that's what's beneficial so you can't take someone that's just a horrible leader and make them into an amazingly or you can take 'em out to a decent leader in the you can make them into a very good or even an exceptional leader because\nHow you know you can definitely get more articulate you can definitely get more comfortable speaking to people you can definitely get more more\nPrecise at taking very complex problems and simple buying them so that your team can understand what it is it needs to get done and these are all things that you can improve upon and I always have to close this out by saying that there are some people that can become better leaders and the people that cannot become better leaders are the people\nThat can put their ego in check they lack humility and of those people they think they're doing everything great so they're not going to improve his leaders you can't go Jim you can't convince them they think they're perfect then they're going to stay where they are from a leadership perspective\nSo what what are you actually learn from the first time you went through seal training and he joined the military and you decide to go to the hardest when everybody widely across America not the hardest training program America what is that like\nThe myths about seal training that part of seal training\nIs that you learn anything at all [laughter] 'cause you actually don't it's it's I mean you can you learn some things but at the screening process what they're trying to do is get rid of people that don't want to really really\nReally do that job so it's it's a free you're going to be doing you're gonna be ... you're going to call you're going to be tired of going to be that for extended periods of time and there was an eighty percent attrition rate\nBut when you make it through you know you get to see what team and when you get to ... that's when you start to actually learn about being a seal that's when you learn the tactics\nAnd the leadership perspective that's when that's when you start to become an actual feel hitting the basic skills training you know when you show up at a SEAL Team\nEveryone looks at you you you you come out of their thinking you like you just don't know I just went through the toughest training in the world you could name I literally checked in with a master chief and he said everyone here has been through that training no one cares [laughter] you know very humbling when you show up and that's when you start to learn start to learn when you're getting a sequel to\nAnd when it comes to you know getting into the field and how do you determine leadership position even among people who you're initially equals what do you think that sort of naturally falls out\nOr there was a rank structure inside the military doesn't rank structure inside the single teams and you're going to be aware you for you when you're a new guy you're going to be a junior guy and then the next day when you're going to be a little bit more scene you'll have a couple of guys working for you\nThe the platoon chief is going to be you know the senior guy enlisted guy in inside of a ... and they don't have an officer in charge of the whole thing and those are pre designated as a pre made which was very\nCounter to my initial thought when when I joined the navy my dad told me I was going to hate it because I said why do you think about it and he says because you don't like to listen to anybody and go like authorities and of course I told him no doubt it's just it's a team\nWe don't have to when I was listening anybody's a team and I was completely wrong because there was a rank structure and you absolutely you know there was a ... it's the military even though it's a team and you definitely have you built relationships throughout that chain of command and that is more prominent than in some other groups but you still there is a chain of command and you're gonna you're gonna fall that chain of command\nAnd a lot of talk about then how to do the mandatory national service and so many has gone through this program and I think so many guys who are military and some of them I knew you know back when they were in high school and we're\nKind of you know I I Can't say the words I ever they were kind of messed up high end and then they come out the other end and their salads and and not only the really making something of themselves what do you think of the idea that mandatory national sort of\nI Love the idea of it but at the same time as an American I don't like the idea of mandating that people do something that they don't want to do and I and I think the volunteer military that we have right now is\nIt it might be the best in the history of world we have a great military and I think to mandate it I think it's problematic that being said every single person that I talk to kids that are the age of you know Thirteen fourteen Fifteen if you get the opportunity to join the military\nThan I Would definitely recommend it because like you said it it it teaches you a lot of things\nWhen it comes to you know the application of leadership principles how much of what you learn and leadership training at the seals was applicable and how much I that was your ... and now you gotta you gotta move he had to figure something out how much of a CDO pants kind of stuff\nWell when I came in we really didn't and it's a shocking we really didn't have\nIt came in we really didn't and it's a shocking when you really didn't have a a a process of leadership training that the leaders went there and we would basically the leaders would learn\nOJT on the job training you'd watch the person that was leading you and then what is your time to take over you kind of emulate what they were doing and if you had a great leader that worked okay she had a bad leader\nThat was a real problem and so when I came back from that deployment to Ramadi that's one of the things I focused on that I realized that we really needed to implement leadership training for the guys because you're on the battlefield leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield and if you don't know what you're doing you're going to get people killed without question\nAnd we'll all that sort of they can't give me a couple of stories sort of demonstrate that point I mean what what the high points of leadership that you've seen on the battlefield as opposed to a low point you've seen in terms of leadership\nFor one thing that's important to clarify here's what I thought about leadership I'm not just talking about me 'cause I was in charge of the task unit or the ultimate American chart upbringing or even the people above me I'm Talking about every level of leadership every person taking ownership of therapies and the mission and executing\nExecuting with a forty and executing with with a passion about what they're doing\nAnd so you got to have leadership at every level and when you don't have that\nIt it's very problematic so what was great for me when I came back and I took over the training for the west coast okay I got to see\nWe we put on the most realistic combat training extremely stressful very realistic and I would get to see a bill to go through the training and then the next night it'd be another between going through the same scenario and then that could be another book and going through the same scenario so I got it was it was basically the most incredible leadership laboratory\nIt might be the most incredible leadership laboratory that's ever existed it wouldn't back awesome to be able to to be able to put these these summits in training and that was where it became very clear that leadership if you're in a good leader and is there\nThat she would do a good job\nAnd by the way that leader didn't need to be the senior guy it could've been a guy that was two or three wrong down but when things started happening you step up and take command and make things happen I mean as long as the other leaders maybe that was senior to them\nAnd the wherewithal to say you know what this guy seems to have a grip on the situation I'm gonna let 'em roam with it then it would be OK occasion you get an egotistical leader that would be like oh you're stepping on my toes and they try and put him down and that will be problematic but you'd see a good solid leader\nAnywhere and that would make those tunes perform great and if you had a bad we're in a field soon you'd watch the whole soon follow power apart if no one stepped up and took charge and made things happen and it's when it's very evident and that's another thing that just solidified the principle that we\nTo fame that same principle that we teach the businesses are are literally the exact same principle that we wrote about extreme ownership are the same principle that we talk to young single leaders coming up\nOkay so now jak let's get down to some of the main lesson leadership so what's the number one thing\nYou look for in a leader well the first book was called extreme ownership and what that means is you're not going to make any chooses you're not going to blame anyone else you're going to take ownership\nOf whatever happened and when something goes wrong that are pointing fingers and blaming someone else take ownership of that problem\nYou're gonna take ownership of figuring out what the solution to that problem is you're going to take ownership of implementing that solution so that is the number one thing that I'm looking for for a leader to do is to take ownership of the problems and again we call that extreme ownership and it was one of those things that was very easy to see in a field too because\nWhen someone doesn't take ownership and starts pointing fingers and blaming\nWell like for instance right now if I started when my finger and blaming you for something which are natural reaction going to\nBe a defense is bad I mean it's not my fault it's broadcast knew what I wanted to be a guy who\nCould actually and then what happens is we have a team where you're going on when your finger you your point a finger someone else and now we have no one taking on a ship but problems\nAnd therefore the problem with never gets all the opposite of that is when you have a good leader to step up and said hey man you know what this broadcast and go the way I wanted to I should have done a better job preparing to for your question I'm Sorry I Apologize and now instead of you getting defensive you say you know what no actually I could've done a better job and now both of us are taking ownership of the problems and we're going to get him salt so that's\nKind of a number one characteristic of someone that has\nThe humility earth when something goes wrong and you're a leader and you say oh you know what all it was bad situation it's my fault I'll take ownership of it you have to be home all in order to do that\nWe're to talk of Guam through these eleven thirty and keeps you in a
