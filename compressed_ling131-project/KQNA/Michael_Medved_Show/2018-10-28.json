written for that is because Democrats get everything there is a lot of times on the right to claim that this is all Republican no hell and suddenly Republicans are good at saying\nWhat what's really happening here isn't any democratic math is often Democrats are garbage and everything basically when president from in the second thing in the new enemy very good thing for Republicans when he is the first thing in the news it's a problem the only Democrat spend weeks demonstrating they don't care about due process and that they will railroaded I simply for political reasons\nThey're good for public and when the lead headline is the winning twenty twenty contender for the Democrats\nSetting herself on fire over a DNA sample that's a really good for Republican on the lead headline is Democrats approaching Ted Cruz in a restaurant and screaming at him and his life very good for a public and the best friend Republicans right now\nIn the in Canada and the Democrats and you are seeing that full scale in ... also out anything you can get back of a very good economy on the Republican the market and buy which voters cross Republicans over Democrats on the economy has never been larger in the history of the holy really like our last Seventeen and the polish amazing also\nI don't want to get milk credit to President Trump President Trump has done it\nI don't want to give credit to President Trump President Trump has done a couple of very good thing number one he has taken proper economic measures that have really benefited the average American\nAnd number two the president of the United states does make it feel like he has a change after\nAnd usually in midterm elections there is an attempt to vote for change right now what the whole show is that Republicans are actually seen as a party of change well being the party in power that's really unusual usually the party out of power is seen as a party of chain but because Trump is so out of left field and so outrageous and so chaotic\nThe benefit of that is that he feels like a change agent even though he is the guy who's sitting in the seat\nThat is very good for Republicans here is what the latest polls show according to the wall Street Journal motor interest in the midterm elections has surged to record within both parties helping to drive a President Trump's approval rating while maintaining the Democrats lead as a party most preferred to leave Congress according to a new Wall Street journal NBC News news pull me findings point to an energized electorate\nBuffet in by dynamics to bring great uncertainty the outcome of an election just two weeks away\nAnd what the polls kind of show is that everything is narrowing nearly two thirds of registered voters Troy high level of interest in the election that has the highest ever recorded in a midterm election since the journal NBC poll began asking the question in two thousand six\nAnd now the reason for that is because largely Democrats than I Do cross we're always going to be energized to vote against President Trump but now Republicans are really mobilized to vote against the Democrat I Know that my interest in voting peaked significantly\nThanks to the Democrats behavior during the Brett Kavanaugh saw that and I know that most other Republicans\nFeel the same ones large gap between\nRepublican voters and Democrats voters interest in the election has now been closed sixty eight percent of Republican voters in Seventy two percent of Democrats say they are very interested in the election\nThat have the highest recorded for either party by the survey in a midterm election also President Trump's from job approval rating has jumped to forty seven percent according to the wall Street Journal and and bikinis pool at at the highest mark he had ever had an office in that poll he's now higher than President Obama the average pull approval rating before the two thousands had elections now\nIs worth noting that President Obama got skunk and the two thousands in elections but with that said President Trump has gained significant approval only forty nine percent disapprove and so that's about as close to parity as Trump is ever going to get he's never going to be a fifty five percent president he's just too polarizing figure\n\nMy name is ... and James I've been a stalking option street or for twenty three years I used to be an active swing

their answer many different than yours I think it's more inspiring answer and then the second we're after and I think it's also true answer then the second were entered the secular answer is basically\nLeave happens in religious answer as we've happen but that because it got him in charge and we don't understand that\nAnd I think that's a fair answer answer the question then simply random chance\nComing up this week we had on Andrew claim it on our Sunday special it was really a fascinating interesting conversation it was a really interesting some of that on the other dimension to Russia\nAnd I needed to get beyond that and I think the thing about another came to visit because it works on two levels because it's a very realistic thriller story very gritty becoming more thriller story and also this very\nAh almost old fashioned medieval fantasy story these two levels in ... in my own mind talking to one another the fact that I Am a realist ah I Believe that the world is a material world I Believe that everything can be explained through materialism on it every piece of our bodies can you know\nI could trace every thought in my mind the same time I believe that there is a new middle plane uh that\nUh where the spirit lives and all that our flesh tells a story about a flushes telling a story about the spirit you know\nAnd so we actually allowed me to write that without ever widening the Christian ...\nWhat what's your process for writing I mean you said that you do a lot of outlining does that turn it workman like or do you actually sit down and he just kind of let it flow\nIt's the only part of my work I hate the outlining I mean it's boring or it's a you know it's just close work and you have to sit there and do it there's no excitement no character and it even though I write a lot of biographies for characters and things like that\nHowever if you knew that work I've now learned when you sit down to write your free you know you you know didn't have seen the guy is going to you know been down that hallway and he's going to find such and such and you don't have to sit there and stare at that blank screen which is of course the nightmare of every writer\nWriter has so I Do do that I Do a lot of prep work and uh it's really helpful and what I now try to do is I Try and do it a little bit every day because it's just so excruciatingly awful you know\nI mean it's just the one part of the job I I Love my work and I I really do love it and then I but it's the one part of the job I just think uh I got into this I got to work it out\nSo what's your schedule on a day to day basis because he coming here young lady kind of hair you do your cats and then you're writing hours and hours a day or how do you first of all I cleared the time and taking them all or is it that you take away from you wake up you go to that and yeah I just casual during a normal day\nWhile I wake up I wake up at a ... you know five Fifteen five thirty I Know and the first thing I Do I like I say hello to my wife and I grabbed my identity start reading the news and I wasn't on August catching up on everything\nAnd I do that pretty solidly or until I start to got to show which uh you know I'm trying to show by around six thirty plus you know\nAnd uh and then I Do that stop stop for maybe about forty five minutes to do kind of stuff I read the gospels in in Greek which I'm so proud of myself and uh and then I read some ... some faith you know other other kinds of stuff\nAnd then come in and do the show and then I go home and ... you know and\nI knew somebody asked me how I got along with no sleep and I told him I take natural other people are expressing their opinions [laughter] really works but um but yeah no I I I just keep going and then I I'm done by the seven\nI guess I don't let let's go through some of your faith journey because you know the shaping how you're you're seeing the world\nIn terms of your your fiction writing on it and you have a pretty interesting turning out to you and I ended up and very ... by ... you started off you're born into the family that I tell you before we had the conversation ... extraordinarily secular Jewish family my show and and now he religious questions how do you get from point a to point B\nOr the weird thing about my family was it was secular but it was also committed to my father at least was committed to the traditions so we went to the Hebrew school we were bar mitzvahed or we learned this stuff\nBut it didn't occur to me that um I've always had this I won't call it an obsession that's a little too much but I've always had this idea that things should make sense if things don't make sense you should change your mind\nAnd and part of this because of a kind of dysfunctional atmosphere in my house where we were taught a lot of philosophical ideas that were just on true\nAnd and it's very damaging you know because you don't want to tear away from your family but in the same time you want to find the truth\nAnd so I became kind of obsessed with finding the truth she they're praying and you're they're learning Hebrew which is not my language and you know they're wearing the you know that happened last thing you know you think\nWell if there's no God and then my mother was a stone atheist and my father was just kind of like ... you know he didn't want to even want to get in trouble with God but like he would [laughter] have you believe in ... and and after like stress think well this is ridiculous this is ridiculous so\nAfter my bar mitzvah I mean that was kind of the turning point I was by miss but I got thousands of dollars worth of gifts to put it in this box and one day I got up through the box with because with everything in it and I just thought like you know\nThis is ... yeah exactly ill gotten games you know this is not what I I Want and I I didn't really expect it to live my life\nAs a shorter\nIntellectual agnostic you know like the way I mean I think this kind of was the default position of thinking men in my day you know and it's this kind of still in that district here now you write and I and I think that was going to be a that was really my position\nWhich is very flattering\nSitting intellectual mind because you can analyze everything into dust is no matter how small the point is you can break it up into even smaller pieces because you don't have the bottom line of there has to be meaning there has to be morality that's the problem was when I was Nineteen I read crime and punishment and convince me that\nThe more world exists convince me that Congress right that was the story sky above the moral all within and that was that was\nUndeniably true and the cause of that I kept circling around the weirdest this morality and meaning come from [noise] and I'm not I wasn't satisfied with things I hear from guys like our power Jordan Peterson or it's just the Taliban falafel\nIt's like our pal Jordan Peterson a tally and philosopher ... live as if there were ...\nI think to lose if there were a God is essential to want the conclusions of the soldiers whose\nPremises you don't accept right then and I know central again everything had to make sense to me and ultimately I mean I had a ... when I was a kid I've lived like these two life I have terrible emotional problems\nSo I had a terrible relationship with my father five my household was dysfunctional in this very invisible way there's not a lot of violence was not a lot of hatred it was just this kind of invisible dysfunction\nIt's cracked up came a point when I was like twenty eight years old I just stopped working basically I just went boom if something's wrong\nAnd at that point which was would have been the smart point she's hold a God like a piece of ... by the ocean\nI felt like that then I'll never bleach because it'll always be this thing I did because I was weak because I was down on my luck because I was broken it'll always be the squash that I've seen just hold up\nShows how stubborn I was about things making sense you know and uh\nAnd so instead of by the grace of God I by founding shrink cured me\nAnd I always laugh about this and the only person I've ever known was cured but he did you know even within the course of like two three years of talking to this guy I was a\nCompletely different thing and it was only then when I felt shame when I felt certain that my impressions were correct when I felt certain that I was not living in a delusional life and it seemed obvious to me that there was a God because of my moral staff and the stance that if everybody on earth was a time that was a time when everybody\nUnder believes slavery was right even the slaves that would have said yeah I don't want to be in the slave\nBut this is the way things are at that time slavery was wrong\nAnd once you say that you're screwed with God wise I mean you cannot you cannot get away from the idea that somewhere there is this moral base is based on main and this is the thing was fascinating to me now because\nThey can win me who actually buildings were kind of anomalies in the world of the thinking man I think there's a there is right now the world of the theme is divided into two one side if people like Jordan Peterson Marshall pairs of that was Perry who wrote that book the strange death here\nAnd we're at a novel isn't it was like about ... who are basically saying the west can survive without the Judeo Christian us he says\nWe should all strive to Dale christiansen basis I myself do not believe right all saying the same thing I myself cannot believe on the other side you have these guys like evil Harare and sapiens and Steven Pinker who said no no no my friend\nYou know we're we're going up and open up this has been an absolute\nAre are adding that arise at least more intellectually honest and then think are I mean I think the whole routine where enlightened it will say lots and everything is going to continue until I get better I mean like\n... away the foundations western civilization nothing will will crumble and Harare making like well maybe a couple of the nation south in the first place right now we're happy or when they're eating grass and and all that kind of got at least he's honest that way\nAnd he has this kind of walk an idea that we're all living in a delusion like he is\nThe problem with him is he says\nThe most unique his phrase I Would never say the most unique but he does and he says the most unique thing about sapiens is the fictions we create so we have a fiction that there's a God we have a fiction that we have human rights with a picture of money money has rallies but that's not how fiction works fiction fiction describes something it is not create thanks\nI can I can create a delusional world through fiction but good fiction creates describes reality to money is a good example of money and describes the value of something to human being when he has a lot of it or when he doesn't have a lot of it that's what it describes you know I was actually it actually does have a value that were\nAccepting the production but the idea does\nAnd because ... doesn't accept that there is a human life that matters um he thinks it's all being created by sections but the factions are being created by that internal life\nStill waiting for the perfect time to buy a new

your turn a guide to waiting lists the average Canadian family um wait Twenty one point two weeks something a primary care doctor\nTo getting treatment by specialist Bernie Sanders want the Canadian health care system as he said Medicare for all the time has come he wants the Canadian system but even more he wants to add vision care free drugs\nAnd um and and and and feed vision care and and um you know of course he he had the bill before the Senate which had sixteen co sponsors for whom want to become president\nAnd of course he never talks about what it would cost and how it would be paid for but it's Charles ... center said\nThirty two trillion dollars over ten years all private coverage under his plan Larry would be outlawed\nAnd you know a hundred and sixty million Americans have employer sponsored insurance and the polls show they like it they would all lose their coverage immediately and we would all be like people in the u._k. under the national health service Canada under its Medicare system\nThe on waiting list or care would be rationed and our taxes would have to be increased significantly\nSally how would why why does a a Medicare for all seem to test all well among Democrats\n[noise] well I think you know Bernie started this back in twenty sixteen I'm Single payer has been around Medicare for all for a long time but only in twenty sixteen when he was running against Hillary for the Democratic presidential nomination he brought out his first single payer plan\nYou know telling the American people that would be free and they would have the best healthcare and all\nAnd so you know the mainstream media picks up on this and plays it over and over again that you know who wouldn't want something that's free but as I say he never talked about how it would be paid for and how much it would cost and so and then he has of course his um new young sidekick Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nA ... member of the Democratic a socialist with America\nShe is going around with Bernie telling candidate you know promoting candidates who support single payer and so it's really a being a very big move to the left for the Democratic party and I think we're going to see in
