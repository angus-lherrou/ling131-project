something similar to so\nNumber one I said put down on the phone it has to be done you can be a spending all day [noise]\nAh staring at the phone or staring at Twitter because you know what it's doing to you I notice what what what it was doing to me and you probably having a similar experience\nA number two you got to say no to the Internet of things and the most popular example of the Internet of things these days is the Amazon Alexa and I don't mean to single out a single product or a single company although I Do plenty of that in the book but these devices these so called digital Butler's or digital assistants so they bring into your home\nAnd listen for a wake word so that you can you tell it to order a toilet paper or to subscribe to a Netflix or something [noise] uh these these devices are extremely problematic in the sense that there are ... what they are all Timothy ... or bugs ... surveillance system\nNow all of a big a Silicon Valley companies say no no no we only have your best interests at heart we are not interested in the spying on you\nWere simply trying to provide you with a smooth experience and the great customer experience so that you all your life will be easier and you'll ... you'll be connected to the people that you need to be connected to [noise]\nBut in fact um they get busted constantly ... we are learning the the um they are listening when we asked them not to listen and they are collecting data when we tell them not to and they are tracking our locations\nEven when we turned off that function on our phones and what concerns me the most about the Amazon Alexa is that it's to the proverbial camel's nose inside the tent once they've set up a surveillance system in your house\nSpeaker and a half to conclude that there's nothing you won't let them in on a and I can I don't think it takes a conspiracy theorists store or a mind that tilts that way to see how\nThis kind of thing could go badly and how\nUh ultimately whether it's a political repression or or even just ah\nRepression or or even just a you know I'm a business sort of like sticking it snows where you wouldn't want to to um\nThis is the kind of thing that years ago people would've laughed often said and there's no way you know my house as Mike Castle or I Would never let a company sort of sneak into my living room and listen to my conversations but yeah people are [noise] they can't they can't get enough of it uh there was a story recently about a college in St Louis\nThat for this fall semester is out putting all of its dorm rooms with Amazon Alexa [noise]\nFor one purpose I Can't imagine but I it all seems or enough areas to me and I would uh so I'm asking people to think really hard and really critically about whether you're going to outfit your homes with these kind of smart devices the so called smart devices\nThat while they might make your ah your mirror shopping experiences marginally I'm more efficient a comic quite the cost there's quite the trade off and the price to pay and we need to be thinking about that before we rush blindly into the future\nIn one last question for you man you want to use memory of life before the Internet to you and a source of optimism and possible cultural renewal\nWell in part because uh you know anytime you want to get back to some something that you've lost you need to have a memory of it's an so I'm with things the way the culture is changing so rapidly it's easy to forget that this is a relatively recent phenomenon\nThat it wasn't that long ago that people weren't even checking their emails every day [noise]\nUm so I think it requires an element of another thing that sort of encourages me about millennials says that you notice if you if you know any [noise]\nUh and you may be one of the earth seems to be among them is a real longing for an hour or more authentic way of living you see it in\nIn some of the hobbies that they're interested in like organic cooking end up making their own gym or pickles and you know the hand of all I handle bar mustaches and the strange long beards that they love or a fixed gear bicycles that this kind of like a\nSense of we need to get back to a a a a healthier more rooted lifestyle that's not so disconnected and disjointed by the isolation that technology can cause\nAnd what's causing in my life so I Do have hope that there are um you know while I'm being very critical of millennials and it probably sounds like a bad mouth them [noise]\nUm I I have hope that there's there's there's a there's a threat there that can be teased out uh and and and we can probably all of your out a way to live with this technology in a way that doesn't make us feel like we're floating off into outer space and we're not connected to anything that that used to be good in true in pure and our lives\nTo connect with that to admit to you I got a tremendous response from a friend recently had a birthday I didn't send them a text message or an email I hand wrote a card put it in an envelope with a stamp in snail mail it to him and he was just overwhelmed\nThat the shocking thing I mean I recently just to this is kind of a goofy but I bought a rotary telephone uh\nBut now of course I bought it off of Amazon but we're also you're going to get a thing like that but it is it the sensory experience of holding the half of the of the\nOf the handset tend to little being that it makes when you put them back in the cradle\nIt's all very comforting and very um [noise] and very you know you feel like you're using a real tool rather than something that you can't possibly understand or a comment was common practice until\nJust a several decades ago for teenagers to get a a an upbeat or of a car and you know ... and see if they couldn't rent surrounding the engine and get their hands and a little creepy and figure out what was going on in there and get a thing running again\nNo kid could do that anymore because when you pop out of a car there's a computer\nIn there it's like it's impenetrable so we're\nWe're definitely shifting away from our way of living that I don't think we have all agreed we want to leave behind but yet it's happening and we and we're um we're not getting much of a say in the matter so I'm asking people\nTo use the one power that you have since you don't have the\nThe uh the since you can't vote mark ... out of office it's not a democracy in that sense but you do have the power you have your purchasing power you have your discretion when it comes to the kinds of devices and tools you bring into your home or into your car [noise]\nUm that's that's really the only say we're going to get in this situation so if you want to be able to buy\nA refrigerator that's not connected the answer to that you need to start making that preference known somehow [noise] um [noise] maybe you do want a refrigerator that's connected to the Internet and I could see how there would be some uh fishing seems to be gained but to pay attention and be aware of pick up the price that you're paying\nIt reminds me of the old story as a teenager who had to making nine one one call in his grandmother's home and the only sold in the house was a rotary dial and he didn't know what to do Leon through his men you see the book is zero hour for genetics how the last adult generation can save America from\nMillennials
