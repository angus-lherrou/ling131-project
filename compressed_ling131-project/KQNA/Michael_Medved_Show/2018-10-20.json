that was something the Cherokee made back in the crab fit he noted crab\nHerds of the Oklahoma planes that her ancestors you've done a little bit more into this story over and over about her Native

the romantic story\nActually right or wrong about what it is I Believe was just starting the air that my mom and dad all were very much in love with each other and they wanted to get married and my

loved\nOkay tell her parents alone because her mom with part Cherokee and Delaware\nWhich means that they're pretty happy notes of Native American ancestry right there right I mean if her family as

down there is no Native American ancestry anywhere\nIn the in the time horizon of rationality so President Trump went out on the campaign trail back in twenty Seventeen\nAnd he was holding a rally in

venture bureau show turned out that Elizabeth Warren the senator from Massachusetts not Native American but she kept claiming he was four years well why didn't you just stop claiming it and then apologized for having done so like five years ago\nThere are a couple of good reasons here's the thing there was a story that came out September first of it is here in the Boston Globe and it just got a serious issue for Elizabeth Warren\nWas Senator Warren actually a professor at Harvard law because she couldn't Native American ancestry in other words wishing granted special status that sort of gave her in an upper hand when it came to her job and University of Pennsylvania\nOr at Harvard law school was more article from the Boston Globe ended up research found that poked at Harvard said that her Native American claims had nothing to do with any of that that her Native American claimed had nothing to do with our actual ability\nTo be granted a professorship at Harvard law school\nThey interview to like thirty one professor ... missions many coming from I Know people like Charles Fried who I have a contract and no one we hire it had nothing to do\nWith her claiming Native American ancestry in fact we didn't even know that it's time we assume she was white and the internal documents suggested that University of Pennsylvania treated her as a white person and sort of Harvard law school until it became beneficial for them to claim that she was a minority heritage for purposes of their diversity curriculum\nThat they had to claim that they had a certain number of diverse professors and so they sort of take it and said that she was Native American but that doesn't mean she got her job based on Native American Native American claim\nWhy would that said why didn't Elizabeth Warren ... and a half ago simply say look\nI was told by my family members that I had Cherokee after my mom used to tell me that my uncles and aunts and told me that and because of that\nI can only assume that the one with him to my relatives were lying to me the story that I was growing up I guess that was wrong and so I never should have done any of that stuff but it didn't have any impact on my actual career trajectory that career for victory\nWas going to be great no matter what and had nothing to do with those claims so I Apologize Native Americans are having taken seriously the stories of my family without checking them\nBut with that said to claim that I was beneficiary of some sort of affirmative action and simply untrue\nBut why don't you do that well there are two reasons she didn't do that and both of them are telling really number one she figure that she could get away with pretty much anything because the media would cover for her which the media did yesterday there were headlines in the Daily Beast saying Elizabeth Warren prove the Native American ancestry there was a headline over at CNN\nElizabeth Warren provide solid evidence of Native American ancestry so she legitimately threw out a study that showed he was not Native American and counted on the media to say that the studies show Jews actually Native American\nAnd then all the ... heart because people can read and that meant that her narrative began to collapse in on her so she thought she can get away with it because it would cover for her and why not why wouldn't you think that I mean to me I have covered for the fact that they don't work in a package with being treated as an Obama at Kennedy esque new young figure\nThat that guy was involved in a ... who's twenty six that involve him crossing over a median lines national truck and then trying to weigh in on the scene and they're still counting and is the big new next Democrat they know what can I'm somebody had my license suspended for driving too fast\nAnd obvious about that I was not driving drunk and I didn't crash into anybody on an empty freeway\nThey don't or war was driving drunk and hit a diet and then tried to leave the scene while he was drunk and the media have basically said that the big nothing in the media to tend to George W. Bush and the why back in the Nineteen seventies Jim disqualified him in two thousand for money for the presidency like two weeks before the election\nSo Elizabeth Warren had good costs to think that the media we're going to cover for her no matter what\nThe media covered Democrats the way they cover Republican half of the candidates for Congress in this election cycle would be told they would be finished\nBombing in its New Jersey would be done\nIn the ... honestly he'd be gone\nClaire McCaskill of Missouri would be done course in Panama in Arizona would be just host but they're not because I Want to look more like every other Democrat knows that there is a great\nAs a sort of buffer zone\nThat at this tablets for democratic candidate and so she can simply claim Native American ancestry without any proof and the media will continue to cover for her as much as humanly possible right and then they'll just continue to cover for her endlessly\nThat's the reason number one that Elizabeth Warren felt comfortable releasing a study to actually contradicted her main narrative line coming up the second reason\nThere was a before and self and the fact that he can continue cleaning Native American ancestry even though she was about ... demonstrating she had no Native American ancestry we'll talk about it as an engineer\nWhich is kind of amazing because honestly if he wants to ensure his future in the Democratic party he really should become a patron of yards right he should be taking that money and distributing it to more hotly contested races he's not going to do any of that so that the ... for Democrats meaning ... meanwhile\nClaire McCaskill is running a very tight race in Missouri and James O'Keefe the kind of undercover journalist\nLike he's going to shock journalists over a project ... he's on some good work before he sent his workers in the than some of his folks into Claire McCaskill's office and he got Claire McCaskill people to acknowledge that she is campaigning far to the right of where she actually is on the issue here some of what that sounded like yeah I can tell them\nBecause she does [laughter] [noise]\n'cause I went to the mysteries like in my own mother\nWere switches [laughter]\n[laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter] and run\nInto she's basically been sending about her own positions so Claire McCaskill is in trouble in Missouri or since animal just three weeks ago was leading mark MacPhail in the Arizona Senate race and now it turns out\nThat all of her past has come out and Clinton said in my case so Kirsten Sinema is the Democratic nominee in Arizona according to the Washington Examiner she apparently takes sorcery very seriously emails obtained by the Washington Examiner show cinema was invited\nTo a prominent come in a feminist which is in Arizona it was called pagan cluster to celebrate International Women's day\nThan to protest the war in March of two thousand three coping protestors weren't paying obviously nothing the women and black were black but cinema encouraged the which is to wear colorful clothing and come ready to dance plural and stay in touch with your inner creativity and with the earth\nTo send them a campaign would not say why she invited the witches or clarify why she thought members of vehicle deserved a seat at the table during discussions concerning more peace which is in question it should be noted claimed to practice only non violent magic pretty about touching on a Web page there is a peaceful and democratic kind of sorcery\nThe pay and cluster focuses on sharing spiritual insights and participating in direct democracy divisions on the side of the liberal many of their Calvin quote have roots in the reclaiming tradition of feminist witchcraft\nMhm cinema also into an anti war rally with pay and later that year and a apparently she talked about singing and spiraling into pagan circle only five rose from the police line I and then the police arrested everybody so than than them up and just doing humans work on behalf of her own campaign also it turns out\nShe organized for the Arizona alliance for peace and justice in one email she urged supporters of the a P J to dilute to deluge\nThe phone lines of a radio show hosted by an unapologetic unconditional supporter of Israeli policies are ... and I basically coast in that Senate race as well Democrats radicalism is the major issue here and all they have is President Trump which is why it's not good that the president of the United states goes around calling women horse base\nI mean really this is yeah we'll get to more of that in just one second the Democratic response to all the spots it kind of shocking story Carter Page is now suing the folks\nOver at fusion GPS who will get to all of that

the the economy continues to do while this was such a good news cycle it really was it was such a good news cycle\nThe economy was doing great then then new job numbers are just terrific not only that\nWe have the highest federal collection of income taxes in history and twenty Eighteen\nThe idiot he just look at the numbers we're collecting more income taxes than ever before even though we have lower income tax rate than we did last year why because supply side economics works when the economy grows and the government actually takes in more taxes and if the economy is stagnant and we have higher tax rate the economy has been going great guns under President Trump will get the deficit and a second which is not quite a bit but\nThis is a very good news cycle for President Trump in the last three weeks got U.S Supreme court justice and watch all that kill themselves over Capitol they got a little bit more in in one of the great on a force political wonders in my lifetime released a report saying she was Native American\nWhen she is ...\nShe's west Indian than\nActual people from India like actual people from India have more Native American blood that Elizabeth Warren does\nIt's an amazing thing\nAnd with that said President Trump decides to step on himself with\nStormy Daniels in calling people core say this is the only line of attack that Democrats have is just attacks on President Trump and so this is what they're ratcheting up down people who's looking at a bad Senate map right now\nShe's trying to suggest that President Trump is now in the pay of the Saudis that the reason that President Trump hasn't been harsher on the Saudi Government with regard to the murder of Jamal ... an American residents who was a critic of the Saudi regime and also than a Muslim Brotherhood\nShe sends a reason from hasn't been harsher is 'cause ... being paid off by the Saudis\nIn terms of Saudi Arabia I think that was that I always wondered why he went to the first country to do this and that the United states of course is president of the United states all the other presidents back to Ronald Reagan went to [noise]\nTo Canada from one to Mexico to extend the Bush to enter hemisphere was that many friends and allies who could have gone to see it was Hillary suspicious this there was some kind of financial transaction involved there whether for his businesses or what ever\nGood luck with his line of attack it it's pretty crazy that the that Democrats and the only way that they're going\nIt's pretty crazy that need that Democrat thing the only way that they're going to be able to win election just by simply throwing out on verified and verifiable information like that but if you don't have that is where they are which is why again on forced errors are the biggest problem for the ... the ministry and they've always been\nThe biggest problem for the ... minutes ration here's here's I think the rule in American politics right now whoever shut them first when\nReally because this is just it's the worst tennis match ever\nAnd he has even watch tennis player ... and very often you'll see that that sometimes the best strategy is just get the ball over the net because sooner or later somebody is going to snap the ball into the net and then he went\n... and ... there's a great wind which which comedian is it I think Mitch Hedberg is that it doesn't even make it on and so he has a line you know no matter how good the problem I have a tendency to no matter how good I get them better than the wall\nWell that that's essentially what's happening in American politics right now if you are the wall you win if you are the wall you wouldn't at all if you are the person who just sit there and let the other side banging his head against you in\nIf you're the person who commits on ... the Democrats have been committing on force there after an forced air here\nAnd that's why it would be great if the president would just stop but again I guess we're going to have an entire news cycle now about what they do that hurt Trump in any way not really but it does jazz up the Democrats again their minds and how much they hate President Trump when he goes away it's hard for them to talk about that as much nobody cares\nBut with that said that Trump Trump Trump that just the way that it got now\n... and it also comes along with the benefit of right and then there's always a good side to what Trump is in a bad side of what Trump is so\nThe same guy who call his former lovers warfare is the same fellow was actually trying to stop the immigrant caravan that have been traveling from places like Honduras so President Trump on Tuesday threatened to withdraw owning an aid from Honduras if it does not stop the care amount of people that had is heading to the United states from that\nThe United states has straw informed the president of Honduras that at the large caravan of people heading to the U.S has not stopped\nAnd

every year where people are set up from Latin America through Central America and to the United states more threatening to withdraw aid from countries that don't adopt that seems not completely

the pillars\nOf capitalism because we have shifted our mind that in the United states\nAnd this is really what I Want to talk about today we have shifted our mind that when it comes to what our lives should be like we believe we are guaranteed things here in the United states we believe that we are guaranteed a solid level of living because we live here you hear this from Bernie Sanders all the time in the richest country in the world\nWhen we really have people who don't have enough money to buy all the ... that they could possibly want to\nHear that from Bernie Sanders all the time we had so much and they're being you were born here ... you were born here therefore America's rich therefore you get stuff\nIt based on an assumption you're entitled to things here is what you are entitled to in a free country you are entitled to adventure that's where ... you were born in title\nTo exercise your rights in pursuit of adventure you get to make up your own story here that the American dream the American dream is people who were coming from across the sea to a place they did not know to an environment that we're not used to\nAnd building lives for their families and creating prosperity from the ground up\nThe American story is people crossing the Appalachian into wilderness they did not know places that had not been that\nGoing to areas where they had no allies setting down roads and trying to build towns and civilization\nThat the American story the American story is poor folks who have an idea and go find funding for that idea and then build that idea in some of the great companies in American history\nThat the American dream the American dream was never year here therefore we give you that that was never the American idea coming up the big problem\nWith this new vision of America as a place where you started your cat thing is that it takes away the truth the American ideal to the African American personality that have been a central element of America is the greatest country on planet earth we'll talk about that in just a second year of\nAnd then we say okay well what can we do to provide that when what can we do to get all the obstacles out of the ... what can we do to remove the barriers\nThat the American way it is not the American way there wasn't you know ... ... it'll comfortable to stretch a wing meaning difficult to leave home it may be harder to do that\nBill to leave home it may be harder to do that\nIt is also we're just going to make sure you know you never have to buy when we're willing to Cato you we're going to make sure that your swab in the warm blanket of government benefits we're going to ensure\nThat you never have to get out there and fly again this is not coming from place to no sympathy this is coming from a place of you can't innovate your children you can't innovate your community and you can't intervene our country on the basis of empathy alone and that is the best case interpretation of what exactly Democrats are doing here\nThe worst case interpretation is something much more cynical purpose for innovation of an entire sector of the population specifically to gain votes and thereby political power\nAnd after you look at towns like Detroit it's hard to imagine that's not what's been going on there for decades the failure of this sort of of thinking is evidence in major cities and counties across the United states\nIf you actually want to\nReinvigorate the American spirit we're going to have to teach people that same lesson that God taught Abraham at the very beginning of the Bible I get up and leave the home that you were born in and go to a place you do not know\nThat's how we become bigger that's how we become better that tell why is become better that's how the world becomes a better trained becomes better as well you have cool stuff\nIt's white culture become better because they experience and bounce off of other cultures\nAnd this notion that we can hunker down now because we've reached paradise and all we have to do it took her down and live in and redistribute what's in our backpacks those backpacks are gonna run out ... any of this worth\nOkay so in just a second I Want to talk about this fascinating article in the New York times about why scientists are are now attempting to avoid actual research out of fear of the all right\nBut first let's talk about

coms Watchmen so there's a fascinating article in the New York times I Want to talk about\nBecause it speaks to the lack of objectivity when it comes to the intersection with politics the article from New York Times is titled why white supremacists are chugging milk\nAnd why geneticists are alarmed then here's what they say it was from Harmon nowhere on the agenda of the annual meeting of the American society of human genetics being held in San Diego this week and the topic leading many of its members\nThat are occurring appropriation of the field research in the name of white supremacy sticking your neck out on political issues as difficult so Jennifer Wagner a bioethicist and president of the group's social issues committee\nWho taught to convene a panel on the racist and its use of genetics and found little fraction of the specter of fielding the mini has passed which include support than American eugenics movement looms large for many geneticists in light of today's white identity politics they also worry about how new tools that are allowing them to hone in on the genetic basis\nOf hot button trade like intelligence will be misconstrued that racist ideology isn't an argument that I have a pretty frequent basis with a friend of mine Jane costs in over a box\nOr Jane is black and ... and I think rightly has great sensitivity and everybody should embrace sensitivity but I think Jane would suggest that her background contribute to this activity on with regard to\nThe race has passed of the United states and the and the racist association between politics and bad science\nAnd so this has led to some serious conversations between the two of us\nAbout political correctness about whether in fact there's an appropriate time to talk\nAbout I ... for example or standardized testing for example or about that natural differences between men and women\nLike when you talk about biology without being condemned and sexist or racist he's a real issues that we happen to Scott and take on head on unfortunately the scientific community has decided to quash a lot of actual science because they're afraid that people who are racist or going to take that science out of context\nAnd then use that to Columbus and mission minority group and that's basically what this New York times articles about says in recent months some scientists have spotted distortions of their own academic papers and far right Internet forums others have fielded confused queries about Clinton White superiority\nWrapped in the jargon of human genetics misconceptions about how gene factor into America stark Reagan was carried\nA surface and the nation's increasingly heated arguments over school achievement gap immigration and policing instead of long discounted proxies like school circumference and family pedigree\nAccording to experts to track the far right today's proponents of racial hierarchy are making their case by misinterpreting research on the human genome itself and debate that have been largely limited to ivory tower for on the scientist whose job is to mine human the humanities genetic variations\nOr the collective good are grappling with how to respond if there's a real way to respond to all of this put out the science and independent science that's the way to respond all of this instead the scientists afraid that there are scientists ones me misappropriated misinterpreted or used for bad reasons\nMay have decided that they are going to simply squash all the discussion internally\nJohn of Emory University of Chicago evolutionary biologists studying human genetic diversity and easier in a society where diversity is clearly valued and celebrated right now that is very much\nOn my mind once my doctor November his folded into his recent talks to fix a group of white nationalist trucking milk\nAt a two thousand Seventeen gathering to draw attention to a genetic trait\nKnown to be more common and white people in others the ability to digest lactose as adults but also showed the social media posts\nFrom an account and she called entered the milk zone with a map lifted from a scientific journal article on the trade the evolutionary history and most of the world the article explains the gene that allows for the digestion of lactose\nSwitches off after childhood but with the arrival of the first cattle herders and Europe some five thousand years ago a chance mutation that lasted turned on provided enough of a nutritional led up to nearly all of those who survived eventually carried it\nAnd then the post show this habit of hate speech urging individual to the African ancestry to leave America saying if you can drink milk you have to go back well\nI mean ... to their idiots\nIn one of the great ironies of of white supremacists the stupidest people on the planet they're constantly talking about white people are superior and they're just dumb asses as one of the things that's so funny it's like if they're going to proclaim white superiority and you really shouldn't send your best is I'm\nIn a commentary that accompanied the paper in the journal genetic documentary warned that research is wrapped in numerous cab yet that are likely to get lost in translation because\nPeople are flaunting DNA ancestry tests indicating exclusively European heritage\nBut the problem here is that we actually have to look at what science does have to say because it is a con founding factor when you look at attributing racism to America so take for example\nRacial disparities in education so there's a lot of talk these days about affirmative action and whether people are performing at certain levels eligible to get them into college\nAnd meets ingestion is that it is historic American racism that has led to that has led to the education gap in America's higher education system in alternative would be that the test scores do not wind up equally among various\nWould be that the test scores do not wind up equally among various ethnic groups and that is true not just with regard to black and white it's not worth all white and Asian why people score\nLower on the SATs an Asian people do as a general matter in the United states how much of that a genetic how much of that happens to be environmental we don't actually know the answer to that that's a hotly broad question\nIn science but suggesting that racism is to blame for everything without looking at other confounding backer like for example ... is a mistake and we just to the wrong outcome and we just to the wrong met her students and deal with those outcomes\nGenetics is not the answer to all of these disparities but neither is racism\nNow these are questions we have to be very careful that because obviously you don't want to get material to people who are suggesting that people some people are near inherently\nAre inherently worse or heart evil or more violence or stupid or because of the color of their skin genetics doesn't wind up that way but\nYou also have to look at questions of science because your eye scientists\nDo and it is and it's fascinating to watch this debate play out in real time\nSo there there are doctors who have organize meetings and social scientists and social implications\nOf the hill the newest tools even Nelson a Baylor College of medical geneticist with President and the human genetics and society\nSays it will not pay completely quite on the issue is that there's no genetic evidence to support any racist ideology which is true because of racism is a moral view a genetic I intend to view and scientific racism is the use of science in order to be racist and it's not the use\nOf science in order to pursue good and\nSo it it here silencing research because you're afraid of how people are going to use that research and I would think that they are misusing science that we need to have some very hard conversations about actual science actual problems and natural solution without falling prey to the idea that because that people are going to use the information we have to wash the information that do okay\nComing up a bevy of actresses now say that any
