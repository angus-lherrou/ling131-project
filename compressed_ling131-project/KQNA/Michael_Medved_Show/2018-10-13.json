won't do it you voted with them if you send me to the legislature\nI Will fight them harder than anyone I'm Dr I'd go back I approve this sale paid for by had go for state representative\nWhere ...\n... a barrel shouts out tactic number one for the Democrats in the wake of Brett Kavanaugh data entry to the Supreme Court\nIs well let's just try to change the system itself well you'd actually have to control government to do any of those things and also there's just to kind of works\nBut that'll come to mind is tacking number two which is that women are suddenly under attack everywhere from everywhere one of the great life it's being perpetrated it's being perpetrated by folks like Valerie Jarrett Valerie Jarrett you'll remember was the top advisor to President Obama and she treated it that I think it sums up well the argument being made by Bill Charlap close\nTo all of the survivors of sexual assault and women wonder if they will be believed that they are attacked no there's a growing powerful moving up support there will always have your back\nWe believe you we will stand with you we will defend you change is coming to the idea here is if you supported Brett Kavanaugh your annoying women\nWho make allegations of sexual assault is so trends parents and really quite vicious and disgusting I did not vote for president from in large measure because of his treatment of women there are lots of people\nAre not happy with sexual assault allegation\nSusan Collins the senator from Maine who came out in favor of broadcasters basically the deciding vote she's been ripped apart for what she had to say on CNN but there is nothing innately wrong with what you said on CNN here's her explaining that while she believes something happened and Christine Blasey Ford she just doesn't believe that according to the proponents of the evidence that Brett Kavanaugh was it was the guy did\nI Do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh's was her at the same line so I Do believe that she was assaulted I don't know by home and I'm not certain went but I Do not believe that he was the is it\nOkay and that prompted Mazie Hirono to come out and say how could Susan Collins doubt\nHow could you encounter that well it's really funny because I remember that like a week ago literally a week ago there was one in Julie sweating it brought forward by Michael ... and she claimed that Brett Kavanaugh had gang raped her or the he was involved in ... you never hear her name any more from the Democrats why don't they believe all women\nDon't they believe that all women ought to be believed toward the atlas of whether there's any sort of verifiable or corroborated the evidence\nBut Julie ... she was gone so not that not believe all women it's believed the women we want to believe because they're slightly more credible and then Republicans say okay well we agree that was why the more credible than sweating it but we don't believe that she's totally credible either early ... story isn't corroborated\nAnd then to be like no no no that means you don't you're not leaving on women or when you don't believe I Want and you don't really want you to Broderick believe Kathleen will eat only Paula Jones you don't believe the waitress is worse than which by Ted Kennedy and Chris Dodd back and then I ... it's just it's maddening but here is made you want to think how could Susan Collins even have a child\nHow could you even have it because this is a free country where we do not condemn people without due process of law and we certainly don't condemn people's lives do the ash ... history simply without any corroborating evidence whatsoever\nTo say that the things that back and forth I think that he went to south and what does that whole than they're worth cooperation with the he had talked about this is talk to her husband to others before back half an hour every nominated to the Supreme Court took a lie detector test corporation lost their\nJobs maybe or on a jet again this is built on the line is that we may have lost the battle with regard to the capital of winning the cultural war the cultural war is going to be\nThat men verses women and women always must be believed and that men who do not buy in are women who don't buy and are just ... and ...\n... it was on meet the press so it was a mulatto shut up I meet the press the effort showing up at the hearing because of Dianne Feinstein who is a very serious senator Leno and she explained were winning the cultural battle\nI think a lot has changed but I also think a lot has changed and yesterday we we may have lost a political battle but I Do think we are winning a cultural battle and often I don't fight for the when I'm fighting for that generation\nI don't have to deal with the abuses of power that would that we've had to deal with\nThis is this is what Democrats are hoping and they're hoping in the most ... why on possible way coming up if the solution to what ails on his gratitude maybe we ought to take a look at some of the\nSurrounding how good we have it here in the United states and I heard a lot of that and about how American income magnate and and how things really haven't gotten better since I mean I I actually want to watch in your life better than it was an idea to have an answer you know which way why that is when you hear\nHere is what they did they divided the Nineteen Seventy nine nominal prices by Nineteen Seventy nine average nominal hourly wages and two thousand Fifteen nominal prices by two thousand Fifteen average nominal hourly wages and they calculated the time costs of household items in each year that's a number of hours it would take\nTo buy a washing machine for example so for example the time costs of eight Thirteen cubic foot refrigerator\nSo by fifty two percent in terms of the hours of work required at the average hourly nominate away so if you could buy two refrigerators for the price of one and that makes you Richard regardless of what your top line income is\nNeedless to say the above price productions greatly underestimate the totality of welfare again by the average American ignoring qualitative authentic and environmental improvements on commonly used item again those products are better today\nThan they were yesterday so it's pretty clear\nIt is pretty clear that when it comes to products that we can buy we are much better off than they were in the Nineteen seventies so where are we short or shorten education health care and housing because the cost of those things has risen at a faster pace than total compensation however it is true that today's houses are larger and health care is better and education is more high tech\nAnd it's also true that the reason that house that houses have risen in prices because of tremendous regulation on the part of democratic administrations for the most part and major city the Reagan easy housing shortages in Los Angeles which is the most sprawling could you know in in the country and it's where I live\nIs because of heavy regulation and zoning\nSo what is the standard of living well it's certainly ... it certainly better than it was Nineteen Seventy nine for the vast majority of people in the American public the average apartment is bigger the average stuff you have in her apartment is bigger the average house is better the average stuff that you have in that house is better all of that\nShould suggest that maybe we should be kind of grateful\nFor the country in which we live and stop trying to tear it down and stop trying to tear each other apart in the name of some utopian vision\nAnd Democrats might be wise to start there especially because the more and rage Democrats get Republicans lag behind 'cause we we are not fond of the rage but\nIf you enraged us when you awake that sleeping giant it's not good for you ... it is not good for you okay well in just a second I Want to talk about the Democrats' failure to recognize that basic truth in what they're saying now about justice Kavanaugh\nBut first let's talk about your sleep quality I don't think that while on the road you know why because I don't have my helix sleep mattress with me there was nobody on the planet like you to why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else healing sleep they'll to sleep when they take two minutes to complete\nThey use the answers to match your body type and sleep preference is the perfect mattress whether you're aside sleeper or a hot sleep or whether you like a pleasure from bad but he likes there is no more guessing and no more confusion just got a huge sleep dot com slash Shapiro take their two minutes liquid and they will match you to a mattress that will give you the best leap of your life\nFor a couple he looks can even split the mattress down the middle providing individuals important needs and your preferences for each side\nAnd a ten year warranty and get to try it out for a hundred nights risk free\nRight now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all now France ordered them to a hundred and twenty five bucks off and he looked sleep dot com slash Shapiro that he like sleep dot com slash a bureau for a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress order again he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro my wife and I have a huge sleep mattress we took that sleep quickly or the mattress that came in the mail it's just fantastic so good\nWe got one for my sister for her wedding so check it out right now he likes to sleep dot com slash Shapiro okay so let's talk about the fact that the wife doesn't seem to realize they live in a a great country\nAnd that they believe that we all ought to be living in fear every single day now fear mongering is never a wonderful thing\nIf you're going to get exercised about problems in your life you probably should be exercised about problems that\nAre truly prevalent\nKnow things that are actually a threat to you and suggesting that every woman in the country is at risk of rape every second of every day is probably not a good way to bring people together it's also not a good way to view your neighbors because the truth is that women are not at risk of sexual assault every day in the United states of America pretty safe country for women in fact it's the free as safe as conflict for women\nIn the history of mankind so there's that but there's a song that now become very popular on Twitter and Facebook\nI'm not sure what and get her name is Mercedes wins I guess a and she's put up this song and folks on the left are just ecstatic about the time because it suggests that men should not be concerned about false allegations of sexual assault we should not be concerned about it anymore so young men who are worried that in the aftermath of the Brett Kavanaugh nonsense\nThat anybody can be accused at any time without any corroborating evidence they should sit down and shop because women have a tough now there's a logical flaw at the root of that which is two things can be for once women can be afraid of bad men and men can be afraid of bad women\nWhy these two things are supposedly mutually exclusive is beyond me I Do not understand why saying that women have a right to be afraid when a man of cost them and treat them terribly why is that mutually exclusive with a man has a right to be afraid that a woman will make a false allegation against him\nI'm not saying that the fears ought to be equivalent in nature I'm not saying that the level of of the or should be equivalent or that the level of prevalence of these events is equivalent to say that I shouldn't be afraid of something bad happening to me because something bad could happen to you makes no sense at all just on a logical level\nAnd the reason I say that is because there are cases many cases across the United states particularly on campus right now\nWhere men are being accused of things that they did not do and it's costing them time money and credibility\nSo here's the story of James I'm Sorry James I'm going to get into this lady's on so James was a freshman at the University of California David this is according to reason magazine who's on his way to math class when he received an email that would really his life for the next few months\nUniversity title nine office which handled sexual misconduct disputes between students was investigating a complaint against him this was in February twenty Eighteen\nRight after Harvey Weinstein and Al Franken and all the rest James had that there's not a good time to get accused of something like that the email from the title mine compliance officer\nWhen into great detail about the seriousness of James situation it would be investigated in accordance with university sexual assault and sexual violence policy as well as the student code\nWhich covers physical assault threats of violence and conduct that threatens health and safety the finding of responsibility could result in suspension or even expulsion the email the short on details or the alleged conduct according to the title nine off as a female student and Becky\nHad complained that they James touched her on the brass and brought up the over under her clothing without her consent\nJames ... they've been classmates and drama and briefly friends on the even about Tobar twenty two thousand Seventeen they'd met up with some other friends to play music eventually finding themselves alone and back to your dorm because for a few minutes engaged in some light sexual touching before other students interrupted them in James's view they encounter had not only been fully consensual it was also mutual\nBecky bore just as much responsibility for initiating it as James as back he would later made clear to the investigator should also touched him sexually she explicitly describe\nThe investigator she'd also touched tenants actually she explicitly describes her own actions in her ... statement\nCame as attorney wrote about the incident and uh and here's what they wrote that he'd account of the incident at that for that in the summary of her investigative interviews does not on a stage allege any active prohibited conduct matter\nInvestigation continued until may first at which time the officers student and judiciary affairs finally concluded that James is innocent even Becky ... afforded the opportunity to appeal the decision consistent with university policy is dictated\nBy the Obama administration to education department\nAt cost James twelve thousand dollars in legal the defending himself against an allegation in which the girl admitted admitted that she was mutually involved in the sexual conduct I mean it's pretty astonishing according to back east complain\nThey can't think about a night of mutual learning and started out romantic eventually she either asked James to call it that are close to herself they continue kissing and also touching it they grind it against each other\nAnd he stayed he says my hand started making my ... while they were speculate testing the waters and to open his I make sure that he was enjoying what was happening she seemed into it and so he touched her over her clothes and remove T shirt and she told them to drop it on the floor\nSo in other words she was involved in every step of all of that right at one point James became too forceful he was running against searches but yet the closet door and he asked him to be more gentle he agreed and tell them down the writing\nBecky admit that you catch the changes that\nI didn't think she gave ... she did however asked him whether he was into certain types of sexual activity and she said that you would aroused by all of that so she says all of this to the title nine court it cost him twelve thousand dollars anyway so should be worried about that sort of thing\nWhy not why wouldn't they wouldn't you'll be worried about the sort of stuff but according to feminist because women have a completely separate\nSet of fears some of which are justified in some of which are overstated men should not be worried about anything so bright cabinet as guilty because bad things happen to women\nIs basically the logic of black and then they wonder why folks on the center and on the right or not interested in that particular point of view well here is that this song from Mercedes Benz expressing that's been our point of view that bad that women are threatened bad things happen to them therefore mentioned shut up here she had thing about having five million use on Twitter it's gone viral of course\nI Can't wait in line in Nineteen eighty nine can live and let me know and then the\nOther for one second so she can do all the thing all the things you've got that you can't do it you can do I agree that men can be paid and the women are at greater risk of being targeted by men and met her but what does that have to do with the pregnancy in China it really has nothing to do with the main topic and ... ... something bad happened to me\nOr could happen to me therefore you should shut up about the possibility of something bad happening to get which is just a line of water I Do not understand coming up President Trump has stated\nThat the left is now engaged in a sort of mob anger and he's clearly right about this wait till you hear this

in a glass cage emotion a glass cage with emotion and does bad right now I'm the sadness overwhelms me at times if I had to take a break to go\nCry in the corner and just rock myself in the ice cream that might be happening a little bit later in the show we'll try to avoid it as best we can\nNikki Haley made that announcement in the White House with President Trump today it was a shock announcement here's what she had to say\nAnd then and author of a lifetime you know I said I in fact I'm lucky\nBelieve in that race and there\nReally been a blessing and I want to thank you for that\nNow Nikki Haley was indeed a bad asking her job at the UN ambassador she basically spent every day going and yelling at death but which was into great at it I mean she would go in and she would talk about\nHow the United states was exceptional and America was unique place in our allies like Israel are worth supporting and how the UN was basically the size of the international\nInstitutional sort of lay out\nAnd she was exactly correct about all the things I Will miss Nikki Haley greatly explains some of the things that she got done as UN ambassador that\nWith the United states on foreign policy [noise]\nThey know that if we say we're going to do something we call it when I got her whether it was the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO sang in other countries have to pay their share having weather training of the main thing is that\nOkay so they're button bunch of rumors about what's going to happen next people suggesting that Nikki Haley is going to take Senator Lindsey Graham spot Lindsey Graham is going to become the the UN ambassador that's not going to happen I'm going to say that right there right now Lindsey Graham has no interest in giving up a tendency to go to the UN ambassador it would be a great solution it'd be really Machiavellian to move her into the Senate\nWhere she could just do battle with Kamala Harris on a daily basis it would be spectacular I Would enjoy watching it and Lindsey Graham would actually make a terrific UN ambassador because it would be full time Lindsey Graham to point out\nThat's all that he would do all day long it would be Lindsey Graham two point oh and just yell at people would you be amazing but unfortunately I don't think that's going to happen there were some rumors that maybe it'll be Dina Powell who was a former member of the administration\nOr or maybe it'll be we're now who would be terrific he's our current ambassador to Germany I really doubt that they're going to call them back from Germany make newer and better there are few other possibility Nikki Haley is is not going to stay with the administration a\nShootout she is not going back to the Senate my guess is that she is going to go back into politics maybe a couple of years from now but I get the sense\nFrom her from from folks you know her that she actually does just want to take some time out that you'd sort of been burned out on this job and I hear I mean that's that's a pretty brutal job I met with ambassador Haley just a few months back and it's not the easiest job in the world going in there every day\nIt number one having to watch what the administration is saying and doing and number two having to go in with some of the worst people on earth and tried to negotiate with them on a regular basis so good

thought that he had during the swearing in of justice Brett Kavanaugh on Monday Donald Trump took it upon himself to apologize to cabinet and family\nAre half our nation that he terrible pain and suffering you've been forced when you are repeated the tire line that he and Republicans hope will stick and you're the common touch base to electoral fervor\nThat accusations of sexual assault against cabinet or part of the campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception they were and what happened to the cabinet family by like every notion of decency and due process it did\nBut here's Charles Blow perspective to me this was not just the president and party worried about and approaching blue wave and trying to take political advantage of a moment to decorate\nIt was an outright and increasing amplification of a reactionary white male victimization syndrome that has consumed modern American conservatism box has called at the unleashing of white male backlash this is very bad by the way\nWhite males are not allowed to defend their right if they do this evidence that they are privilege\nSo if white males are given to profit than that showed that they are privileged and if they're not given due process and then they get angry that also shows that they are privileged so just like every other major left the argument these days the conclusion is already assumed it's just a question of how you got there\nA coral Charles Blow the woman accusing the white man of assault weren't the victim instead the white man with a victim well to be accurate the actual accusation\nIs that the women accusing the white man of assaulting had any corroborating evidence which means that you were trying to get this guy without any corroborating evidence whatsoever in some people's eyes as low he was the victim of political correctness majors overage\nA check your white male privilege culture drunk on its own self righteousness which is on which is true\nBecause that's what happened but that's not really what this is about according to Charles Blow Kavanaugh's belligerence defense and Trump's dismissal of the accusers he mocked one at a political rally and called the accusations of helps you'll recall that some folks like me criticized that and said that he shouldn't have mock Christine Blasey Ford because he didn't know the facts either\nAccording to blow they represent for many many back against the wall no more space for treatment of fighting back uh pushing back\nA standing proud and their patriarchy and for claiming that it will happen now due process is patriarchy now presumption of innocence patriarchy continued\nThey're saying enough they will see no or ground they will share no more power they'll accommodate no more ascendancy and validation of the press\nNine out of the word allegedly oppressed there because again none of those allegations have actually been supported by any evidence that is what they're telling us and they are speaking through Trump he says the victim sensibility Trump is articulating is not generationally restricted\nIn January a PR I MTV Paul uh Fifteen to twenty four year old now that forty three percent of young white men say discrimination against like is this your is a problem as discrimination against other groups twenty nine percent of young white woman agreed with them and you're only half believe efforts to increase diversity will are white people\nBecause by nature the definition of the left attempts to increase diversity include harming white people meaning what the left one from diversity is not ideological diversity or diversity of experience what the what that is that we should give slots\nThat be moms you qualified white people do while by non white people is an actual point that the what we use it\nI don't even know what can argue this particular watching it doesn't make any sense if you are saying that there is a group of college admitting which too many are white and we need to replace some of those white people with non white people\nHow does that not harm laypeople you have to explain that one and as for the notion that discrimination against whites in the jury is a problem as discrimination against other groups there are two ways to read that question and I think that there's one ... the inaccurate ways to say that historically and presently discrimination against black folks is\nJust ... it is not as bad as discrimination against white folks with which I disagree\nAnd then there is a way to read it which is
