ago a huge explosion of well deserved controversy for her insistence that Santa Claus was white\nAs she should have been able to watch out on this\nBecause what all of this is based on and she was commenting in a discussion about a Halloween masquerade which looked truly awful frankly uh by Lou when the lessons to his one of the real housewives of New York\nAnd um she uh she dressed up as Diana Ross and posed and put out pictures of it\nAnd uh and and Diana Ross and of course I was very um a light skin and as soon as she was trying to approximate that wearing a big giant afro wig and it

yeah can you imagine if she was in a school pageant\nAt some point when she was eight years old and little Megan Kelly I Am because she does say in her statement that when I was a girl when I was growing up there was no problem with it\nWhich I think guys going to send a lot of reporters scurrying looking for photographic evidence maybe that's why a NBC was so we are to try and this this sad controversy let's go to a Bob in Cleveland, Ohio Bob you're on the main event show\nHigh I think are making a ... original statement about Blackfish it can be explained initial observation you can pick a girl out of Fox News but you can't take Fox News out of the girl\nAnd I think the statement a bet she made about Blackfish reflects or the way she was a I guess which say normalized at Fox News\n... wait it it it is there a history of crazy statements by Megan Kelly I Know she made a statement that Santa Claus was white which was highly controversial\nBut a ... D can you think of other statements where Megan Kelly has gotten in trouble I mean she got in trouble with President Trump on some of our questioning of him but other than that\nI think she was trying to re dreamer so I think she knew I Know I mean when we're ... from what\nI I just look I just I'm not a big follower American Kelly but I Am I you can kind of ... ah you know watch what she probably wasn't doctrine aided at Fox News I think it's you know these people that work\nAt ... who did it on and colonel who do you think\nOn Fox News is uh has shown naked Lee racist attitudes\nI don't know if you didn't want him to prominence sensitive I think they're very sensitive to um\nYou know people you know just just shows have shifted charity\nTowards people of other races or not\nYou know what I'm thinking Bob I'm thinking you probably don't watch a lot of Fox News am I right\nNo I don't know what I hear about I guess I Would I hear about vitamin C. here\nHere's the point um [noise] ... media I have lots and lots of problems with them and I don't want to say that Fox News you never hear any content that's questionable and I don't want to say that uh over at CNN MSNBC you you never hear any content that's correct\nUm but this whole idea that an entire network of some of the most conscientious\nUpright a decent far seeing Americans that I Know of a work at Fox News and yes there is some and CNN\nAnd uh to to write off a whole network because of propaganda against it is just not fair oh I've tried watching some time I don't think you'll see a lot of stuff that you will find hateful are alarming\nOh let's go to Kevin in Columbus ohio Kevin you're on the ... that show\nHello Kevin\nWe don't have Kevin uh we will go to another call from Columbus Josh you're on the ... that

probably here she is probably a a dysfunctional person I'm Sorry I'm getting off track [noise]\nSo I'm voting because I think when people that are in power\nOr you disagree with that if you tend to to look and see what they're doing\nAnd be paying more attention and so I think that the best way to express my feelings are about the situation in my lot in life is to vote and voting on the local level and the state is the best way to do that no good for you as one way or the other but\nI Know a good good for you or I can I ask are you voting for ah Sherrod Brown where are you voting for congressman or a ...\nA ... at this point I haven't looked over their platform listen to all the governor debates uh that's far and I'll I'll be voting for Cordray for governor um\n... that's interesting why\nUm I agree with issue one uh mostly um I I thought he did better in the debates I feel like the viewpoint wind up um after that that that's kind of how I took away when I took away from it\nWell I knew I was fascinating as you know Ohio carried big time big league for President Trump won Ohio by nine points\nAnd and right now uh I Know the the governor's races close a Sherrod Brown the very very liberal senator who really should be voted out but it looks like he is going to win and what this shows is the American people are not doctrinaire they're not automatic about their voting\nBut I I salute you Josh what you're saying about voting to express yourself to get involved\nIt's a good thing and it's the right thing and congratulations on that let's go quickly to David in Duluth or ...

we're building the patriotism and I'm seeing kids\nI'm thinking that's now I've had many veterans who have come to my school um like with my veterans' day program we invite that's from the community and the kids seem to them and thinking for their service and\nUm I get compliments all the time about how patriotic the kids are how they think the everybody walks up and think that that if you're one of my students you definitely know when you see a veteran you say thank you for your service\nNot only that but by seeing the veteran in the flesh and exchanging those stories it brings all the history lessons\nTo heart to them yeah I can still recall being in the fifth grade when I open up my history book and there was the JFK assassination which I had watched for four straight days on CBS has a little kid now all of a sudden it's in my history book\nAnd it dawned on me course I Lived through the whole thing but all those stories I was hearing in history class they weren't ... they

Lewis financing ... your ... your team Toyota\nRoot for no with three thousand dollars judgment zero percent for six months what do you do have children you know three thousand guys beggars\nZero

deserve during\nThe ... century authorized clearance of them use promoting family Toyota ... really courier twenty two readers shows the word for the motor motive viewership Toyota president and through literally go to prison\nWhere everybody's on their own [noise]\nWondering why not wanting\nEncouraging thing is these kids do speak out and they do tell their stories and they don't hold it in and they get the support of all the other kids around them and it's it's that's supportive mess that so impressive and I'm sure that will come across a with the production\nAnd aired and Julie I may have my facts wrong about this but I Believe the Matthew Shepard murder may have been the first prosecuted official hate crime what why did they kill Matthew\nShepard my understanding is that he it was it at at first it was a great thing it was they were going to ride him and then supposedly we never know 'cause method never got to speak\nAfter he was attacked that supposedly Matthew Shepard I made a sexual advance of some kind and that gave that person or people the thought that they had the right to beat him to death and leave him to die on a cold at night\nBut as you said DJ or are these two guys that committed these murders a huge certainly cross the street if you saw in ... he was a tiny little guy five foot two ... yeah yeah he was yeah\nAnd the two men were talking about Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson they are serving I Believe life sentences is that correct It's a double life or double life says yeah as as well it should be\nAnd uh the way he was killed was so brutal uh and and so hard to fathom it makes you wonder what in the world made these two guys so angry to do something like that because that goes to the very core of bullying why are you doing that to correct\nAthlete you know it lately just reminded of that one of the our stories includes somebody so grave that he admits to his own bully\nIdiot so he's they're standing in front of and willing to stand up and say I did this so we also addressed that in the show\nYeah and you have to ask them what do you go from here okay you acknowledged it you're you're obviously you know story about it what do you do about that you know I uh I used to grow up every day you're reading the advice columns of van landers and dear Abby people like this\nAnd I remembered how important they said it was to forgive the bullies you've been you've encountered your life\nAnd there's a caviar comes with that if a person remain unlike the one who confessed are like that you were speaking of if a person remains a bully into adulthood\nConfession them and for giving this bully might play right into their hands because they know it still hurts you and it it's so painful to know some people never grow out of that it makes you wonder what happened to turn them into that\n[noise] you know something that I thought of I was thinking of today is and I want to I Want to tell all of our kid as because there's an anger that comes out these kids are\nTalking about very very hard things but there's a difference between being furious and be fierce serious is carrying the anger forward\nHurting either because they've been hurt being fears is turning it into something that actually helps others the um these kids are fears yeah\nYeah and in ... in the case of an errand McKinney a he said that uh he uh struck shepherd Nineteen to Twenty one times in the head with the butt of a three fifty seven magnum the final blow damaging shepherds brainstem and he was left there to die on offense\nAnd speaking of fence aired you became quite know what a segue this is you became quite well known in our area are not long after the er the Granite Mountain hotshots tell us about that project will\nStrangely enough that was in a way inspired by a the Laramie project because when I was looking for a\n... a guide or a way to deal with what I had gathered which at the time was interview upon interview upon interview\nWith people in the Prescott area that had gone to station seven and hung something on the fence or a the professors from nearby college would done the prayer flag project or the two hikers from your Nell uh I spent hundreds and hundreds of hours interviewing these people and I wanted to translate that into\nSome type of a player performance and the Laramie project is written that way it's basically interviews so I re read the Laramie project and use that and I found at the time that unique fence connection that when the fence prominently featured in both events so\nI just went with it I said there's got to be a reason and um you know I had some personal connections in both regards to both plays so\nIt seems very natural and uh what we ended up with which of course Julie directed as well was a very successful and very very moving in a different way in a very different way than the college project but a very moving project\nAnd speaking of directing Julie I saw you directed Gail mango in red hot patriot which was a wonderful one woman show at the the oaks theater you've also been involved in a whole bunch of a PC a projects tell us about some of the people who will be part of this project with you\nIn our particular project right now that tolerance hide it\nArid and my baby it cannot landed in my lap and I knew the whole background about arid frightening the fence and the connection to the Laramie project so as soon as I heard that it came up he has become a you know my kind of I don't know\nMy they into my yang and this whole theater endeavor I Am so blessed\nTo be near this man and I call him the Swiss army knife of theater because he pretty much to do anything and he does [laughter]\nYou know when you know when or when our listeners hear black box theater most of us think instantly of course of the stage to a little theater which is just like being in Greenwich Village you you know enter from the alley under the ... up but this is something new you said if you have a pi college when did this start up\nThis they have their very first show a couple of weeks ago it was a murder mystery in our area and it's a gorgeous little space\nDown in ... and they really have done it done it up right it's a bigger space than the states share which I'm ... and I have worked and that's where we don't face the fence and I'm among other projects that this is a really kind of fat I don't know how would you describe it\nWell it's it's a comfortable space mhm and\nOh it's it's a comfortable space ... and the fact that it's in in Institute of learning gives it a whole different sure you know it's not downtown\nIt's not kind of gritty yeah yeah and that's something that they had some more of an academic field ... that's a beautiful space now used you performed in black box theaters now yeah\nAs an actress and as a director ... how does that affect your approach when compared to a much larger main stage that is a great question so the bigger theaters I think the range of motion that you can get because of that you have to protect your voice\nAnd because you're kind of having to be louder and shout out you're playing for the back room playing for the back right absolutely whereas in a black box it's much more intimate they can see your eyebrow ray it's\nThey it's more like TV I guess and say you can get pretty close you have to watch around it of course 'cause he couldn't make the audience kind of uncomfortable and his only just fun as an actor to play with sure\nAnd ... and let's face it any kind of hard\nProbably sets out at some sometimes to make at least somewhat uncomfortable I remember one artist saying if someone somewhere has not made uncomfortable I haven't done my job because it's got to get you out of your comfort zone from time to time right\nOh absolutely it's got to make you think ... and it's got to got to make you take on a viewpoint maybe you're you're not used to looking at things differently or you know from a different angle feeling emotions you are not accustomed to seeing how people deal with those emotions and um\nThat's that's what theater is and that's why we are always excited with a new project and moving forward with all kinds of things I mean we've got some very interested in ... interesting things lined up\nAnd we've got so many we want to do and we've got to kind of would let down and and focused but uh it's just an exciting thing I mean the arts in any way or how many Prescott and the Prescott the area\nA great place for arts great artists great musicians and um\nWe're looking forward to really being a part of it now and in the future that's aired Matthew and Julie Chavez Harrington on behalf of tolerance project that was one last time when
