that it's breaking news I mean just today headlined Georgetown Prep alumni clarify meaning of devil's triangle in letter to Judiciary Committee\nNow this honestly sounds like a parody we have the Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate\nThe world's greatest deliberative body as it's known\nThe Judiciary Committee is pondering\nA couple of references in Brett Kavanaugh's high school yearbook\nIn Nineteen eighty three\nHere here's the story\nEarlier today a group of Georgetown Prep alumni confirmed Brett Kavanaugh's explanation of the term\nDevil's triangle\nWhich he was asked about by the committee effort surfaced in his year book before alumni who are named a land sea Davis Bernard McCarthy junior pull Marion Matthew Quinn clarified that the term devil's triangle refers indeed not to a sexual act as has been alleged by Kavanaugh's detractors\nBut rather to uh drinking game they played in high school they actually played the drinking game devil's triangle\nQuote devil's triangle was drinking game we came up with in high school it was a variation of the game quarters when we play devil's triangle for people sat at a table on the table three small glasses of beer were arranged next to one another to form a triangle\nEach of the four participants took turns being the shooter the shooter attempted to bounce a quarter\nInto one of the glasses wrote the alumni we do not remember the exact origin of the name but none of us use the phrase devil's triangle in our yearbook to refer to any kind of sexual activity\nTo watch it was just a game with glasses and the shape of a triangle if the phrase devil's triangle had any sexual meaning in the early Nineteen eighties we did not know what\nThe letter concludes so the biggest objection now again we don't have a letter clarifying booth thing\nBut I Do have the statements from Greg Tomlin I'm associate producer on the Michael ... who comes from very distinguished background his brother and his father\nAnd or his grandfather all graduates of Annapolis\nAnd naval aviators and great people\nAnd they say that in their family the term blue thing has been used\nUm I'm afraid to say to describe

want to speak for the demonstrators if you share some of their anguish and their occupation of the heart\nAtrium Senate office building I clearly if they're going to try to disrupt the business of the

[noise]\nThat what the committee found is held up and then so I'm [noise]\nThe main thing for me\nThat you need to go to the FBI\nAnd you need to ask them\nDid they feel like they were able to do their job without a fair it's not an easy answer and she is [noise]\nThey interviewed over a hundred and fifty people have been interviewed throughout the course of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nThere's

to vote they are going to be voting tomorrow on a procedural question which is going to be to advance the nomination to the Senate floor and apparently the final vote on the confirmation of Brett

uh the vote coming up very soon next week\nOr next Tuesday to be exact and that runs through a December the seventh and this is that a period of time in which a Medicare beneficiaries can decide to

move from one plant the other they can do that or they could also sign up for our switch plans in the Medicare part D as a dog a prescription drug plan a program so there are several\nIt both Medicare Advantage private Medicare Advantage plans in private about Medicare part D drug plans there's a variety of plans in most areas to choose from a and then a ... this was a period of time in which they can switch from one plant to another\nAnd again in the case of a Medicare Advantage they can actually totally get out of that program and go into the traditional Medicare program\nNow Dan also there

hand bucket actually has links to a pages that will help you compare different plans and so you need to be looking at the if you're talking about Medicare Advantage plans you need to figure out if the plan your enter the plan you want to move to has your doctor is within their network that's a really important consideration\nEach of these plans both of the uh the prescription drug plans and private medical Medicaid Medicare plans\nHave star ratings and so that's an important consideration to see you know the quality\nOf the plan um and then also both types of plans are there could be different types of cost sharing so different that Dr bowls are different uh copayments and so you know when you're thinking about moving from one plan to the next all those things have to take be taken into consideration\nOr to make sure that you're getting the biggest bang for your ... best coverage\nAnd also a very important thing on prescription drugs or is or when you go more when you move from one plant to another\nYou need to make sure that the ... the prescription drugs that you depend on are covered by their their that plans for me Larry than those that that particular plan will provide you with that particular prescription drug that's a very key thing uh so that answers the first part of your question\nNow or in your experience with the national committee to Preserve Social security and Medicare how often do you find beneficiaries making these changes\nThey're not making them very often I according to some polling that we recently did a only about Thirteen percent of of a\nResponse in our poll or changed their plans from in the ... if they're within Medicare Advantage or change plans from part a change to one of the other part D plans that are available to them in their area\nAnd that's consistent with the national polling that\nThe nonpartisan Kaiser Family foundation also has done recently too so that's not a very high number and what it what it tells a lot of us is is that a a there's a lot of people that are a lot of seniors they're staying and plants that are probably are not\nGood for them you know that the where they're not getting the most out of their

three versions the original Eighteen eighty eight eighty Ninety three and then there's the Nineteen hundred version which was record for a large symphony and then you'd have to have a large choir and that's\nA up to the John Ritter version that we're doing which is about twenty five years ago when he\n... he did the translation again the English translation of it and he he tried to put everything back to the Eighteen Ninety three version subscribe to a venue where you're performing while they're there you go and so the venue is a for us I think it's one of the best venues that\nThat uh we've ever performed in it's um it's the uh it's a church of a but silica a stature so it's very large should see something in the area of Nineteen hundred people\nAnd it's also in the shape of across if you look at it from above a as all the basilica as are the ah alter everything on the floor is all\nI'm a tile or and or or marble I think actually I think it believe it's marble and you've got a plaster walls plaster ceiling and would views and\nSo you have an echo I think the ...\nThat are on my next quite as a retired already you adapt\nTo that well you perform at a little slower uh and uh um for my taste\nUh and uh um for my taste or having been a singer in in my past and the song and those churches I come from Chicago where\nThere's a lot of churches like that for sure and we would tend to sing those that music with little gaps in the notes you know so that there could be time so could adjust for the echo mhm so rather than just connecting so instead of things quite as smoothly as you would say in a drier\nA venue than a acoustic Lee drier venue then\nUh if you do if you sing like that in a very very uh very bourbon and then you you are going to have them wash of sound which is\nIn some cases a desirable and in other cases if you're trying to understand the text or if you're trying to say something a little more ... with a little more um a accent to it then then you need actually need to have space between\nAh some of the notes and that is what I Am not an agreement or or I should say there are other conductors that are not in agreement with me on this but I I'm taking it from my previous experience uh from Chicago and singing and those churches while a group called music of the baroque\nOr with orchestra that was a group of thirty singers with a small chamber orchestra and we sang a lot of it's the Cato almost to the point of the Cato but the audience heard it as clear clean and let lego\nI think you just explain why we sometimes here at stadiums in arenas the national anthem singers sometimes losing track because they're listening to the echo correct\nExactly I've also had that experience all boy and so you basically ignore what you're hearing here the Saturday as hard as you listen now while you just you just turn it off [laughter] but um\nUh getting back to the project the um\nAnd it was a a project as all things kind of a genesis from\nUm uh last year when we program for this year a you know for the\n... the the idea was for Yahoo by college to have a little more presence out there and the other side of the mountain [laughter] because there's a satellite a campus and that sure and so uh I was given the go ahead green light to come up with it and do a concert out there and I could pick the venue\nSo I was aware of this church have having a attended performances there and and a Catholic Mass there as well\nAnd um\nSo I thought the foray requiem is a beer to appease a dear to my heart and it hadn't been performed\nUm as far as I Know in recent years but it's only a thirty five minute peace so in order to make it a more um you know more of a concert or I've added to other pieces that are high interest I Believe and they are a piece of that I was familiar with\nA more start with a English piece called the lord let me know mine end and that's by Maurice green and he lived in sixteen Ninety six to ... to Seventeen
