go well it's a toss up and it's close but there is some very very sound advice\nBut there is some very very sound advice it seems to me that is given to Democrats by a leading Republican and somebody who is one his own house elections by huge margins one two terms also by huge margins as the governor of Louisiana\nHis name is Bobby Jindal and he wrote a terrific piece that appeared in the wall

Seventeen Seventy six that our phone number ... you say make so much sense in other words just to give people a flavor of what you're saying\nYou were Democrats Democrats you write can support gay marriage without forcing small business owners to violate their religious beliefs and participate in the wedding ceremony\nThey can defend abortion without opposing the sorts of restrictions common in Europe including waiting periods and bans on midterm abortions\nBy global warming without making obsolete many Americans livelihoods in lifestyle if all of that is possible why do you think the Democratic party seems to be moving in the other direction\nOr Michael I think this is really an important moment for the Democratic party and they have to decide are they going to listen to the most\nExtreme base or are they going to try to become and remain a mainstream political party in the United states\nAnd I look at my wireless do another policy positions that they're certainly not going to appeal to conservative Republicans like me and I suspect many of your listeners I think by by trying to come to the middle of the Democratic party can actually recapture some of those voters who voted for Trump who wore consistent traditional Republican voter or\nThey can make the decision they want to become angrier and even more radicalized\nAnd they look they really have a choice if they pursue things like trying to impeach president proper trying to teach\nBrett Kavanaugh insist on open borders they insist on abolishing ice or Medicare for all those are great talking points on that excites their base and they can raise a lot of money from George Soros and folks like that\nI don't think they're going to win a lot of elections I think that if anything there and help the President Trump wins reelection I think the worst thing they can do is to continue to go to the far left but I think they've got a choice to make do they want to come back in the middle or they want to continue to be the angry far left party\nTake you and I send them in a movie review is ... ... by rapture eleven [noise]\nGoing to find out where after eleven the holidays are happening and rats

should get out and vote a particularly if you vote Republican but get a get out there and vote and participate in the process what's interesting to me is that there's some comment by Taylor Swift\nA

Swift saying get out and they'll get out and vote\nShe said I'm encouraging all my fans to unregistered vote\nAnd do not deserve a say in this country\nWho's right and the grade Tosh swift debate one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number let's go quickly to\nDavid in Houston, Texas David you're on the Michael ...\nYeah you know for many many years I've had problems with the Democrats could affect political if they should be through political malpractice but it always fascinates me when people are able to come to the root themselves I mean the right\nYou an author I have been unemployed for many many years ... water to poll mold that all that gumbo frequently during your show in Houston\nThey talk about war they're talking about we're in a war and so and if ... if you're listening to talk radio call so we're talking about how the war we're having with the ...\nI I think as as you know I I agree with you that does happen and I think it's unfortunate and\nI don't think you will hear that rhetoric on this show because I think it's wrong I don't think this is a war and I'll tell you why David and I've said this many times of the goal of a war is to destroy the enemy to kill him basically and uh the the goal of politics who to persuade people\nMichael it is you have friends who it is so don't know I'm a yeah OK you particularly don't say it but if you're friends through for people who you are\nOkay you know what I you probably have some friends who has some strange ideas to write this right [laughter] wait a minute wait a minute what about bad or or\nNot my prayer and I'll probably vote for him but in our foreign them are\nOkay well we'll vote for him a because again if you do that you're encouraging this left were drift of the Democratic party David I I'd like to sit down I imagine that you and I would find a lot that we would agree on it and by the way I Do agree with your basic point that's why I went to your call first\nIs because I think it is true that this tendency also exists on the Republican side\nBut I'll tell you what was very refreshing to me and I think it's one of the most important speeches in recent years\nWhen Susan Collins spoke on the Senate floor\nEvery word she said about a justice capital\nWas measured it was balanced it was persuasive it was none of this rhetoric is the other side is all wrong and we're All right and this is the basic point because even if you leave out the independent voters the people who vote regularly and they go back and forth between Republicans and Democrats\nThe biggest group of prospective voters in America that people don't vote on who aren't interested the people who represent this uh Daniel Tosh uh who are dumb as blank and move don't vote and don't pay attention\nTo try to get people to pay attention it it doesn't work to say that we're on the verge of Armageddon and and we're all getting ready to kill\nEach other what it actually works better it seems to me [noise] St Louis we have some good ideas about how we can change things for the better and in the midst of a big down day on Wall street today and a horrible horrible

these images were um posted on V. con topped which is um the Russian equivalent of Facebook\nThis is just one of those things where when people talking about America and the civil war the reason they

of fun but the other thing is is that it's not really expensive you know to do things in Prescott sometimes it gets a little pricey but this is thirty bucks how do you read that you can't beat that so it's going to be fun I don't know what I'm going to wear yet how the hoop skirt [noise]\nI don't know I I'm thinking of something like a felt skirt oh okay okay I'm kind of funky cutesy white cloud ...\nWell if you need reminders just to rent the movie Greece and they'll give you some idea that what they find that would be fun with\nNo yeah it's a good opportunity so who came up with the idea of a shock hop how creative\nI'm not sure who came up with the idea that I bet Alice ears did she might she might have I wouldn't put it it was something that just popped out of there and it was an opportunity and here we go\nWell that sounds like a like a real blast coming up on the twentieth right twentieth of October and then from sign is and it's um it's I hear from six o'clock the doors open at six and then it still use drop ... so I think it's going to be fun that sounds like a blast\nOh you've also got a very important ah annual Galen fundraiser coming up that'll be a Saturday November third this is an annual event\nYup that'll be Saturday November third this is an annual event tell us about that\nStill they'll send tuxedos oh I don't really need the I've been doing tool belt and tuxedo ... long time ago I was interviewed several times yes um November third is going to be our and I can't tell you how many since two thousand four we've been having till belts in tuxedos\nAnd it's just an evening of elegant dresses tuxedos but we have everything from T shirts that looked like a tuxedo\nTo cocktail dresses it's a dinner and it's um opportunity to fund raise for habitat because where our goal is always to try to build or try to fundraise to build one house and so it takes a lot of money and so when people come they know that this is a fundraiser so\nYou know they're looking at silent auction up opportunities jewelry art work\nI'm One of my favorites is um a pie a month by a lady in town who they pies\nWhich I always get outfit [laughter]\nUm but then there's car washes and dinners and lots of things and then there's live auction and live auction are the big item pizzas these are ... these are trips and of course these are opportunities that go along with building a house that maybe windows that can be\nUm a contracting company that's going to give you a home repair repair services so there's a whole lot of opportunities and then we have what we call fund a need and we of course we're going to build a house so there's a great need there so we give people an opportunity\nTo donate to an evening of of fun and and talks and you see videos and we we uh have a wonderful auctioneer that comes in from Oklahoma as\nA colonel Wayne when when and so he's fun um some people just come because he's so much fun\nSure comes in and for those need to tone or who haven't heard of talk she goes into boats\nOr true built into CEOs of course the tuxedos parties the gala did her book the tool belt part is what is what you guys really do that that is your corps building homes and tell us what a church to become the recipient of one of those homes or in free use it\nThere's no free house and it's kind of a long process you have to be income eligible we're looking at low income families\nSo their income has to be between thirty and sixty percent of the median for yeah pike county which let's just say sixteen thousand two thirty two thousand for a family of four and\nThen you have to be willing to partner you have to be willing to do the deal that means helping us do your sweat equity volunteering for opportunities such as at tool belt\nAnd then there has to be a need and the need doesn't necessarily say that you're living in a of falling down house which many times it is ... it can be that you're paying too much rent more than thirty percent of your monthly income toward your rent\nI Know that most people are now in these states pay more than thirty percent but that's our guideline we look at that so you can live in a nice apartment but there might be five\nPeople in that apartment that's two bedrooms and it's kind of cramped or it might be eight people in a two bedroom apartment and it's really cramped so we look at that too because you can of many of our families just cannot can't afford it\nAnd then the differences is when they get their mortgage they're thirty or mortgage it's an affordable Morgan ...\nSo the sales price to the family is the appraised value\nBut what they pay back to habitat is what they can afford it's based on their income so we do that or we have to do that we don't want people in the neighborhood to say that they're building one of those habitat houses and it's going to bring my values down you know\nWe have praised by appraisers and that means it's equal to those houses in the neighborhood\nAnd these people in the home or invested not only financially but physically Arctic\nOh absolutely because they have to do up to adults ... to do five hundred dollars a sweat equity\nAnd a single parent um Parenthood household how to do two hundred and fifty which means working out on the job site working at a rate star\nWorking in the office helping has said events down in the courthouse square all kinds of things to get their hours speaking of the story tell us about that oh you haven't been to the restart I've been a couple of times so pay I read store is is just what it says it's a restart reusing of items we have\nAnd that's not just all building materials people think oh I don't need to go to the store because it just has lumber and nails and no no it's got everything you can imagine accept closing and so other thrift stores in town and have a lot of clothing we don't have any so we\nWe have furniture we have refrigerators we ... we have we do have lender lumber and we do have opportunities of other we call and chat skis you know get little knickknack things and dishes and\nAppliances there's just about anything on any given day when I Walk in that store thinking and I usually leave my purse in the car\nBecause I'm usually going to find something so every time I go on that star there's something there is something that I Know that\nMay have come from in a state that the kids come in and they have to empty the house quick and so they'll call habitat we come and pick it all up but sometimes there are some things have of great value recently we had these robo dogs\nThat were given to us and there's a whole cult that goes with these Japanese robo dog can we had I think we had a a dozen of them so\nThe city's bicycle pedestrian

associate professor in the department of political science at ... university we spoke with Travis a several weeks ago about whose new book\nSuperhero ethics uh we're glad to have him on the show regarding why we need to rein in our divisive politics which neighbors are treated as super villains we need to restore civility to our public disagreements Travis you are of course obviously a big fan\nOf a superhero comics and characters and you related how some of those could save America but I'm reminded of a a quote from years ago that said the government works best when it protects us from each other who works at least when it protects us from ourselves you see that going on today\nSaudi Arabia day or whatever what I've been thinking about lately is the way in which\nAh it seems like we are oriented seeing ourselves a little too much in the direction of\nWith a from a comic book perspective are likely great cosmic powers and as if there is a great cosmic bottle when we were all enlisted we fancy ourselves to be a heroes but we might be a little more than ... cannon fodder\nGreat cosmic vital pitched in a fashion and which are like on a fourth old fashioned comic book cover where the characters are aligned on the two sides whether it's super powers are ready to blast each other to bed\nAnd we have a difficult time seeing each other as a fellow citizens with whom we might have disagreements perhaps even stronger disagreements ... allies the ways in uh in order and Republican or a deal with these things\nBut instead we find ourselves lined up against each other as it were you were ourselves a super heroes [noise] uh and and catch battle with people who can't see but uh anything left and super villain we\nUsed to a tune into new used to always hear facts that may challenge our preconceived notions now it seems an awful lot of a nice choices with cable and satellite news seems to be an echo chamber for our own confirmation bias do you think that makes this a problem worse\nAnd I think it's I mean we're further and by the nature of the news industry today that profits off of\nThe deepening and worsening or passions and making us feel like we're so in danger and we have no choice but to have our attention are constantly on a screens paying attention to whatever they are and who are selling us in terms of how file horrible things are [noise]\nThan how I was scared we shouldn't be\nAnd you know the cage I like to point to is how Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill who could not be more different would fight like cats and dogs during the day in Washington then sit down play gin rummy together at night that's not happening today is it\n[laughter] no I think it's the young civilized a\nScore and the degree of her fury a air that we see being played out in the centers of power are now being replicated across our communities across or neighborhoods across or social media feeds\nIn which a the idea that we might try to have a civilized conversation to express and understand why we hold the positions we do other people have\nA different position and and in a in a fashion that treating each other with respect to work to try to persuade each other to change our minds [laughter]\nAnd do we take our heels in and get our metaphorical Bob\nAnd ah attack each other instead of trying to\nAnd uh attack each other instead of trying to at least understand why anybody else might disagree we've decided instead\nTo give the people with whom we disagree the worst possible interpretation of\nTheir uh their judgments the worst possible interpretation of their intentions and motivations cast them in the role of the devil or the demon or the super villain because those are conditions under which we can you know they're not conceive of ourselves as heroes engaged in some sort of\nValiant effort in order to destroy the evil in our ...\nThan anybody who's ever tried to write a screenplay knows that even if you're writing a comedy you have to create conflict do you think the national news media is engaged in that trying to create conflict yes yes\nYes I think that they have an interest in doing\nSo or the demonizing the other side do you think well\nWhen you get to that point in which the only possible interpretation of the parents of people with whom you disagree can only be that they must be the most ignorant a malevolent being or you can imagine and then that seems to be the conditions under which contractors are being encouraged\nOr you have a great quote here it says lead tree story civility even in the midst of our disagreements refused to be manipulated by those who have the power to gain or profit to make off our readiness to enlist has their millions or henchmen or cannon fodder\nTurned down to twenty four
