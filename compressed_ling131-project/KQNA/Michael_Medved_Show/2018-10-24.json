disturbing\nDevices that have been dismantled in one of the things that the bomber I think is seated in already despite the fact that none of the bombs going off\nIs getting the attention of the whole country\nPart of what's fascinating here is a lesson in how media works because it was yesterday it was last night\nThey found a bomb that had been delivering hand delivered\nTo the rather remote isolated outside New York city home of George Soros the billionaire democratic donor\nAnd philanthropist all over the world I mean I guess philanthropist would be a generous term but he's somebody who was funded\nA lot of left wing causes and by the way one thing about George Soros it it it ... to view him as a fountain of diluted evil\nHe does deserves some credit from Thirty years ago for helping to win the Cold War no really he helped to fund a pro democracy\nNo really he helped to fund a pro democracy efforts in some of the Eastern European countries and then even having having noted all of that\nGeorge Soros gets these bombs and it's a kind of OK story but all of a sudden you plan a bomb at CNN headquarters in the middle of New York city in the middle of Manhattan and divert traffic on the street and it's treated like an emergency and boom\nNow all of a sudden it is a wall to wall they are treating this like some kind of devastating terror attack is the only thing that has been covered in the news\nAnd\nPeople were demanding whereas the president one of the president have to say rather than saying anything well he had a public event planned for later that day\nHe had a statement prepared for the public event in a statement was fine there's no way that anyone can look at that statement and find anything wrong with it in fact let's listen to the first part of what President Trump had to say about this attempted bombing and wounding and maiming and killing\nInvolving his defeated opponent Hillary Clinton and\nBarack Obama and Michelle Obama in their home\nAnd the former attorney general Eric Holder or of or the Obama administration along with representative Maxine Waters apparently and we had a caller who referred to the bomb that had been apparently though this has not been confirmed planted in the same building\nThat houses the San Diego union Tribune the main papers in San Diego but apparently that same building had the author so senator or one of the offices field offices intercom lot higher is so\nThat potentially could go along with very prominent left wing targets and that would be the first person\nReally who is identify more with the Bernie wing of the party then with the very left mainstream of the party that Bernie weighing being left of left a one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six year was the president of the

first time an African American ever been fire chief of the city of Atlanta\nAnd uh Jason Riley writes last week after four years of litigation this city agreed to settle the case and pay its former fire chief one point two million dollars Gilman Tom friend had been fired\nBecause on his own time he had written book promoting marriage and was involved in a Christian a men's study group about preserving in promoting marriage he was fired\nAnd because he he didn't include a gay marriages you to believe or in traditional marriage\nIn any event Mr Cochran setting an interview yesterday that he was pleased with the outcome and look forward to getting on with his life the first Amendment rights that are assured in our constitution of been upheld\nBy the ... is a sad reminder writes Jason rally they hostility the progressive politicians and other government officials are directing the people of faith who dared voice on fashionable opinions bakers the florists and fire chiefs who

about Ninety seconds get what you can for the alliance defending freedom that so I go to Michael ... dot com and click on the banner\nAt the top of the page for the alliance defending freedom\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number there was a statement from a Jeff Zucker who's president of CNN and he says this statement there is a total and complete lack of understanding of the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media\nThe president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter that's far they've shown no comprehension of that\nOkay so that it that again is an attempt\nBefore anything knows anything anybody knows anything about the shooter to basically blamed the White House and blame White House rhetoric for these attacks now if these attacks or inspired by President Trump's hatred of the media\nWouldn't you expect media companies to have been prominently targeted and you say well CNN was well known won it\nThat package that was delivered to CNN and the name on it of John Brennan the former CIA director has been very very critical of President Trump remember President Trump removed his security clearance\nAnd a yes or that John Brennan's name spelled wrong but it was addressed John Brennan care of CNN [noise] it or to the very best of my knowledge\nThere is no report yet of any other media company and the San Diego union an evening Tribune it apparently it was just the same building they were in the thing was in the mail room it was addressed that they think though that has not been confirmed yet either\nTo senator Kamala Harris who has an office in the same building\nOf this ... it seems to me um the the idea is similar to the stupidity of suggesting that somehow by President Trump's intent Britain foolish criticism of the media and I think it is foolish and stupid and wrong but equating that\nWith the ... murder that really you you want to show me that okay I'd I'd love to hear from a prince Mohammed bin ... oh yeah President Trump told me it was okay I heard him attacking the lying stinking disgusting fake news media\nAnd I thought okay I'll do something and no of course he didn't think I didn't didn't at first of all we don't even know psalm on a ... was actually directly responsible he probably was but the idea that he was somehow encouraged by Trump's ongoing feud with MSNBC and CNN\nIs ridiculous I Do hope\nThat when we emerged on the other end of election day whatever happens and I hope urgently ... earnestly that the Republicans prevail\nBut that we can move on from this this stupid back and forth on both sides it doesn't do the country any good to have voices in the media just perpetually blaming the president for everything and attacking him for everything\nWith a visceral hatred that I Do believe is unique it goes beyond anything\nThat they applied to George W. Bush Ronald Reagan or anyone else\nLet's um\nOr go to a\nJohn Berman\nWho is an American news anchor and currently the co anchor CNN Uday with Allison income or out on CNN he's a regular uh released presenter of Anderson Cooper three sixty this is what he had to say\nThat could have been sent to John Berman\nMeant to be because they said John Brennan on the packages had Brennan B. R. E. N. A. and I see okay so nobody knows who that package was sent it\nBut if it was sent to John Brennan which is more likely than he's another politician not primarily a media figure um meanwhile\nThe Dow is down sharply\nAnd says technology stocks led the market deeper into the red on week earnings reports for may TNT and Texas Instruments the NASDAQ last more than three percent\nThat of course MCI's attack the the Dow Jones industrial average is down [noise]\nMore than six hundred points at the moment [noise]\nWell at the moment the market's close [noise] ah [noise]\nAnother six hundred point drawn [noise]\nIs that a response to ah [noise] once this um [noise]\nMad bomber did [noise]\nOr do you think it's mad bombers plural we will get to that and the response on the caravan coming up [noise]\nHusband was researching on the Internet of ways to ease my paint in both of my head and it was at a point where I couldn't even hardly walk so we ordered it and it took about\nI'd say five days of being on it oh my gosh I I don't even feel like I have any problems whatsoever I think you with all of my heart this product is amazing and I and so so thankful\nOkay uh you will be thankful to because relief factor kicks in in just five or six days you feel a real difference the pain is reduced sometimes entirely eliminated and certainly at the end of three weeks more than Seventy percent of people are so gratified was the impact of taking relief factor\nI've just Nineteen Ninety five for the first three weeks by the way they're so satisfied and gratified by taking really factor\nThat more than Seventy percent ended up going getting more go to release factor dot com that's relief factor dot com nothing to lose but your pain and the whole world to gain\nMeanwhile what do people have to gain by praising the caravan will get to that coming up on the ...\nMy bills now offer your specialty buy one get one free to do my little dog dog usually provided\nTiming is everything in the gold and silver markets and it's true it's Michael Mann that here for American federal rare coin and billion although you can buy at the right time if you buy the wrong coins\nWell you may not make a profit when gold was four hundred dollars announced many people were talked into buying five dollar ten dollar and twenty dollar gold coins now unfortunately most of the people bought these so called semi Newman's medic coins like the twenty dollars chain gardens and liberty had gold mines they haven't\nBroken even yet on their investment now it's incredible given the gold has risen approximately three hundred percent since then to wall timing is everything if you buy the wrong coins the\nTiming doesn't matter that much having a dealer who cares about positioning you win the white types of coins or bullying will mean more to your portfolio than anything else my experience has shown me that and that's why I only deal with Nick ... and the American federal team whether you're buying or selling call American\nFederal rare coin and bullying called toll free\nEight hundred to two one seven six nine four that's eight hundred to two one seven six nine four or American federal dot com American federal dot com\nWhen it's so hot that even starting the car becomes an adventure and pain\nHow it's time to call one hour heating and air conditioning always on time for you to own a a darn what our heating and air conditioning\nAt Norfolk unsafe we stand for life liberty and pursuit of said let me think that\nIs this is Jody I Am so excited we are now the largest authorize liberty dealer in northern Arizona and you follow the norms liberties have are made right here in the u._s._a. and have lifetime Maury check out the new show room of liberty home and gun safe life liberty and norms laughing have\nMore could you walk safely Liberty's face at norms impressive valley\nIn Arizona your words to mean something for a Washington politician like more than ... it doesn't mean much at all\nIt's bad enough the independent fact checker ... valley lying about her opponent repeatedly me can fall into great acclaim\nFor what's even harder to stomach she lied about our future\nSally told her she protect our Medicare\nAnd she didn't she voted for a play on the wall Street Journal and with a century or Medicare and when she promised to protect millions of Arizona's who have pre existing condition she lied about the two buildings free time to those protections in with insurance companies to nine gear to people with diabetes asthma even cancer\nEvery broken promise every lie\nSally betrayed if we can trust them it's always we sure can't trust her to be our senator\nPaid for by women the W.

percent perfectly\nWithout for ... or ...\nA one eight hundred Ninety five five Seventeen Seventy six however\nWhen uh people like Senator Kamala Harris the Democrat junior senator from uh California the senior center from California who's about to get reelected by the way is very very very very senior it's eighty five year old I'm Dianne Feinstein\nSo this dynamic duo uh basically things not the Trump can do no wrong of course they think Trump can do no right and er here is Camelot Harris giving you her idea\nOf what America is all about and how that\nThe caravan which has now said to be down a little bit to six\nCaravan which has now said to be down a little bit to six thousand people who are marching toward our border here senator Harris'\nWe are\nOur strength and all this and that we are eight eight eight eight tolerant country\nIn handling them [noise]\nAnd you're on the basis of our country what our country want another one of our country and they want leaders who are focused on the town that they hadn't they hadn't paid by the end of the month every month that they're going\n[laughter] I don't think they are monitoring empowering\nOkay not villa find somebody but has she answered the question about what should be done when the caravan comes to the borders of the United states\nAnd and this is where the Democrats fail completely because they have nothing to say about it\nIn other words it's least President Trump has a virtue of cat clarity here he does not want some kind of mass entry into the United states and by the way we get along I think relax a little bit there's an interesting piece in the Los Angeles times\nAbout the asylum process and about the level of illegal immigration and it uh\nIt it mentions that illegal immigration right now is at a forty year low\nThe only years where illegal immigration has been even lower than it is right now\nWe're the last three years including last years of the Obama administration has been brought way way down and brought down by three quarters way greatly reduced part of it a bad economy\nPart of it much better border security which began by the way under President Bush in any event here's the interesting thing\nWhen people come here\nIn terms of uh applying for asylum\nBetween the years two thousand twelve and two thousand Seventeen in other words including the Trump Administration\nImmigration judges turned back Seventy five percent of the people who came here from Guatemala seeking asylum\nSo she may say it's America's strength to be tolerant accepting but right now including under President Obama and yes under President Trump most people are coming looking for asylum are turned back\nAnd that it seems to me is reasonable it says the Trump Administration has made the process even more difficult by ordering immigration judges to stomp granting asylum to virtually all those claiming to be victims of domestic violence a move that could block tens of thousands of people from gaining permanent entry into the U.S\nAnd in other words if you're running away from an abusive husband\nYou probably don't have to run away two thousand miles to get to the United states\nAnd that seems to me is reasonable enough or let us go to your calls to John in Columbus ohio John you're on the Michael Mann that show\nI'm Mike I'm yeah I I just find that you know disheartening and an unbelievable ... out the five and paid for that left side media line they don't give you that the whole story it cut things out anything they can do\nIt that we're really perpetrating a flawed as far as I'm concerned but I'm ... and the the that the political people on the left side\nThat are that are lower than bottom feeder tactic of Mary and President Trump and it is a lot of a ... he's pretty much kept this war he stayed on target these trying but like you said nobody is perfect guy created nobody's perfect\nRight but the point is it don't you I I don't get any would be helpful if folks on our side didn't for instance chant lock her up lock her up um I mean again it's I I think the American people are kind of tired of that and that's OK maybe in the height of a campaign\nFor stringer for

a lot of these women and um we're into a causes quietly giving money and time\nUm people don't really know that Amy Winehouse was like extravagantly charitable she gave so much money to to charity and Qatar and all these other things I mean you think of her as just this person who's constantly falling apart but that that's not the whole story of who she was\nUm an anti Lennox he has a an NGO called the circle that this remarkable things for women all over the world Melissa Etheridge Bonnie read Shirley Manson of garbage I mean all have I have done so much with their\nCelebrity and you know people say oh don't use your your platform but that doesn't political it just really good work Aretha Franklin St things very few people know how much she did for others\nAnd so there is that a is there is still the fact that they've outlive outlast in and out so many of their male contemporaries increasing island is still on tour and she just turned Seventy\nWanda Jackson is still making music with Jack White of the way she's eighty one while I mean it was guided forty two so\nYou know with all these women are are strong and tough and beautiful and it's just they're just say lasted and and you know kept creating music we all are still enjoy\nIn the last couple of years we've all become familiar with me to stories involving actresses has that affected female musicians to\nIt's interesting when I was reading the book than me two story really broke open and that's a woman in music I mean I'm I'm familiar we're all familiar with uh with uh the stories and a lot of these stories that I found have already been told and these artists have been telling them whether in song or in the media\nBut nobody was paying attention I mean ... told the story about being chased around a piano in a studio and about a\nRadio program or patting his lap and say come over here we'll talk about getting that album play it um but nobody was listening so I put some of those stories

don't they don't\nStop at a ... they don't go oh that's fun is I'm not going to get into that they just love music and I have this passionate love for for all kinds of music and sort of an understanding of it and\nI think that helped in communicating with a lot of these artists\nIn communicating with them that you discover a glass ceiling that kept them from getting a record made or played [noise]\nThat is a very interesting question I mean you know with the art it's not like I'm the C suites grade it's kind of a different thing but there were different challenges a lot of being told no\nMillion insect species around us today meaning that we've only yet documented about one fifth of the total diversity that is out\nThere now you're a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and the senior curator of entomology at the University of Kansas or tell us about the uh Ninety five percent of what we would call other bees that comprise the world's bee population\nYeah um we tend to think about honeybees rightly so but there are only seven species of honeybees throughout the world and yet they're twenty thousand feces\nIn addition to the honeybees and so there is this rich variety of diversity out there\nAnd we tend not to think about them at all and so they include mostly solitary species such as carpenter bees sweat bees alkaline be nocturnal be fire ... whole rich panoply\nOf these wonderful pollinators 'em and all of them are jeopardized and so it behooves us to kind of protect them all and not simply focusing on the one that we're most familiar with\nYour book also talks about insect agriculture and the way that insects evolved agriculture in animal husbandry\nYes yes long before humans didn't at least thirty five or forty million years ago insects had already develop their own sustainable agricultural system from both termites in ants have independently of all the means to go out and harvest\nFungi and bring them back into their colonies and develop crops I'm using the results of the labor's to feed the rest of the colony\nAnd answer will actually go around and tend aphids just like we tend cows and we milk cattle they will go out and they will milk um aphids for honey do insert similarly use that as a source of nutrition within their math in your\nBook points out some of the many benefits of having our insects in this world but you also spent some time talking about pets parasites and plagues don't you\nKnow whether we like it or not they they're we have sort of a love hate relationship with insects we have to love them on the one hand since they pollinate our many fours than they are served as a source of food and medicine\nUm but on the other hand they also can bring about great ruined too as a termites will

works that are now difficult to access some of the public rarely ever get to see\nAnd yet are the original works through which many of these discoveries were made and\nSo while they are wonderful scientific documents they are also um wonderful examples of artistic expression because obviously the times in which these studies were undertaken it was not possible to run out and grab a quick snapshot of something instead you had to have\nTalented artists who could go and render insect faithfully\nAnd many times did so with a great deal of artistic flair as well [noise] um so they are wonderful highlights to a supplement to work with\nWhen our listeners reading your book I bet that would be surprised by how many insects are so skilled at camouflage and mimicry\nYeah it starts off in the most simplest case as a insects who are for example you know sort of a standard dream color and so allows them to blend in naturally with the foliage\nGoes all the way to much more complex systems where by for example a little late swing larvae who reverberations predators and feed on aphids can go about and they themselves don't necessarily resemble anything so it makes it difficult for them to hide but they can go out they can survey their environment\nThey can selectively grab materials from an environment to building in dormant on their back and disguise themselves so that they can go about unnoticed even for much though is to going through and sampling the ... the carcasses are their prey\nTo that they can sneak in amongst their prey sort of as a wolf in sheep's
