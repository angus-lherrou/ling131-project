suggestion by President Trump that somehow if Honduras doesn't stop the flow of people if Guatemala doesn't stop the flow of people out of their country and to Mexico and then making their way to the United states the President Trump will remove all foreign aid from Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador those three countries\nThey're owned by the way destitute dysfunctional ah countries I I'm I'm Glad that President Trump does not appear to be repeating this and I hope you stop saying stumps repeating it\nBecause it it's wrong it is wrong at first of all if you want to look at it are foreign aid budget\nTo those countries almost all of it is military or law enforcement aid to helping the war against drugs and to help a battle with gangs like MS Thirteen\nAnd a two to basically aid local law enforcement to try to avoid corruption and to bring order instability in those countries in other words\nAre foreign aid budget which amounts to less than one half of one percent for all three countries of our total foreign aid budget\nThree countries of our total foreign aid budget in other words you're talking about zero point five percent of our total foreign aid budget\nWhich then comes to point zero zero five of our overall budget is its incentive has mostly small in comparison to what the government spends\nBut it's spent non for the benefit of people in El Salvador Guatemala or Honduras ... spent for the benefit of us\nTo prevent some of these gangs from flourishing and then coming over here to prevent the kind of total societal breakdown that sends desperate people trampling north with no permission and NO PLAN\nAnd a ... frankly cutting all foreign aid to those countries\nWould make it harder to stop the advance of future caravan now are these caravans organized by George Soros know\nAre they organized by leftist politicians in Honduras absolutely and it's reported in the New York times and everywhere else\nAnd the idea that that somehow Democrats one to use this as a political issue\nSuggesting that we have to show some kind of a welcoming to people who are desperate who were decided to march up to the United states nowhere else they they wanted to go there probably places where they could establish themselves more successfully and more immediately\nBut the United states backing\nAnd we simply cannot\nCannot uh allow the fact that the people want to come here\nTo allow people wanted to come here who are willing to force the issue\nLet's go to a Kurt in Minneapolis Curt you're on the Michael ...\nMichael Vick protecting recalled a grade really into my question like I couldn't have ... I I don't feel that we shouldn't let any of these people are given earlier with Ireland\nBut what can we do what our options or ... I mean you may have too much and good but what they're obviously traveling through other you know Mexico depending on where they're coming from but it like what your what your diplomatically and what can we do immediately\nOkay well first of all Mexico has not been terrible on this and even President Trump has agreed that the new the new president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\nUm a agreed to some level of cooperation they want to discourage these people from going through Mexico and the numbers of apparently declined recently but I have been cut in half\nWhich means that maybe half of these people have uh gone in another direction or split off from the caravan or are finding some places to stay in Mexico it seems to me this was an area where government can cooperate with and work closely with private charities\nAnd they're all kinds of private charities\nThat could take it among themselves to greet these people on the Mexican side of the border before they get into the United states and say hey we're gonna help you get back home and when you get back home we're going to help put your feet on the ground and we're going to help work with you I I Know that the charities that

continuing to help the local law enforcement\nSo that it's not a situation where people are shot in the street all the time\nAnd it's it's much better to invest money in that it seems to me\nThen

wait wait I've never\nI've never heard CNN describe antifa as doing social justice work and Florida describes themselves as social justice warriors and that your job or their sucks but I've never heard I've never heard CNN or MSNBC or any major mainstream media source say that antifa was good guys\nWell at least the the point that I'm trying to make is they're not out clearly making them out to be the bad guy and the people who are the the voice that they have on their network at least hold them to a high regard and they're not shutting that down and and I totally understand that but\n... and look I think what you're saying is true I think there is a profound biased throughout media news it it's it's very very biased and they they certainly treat neo Nazis a much more harshly or Proud Boys much more harshly than they train antifa\nAntifa deserves just the same kind of contempt and just the same kind of criticism\nBut that's different from making things up\nAre and and to say that
