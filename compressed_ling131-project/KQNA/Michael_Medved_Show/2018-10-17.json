A. hyphen age CSI dot net or called the box office at nine to wait for four or five three to eight six\nOne uninteresting selection because you know when you mentioned a combination of far she meets feel more a plus the Neil Simon a label on it and you have the self styled detective\nOr in this I'm picturing some combination of inspector crews showed me a Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot row\nYeah well you know it when what struck me is that Neil Simon maybe experiment it and then place it would do something different for a change you know maybe I have no idea I didn't look up the history and as I said this is one that that would've given me more insight if I had seen the play before\nSo I don't know you know you know as a reviewer\nOn a plane in like this it most just drive you mad not to be able to give out more details because they would spoil some new twists right yeah\nThere is you know I wanted to get more information than I did not know I Can't in this case you know I'm so [noise]\nYou know it's a it's a good production in well acted um there are some surprises the set is wonderful the costuming is terrific um it really does gain depth in that kind of psycho drama that goes on after Gabrielle arrive and makes it all worthwhile\nYou mentioned blue streak when Bush was my neighbor for two years ago I used to see her doing improv comedy to what a talent show is you know she's been several pieces shows she has yet I've seen 'em when you when you when you use this term before when you've done a reviews of players\nHow can you tell when the direction is especially good [noise]\nWell this is the coordination and everything you're seeing and hearing\nYeah I think well it depends on the type of play it is if it's a comedy which this one apparently was supposed to be but it doesn't hurt that it turned out not to be is a real comedy than the direction is everything especially with amateur actors\nBecause you have to have the timing down just right for the last to come across right if it's a drama\nOr something like this play turned out to be there and\nIt's not so much about the timing as just the buildup of the mystery that suspense the actors have to get that right and then in the end\nYou have to feel their pain during that psycho drama phase that she that she kind of elicits with the questions she forces pretty much forces them to all answer\nAnd so and then when you see the relationships come together I really can't say any more that has to be well directed as well especially with amateur actors\nAnd I get the impression to that because the zoo's a play were it builds on itself during the play writes ah it's probably a good thing there's no information that way you don't get out from under the ether you don't have to recapture the audience right\nYes except in this case\nIt it kind of changed in the second half it got much more serious so maybe if there had been an intermission it would have worked out okay but yes there is a build up here and it's a very effective without the intermission\nFifty off and that's how the tea or price cities he's six twenty five twenty have your time for him for the savings are

listening to talk of the quad cities cake you and I want the here's your host DJ fall and we are back live up to forty\nOne with Raymond ... he is a certified public accounting who was the chairman of the board of ... pi college a re I understand the board took action last week to lower the property tax levy permanently tell us about that [noise]\nThank you a DJ I I Would like to start actually at the beginning because it's kind of interesting story we about eight or nine years ago build a facility located next to the Prescott library we have a pi college\nAnd the building was to be shared by us and northern Arizona University in a collaboration them\nAfter the change of administration in Flagstaff here about three or four years ago that you have a pi college involvement deep diminished to zero\nUh so that building became available if you will and we didn't have any plans as a board or as a college to do anything with that building but we had an agreement with the town of ... town Prescott valley to buy it back\n'cause it's located right next to the library and the deal was we could they would buy back if we asked them to at a certain price that price turned out to be four point four million which is about a million dollars more than the cost to build it\nSo January of twenty Seventeen we went back to the town of Prescott values that we would like to sell it back to you it took about Eighteen months to close\nWe got the money in August and\nDuring that time\nThe idea that the question was what do we do with the money hey we could spend it on current bills\nBe we could put it in the bank and maybe use it at some point in the future for future projects or see we could try to find a way to give it back to the taxpayer\nAnd we examined those things and it doesn't make any sense from a budget standpoint to by current services with one time money because next year they'll have the same expenses but you won't have the money\nWe didn't have anything on the horizon as a school for a new building projects that we could look forward to so we're leaving the money in the bank was an alternative but my proposal or my ideal was let's find a way to give it back to the taxpayer\nOne way to do that is to go to the general obligation bond levee which is what's called secondary property tax levy\nAnd find a way to reduce that button levy by the amount of the four point four million ... either buy the bonds back that are currently outstanding or put it into a sinking fund that will pay the bonds off as they become to do\nThere by taking the levee off the tax bill\nThat's the proposal I made in September after we knew the money was there\nAnd the board seemed to agree to do that we had to have a vote formal vote the bond council had to do the resolution you know all the legal kinds of things but in the October board meeting that was presented a the actual numbers turned out to be four point\nFour point nine million dollars\nIt phases in a little bit but by the end of the fiscal year twenty twenty two which is three years out\nWe won't have a property tax levy for the community the whole county that secondary property tax levy just goes away permanently it's gone which\nI've been told and I believe it's true that that's kind of a win for the taxpayer\nI gather with your input on this you draw from a ... a long history I'll put it this way if anybody ever puts together a who's who of business in the quad cities you're going to have about four pages tell us about your background [noise]\nWell I I took the nine year plan to graduate\nAnd I graduated in February sixty nine from in a you and I came to Prescott and I took the job that I currently hold which is an accountant became a CPA in Nineteen Seventy one\nProfessionally I'd been a part of a national accounting firm and I've been a part of a local accounting firm and now I'm just me my accounting for him as a staff of tree I've been doing this now for fifty years and I met a member of the community though for all that time mhm\nWhen someone comes to you for your services what are you looking for looking for someone with a challenge\nSomething that would give me something more\nSomething that would give me something more than just pure prepare my tax return that's in the business environment in the personal environment\nI take referrals from my existing clients if they're if they're interesting\nWhat I did in my early career though I think is what you're talking about which is I did all that I did the city of Prescott the city of Flagstaff the town of cotton wood the town of park Dale ... pi I'm\nSavings and loan\nYoung pie regional medical center all of these things during my early career led me to business how how things should be working and that's that's where that's thinking fund idea ... actually came from but I'm\nOver the years I have professionally done all those things but I've also tried to give back to the community\nThis community has been very good to me for fifty years and I'm a professional I make my living here I've done well\nAnd you but on the board of the occupied college for a long time you've also served in other public ... uh service roles in Prescott now the college is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary this year uh I'd been a pleasure to uh be a part of a couple of those doing broadcast remote to\nAh to note those occasions what is taking place and what does the future hold for the Occupy college well if I could show the people out there in television\nLand [laughter] if only if only a this is a Seventy five page brochure more booklet prepared by the college which was kind of a timeline history and\nWe've had three events so far we've had the Prescott campus event we've had the the the check event and we've had the\nPrescott bally's center advent and these are just gatherings with a band with with with the boots and things like this ... celebrating the the college with a with a cake and and the sort of thing\nSpeeches that kind of of the sea tac event was really interesting because see tech building was one that we bought in Nineteen or in two thousand and eight when I was chair of the board\nWe bought it because sturm Ruger had a building that they weren't using they said\nThis building is worth more than we are going to sell it to you for ... for five million dollars a hundred thousand square feet\nThree and a half to four acres on the airport with runway access I was out there last month yeah that is it's in my opinion that was a steel ... weather Ruger took place it took their donations for the difference between fair market value and what they sold it for you know I don't know\nBut we we know it was worth more than five million dollars we built it we bought it\nAnd we've it's actually the second the second\nIn terms of head count the second most busy campus on the pie college a a a system", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott
