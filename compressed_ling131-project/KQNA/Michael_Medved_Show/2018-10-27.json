realizing that President Trump is president Hillary Clinton is trying to come up with a way to combat that once you come up with\nBelieve it or not federalism Hillary Clinton one of the great advocates a federal power\nOf the modern era she is now discovering federalism I got amazing how this works downtown comes along and suddenly Hillary Clinton and the left are discovering that states are kind of break\nHere's what she tweeted yesterday in reality image approval court with the right one majority is it the state or new important front in protecting civil rights especially the right to the most vulnerable among us\nIs that really a new important front and protect with them or I\nOr does it turn out that the state we're always an important front in protecting so right now folks are going to say well think about the fact that states were responsible for him that true it was also states that were responsible for failing to abide by the fugitive slave act in an Eighteen fifty leading to the civil war the federal government was trying to force state in the north to abide by the fugitive slave act\nTaking the north shore of using for by by the fugitive slave act\nStates are only as good as the people who comprise them and their policy is only as good as the people who comprised them the one thing that it's certainly true is that the United states at the mixed\nState and and national took them as it is putting federal thirty nine\nOr they mix system state governments are designed to preserve the center for our city of locality in American Jurisprudence\nAnd the fact that blood is only now realizing this as soon as somebody who's in office they don't like in the head of the federal government demonstrates just have the time if they are because here's a thing Hillary Clinton and her ... if they ever gotten charge again how long do you think they'd stick by the state's rights proposal how long do you think they'd be in favor of states' rights the answer is five second by second\nAt the left is just it's honest about all this stuff that same left that proclaims that Donald Trump is just on a business is on when Hillary Clinton says she likes states where I\nKnow what Hillary Clinton mean and then she wants to use any optical to prevent President Trump governing but you know that actually believe in states rights and she actually believe in states where I Am presumably should want to demolition of ... to the states from the federal government across the board including if she'd been president we all know that that was never going to happen\nWe all know is that we're going to happen instead the truth as Democrats really want is to copy the policies of Scandinavian countries\nWhere people forget to tell you this\nBut the policy and Scandinavian country is not just the math and social welfare state and the amount of social welfare state paid for by enormous unbelievably catches\nThe taxes in places like Denmark and Norway fifty and sixty percent on everybody making more than ... years ... grand a year\nOr not talking about taxes on just the wealthy\nEven folks on the left are not willing to be honest about what exactly it would take to pay for all the crap that they are talking about\nInstead what they will do and they'll just kick the can down the road so what exactly are they proposing\nSo they're not really proposing federalism and they're not obviously proposing ... legislation is proposing spending a lot of money so now we're going to get in on the twenty primaries when the Democrats who can spend the most cash so we have Kamala Harris is proposing giving every poor family five hundred bucks\nBased on nothing we we really don't know where a Japanese money is going to come from how this is going to spur the economy any of that Cory Booker says well why do five hundred why not do a hundred times five hundred what's getting everybody Fifteen grand\nSo why not give me five hundred grand by the way we are not five million by helicopter pallets of cash\nOver Newark will just drop out of cash ... hopefully people get out of the way now there'll be crushed by money and die happy that apparently the idea of Cory Booker so corn into box which is the repository\nOf all things too but that's not saying that everybody at boxers do but there is some intelligence to block of all why they were made there is beyond that senator Cory Booker and introducing a bill aimed at closing the gap between rich and poor his ideas get lower income kids a sizable nest egg\nNearly Fifteen grand in some cases that they couldn't use for wealth building purchases like a down payment on a house or college tuition these opportunity accounts with theoretically make sure all children have significant assets when they enter adulthood rather than just those Robin wealthier home\nWell you know what this particular proposal relies on people to use money well you know what else relies on people to use money well basic reason in free market\nSo dropping cash on people\nWithout actually using that cash for the purposes\nInto counterproductive coming up the presidents of the United\nStates sweets his response to the migrant caravans bearing down on America as a father in law or is he right [noise] well yeah he kind of it and the fact that Democrats refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of the United states or more political move Ventura\nThat is not a recipe for victory\nAnd that's why President Trump the Republicans are going to win on this issue even Lindsey Graham was a real job on immigration right Lindsey Graham famously one of the gang of eight along with John McCain a big fan of immigration from even he said listen\nThis is not something we can do Nancy blows you would welcome the cameraman I don't know what happened Lindsey Graham whether he bumped his head or something but Lindsey Graham to point out the ... is really good and here's Lindsey Graham senator from South Carolina saying

actually deliver for working families out there that will foot good judgment on the court\nThat will stand up to the enemies of this country Nancy Pelosi will welcome to care of and fear a Donald Trump and the rest of us will stop them\nOkay well that that is exactly right and that's not out of lack of some of the U.S because of a country that has a rule of law must abide by that rule of law Democrat to continue to push the tissue aren't going to lose it's funny because Democrats are so ensconced in their own bubble in what poll showed that Democrats have far fewer Republican friends in a public and have Democrat friends\nBecause Democrats who live in areas actually see Republicans as nasty\nEvil human beings and so they won't even talk to them\nThey actually believe that it's a

I mean there's an amazing story is the way the media are covering an attempt by the department of education to the wind what title nine actually said so here's the headline from the New York times today is a transgender could be defined out of existence under a Trump Administration\nNow when you read that headline what does that sound like you it sounds like the Trump Administration is saying they're no such thing as transgender people or people who suffer from\nGenerated for your gender identity disorder that's what it would sound like from that headline is that what's actually happening\nNo that's not what's actually happening because that's idiotic and nobody is saying there aren't people who are transgender what the Trump Administration is saying is that under the law\nWas that have to do with sex discrimination or specifically focused on biological ... they're not focused on you thinking you were a member of a different track\nSo when the civil rights act was written and it included language about men and women and sex discrimination it did not mean that it affects discrimination for you to say that a man who shows up in a classroom a fifth grade classroom dressed as a woman\nAnd you say that's not cool we're not going to do that\nThat's not the same thing as saying woman can't work in the classroom that's not sex discrimination\nAnd that's that's what the Trump Administration saying they're saying\nBehavior by men is not the same as being female\nThat the actual what I'll read the actual article it doesn't it doesn't ban transgender people that sell what they're doing the media is so dishonest with regard to how they cover transgender issues because they refused to even acknowledge the fact that there is such a thing of biological sex it's orderly self defeating\nWhat the what the ... is a gender insects are exactly separate but gender is that\nRight so generous acts are completely separate you can be a man but your gender is female and that makes you a biological female that makes you an actual woman\nThis is how they want to read the law and make no sense under any circumstances I explain in just one second they think there's a winning issue I mean it's just it's insane it's insane\nBut first let's talk about your online security with all the recent news about online security breaches kinda tough not to worry about where am I ... making an online purchase simply accessing your email that could put your private information at risk you are being tracked on line by social media sites marketing companies your mobile or Internet provider\nNot only can they record you're browsing history them and tell us how the corporations want to profit from that information that's why I decided to take back my privacy using expressed VPN expressed VPN as easy to use apps that were on seamlessly in the background of my computer\nPhone and tablet turning on express again protection only takes one quick expressed VPN is rated the number one VPN service by tech writer becomes a thirty day money back guarantee and protecting yourself costs less than seven bucks a month there is no reason not to get expressed VPN particularly because of that money back guarantee I mean really no risk protect your online activity today\nFind out how you can get three months for free and express VPN dot com slash then he X.

President Trump rails at the fake news this is what he's talking about this sort of headline from the New York times transgender could be to find out of existence under tremendous ration when we're just going to disappear the transgender is now know that is not what the heck here's what they're doing quote\nThe Trump Administration is considering narrowly defining gender as biological immutable condition determined by genitalia at first the most drastic move yet in a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protections of transgender people under federal civil rights law\nWell because of gender is biological and immutable and it is delivered at birth\nNow with a lot since Saturday redefined the term one of the great ... areas of confusion in the transgender debate is what the hell everyone's talking about really I mean that because sometimes when people on what the gender what they mean is expressed feminine or masculine qualities and sometimes what they mean an actual sex and and impossible to tell which unless they actually about to buy\nAnd then they shifted definition based on what they want their point to the left is really the one making the case of only two genders they're saying that if you're a feminine man you're actually a woman and if you're a masculine woman you're actually a man if he wanted to find gender is just expressed characteristics of femininity or masculinity\nThere are seven point three billion genders on planet earth which means meaningless toward the means nothing if you want to say the gender has to do with biology\nYou have to separate it into sex sex is based on y chromosomes in X chromosome now they're intersects people did they very very small percentage of the population that is not the argument being made by transgender advocates they're arguing that you can be fully genetically male and female\nAll of this and make no logical sense it completely confusing because it makes no sense there was no internal consistency or logic\nAnd transgender civil rights movement they can't even find their term if they simply want to say people should be treated well I'm with you if they want to say that I have to pretend that a man who says he has a woman is a woman that Caitlyn Jenner is just as much of a woman as my wife gave me a freaking break and everyone with half a brain on planet earth knows that\nBut here's what the New York times has a series of decisions by the Obama administration moves into legal concept of gender in federal programs including in education and healthcare recognizing gender largely as an individual's choice and not determined by the sex assigned at birth first of all sex assigned at birth and the dumbest term in the world who are the gender assigned at birth\nAt least now you're being consistent with the terminology but even in that setting you can see the terminology shifting right there's gender and then there's sex assigned at birth\nYou told a sign a sex at birth\nBabies are born they are what they are when my girl was born she was a girl I did not find her girl\nYou know was either a girl genetics God that was sort of bacon in you know I Know 'cause she's a girl my God people and the same thing when my son when he was born\nYou know I knew he was a boy I looked at him\nWow isn't typical and it turned out he is in fact the boy amazing coincidence they come out and you know the all male characteristics and he also boy\nUnreal just amazing\nAlmost scientific ooh okay so here's what they think the policy prompted fights over bathrooms dormitory single sex programs and other arenas or gender was once seen as a simple concept conservatives especially evangelical Christians were incensed I Love the New York times conservative especially evangelical Christians that this is our way of slandering religious people as they can\nThey not people who actually use their brain and recognized that there are men and women and these are two separate category\nAnd that maybe they're women's groups that want our main women's groups and not have men who believe that women in those girls and the same thing for mental growth\nAnd the same thing for bathroom no it must be that there is those crazy people believe in the genes and it's those people the people who weren't for those crazies believing the Jesus then it would then everything will be fine that we can all acknowledge the men and women are exactly the same except for a little bit of appendage damn well\nHere's the New York times has now here's the bad stuff okay what's the bad thing that tremendous ration dead\nNow the department of health and Human Services is spearheading an effort but that was legal definition of sex under title mind the federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination and education program that we're seeing government financial assistance according to a mental obtained by the New York times\nThe department argues in his mental that the government agencies needed to adopt an explicit and uniform definition of gender as determined on a biological basis that is clear grounded in science objected and administrative all\nThe agencies propose definition when the mindset 'cause he's a male or female on changeable and determined by the general a person in ... according to a draft from you by the time and just being about once asked what happened he clarified using genetic testing\nHow in the world is that not to say to rationality and he will enter a woman I should be able to objectively tell whether you're a woman or not it shouldn't be up in age and get to you to decide\nAnd it's amazing to me that the same let that has now come around to Elizabeth Warren is not a Native American because now while education at American why isn't she Native Americans you should be why not she's more Native American and Caitlyn Jenner as a woman\nSo what exactly is the problem here\nIt's truly amazing so you wonder why the white doesn't trust the media you wonder why people are resonating to the right it's because of what instead that we absolutely ... bottom eyes ourselves\nOn basic concept like what is a woman and what is a man and we're supposed to pretend it's a great evil when the Trump Administration says gender discrimination means discriminating against women not discriminating against men who believe they are women\nIt's an amazing thing coming up I actually want you analyze the new law in the United states under title mine\nWasn't specifically meant that women or was this specifically messed feminine may

natural\nIt is well it wasn't just getting a cost I who at this point basically everything that he says the ... year diary because he had all the quiet stuff out loud it was almost anything Peter Alexander more objective journalism being from the mainstream media on the issue of nationalism\nYeah it definitely does mean under tones that are not just racial ... says something to the presence of sort of shied away from in the ass obviously nationalism was a phrase that Steve Bannon a obviously embrace over the course of the campaign and a lot of the president's opponents tried to pin this idea on him\nNow look at I'm somebody who said that I prefer patriotism to nationalism I don't think the national with them alone is enough I think there are ties that bind up it has a history of culture but what actually make the United states the United states is the root idea embedded in the declaration of independence and the constitution backed by two thousand years\nJudeo Christian History or rather three thousand years in Judeo Christian History\nAnd that's what makes the United states the United states and the idea of classical liberalism combined with cultural conservatism and that's what makes the United states' unique data unique idea in world history so I'm not putting than even the president using nationalistic language but isn't jeopardize white supremacy is anything\nBut again this comes back to the basic idea and you want to raise the temperature in the country you want to raise the meet me ... of people on the other side\nAll you have to do is just a question motives day in and day out and that's what we are now in the business of doing the truth is that in a country where we agree on Ninety percent of our bellies we really do I think in the end a grand Ninety percent of our bellies the only way you can divide up by\nCaptivating people would disagree with you on the manifestation of those values as evil nasty bigoted horrible people coming up the\nCNN believe President Trump is responsible for these heated rhetoric at least to violence but in and obviously doesn't have clean hands here either it seems\nOver a series of suspected explosive devices sent a prominent Democrat thinking we're listening with great interest in the president's remarks this afternoon we all take an oath to support and defend the constitution and protect the American people and that at first responsibility however President Trump's words ring hollow until he reversed as his statements that can do an act of violence time and again\nYou were versus his statements that can do an act of violence time and again the president has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and actions expressing support for the congressman body slammed reporter they own neo Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville and supporters of rallies who get violent with protesters dictators around the world who murder their own citizens\nAnd referring to the free press and the enemy of the people\nNow I think President Trump has a lot about stuff how 'bout that unclear about this\nBut you're actually going to blame him for this bombing state and so this is what you're going to do now\nI can remember somebody Nancy Pelosi just got a year and a half ago who was asked about Steve ... nearly being shot step you own died okay he was in critical condition he almost died it's a miracle that he live Nancy Pelosi saying how dare you blame us or Bernie Sanders for heated rhetoric that could have been connected\nWith the guy going on to a baseball field and shouting asking guns down members of Congress about health care that's rude is doing he was he was standing there screaming about health care while I tried to murder members of Congress there was Nancy Pelosi's response time she was right then you're not right now what's the difference now she gets to target right winners\nAnd there they say such a thing how dare they chose this individual does something if the wall and it was horrible what he did have tall\nFor them to all of a sudden these sanctimonious and since they don't never seen such a thing before\nIt's just it's it's just amazing so she's rumors I mean I Wonder what changed what changed his who was going to get one that's what changed so there is no such thing\nAs a sword that cuts both ways all we have in the United states at this point are a bunch of ... red blood on one end directed toward you and sharp on the other end directed toward your opponent we don't recognize that what we're actually holding in the store and if you use it on your opponent it can easily be turned back on you\nEvery store and has two legit but according to the left it's just a habit and you can bury it in between the shoulder blades of your political opponents\nHillary Clinton does the same thing so me former first lady senator presidential candidate she says wasn't as an American I'm worried about the level of our rhetoric\nSay well it's a person's I'm rage as an American I'm worried\nI worry about the direction of our countries\nI worry about what kind of world will be waiting for them\nWhen they're\nTeenagers and young adults and beyond\nOkay and it wasn't just Hillary Clinton saying that's our top aide Felipe brains who is really one of those ... people in American politics he was on MSNBC and he explicitly just blame President Trump's rhetoric for all of it\nThis is someone who has a weaponized Trump's Twitter feed and made it into a hit list he is addicted to their response and their response they are addicted to his um betrayal\nOkay so next time somebody who is a big Hillary Clinton fan decides to go and shoot up an office or invaded Fox News studio\nBut I guess we when Hillary Clinton because after all I recall when a minute ago one minute ago Hillary Clinton was saying you cannot be civil with the other side it was it was like what the date today today is the twenty fifth okay so what's your name at least twenty four ... fourteen days ago Fifteen days ago Hillary Clinton said that\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that Clinton village he can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to recognize and respect strength hey\nEverybody is completely full of crap everyone is completely full of crap\nWill get to the fullness of the crap in just one second\nBut first let's talk about what you do to get ready every evening I Love the dollar shave has everything I Need to look steel and smell my best friend even more is the fact they never have to go to a store\nHere to think that story you have to wait in line you have to find the product you have to deal with humans\nYes he doesn't make you do any of those things they deliver everything I Need right to my door and they keep me fully stocked and when I used I never run out here's how it works\nDollar shave had everything you need to get ready no matter what you're getting ready for them but you covered head to toe hair products skin ... they've got it and they have a new program where they automatically stocked up on the product you you do you determine what you want when you want to show the break your door\nFrom month to month once every six months I particularly like their ... delightful and keeps my skin\nSilky mood I also\nReally enjoy their black pepper and stage shampoo really smells good plus with their hands some discount the more you by the more you say right now about a bunch of stars that you can try for five bucks like the oral haircut after that restock box ships regular side product to the regular price so\nWhat are you waiting for get your stars that for just five bucks right now a dollar shave club dot com Waxman\nThat dollar shave club dot com slash been again\n... everyone a photograph including Andrew Cuomo and bill de Blasio both of them came out and they said listen we have to turn down the temperature in this country and have to start at the top\nWeird I remember when bill de Blasio was saying the police officers were just shooting black people for no reason\nAnd I remember when Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York so that everyone who disagrees with them on politics should get out of the state that is not an exaggeration he said that there is no place in the state of New York for you if you don't believe in same sex marriage and his views on social issues let me explain if you are sitting around today and uh going it's always the rhetoric on the other side this problem\nBy freaking near\n... everybody has a role in temping down some of the rhetoric here\nAnd that also means that\nBlaming the other side and suggesting that the other side of responsible for violence in meetings way worse country it's so funny everybody thinks they're fighting violence when they suggest the other side is responsible for violence when they just use mainstream political rhetoric you're actually increasing the chances of violence when you do that because you are eating everything up\nYour suggesting the other side is so evil but the very outer end of their ideas is likely to lead to death and destruction\nThat isn't that an American perspective on American\nBernie Sanders' can say whatever the hell he want no matter how wrong he is and how much he's actively saying go should people on the congressional baseball field that is not his ball and Donald Trump can say whatever he wants\nAnd you don't have to like it or whatever Donald Trump said he has the right to say that as long as he is not saying go beat up somebody right now go bomb someplace right now\nIf I found weary of all of us just because I Am weary of all the really I mean if we're going to have any sort of level headed conversation\nWhen to stop blaming each other for every crazy person who does a crazy thing enough is enough folks really really ... let's not making the country worst place\nAnd other news NBC News is actively hyping this Megan Kelly blackface thing and it's really stupid it's really stupid speaking of stupidity in politics so Megan Kelly we talked on the length yesterday Megan Kelly said on a show that she doesn't really understand why this woman who was in the real housewives of whatever why this woman\nWas in trouble for dressing up as Diana Ross at a party because when she was a kid people used the dark and their skin for Halloween costumes in wasn't a big deal and a bunch of folks had well blackface has along in a glorious history in the United states at insensitive shit you know what I learned something today that incentive I was wrong\nThat seemed like the end of the story so anyone really believes making Kelly's approval vicious or racist and they don't actually believe that of course nobody believed that nobody actually believe that Megan Kelly thinks black people are inferior genetically and why people are worse by people are morally culpable at a higher\nLevel than white people or any of that no one actually believe that but NBC and it's just shows you that capitalism when used by bad people\nYou know is not great OK NBC wants to get rid of making Kelly they want to get rid of making Kelly because they tried to push Megan Kelly into a box that is not properly fitted for making Kelly main LA is an excellent interviewer she's an excellent question\nKelly main Kelly is an excellent guess from your an excellent question and they form a lawyer and prosecutor that is where her role as best they tried to fit her into the Katie Couric ... morning news routine and that didn't work for them\nAnd so the ratings were not good and so they had signed her to an inordinate amount of money and now they're trying to push out the door are they doing not by actually actively stoking racial resentment in the United states is ugly style\nNBC News is now saying they're going to take the episodes of making a show this week and they were going to terminate her contract based on her saying that she didn't understand what the deal was about somebody darkening their face for Halloween costume\nThan anyone really believe that the embassy brat is really upset about that or their boycott is on his way or that and this was a actually vicious brutal KKK style racism they would actually think that no of course not doing anything is trying to stoke racial resentment for purposes of being able to fire somebody\nAnd they had the head of NBC News anti lack he openly ... into Kelly after she apologized she apologized and lack that there is no other way to put this but I condemned those remarks there is no place on our air or in the workplace or the very unfortunate and then lost our whole cover her comments on NBC nightly news\nAnd so the NBC decided to eat their own by going after making Kelly it's amazing how convenient that it\nI Know one on CNN criticizes CNN nobody on NBC News criticizes NBC News unless they are preparing to shop somebody up and throw them in the winter\nAnd that's basically what NBC is doing here I Wonder why nobody trust me I mean it is it really is a great media story of just how corrupt the media are\nThere is no question that NBC is just that something that plane that they still playing here in Oregon that they can make a move by making Kelly that they wouldn't otherwise be able to make contractually so well done over at NBC making the country at worst place they can save some money on a hole that you yourself box in the wrong way coming up\nThe presidents of the United states is using his cell phone apparently in ways that exposed sequence of the United states to foreign eyes and ears and this sounds bad because it really isn't Mary ...
