like\nWriting in the New York times and who is Neal Pollack or I don't know him personally but it says that he is the editor in chief of book in film globe and the author most recently of not coming soon to a theater near you\nSaw it was one of those people in there of course many many of them\nTrying to make a living putting words together\nAnd he says now in this piece that after the two thousand Seventeen World Series\nWhere he was living out a desire to see a Dodgers game\nHe uh looked in the mirror\nAnd realize he was wasting his life\nAnd he says I've been sober now for eleven

recreational in California or even went to a medical but all the stories we're following around\nIt became so much harder to quit because every corner you look you find it and everybody talks about it that you know it it it's a good thing and it's helpful but it's really not because that growers\nKeep thinking it's stronger and there's really no regulation out there to stop them from making it stronger and regulations on what type of pesticides they use on the actual marijuana but keep them fresh for longer so they can sell 'em at higher heart\nSo and I would go into one of the marijuana

consumer in the business to be able to try to work it out that step number one for sure\nAnd if people give the boots but it's a chance to do that in most cases that's exactly what happens and I bet you hear a lot of times from the business person I wasn't even aware of it was a problem because the consumer didn't make the booze and so what is that right\nA lot of times businesses are blindsided by a complaint that we will send\nOne of those see something on Yelp and go what happened\nExactly yeah or why were they so mean or so cruel they we didn't even know so especially if it's a small business ... given them well you should give any business an opportunity to try and write the wrong with the understanding that there sometimes consumers that you just cannot police\nYou know that's that's a key thing because you know I I spend a lotta years in a restaurant in industry and of course everybody believes the customer's always right now I work for a guy who won his menu put the reasonable customer is always right\nAnd he was type who if somebody gave them too much trouble he just tell them to go down the street to the other guy and give them their heritage and we welcome them doing that because once in a while there are people you're never going to please true\nThat is the price of one of the costs sure of doing business I think anyone who's been in business will tell you that young at how little businesses you know given advice given suggestions there are just there are going to be times where\nAnd suggestions there are just there are going to be times where you are going to run into those people and a lot of times it's best to resolving issue to the back of your ability to make a good faith offer and then with the understanding that this is the last time that never the Twain shall meet you [laughter]\nWell lately of the BBC has been warning consumers because we're looking into the holiday travel season where a lot of people are looking for a rental and vacation homes and what's been going on\nShore I Would like to say rental and vacation homes for holiday vacation travel and also because Arizona is beautiful in a lot of areas in the wintertime\nSo we have people from Canada a northern states in the United states there was no birds for the warmer weather to just come and hang out for a few months so they go on line and they'll see a a house in an area where they'd like to stay\nAnd they will put in a deposit or pay up front for the home only to later discover that it's a picture of a home in that area\nThat's owned by someone who lives there it's not surprising a rental\nCorrect a you know it it it pays to it pays to establish a relationship with\nThe people you're dealing with online and ask questions right\nCorrect so I Would say when we have reports of this happening a lot of times it's because people have gone to a website such as Craig's list\nA potentially they've typed in vacation rentals by owner not necessarily gone to ... dot com [noise]\nNow I Will tell you those sites do the best they can to vet who is on them but they're still I mean it's just it's a crazy big world out there and they just they can't catch everything so we definitely tell people to watch out for a deal that obviously sound too good to be true\nSo if you're getting a great deal like if you're like wow that is a smoking deal\nA hot deal if you're if you're having words like that run through your head where like I had to get this I got to get it now you may want to take a deep breath and just really research to find out okay is this legit before I give money to someone\nUm if you can see the property in person and if you're not there and like the gentleman that was taken advantage of in Canada\nLast fifty seven hundred dollars and in the closet for home that he wanted to rent for I think a couple of months three months over the winter\nAnd that may not sound like a lot of money to some people but to me that sounds like a crazy amount of money [noise]\nUm he didn't have anyone that he knew that he could call on if a if possible at all go with a reputable rental company in that area so that they can verify what you're getting ready to spend money on\nIf you have a friend there if there's any one you can call in if you're not in the vicinity we would highly recommend that and then of course to be pressured to act immediately yeah nothing has to be done right than if you're finding your doing that than you probably are going to be taken advantage of\nAnd if it seems too good to be true [laughter] probably lawyers you know on that note\nIn hot deals things like that we've seen major stories uh this year about hurricane areas floods and every time it was a major flood watch out if you're in the car market correct\nAbsolutely one hundred percent\nIt's something that they tell you to look for open up that trunk pop open that trunk and ... is the carpet wet that's that's laid back there\nIsn't a carpet on the inside on the floorboards wet in any way do all the little electronic gadgets work and that's where you'll pay the price correct if it's a brand new car and you get in the signals that turn signals don't work life don't come\nOut smelling little musty exactly or they're or there's mud on the inside of the wheels were they didn't clean quite as thoroughly yeah there are there are things you have to look for it\nAnd if you're not physically able to get down and look underneath the vehicle bring someone who can bring someone that you trust that can help you inspect the vehicle and to be completely honest if you have a reputable company that you're working with the allow you to bring in a mechanic right regular to nose with our looking\nYou know it's really good to get to know a local mechanic because uh you can help keep them in business and doing keep you out of trouble getting\nYou know what you get what you pay for his true story really really do in every place of the market place whether it's a simple meal somewhere\nOr [laughter] buying a car a larger purchases like a home you know these are things that just proceed with caution and yes getting to know a good mechanic is kind of like getting to know a good doctor is kind of like getting to know a great mover\nOr your folks who have these are industries even cable companies you know it's they're difficult industries for these companies to be in we complain if the Internet doesn't work immediately guess what we all get a little upset you know and they hear about it so if a company response to you and does the best that they can\nTo make a good faith effort and to ease the situation than you're looking at a pretty darn good company and you should respect that an honor that and try to be a good consumer\nEvery Sunday when I open up my a copy of the press could daily courier first thing I turn to is the business section and I wonder how many times in the past year poor ... has written a
