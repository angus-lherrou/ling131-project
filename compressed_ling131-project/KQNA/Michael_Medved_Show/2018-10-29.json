that\nWe'd which the whole structure of the constitution was developed in that is that the courts would interpret the laws that were passed by Congress here in the Chevron case in Nineteen eighty four\nCongress was at the court the Supreme Court was saying the opposite\nAnd that is the agency's we're supposed to interpret the laws how far the laws extended how much power they receive from Congress and the courts had to approve it if they thought what the agency's has had done was reasonable that isn't the way the system or to work\nAnd what I think is going to happen um when I\nDrive a majority of five constitutional is on the Supreme Court today\nAfter Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed I think what will happen is that the court will now authorize the the lower courts to interpret these statutes for itself and not to\nUm to or not to rely on the decisions of the administrative agencies about how much power they had received from Congress\nAlexander Hamilton called the judiciary the guardian of the constitution you contend the courts have largely failed in their obligation to keep the elected branches of government in their proper constitutional rules correct\nYes that is

Washington area\nAnd if they are going beyond what authority they were given by Congress\nThan they are in fact making law is the result of that is a naturally overtime the American people will come to realize\nThat they are being uh they're being subject to ... they are being made subject to regulations that they didn't vote for through Congress\nAnd in a democracy if people recognize that they have no control over the government's than the government loses its legitimacy and we can see that actually happened because it happened in Britain in twenty sixteen\nWhen the British people voted to withdraw from the European Union because they were subject to all kinds of regulations\nThat were made by the European Union and imposed on Britain's and in a way that they didn't think they\nAnd in a way that they didn't think they were able to control that was the perfect example of a loss of legitimacy by a government in this case the European Union\nAnd this will happen in the United states unless the American people are satisfied that the rules and regulations that they have to live under for actually made by the people themselves through Congress and not made by a lot of officials in Washington DC\nNow what do you think of legislative attempts such as the reins act to counter the growing influence of executive agencies and restore Congress's lost power\nI don't think that those were work I I I appreciate\nThat Congress is attempting always to try to rein in the administrative said itself\nAnd the reins act is one of those laws but I don't think these are really feasible every time the rain jak for example requires Congress to approve regulations that have been passed by an administrative agency\n[noise] um and the trouble with that if these regulations are hundreds of pages law\nToday are very detailed and the problem is that Congress doesn't have the time\nFor the staff or the inclination to go through these rules line by line to decide whether they like them or they don't like them so it's not it's it's not feasible way to deal with the problem\nThat feasible way to deal with the problem I Believe is to have the courts say that whenever a rural or regulation is challenged\nThe a quarter of the United states district court record of appeals or the Supreme Court ultimately will determine whether the action by the agency was previously properly authorized by Congress and if it was not end the matter has to go back\nFor legislation from Congress not an approval level regulation but trip that Congress has to give the agency the authority to issue a new regulation\nMr Welsh in your book notes there are some indications today that several members of the Supreme Court\nMay be willing to modify the Chevron case and resume its role as the quote\nGuardian of the constitution my effectively policing the separation of powers are you optimistic that the judiciary will discharge that duty to rein in the ministry administrative state and we'll just his cabinet ... helped create the Supreme Court majority necessary to modify Chevron\nYeah I think that uh with Brett Kavanaugh as the new ... the Supreme Court there are five members of the court who are constitutional is that in LA or understand that fought er Kramer intended in the constitution and want to make sure that those\nAre intentions are realized\nA standstill I think they will begin to um rainy and the agent and critically militarily or by modifying the so called Chevron case though that the agencies are not the one to decide whether they had actually gotten the necessary power from Congress\nBut they are in bed I'm only able to\nDo the things that a court says they were actually are her eyes to do by Congress and until we have that kind of system where the court is making where a court and all the way up to the Supreme Court is actually making those decisions\nUm we will not have a crew democracy in this country\nWhere the people are actually I'm making the rules through Congress that they want to live under so I'm optimistic that with five members of the court that will actually happen in time and uh I I I Believe that we are at a time now in our nation's\nHistory where we have a chance to make some major changes in a trend that has been worrying for some time\nAnd speaking of those changes one last question what specific solutions do you recommend to rein in the administrative state and what practical steps can citizens take to solve the problem and restore our democracy\nBut I think citizens can make sure\nThat they tell their Congress person that they are disturbed\nAbout the amount of regulation that it's coming out and they can also um write articles or speak to judges and tell judges that they think that the administrative agencies have taken too much\nAuthority on themselves\nAnd we should go back to the original system that the framers devised and that is for Congress to adopt the laws that the people on hold them at least live under um but in the last we do that I'm afraid that over time\nWe will have a loss of legitimacy of our government and that's a very serious and dangerous thing\nThe author

universally loved one who's friends ran for ... seasons in prime time at its peak with our culture influencing phenomenon\nStill watched by sixteen million Americans\nIn reruns him journalist Kelsey Miller has written a wonderful new book to bring back to all these memories for friends friends gets cold I'll be there for you the one about friends killed so you took us all the way back in your book to the creation of the show and what would surprise people is maybe it's promising if imperfect beginnings\nHe I think so um you know when I look back at the pilot episode I thought I don't know I mean it's a perfectly fine episode for calm is definitely not at the taxpayer episode of friends friends really really got better as time went on\n'em and you know I think the critics definitely noticed that at the beginning that show is received as okay this is just another Seinfeld knock off and it's not going to go anywhere um that it really was you know not until maybe the end of the for the year when the show really counted footing and when audiences began to pick up and it began to snowball into this massive\nCultural phenomenon and\nDo what do you attribute the quick transition into a phenomenon\nI think it's a number of things I think some some of it has to do with the fact that you know first of all the writing is so so good\nAnd it's just very well produce and the cat had this incredible charisma and that's incredible chemistry between them that really gives a sense of a live next to the show and today they're on screen friendship because you know they have that sort of solid off screen friendship as well and I think that really shines through\nMade this really really compelling and still make that compelling now\nAnd you know I think part of it is also just the tenets of it which is still simple it's so funny you know people always wondering what what is it what is it about friends what that magic secret thing and I think the magic thing the fact that it's simply a show about friendship but the show that the experience of having a close friendship\nAnd that's something that is the universal and timeless and everybody can either relate to or or aspire to everybody want that kind of a closeness you know what I mean\n... speaking of closeness leisure six below characters who were largely\nYou can a closeness losers six below characters who were largely before the show on known except for Courtney Cox Cruz who was famous for the Bruce Springsteen video for ... for kids off sugar bonds as well and their lives were changed by the shoe rights\nTo literally they really made a very conscious effort and the beginning to foster that friendship I think they understood it very early on that they had to become real friends unreal you know partners and collaborators because\nIt's you know what if the show continue to move forward he would have been very easy for the first things to fall apart if somebody got jealous or for example somebody with being paid much more much less than the others [laughter]\nWhich is why I think it was really crucial that they came together and became as friends but then really became sort of a union of sorts and eventually started negotiating all of their contracts together and you know and said that they all be paid equally and that lasted for the entire tenure run of the show\nAnd it will also less through syndication ... L yeah oh yeah I Know you also hear details about the behind the scenes stories you mentioned the writers about proved choices are often succeeded but sometimes failed big time\nYeah yeah there were a lot of I mean you know when you're talking about I think it's two hundred and thirty six episodes it you know I I think it's going to take some effort and you're not going to win a mall there are some episodes especially early on that when I look back they're not even offensive they're just kind of weird like there's this one episode where David swimmer\nPlays another character named arrests and he's just wearing pathetic makeup and he looks sort of like himself but just a little bit different and it just doesn't seem to make\nAny sense but then you know I I don't know I think it's a win win some you lose them because there are some really good things that happen later on in the in the series like in season ten there's this episode where the the after she gets married decides to change her name not to her husband's name but to change her name to princess ... silliest thing ever\nAnd yet it so well written that said it's really funny just work\nDid you ever wonder how monitor could afford ... amazing New York apartment yes\nAnd in fact I have the answer to that they don't explain it they don't hit this point to heart in the show which is I think why people bring it up so much but Monica is illegally sub letting her grandmother's apartment and the apartment is rent controlled meaning that he would probably paying you know under two hundred dollars a month for that apartment which of those apartment do exist but they're very rare\nAnd you know the series also capitalized on a influencing everything in pop culture from the way women cut through here we all remember the Rachel cuts to the burgeoning no movement\nYeah that is absolutely true I sure I sure as heck remember the Rachel cat because I did it myself many times before I realized oh this is a terrible hair cut [laughter] as and I don't mind saying that I think Jennifer s in herself I've had to say that many times that she she hated it was a really high maintenance haircut\nAnd she hated seeing everybody in the world walking around with it but listen we all live and learn and yeah\nAs you point out that the show influence things that we don't even really recognize your friends took off right around the same time that Starbucks came out and I think that those", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "29"}
