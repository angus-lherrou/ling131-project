another great day and the greatest nation on God's green earth is a particularly great day if you want to use recent history\nTo understand what's happening in this country right now on the directions that we should go there\nOf books that come over my desk\nAnd there is one book in particular that it just is a must read at this moment\nBecause it is so relevant to people who are concerned about\nThe prospect of the new democratic move for impeachment impeachment Brett Kavanaugh impeachment\nOf President Trump\nOr if you're concerned about what's happening with the Mueller investigation or if you're concerned about the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation there is extremely relevant material on all of that in contempt\nIt is subtitled a memoir of the Clinton investigation the author is Ken Starr and a judge star I've I've got to tell you this book is so readable it is so relevant and some of the revelations are\nMost sensational unsatisfying and uh the the book is posted are\nSatisfying and uh the the book is posted at our website at Michael midday dot com\nIn writing it and then\nThe response to the book which has been overwhelming sense has come out what's surprised you most\nOf what surprised me very positive way is that uh the Clinton a spin machine has remained silent and I say I say and and I don't mean that to be unkind but to the\nEr the Clinton spin cycle is Howard Kurtz or that of the Washington Post style but [noise]\nUh was extraordinarily busy and energetic and somewhat say highly effective\nAt a uh taking a a issue with what seems to me to be indisputable and that is the facts and so I'm very pleased about that the other thing Michael I Would say is that there's so many eerie echoes\nFrom the past that we are hearing today and you mentioned to impeachment that's a very high on the list because as you though\nA impeachment was extraordinarily controversial in the nineties and yet some of those crying for impeachment now with some of the most of the center for his voice is saying how dare you that\nThe book is called contempt a memoir on the Clinton investigation or Hillary Clinton doesn't come off are so very well in your book\n[noise] yes and uh you know turn the other cheek and uh and kindness to others and so forth but it's just the facts and and and and the facts are are\nAre in sort of the day new mall was when we in the investigation seriously considered presenting an indictment or to the federal grand jury and little log\nNaming Hillary Rodham Clinton alone for her crimes in connection with\nThe Little Rock or Arkansas face of the investigation [noise] in addition ah during the course of interviews with her at the White House\nShe stood in such complete contrast in terms of relational skills and the like with her spouse Bill Clinton who of course is immensely\nCharming and charismatic and a empathy at all the rest of it and she said as I say in the book seem to be just sort of deliberately in your

course he was in the news every day for longer\nThan I think he wanted to be a with the Clinton investigation that led to the impeachment of President Clinton he has now written a book about the whole experience\nAnd it's a page Turner it even though you know how it turns out a it didn't turn out so well for the good guys it seems to me but there it is the book is called contempt a memoir of the Clinton investigation\nAnd before we get back to the Clintons Ken Starr I Know that um we all know that Brett Kavanaugh before he was judge Kavanaugh before he is justice Kavanaugh\nWorked for you and let's make some news here or did you have a problem did you always feel that when Brett Kavanaugh came into a room you had to lock up the Buddha and put the women in another room and to protect them from this morning I'm a horrible person\nThis was so terrible a smear attack a a a a ... it was very reminiscent of the attacks on Bob Corker\nA on Clarence Thomas a and regardless of liquor them here the other motives are the truthfulness of darker forward but I Do know Brett Kavanaugh and I've done since he was a very young lawyer and we work side by side\nHe was a very young lawyer and we work side by side literally for years\nAnd the outpouring of support for breath for justice cab no by those who not only known how to work with him who went to school with him and said this is just not Brett Kavanaugh and he emphatically and forcefully and emotionally\nDenied the allegations and so knowing bred to be a person of a just an impeachable integrity and honesty I Believe him so it was very painful for those of us who know\nThe judges lead such an exemplary a career professionally and\nA wonderful life personally with his two beautiful children with the nation for a period of time had a new coach K right the girls' coach and uh it just it's it's a he called that a\nA a and a national disgrace I call it a national tragedy\nOr book guys called content that is a subtitled a memoir of the Clinton investigation\nI you um you you look back on a this situation not without some changes of regret ... of the things that you might have done differently or that you look back on now\nOr as perhaps they should've been emphasized differently steer differently what stands out most\n[noise] as I describe a Michael I win against the advice of my advisors who was a scene out of the scriptures re a bomb or ignoring the advice of his wise elders and listening to\nThe voices of his young rebel browsers and thereby dividing Israel [noise] um I fail to listen to the advice of folks who said do not sit down with this particular journalist who I knew I'd known him for ten years his name is Steven Brill\nYeah he's a farmer and as an eight or nine I Know Steve and for many years go ahead\nAnd my goodness well I have a ... ended up being a unscrupulous a character who totally distorted everything I had to say in the interview that's my biggest thing you might say well ... well it ushered in an investigation authorized but as she should have\nOf the chief judge of the United states just record of the district of Columbia and whether we were violating very fundamental rules violating the criminal laws with respect to a grand jury secrecy we came through with flying colors that being the investigation but it was so there was such a self inflicted wound\nAnd then more broadly what I've said frequently is that I Wish that Janet Reno who did the right thing and saying\nThe information that we have\nThat the ... the United states is in the process of encouraging people to the law is about to commit perjury and so forth in the ... civil rights sexual harassment case\nHas to be investigated Michael I Wish she had had a ready reserve independent ... special prosecutor who she could have just said you marry rower John do you take over the investigation Ken wants to go to Pepperdine he's been trying to get the ... and the city\nOr in law school yeah go ahead\nYeah yeah and this and to be the end of the law school there and this is just I'm going to take more time energy and so forth although I Will say this we were optimistic a that perhaps the uh ... what became the Lewinsky phase the investigation will be over very promptly\nBecause we were going to be giving Monica\nThe opportunities simply to cooperate with the investigation and to receive completed the unity as as a witness get out of harm's way but of course famously infamously\nAs I describe the hallway scene at the Ritz Carlton hotel on that fateful day in the evening or in northern Virginia and the Pentagon said he or she said using very foul language to her mother who was encouraging her Monica to\nCooperate with the investigation and take yourself out of harm's way\nThat she was not going to bring down this and she is very strong language cries of the uh and then she said that course for five months and I'm the president for his part consisted of course that he had told the truth and his uh perjury is a deposition\nAnd the Paula Jones case so the combination of the ... city of Bill Clinton under oath\nAnd the stubborn refusal of Monica for five months to cooperate with the investigation just hurt us and the nation through this very hellish purgatory old process\nSpeaking of a hellish in purgatory old process\nI'm ... I I'm I'm sure you've encountered a the currents national counsel Robert Mueller he's quiet right now for a while because it's just a few weeks before an upcoming election and I guess the tradition\nI for somebody in that position as you don't break any news right before an election I Would you have some national advice for a special counsel Robert Mueller about how to handle the\nConclusion and his investigation based on your experience that you described in contempt\nYes I Would say that the regulations that are what she was appointed by a Rod Rosenstein points away to a very happy resolution once he comes to let the inclusion and I think he has on me the wrong and I don't know\nBut I think he has concluded that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign\nAnd Russian interests uh that's why he was appointed obviously those the Paul Manafort matters that Rick Gates matter the indictments of the Russian individuals and organizations which really do touch on reason he was appointed\nBring this to an orderly conclusion and a professional way as quickly as possible and then happily and this is a huge improvement Michael over the independent counsel statute of under which I was appointed\nAnd that is the regulations in which a model was appointed to not speak of impeachment there was a powerful dynamic in the independent counsel law that Congress pass in Nineteen Seventy eight to nudge the process toward impeachment\nThat's now where we're going God willing or and you'll understand why that's so important when you read content a memoir of Clinton investigation Ken Starr has been a public servant all his life\nThe biggest outrageous I reported on was the trial of abortion doctor Kermit God now I'll be a woman goes into a clinic comes out of

this whatever's going crazy again\nYou know people don't even know what Germany they want to be I mean this is hard to believe that she reality and the thing about it is it was for Kavanaugh I'm Glad he got in\nThe guys and upstanding man I used to be in law enforcement and I'll tell you you can't just sit there and prosecute somebody on some of these accusation with absolutely no substantial proof to back it up you would never make it in court\nAnd yet it doesn't matter for these people because it's an agenda and how is it all men are evil now and nobody listens to women\nWhat exactly went wrong there by him being put in the position that he should be at is done nothing\nNo no I think your your your point your point is very well taken\nAnd what all of this goes to his ear right it is an agenda and the agenda is to demonize the opposition\nThe opposition doesn't just need to be defeated and needs to be destroyed and that is a sick and destructive idea and it is one that ought to be resisted but the interesting thing here to me the amazing thing\nIs that when you talk about the opposition\nAnd you talked about the issues that we face\nThe the issues that we face or not\nSo dire yes I agree with you I think the idea that a little children after looking just decide what gender they are\nAnd look I understand there are some people who have gender whether they used to call gender just for you I understand that and you can be compassionate but the idea that you have to redrawn society and redo everything fortunately it's a very very small number of people earlier on this show first now where\nWe were talking about a a a major new study\nAcademic study that shows that Americans in every line of life reject political correctness they're worried about it\nAnd and that's I think part of\nThe basis for\nThis rage is is rage against America as it exists\nAnd if you think about it and you want to change American someway\nMuch better to do that while acknowledging gratitude for this wonderful country rather than giving into this pointless rage\nWhich he's now described as a world rage it or Seventy year old husband\nA let's go to Larry in Oxford Arkansas Larry you're on the Michael Mann that show hey Larry or on\nA yeah Michael Moore long term listener for from color well thank you very were talking earlier about the about the political correctness unfair

she no she didn't say that\nUh she oh okay I can recall I I understand I understand it the here's the point about this one world government thing it's been a a sickness and the disease for a long time and I remember when President Obama and he did make a as stony gave that speech in Berlin during the campaign\nAnd that campaign of two thousand eighty wasn't even president yet and he said I speak to you as a citizen of the world\nOr look I we don't elect a president to be a citizen of the world we elect a president to represent the citizens of the United states because as much as people might like the uh the votes of people in the very end she less they coach dying in other states in Germany to count\nA no electoral votes there are none at all\nUh appreciate your call this is the basic point about the one world government thing\nWe're going through Brexit right we're going through even the European Union the idea of people giving up nationality this is this is being opposed we're not moving in that direction we're moving in the direction of wholesome nationalism\nAnd one of the points that Europe has only makes it a good new book on the subject of nationalism\nIs that nationalism goes together\nWith a representing the people\nBecause it is tougher to enforce\nA top down kind of government\nIf what you're basing that government on is it sends a strong nationality

those\nFilms that is sure to be an Oscar contender in a whole bunch of categories it's called first man so let's have inappropriate fanfare from Holly aware [noise]\nThis is the story of the first man on the moon and people know it was Neil Armstrong they were a member of the words that's one small step for man he actually was meant to say a man and\nOne giant leap for mankind but you don't really know the back story and that back story was written about in a book an authorized biography or it is now brought to the screen in a fine screenplay screenplays by Josh Singer who is the same screen writer\nWho did a spotlight which won the Oscar a couple of years ago and he also did the screenplay for the post and here he puts everything in order\nTelling the story beginning in Nineteen sixty one of the eight years of Neil Armstrong's life where his wife and his family play a very real role as he struggles with some of the dangers and difficulties of actually getting to the moon Neil\nEvery once in agreement we like he declared well what's wrong and I think it had gone to move the vehicle not safe we need to fail we need to fail down here so we don't fail up there in our world is watching in question whether the program for the call and money and the last one of the ... you're not come that we've got this under control\nOkay they didn't have this under control they were depending\nOn good fortune and sometimes that dependency turnout tragically this is an utterly remarkable film and it's a riveting I Know a good deal about the space program and I will tell you I'm I have a real interest in this because part of what Neil Armstrong was involved with before the Apollo program was the Gemini program\nMy late father was the experimental director for the Gemini program and I kind of grew up hearing stories about Neil Armstrong and by the way all the stories that I heard from my late father about Neil Armstrong\nComport with what you see on screen which is that a Ryan Gosling as I was standing up performing one of those classic American heroes are kind of role that could have been performed by Henry Fonda\nSomebody who is heroic\nBut understated an unassuming with a quiet and mysterious deaths and in the film\nThe emphasize that part of the reasons for that attitude\nWas Neil Armstrong's life at least according to this film in the book that it's based on\nRelated to a family tragedy which is very dramatically portrayed on screen at the beginning of the film every one is remarkable in this movie in terms of performance as clear for playing Neil Armstrong's Wife Jan\nA ... and she was a long suffering wife and she was somewhat skeptical of what he was doing she said she wanted to have a conventional life and instead here he is an astronaut risking his life constantly\nAnd that's one of the things that the film brings back a very dramatically I I live in Seattle as people know and we have a a museum of flight here and you can go there and you can see some of these old space capsules that they actually use from the sixties\nAnd you look at them and they're incredibly small and rickety in dangerous and you think they really want to get into that things of this giant rocket can rolling into space\nAnd yes people died and the space program\nAnd that's dramatized here two of the the scenes in which director Damien ... who previously did la la land with Ryan Gosling and before that did whiplash\nWhich also won an Oscar for Jk simmons well deserved if she does such a superb job I mean truly superb job\nOf dramatizing the space flight itself the training and the Gemini flights from the dangerous flights that came before\nIt's um it's it's one of these films where you cannot take your eyes off the screen it is so riveting and by the way Jason her which provides a film score that his heroic that is stirring that his captivating\nAnd very knowledgeable there's even a little bit of a nod to two thousand one space odyssey\nDuring one of the Gemini sequences where they're trying to hook up in space\nOf the only reservation one can possibly have from the film is that it's not the kind of her real wake while we've done it totally satisfying triumphant conclusion you expect it's not the right stuff\nAnd uh ... what it shows also an emphasizes is it the space program had its elements of controversy or use your voices on screen about people who are questioning the value and the amount of money that we're spending\nOn putting a man on the moon when we're going through very difficult times in American urban neighborhood but with all of that the caring about the characters including Jason Clarke ... what a year for him", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day":
