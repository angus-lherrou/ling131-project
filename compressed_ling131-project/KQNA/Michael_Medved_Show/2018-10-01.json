now he's three and a walking talking going to preschool and mommy's going back to work\nWhat was it like backing Christina Aguilera\nGreat I mean she's an immense talent you know everybody has different opinions about her or her style of music but working for her was great um you know she's she's really adamant on talent so all of our singer is a great singer is all of our band is a great band um all of the dancers are family talented dancer\nSo have you ever seen the documentary twenty feet from start\nTo have yeah and I know a lot of singers yeah I'd but that hit home yeah definitely\nMe I think something that'll make you do something I don't know if it's worked for ... for Taylor Swift on her tour here he's done the Wilson yeah that one's ever heard of ... in the famous tell us\nWhat it's like no I I did the the Warner Brothers tour a last may and they took us through the Clint Eastwood recording student ... where he ... his own movies surprised a lot of us tell us when it's like to uh do music for a movie I mean do you have the movie scenes on screen with the south into the second time or\nGoing yeah so what's interesting about what I have done it that most of the music I've done that it's been in movies has already been produced prior to the movie holiday place it in however I have done quite a bit of a PR\nUm of spoken voiceover work where I Am in the big studio looking at the movie I was actually a voice double for Lindsey low hand on a movie once 'cause she was not well and they needed a deep breath when he was yeah and Garry Marshall I Need the ... the director very well he was a friend of mine I had worked for him at one point and um he was like\nCanada the United government and you know there are none of that and they never\nGot to buy your name was always like Betty or ... or whatever he he never told anybody about the correct name but um and it was that way we were at Disney studios and we sat in the big room and the big film was up there and you had your cue ends and the five four three and a matching all the dialogue and yeah it's really fun it's really cool\nI Would imagine a challenge to because you have to sync everything up or do they post production people do that [noise]\nUm no they would like you to think everything up as closely as possible obviously if it's a millisecond tough they can move it in and out you know like any kind of technological device but I'm now for the most part you watch the scene watch their mouth move you you're sitting there like talking with the person and you know doing that kind of stuff yeah\nDrew take me through if I were to ask you to teach me how to play guitar first of all I asked him to them that are me\nFirst of all would your new a student I have to have their own guitar yes okay and uh when you when that news student decides he wants to play the guitar how do you recommend they buy one\nUh you know basically just send them over to places that I like in town like pretty much everyone in town Bob's degree dog or mercy guitar or whatever\nAnd you know to find something that's exciting too soon as they want to play that looks and makes them want to pick it up um friars ended up in my heart you got to be inspired\nAnd feels good in the hands you know to feel good in the hands go to fit you know but most of it it's like you got to want to play it matters if it's green any like green yeah you know it matters if it actually looks just like Steve eyes guitar or whatever you\nKnow that sounds like a the advice I used to give when I was younger to people who want to be ballplayers you know if you're just going to go to the organized practices and the games and not play on your own your buddies you're not going to be a ballplayer same for guitars yeah\nSee I was in Los Angeles last week and on almost every subway we took there was a bus gr walking on playing the violin didn't want to play the guitar the next time of course you had a captive audience the good thing about it was they were really good yeah I mean really good to walk me through the very first lesson\nI'm really just getting your hands to work playing one string at a time holding a pig making sure that you picked both directions pastries all your fingers you know to hop in one finger all over the place you know\nWhen you're watching a TV show or a movie in the star appears to be playing the guitar and you tell when they're just faking it or you\nCan definitely see that the finger need my living room name was singing to actually you know yeah yeah yeah sure\nEither way have either have you seen the trailer for the new movie star is born it looks it looks or a or a Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga that that's going to be a dynamite movie and it really is so you'll be looking for the sake of vocal movements you'd\nBe pretty seriously it's got a dial down a little\nSays speaking of way to go to my daughter who's Thirteen ... as a quote we can it's performed with me at my own\nThe team ... as a quote ... candidates performed with me at my old show yeah after\nThe show my Thirteen year old Lady Gaga shook terminology\nYeah I did know\nLady Gaga show this is Thirteen

sounds as though I don't respect the artist today 'cause I definitely do the people I worship are from the past I mean I was Whitney Houston vocally is undeniable to me the late and great Aretha Franklin is undeniable to me\nI Love Carole King I Love singer songwriters I Love I'm Jennifer ... another one that I you know Taylor Dana I remember there are a big singers you know I Love\nI Love the days when singers saying you know I I'm a singer who things you know so I'm\nI'm much respect for Christine and paint the same way they both get out there and they do their chops live you know I and that is no disrespect to the contemporary music of right now I just I like something that gives me goose bumps I like things that make me want to belt out a song I like things that\nMake me want to just you know they'll singers or the people that I I just can't tune out of my head\nTo head dues bumps reviewer with those two weeks ago Saturday because our first stop on our LA tour\nWas

there's so much talent there that doesn't even get acknowledged on the big grand scheme of\nOf you know what people listen to I have a lot of friends who have done Broadway off Broadway and regional theater and I got to tell you their voices are about a billion times greater than a meal on fruitful they're really great you know they just have a different format and they've had a different\nLevel of of ah\nAttention you know from being on stage but yeah I I'm drawn to that so I I tend to lean I'm a record collector when my husband and I have like twelve hundred or two plus record show I I find myself leaning toward the past I'm In my influences and in what I regard for great singing\nFelt so the question I always ask every songwriter which normally comes first the lyrics are the melody\nForm well it depends on who I'm writing with if I'm writing by myself a lot of times they come at the same time because they said at my piano and the melody drives words or if I have an idea of words that I Know are rolling off the tongue well then the piano follows\nA lot of times I co right with other people so when I'm writing with other people I Am not a fantastic musician myself I'm a pretty great singer I think um I I Hope but I'm so in that regard when I'm writing with other people for me melody and lyrics\nAre always what's bubbling in my mind and and if let's say I was writing with drew and he's getting a groove going that'll immediately inspire melody and then the words tend to come after um so it just depends on your\nPlate for us real quick um well we were going to where he was going to do it to go for it it's called I'll be your home or I read\nIt with many ... and it made it on her way to wild heart album which has a Grammy nominated album\nAnd she's not

million questions running through your head the change Rausch team at Wal can bolt mortgage this here twenty four hours a day seven days a week by appointment even if you need to meet on Saturday morning because of your work schedule\nWill be there all the chains Rausch team that for four or five eight seven three zero ... like the summers are ones who make ... number one sixty two equal opportunity land\nOf overdoing for kids in a major part of what the bond covers what\nKind of communications do you have with the area employers about preparing students for a after school\nYeah you know I'm fortunate I sit on the board for both the ... valley chamber of commerce as well as the ... valley economic development on nation so as we're looking at our existing businesses as well as businesses that we're trying to attract a to the area\nWe play a really a pivotal role in those discussions of what they need and obviously it's skills beyond content knowledge we always talk about just those interpersonal skills that kids have but also when you look at building your economy in a specific area you start identifying what specific skills do we need\nA with an employer coming into the area so both us and you have a pi college have been really at the table to talk about what are the specific workforce development needs in our community\nAnd in our community of course we've seen a shortage of skilled trades in fact I did a broadcast remote Saturday and you have a pi colleges seat tech campus and they stressed how they also work with the area employers because you know the fast track through the university program and white collar career jobs isn't necessarily for everybody is it\nIt it's not and and I'm really proud of the relationship that we have with the apple pie county contractors association and Danny and I have sat down Sandy's received a grant she's going to be working on a a workforce development program herself\nWere participating in that I'm actually reaching out to some of our recent grads to introduce into this program is great but there is a shortage and there's a tremendous opportunity it's a tremendous field to go into\nAnd what we're trying to do is educate our students on just the different opportunities that you have there are a lot of kids walking around our campus of dreams and aspirations of owning their own business of being an entrepreneur or things of that nature [noise]\nBoy they'd be making a mistake if they close their eyes and their mind to an entire industry that provides those opportunities\nAnd not only that but an awful lot of these employers who are hiring and skilled ... in skilled trades with the proper kind of training and we're not talking a four year university program you guys and the two year colleges are getting them ready to walk in the door and hit the ground running or\n... it's a ... yeah it's a great opportunity I mean a a a training program guaranteed positions in the community and no student debt and no debt\nWow yeah can you um and and the funny thing is at the remote I did it a sheet check\nI interviewed a Rodney Jenkins who is one of the very people were talking about because he went to a private university which he was expected to do it came out with a hundred thousand dollars in debt and now he's a a one of the vice president's\nStretching the importance of preparing for a career you wanted to do and that you were prepared to do and you have the skills for\nAbsolutely and I think it's important to note the skills you know we talk a lot about being college and career ready ... we need to emphasize of college and career ready to go in the in the skills are very similar in and make no mistake it's not college or career ready to skills are very similar and make sure that our students have those opportunities\nSo when it comes to the bonds what is the amount that districts asking for and what does that mean that area taxpayers\nSo where the cost of the bond is Fifteen million dollars and the impact to the average taxpayer so when you really look at um growth in the last ten years in the area you you project out of what the impact will be to the average taxpayer so let's talk about a homeowner average homeowner impressed devalue looked at a ...\nUm you're talking about about you're talking about a dollar Ninety five per hundred thousand dollars of assessed valuation per month and that's based on the last ten years of growth now the the actual numbers will be based on real numbers of growth\nLast ten years is a little bit of a top number that's what will be in the voter pamphlet um I Do remind people the last ten years you're talking about the entire recession so that does skew some of those uh growth numbers if you look at the last three years of growth\nOf growth is much higher and really the number goes down to about a dollar fifty per hundred thousand the ... the average just sets valuation in ... valley doing humbled is about a hundred and thirty seven thousand dollars on a home so you're talking about a little over two dollars a month is what would support this bond and\nYou know you're going to hear this when you do the forums or how do you answer somebody who's a say who's on a fixed income who was a homeowner who says I don't want my taxes are gone up but what's the benefit to that at home or if we keep the schools\nWell funded yeah well legally I'm limited as to how I can answer that question is what I what I Will tell you that we know a survey and research says about\nA sound K. twelve educational programs in the community\nAnd when you have a strong facilities the community has access to what that can do for a homeowner values and um but I I think that we can also go back to the conversation that we just laugh about workforce development as well and there is an opportunity to invest in our own community in do great things for this community\nI've heard several employers say they lament the fact that even though this is a wonderful area that's regarded in many ways as a retirement mecca\nThat means that sometimes those jobs in the twenties thirties and forties go begging and they're afraid of a brain drain of very talented people in several skills leaving the area how do you keep them in this area\nYeah and that's that's the challenge isn't it I think that you could say that this area is a retirement area I I think that we're trying to diversify imbalance our economy a little more than that [laughter] uh but it's undeniable that the average age and you have a pi county is is a little bit higher than some of our metropolitan areas\nBut we still want to make sure that we have services and activities that are available to everybody in our community and that hits this population we don't want that brain drain we don't want people leaving the area or people that are afraid to come to the area I I think that this is a tremendous place\nTo live I I'm right now my family here either I certainly am am very proud of the opportunity to my kids have had\nAnd we want to make sure that we continue to offer those opportunities for the young families in this area as well that support the big picture the entire economy that everybody in the air is part of your tell us when and where the forms are\nSo very important ah we we have for forums coming up the first one is tomorrow that's Tuesday five thirty PM at Bradshaw mountain middle school\nWednesday at five thirty pm we will be at the ... valley library auditorium that's for the the town council meets\nThursday will be a brash amount of high school that's going to be a Spanish only a version of the forum and then we're going to have a fourth one on October\nVersion of the form and then we're going to have a fourth one on October Eighteen so that's in a couple of weeks that will be at the glass for hill auditorium that information is on our website and again the purpose for the forums that just share information about the bond that there's people out there that have questions this is to get those questions answered this is just share what is the bond\nAmounts what is the bond going to cover what is the impact to homeowners business owners landowners\nUm it it truly is an informational session when will it beyond beyond the ballot so the bond is on the ballot for the November six election mail in ballots go out October tenth\nOr last day to register to vote is October ninth um so you can ... I Know the voter pamphlets out people are able to start to see the information but look for your ballots in your mailbox October tenth and if not we'll we'll see you at the at the ...\nI was watching a political roundtable MTV two weeks ago and one reporter said right now the biggest the biggest uh influence on voting day is people who don't vote because they leave it to the few relatively few who do turn on you don't want that do you want people participating right\nWe want people participating want people to have knowledge of what's on the ballot young you know we you know we want an educated electorate there you want to know 'em but you're right we we look at the lack of voter participation is a concern not not for the school district not for the bond but for our entire society sure and when you start scaling back\nThe number of eligible voters down to the number of registered voters down to the number of voters who participate in primary what we're talking about there are a handful of people that are dictating public policy in the state of Arizona\nThat's right that's right so what happens if a worst case scenario that bond is not approved\nSo if the bond sales obviously we will fall back on state funding to address some of our needs\nUm right now when you look at our capital reserves we have about two point seven million dollars and our reserve budget or one of our biggest challenges is the money coming from the state to the district the last ten years has been drastically reduced or two years ago it was reduced by eighty seven percent [noise]\nUm we received Thirteen percent of what we were supposed to receive for capital funding\nLast year we got a little bit of a boost we got thirty five percent of what we're supposed to get that's creating the challenge is so you look at to point seven million in reserves are expenditures on an annual basis we haven't really scaled back to needs or about one point five million\nI think when you start doing the math one point five million being spent each year to point seven and reserves you can see that there's there's a problem on the horizon\nSo in our state legislators say all this money is going to be spent on education\nWhere is it yeah you know it's it's a challenge I there's a lot of promises out there to put a dollar back into um schools the governor's twenty by twenty twenty plan last year as I remind people that was for teachers' salaries that did not address their capital needs again that's why we're talking about a bond and not a number to override\nOr we certainly appreciated that um you know I I think our challenges we went through the great recession and we knew that when we when we went to the great recession that they were going to have to be some reduction but I think everybody understood that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "01"}
