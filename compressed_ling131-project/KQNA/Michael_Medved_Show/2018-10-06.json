what I Do hear when I'm Out and about and people just can't understand and why we haven't moved on with\nGetting him confirmed they understand that he has the right credentials to hit on the nation's highest court and ... that that we should get this done sound\nI Want to review a few things with you about the testimony\nFirst of all there was a story in Politico that she had a fear of flying which is why that had to be delayed she never actually said better itself but that was represented the committee she didn't say she was not aware that the committee would come to her so that could be on her lawyers her former boyfriend has filed a letter saying she's familiar with polygraph said never discuss sexual assault\nThere they knew real clear investigations report that the second front door contractor evidence shows that was not about claustrophobia but at second entrance for an office\nNot about claustrophobia but his second entrance for an office there wasn't a single verifiable assertion or testimony and not one that could be disproven either and then there's the Rachel Mitchell Report I simply do not believe that that testimony could not read Kevin off of consideration\nNo I I don't believe so either and and Dr Ford I Do\nHonestly believe that she has experienced trauma at some point and otherwise show do I I I think most folks would agree with that however um even the witnesses that she taught forward actually uh\nCan't corroborate or simply tear down that that testimony that she gave about um some party that she had to I tend to add so\nUnfortunately for her I don't\nFind that can be a credible message again I Do want to reiterate that I Do think Shakespeare and trauma but I don't know and it wasn't proven that it was judge Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile we have secondary assault on judge cabin on who I Do not know by the way he's ten years younger than I Am so we did not move in the same circles but he he strikes me as a very good and decent man and his two daughters caught me they're telling the fourteen year old they will be dealing with this for the rest of their life and that people have much to it up\nTo to underscore that their father is not a gang rape is that none of this has been proven that Sheldon Whitehouse who's allegation was libel and slander as an immediately reputed referred by the committee for prosecution are you and your colleagues doing enough to stand up and and stand by judge cabin on your view\nWell I think we are standing up for judge Kavanaugh's core she won't hear any of those stories covered by mainstream media but we certainly respect him we respect his family they have been put\nThrough um the the worst possible situation ever with their father being demeaned and and discredited and and it's very unfortunate and we'd have those discussions on why would anybody want to step up\nBe nominated for such an important position why would anybody want to run for office if it simply takes an accusation and unproven accusations which can put a family and literally thrill how\nJust look around here it's all about obstruction it's about resistance and as about what can we stop and put in the president's way what can we put in Congress his way to stop them from doing a better job for the United states of America I mean look at our\nEconomy and how strongly are doing right now and and know thanks to our counterparts across the aisle they have tried to slow us down stop at every opportunity whether it's getting rid of unnecessary regulation whether it as as stopping the tax cuts in JOBS Act whatever it is\nThey try and delay Dell a recess\nUm and that's exactly what they're doing in the house if they take the house we can expect that from\nThe middle of disheartening speckled with is taking place in the United states some very good news came out of mid week\nThe new trade deal was finally signed with Canada several weeks following assigning with Mexico to the United states and Mexico kind of agreement for us MCA\nUs she will replace NAFTA which dates back to the mid nineties Larry Elder joined us even more of the Heritage Foundation will pick up their interview with more\nThey're huge victory for Donald Trump I mean we've got a new NAFTA modernize now the by the way I I always thought now there was a pretty good thing I mean it unified our North American continent uh Canada Mexico and the United states and needed to be modernized there were a lot of things in and out there that were out of date or unfair and\nYou know Trump had a big big for your first she got Mexico to sign on and then he's fighting the screws on Canada\nAnd they've made some real concessions cheer Larry that they didn't want to they didn't want to make and now they're sets up very nicely for negotiating you know the big big deal it's going to come to hopefully with China because they they are the worst uh you know abusers of the trade laws and on the planet\nOne other quick thing Larry I was there yet the rose garden when Donald Trump had his past outbreaks of one of the point she married\nHis he said look I Want to use these terror ups as a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce their tariffs on us and I have to say you may not agree with a tactic but what is it working 'cause these countries are reducing their their or\nEven a review of the congressional budget office\nSays it NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries and the University of Chicago survey of top economists on Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off with NAFTA than the previous trade deals so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI Do it you know and I told them I disagreed with them or not I think you know I actually helped draft NAFTA back in Nineteen Ninety three or Ninety four when we originally pastor when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nTrump also had a point that it could be approved this is the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a new free trade agreement it's now called the you asked them to see a we're not going to call nap any longer but it is a new a North American trade agreement that will open up orders are between all three countries\nIs modernized because America has a better deal and so I ... I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing minimum wage on other countries should write a ... one of the things I don't like about this deal so that that got me on that one that's not you know we would we want Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics in this plan\nA show I mean I agree with you on that one\nSo on par though this bill lower tariffs and barriers are up for the candidate has imposed against us and Louis terriers and beer and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nYeah not just everyone just one quick thing they're not just terrorists but also there were a lot of it you know as you know we talked about this on your show before war and more what Americans producers called intellectual property we produce\nComputer software we've gotten some copyrights and they're on a technology and when it comes to some of these countries like Canada and something and certainly trying on\nThat and many other countries in the Asian countries they just steal our intellectual property and this new uh I'll call it the U.S she I make as much better protections for not America's intellectual property so countries are going to use our products they actually\nPay for them to the entire interview with economists even more on terminal review dot com going\nOn and then we in our taxpayer money went to preparing religions America's religion for the discovery of extra terrestrial life\nDoesn't matter these innocent or guilty says Spartacus\nSenator Cory Booker of New Jersey had quite a resolute right just ran when we talk about with maternal reveal return to the moment [noise]\nWho is shocking to me that the government would try to take away my freedom\nWhen it gets my\nThat's jak Philips a masterpiece can't shop in Colorado who was sued for living out his religious beliefs [noise]\nAlliance defending freedom took his case all the way to the United States Supreme court which recently gave jak a big victory but apparently not win wasn't enough for the Colorado government because it is harassing him again yes you heard that right this time we are taking the fight for the government but we can't do this without your health\nRight now your give them one hundred dollars will help jak an alliance defending freedom in this fight against the hospitals government call eight hundred six nine one eight nine six nine that's eight hundred six nine one eight nine six nine if it can happen to Jack it can happen to you or any of the value of religious freedom\nAll eight hundred six nine one eight nine ...\nOr click on the alliance defending freedom banner ... town hall review dot com\nBest public leaders are wave makers\nAble to combine smart policy ideas with a call to what makes America exceptional creating waves of popular support\nI'd be Peterson dean of Pepperdine graduate school of public policy and for two decades we've prepared wave makers through the nation's most unique masters curriculum combining rigorous study of our founding principles\nWith the latest tool to policy analysis based at one of the country's leading Christian universities are graduates go onto a variety of careers from chiefs of staff on Capitol Hill to the foreign service and intelligence agencies to nonprofit leadership on issues ranging from education reform to homelessness\nAmerica needs citizen leaders and we prepare them like no one else find out why we say at Pepperdine school of public policy\nYou'll see your future differently from here to\nVisit us online a public policy duck Pepperdine dot edu that's public policy dot Pepperdine dot edu [noise]\nYou know it's so hard for us to say no to waiting Christians Hi it's Mike was Bible league international in our campaign with singing news radio that we're calling still\nThe whole world knows bibles for the nation's our goal is to send God's word to Twenty one hundred Christians in Africa Asia Middle East Europe and other parts of the world who cannot access it because of persecution poverty in remoteness we're only part\nOf the way to our goal we're asking you to be the answer to prayers for bibles by Christians like Ruben in the middle east beaten by or Muslim\nFather after she came to Christ last year and Anya in Africa shunned by her atheist family after she started following cheeses in recent months thanks to seeing a news radio listeners bombing gene ...

that you did not coach anyone on a polygraph never asked boyfriend says that's not true there is her testifying about that's under oath\nI didn't expect it to be as long as it was going to be so it's a little bit stressful\nAnd you have you ever given chips or advice to somebody who is looking to take a polygraph test never\nPay and it turned out that that is a serious question for\nWere you lie about that that Senator Chuck Grassley has now sent a letter to the attorneys for this woman for Christine Blasey Ford and he asked for material evidence relevant to the allegation and then you want some corroborating evidence you know he wants to know from the therapy sessions the doctor for discuss and it turned over to the Washington Post\nAnd he does that he wants copies of all that your

asked under oath and the hearing whether she'd ever given any tips or by someone who is planning on taking a polygraph soccer for replied never misstatement raises concerns about the reliability of a polygraph examination were do that then and therefore need\nThat information so she's a credibility problem there as well then jumps on another a credibility problem it turns out that you said in her Senate testimony over and over again that she was in therapy in two thousand twelve because she had a fight with her husband about building a second front door and the reason that she wanted a second front door is because she had security concerns because she was still\nDeeply disturbed about her alleged sexual assault at the hands of Brett Kavanaugh will now it turns out that that's a really dicey story\nReal clear investigations pulse Barry over real their investigation had the beach in which he does real estate and other record to undercut the part\nOf Christine Blasey Ford's account of why she finally came forward with charges of attempted rape against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh after some Thirty years four testified last week they should never revealed the details of the

I'm a former weeknight media meteorologist for channel seven in Washington DC and one in Nineteen Ninety five I Want to preface this by saying I'm proud or get what's in the actions about he mentioned in his letter I Hope my friend's family in church members can forgive me I first met Julie putting it in Nineteen Ninety three out of Washington DC bar near Wisconsin circle\nHow's it going away party for channel ... Sally I left the party to go to the bar to buy it showed up I haven't drunk alcohol things my Eighteenth birthday as I tell or the end of our Julie approach me she was along quite beautiful well dressed and no drinking Han consequently my initial thought what that you might be a high end call girl because of the time I weigh three hundred and fifty pounds\nSo it was someone like her want with me but there was no conversation about a changing sex for money so I decided to talk with her human\nI'd never been hit on in a bar before I didn't leave with her that night although we talked about getting together over the next couple of weeks we met when I Believe and still believe with Julie place from the beginning Julie knew I was married and then I was having marital issues\nAnd says she was an opportunity I felt she had only interested in my three hundred and fifty pounds all because I was on TV\nAnd well known although we're not emotionally involved there was physical contact we never had sex despite the fact was very sexually aggressive with me and then he talks about all of her fantasies you know sets of multiple guys and he suggests that or she is politically motivated and he says\nThat basically she's not going to be believed he made to the calls are sociopath a and do that that's not great for her account either enter account always was was really troublesome right but the gang rape account was always a very difficult to substantiate considering there should've been witnesses for any of that stuff\nWe're going to get to a final allegation of Democrats tried to bring up last minute and just one second but first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet like you said why would you buy generic mattress built for anyone else\nHe would sleep has built a frequent that takes two minutes to complete they use the answers to match your body type and sleep preference that's the perfect mattress whether it's I'd sleep or a hot sleep or whether you like a pleasure from it but he like there's no nothing no more confusion that going to feel it sweeps dot com slash Shapiro take their two minutes we'd cause they'll match your mattress that will give you the best leap of your life you're going to be the day\nYou hear how energetic I Am ...

V. show probably tell them apart that took place at the house and judge Kavanaugh's undergrad fraternity during the Nineteen eighty seven to Nineteen eighty eight school year and which allegedly featured some salacious activity of court judge Kavanaugh had already graduated when this party allegedly took place on the first year law student that period as as you well know\nMost academically in time and most students live it's allegations has all the makings of a tabloid headlines but there's just one problem\nThe accuser freely admit to having no evidence whatsoever that judge Kavanaugh even attended his party is Chuck Grassley slapping the crap out of Chris Coons\nRather than provide even circumstantial evidence of judge Kavanaugh was attending the accuser provide some investigative evidence he proposes that someone searched judge Kavanaugh's calendars the very same calendar is your college have dismissed and divided\nTo determine whether he attended a frat party at some point in Nineteen eighty seven in Nineteen eighty eight and that's it\nAll he alleges that he wants to witness a fallacious party at our house owned by judge Kavanaugh's undergrad fraternity even separately advises us to obtain and search judge Kavanaugh's calendars to determine if he attended\nWe've reached a new level of absurdity with this allegation there is no evidence the judge Kavanaugh is anywhere near the party or anything to do with it at all in fact the only person we can be sure attended a party was the accuser\nInvestigators have serious work to do all the minority has refused to engage with the allegations against judge Kavanaugh in any meaningful way by investigators have tried to pursue every relevant lead and therefore I Hope that before boarding an allegation and the future you'll first consider whether you'd want you or your staff to spend valuable time investigating it thanks for your consideration\nHonestly I I got to love Chuck Grassley the point you just does not give any out that this way he like you know what we're done we're just done here we are finished it ... it it it's just great because he did the same Bernie Sanders earlier this week Bernie Sanders sent him a letter saying\nWe wind up longer FBI investigation and Grassley sent him a letter back\nSaying Bernie you came out five minutes after the nomination and said that you were going to oppose Gavin you think I can change your mind you're going to have your mind maybe we'll talk about it and it's just it's amazing so all of that leads up to the fact that there's just a shifting argument going on in this started off if you recall\nWith an argument that Brett Kavanaugh was unfit for the court because he allegedly tried to rape all grown and Seventeen right that was the original allegation then it turned into gang rape that turned out to be all then it turned into a killing himself at a party no evidence of that and it turned into okay well maybe it's got angry angry we kind of angry people on the court because Ruth Bader Ginsburg seemed like a delight\nA roommate or Ginsberg who goes out and rent\nRuth ginsburg who goes out and ran as are being gene then it tore his RPG yeah but she goes out and she ran politically every five minutes\nShe's perfectly she's ... you know the corporate Brett Kavanaugh mad when you accused him of being a gang rape it doesn't belong on the court the shifting ballpark posts are jumping and say here's Hillary Clinton thanked Brett Kavanaugh's behavior is out of bounds\nOr I mean Hillary you want to be president and you drank John McCain under a table and throw a lab for your husband served that\nAirs Hillary Clinton wearing again something that she got from ... wardrobe and ...\nBut I think for anyone who believes there is such a thing as a judicial temperament and that we want judges particularly those on our highest court to approach issues approach plaintiffs in defendants with um a sense of fairness that there's a lot to be concerned about because\nHe got mad when you use them of of being ... and I remember\nSomeone else getting mad when when her husband was accused of rape I remember that who would that have been accused of sexual assault that's probably true I remember someone getting mad about that oh yeah and you want to be president in the United states by the way I should correct by Gillette reference has moved ... not ... it was a dictator and Bob way well got to have gotten into character from doing okay\nHow how often the shift that the Cantor Alvin camera on CNN there was a story about how bright cabinet back when he was in college got in a bar fight with a guy I talked to my eyes to the guy\nI Know when they explain how this works I went to Harvard law school a lot of great minds there why are these folks will be senators the people who are in my class and there was a guy who would go out they invited me but I ... as you all here this is not my type of party they'll go out to bars and getting drunk off their body and then they would just suck each other and then I\nI not not a joke like they would actually just punch each other and the girl I like there's an actual thing that I Would hear about later\nImagine not my kind of party and but\nThe accusation here by ... throwers are more likely to adult so if you were in a bar fight with all due to a bar\nThen it must be they use sexually assaulted a woman years prior\nMakes perfect sense makes perfect that I'm with the all the way Allison ... and ... herself\nI think that if you are known as a belligerent means fighting drunk that's relevant I think that it's relevant to than a woman who said you would corner her and putting your hand over her mouth somehow that I think makes more sense than if you were just a fun draw who always fell right asleep\nOkay or alternatively the two things don't necessarily have to do with one another because guys getting bar fights with other news and then they may not touch when\nThat happened ... that's where it's like these people have never met a man it's a it's a it's an incredible incredible thing coming up more goal post shifting from the Democrat Senator Bernie Sanders has a new way of shifting the officers\nReally irritating because let's face it the original allegations are serious rather sorry allegations that by having a drink and they have and I

Shakur it turned out\nThat nothing has been found and we've been doing this for another week another week thing under Jeff Flake\nAnd the idea of the FBI investigation was going to while everyone's clearly that's happened clearly Democrats are now very satisfied with how they go on everybody has a lot of faith in the FBI folks I don't know what\nThey really feel like a bull investigation has been done and they're feeling pretty satisfied about all the take for example Senator Dianne Feinstein who took the results of the FBI and Corey and she saw that it basically said nothing you can you know what I feel like that have been settled now really compare Brett Kavanaugh's nomination\nOr alternatively she knew what everyone knew what she would do and she said oh no\nInvestigation is a bunch of going\nAnd it was never meant to be comprehensive and therefore Democrats can't vote for Kavanaugh on that basis or a Dianne Feinstein who really has just been\nI mean there's no other word for it in terms of the process that you can gauge than than evil I mean it really has been an evil profiting which needs engage getting an allegation on July thirtieth holding it for six weeks until just before the vote releasing it without any corroborating detail\nMay be releasing an anonymous link in order to spur the full release and the story and then grilling Brett Kavanaugh on to pose a gang rape and all this growth but here that are Dianne Feinstein continuing her pattern of being rose by saying that the FBI investigation is incomplete and becomes incomplete therefore that's really why we shouldn't vote on Kavanaugh\nBut what I can say is is the most notable part of this report is what's not in it\nAs we noted by the White House the FBI you not interview Brett Kavanaugh we have seen even more fresh reports of witnesses who wanted to speak with the FBI but we're not interviewed\nOkay so I Love it she said what's most important here is what's not in it\nThat is true but not how she made it so she said what the most important and all the people you have to I didn't interview\nWell that's because the people that she's talking about could provide no corroborating evidence but not in the report is that there is no corroborating evidence for an end I'm Christine Blasey Ford's allegation\nNo corroborating evidence\nNone and she'll be than it is your church Chuck Grassley because there is no hint of misconduct and confidential report on Kavanaugh sexual misconduct claimed he says there's nothing in it that we didn't already know\nSusan Collins and Lisa Murkowski at least in the colon from from Maine ... thing that the FBI profit that has made her feel a little more quiet about this whole thing maybe that's what was going for if so what was the best possible spin on it\nMaybe when Senator play called for the FBI investigation and just trying to get ... on board or provide cover for a couple a Democrat Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp to vote for Brett Kavanaugh\nAlto appalling gets weaker than brutal for Democrats\nAlso the polling data week has been brutal for Democrats and that means that Joe mansion and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota that the two of them may in fact most for Kavanaugh adjusts to preserve their Senate seats it is very likely right now the Democrats than their their chances before the Kavanaugh saying we're not good at it

I have a relative who was murdered that means that send you a committed murder of another person there's no logic to that whatsoever first of all then you'll get away with it she's very clever dastardly in fact in her cleverness\nIt's a ... a lot of them that's an argument that's been repeated we couldn't believe all women because something happened to me\nAnd because when they happen to me I Believe Christine Blasey Ford I don't understand that line of thinking it all bad things have happened to everybody in their life terrible thing happened to many people do worse than others that doesn't mean that third parties are guilty for crimes against foreign part which if it's an uncertain Clinton\nComing up ... and you remember her from such networks and CNN and ABC and NBC she's worked for a much all the network has a piece in today's Washington Post explaining why she believes that you have an audience something wrong fans are very very serious when\nOr live out of high school here but now I'm not going to the front line I'm not going to pretend that Brett Kavanaugh lied about things I think that makes them squeaky clean let's go through with the oppose it lies that bright cabinet all this from ... who they are website and they'll just means they're going to get about as comprehensive a view was actually from media matters which is comprehensive news you can\nPreventive a view was actually from media matters which is comprehensive news you can come up with a Brett Kavanaugh's wide so\nWhat are these impose allies have enough that he did not travel in the same social circle as for what he did\nAnd then they said well he traveled in the same social circles well what's the evidence that some of the people she says we're in a party with her were on his calendar\nThat's not the same social circle that six degrees is Kevin Bacon\nRight and that's that's that's like saying that\nYou know I travel in the same social circle is ending and therefore send your friends are in my social circle that's not the same thing at all also they say that he lied when he attempted to fabricate an alibi backing jumping he did not drink on weekdays that's not true he said he rarely drank on weekdays and his own calendar and in fact you referred openly and his testimony does ... said on this day\nI probably drink at all I Know I probably drink that said though on my calendar\nHave enough that he had no connection to Yale University prior to attending undergrad in law school there but he was the lead if he had ... and ... and it's not really not all I did see admitted his grandfather went to Yale in Nineteen away not here law school in jail but that's that's not that's not actually a thing\nWhere else did he ... he lied about blacking out from drinking\nHe didn't live out that there is no evidence that he actually did blackouts and bringing\nDown the Democrats kept using blackouts and drinking because what they're trying to and they were attempting to establish is that he actually tried to rape Christine Blasey Ford and just didn't remember the incident that that's what they are attempting to say but there are no actual evidence of that\nSo there is no why they're either now when you couldn't tell you that he was playing his his drinking in the most favorable possible like I think that's fair but that's not the same thing as as perjuring yourself and wine openly\nWill go through a couple of more of these opposes wide the cabinet told virtual our has a good rebels that over political as well but first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet in like ... why would you buy generic mattress for somebody else\nHealing sleep has built asleep Clinton takes two minutes to complete the in the answers to match your body type and sweet preference as to the perfect metric\nWhether you're inside sleeper hot sleep or whether you like a pleasure from but was he like there's no more guessing no more confusion just go to sleep dot com slash a bureau take their tune it sleep when they will match you to a mattress\nThey'll give you the best leap of your life for a couple he looks can even split the matter is down the middle providing individual support need and feel preferences for each side and a ten year warranty you get to ride out for a hundred and risk free right now he looked is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress orders get up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off and he would sweep dot com Fletcher bureau wasn't\nWe tried that we got we didn't fully quit we received a mattress\nIt's really terrific it came in the mail we unwrap that popped right on the bed because that inflates right in front of you it's so good I got my sister a healer sleep mattress for her wedding he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro right now for a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or again he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro the matter is is a luxury map for the non military prices healing sleep dot com\nSlash if you're over a hundred and twenty five bucks off so back to the\nSupposed ally the cabinets old vinyl ditch attempts they said\nWe can't nominate him because sexual assault and then they said we can't nominate him because\nOther women had been raped by other people were not by Kevin ... and then they said well we can't nominate him because he got angry and finally they came up with well he committed perjury committed perjury as one problem\nNo imminent to commit perjury so some of the other accusations they say that having on site in Maryland and drinking age in explaining his behavior even though he was too young to legally drink in any case the only thing is that he said in his testimony he was too young to legally drink it can the drinking age Marilyn was Eighteen and he said that in his testimony\nAnd then they got to the booth thing right so they suggest that they lie committed perjury when the charged with perjury for saying that in ... when he was Seventeen he used the word booth to means part and what it actually means is ...\nI'm not kidding this is what they actually are saying that what that everyone knows that moving as anal back the guy didn't know the ... was that that we're\nAlso it turns out that there are a lot of different ways that people use the word ... also something I didn't know but there's been some angel research on the ... and it turned out that there is no way to substantiate that an ally also the term devil's triangle congestion\nAnd that Brett Kavanaugh will using a pornographic reference about Jews and one girl and a brief him again he says that with the drinking game it seems pretty weird wage would scarier path and drunkenness to term devil's triangle uh drinking game but again there are a bunch of people on Twitter who have said that they have heard of that as well\nAs though they there's a bunch of people who say no and he actually meant that now let's let's remember\nWhy if any of this material it's only material because of the congestion by Democrats is that he put a bunch of sexual references on his Facebook page that means you sexually assaulted a girl when he was Seventeen that in an ... an insane line of inquiry it's an insane like have you ever read a Facebook page\nI think people have been in high school\nI went to an all boys Jewish high school\nThey might you're paid was clean\nI Can't say the same for all my friends are there are references that people didn't necessarily understand in the year ... pages and orthodox Jewish day school\nAnd I have a feeling that most high schools around the country are replete with such reference it\nJust in Kenya you got to untied cool we're learning obscure we're sexual references in your your book by dude\nYeah that's right too many to count is precisely the right answer because of course have you ever met a teenage boy\nI Love all the senators were drunk and allow going really well when you were Seventeen you wrote in your book about drinking and making sexual references\nLike okay if you're a Seventeen year old boy I've ever again and he met a Seventeen year old boy there's not a Seventeen year old boy on earth doesn't make sexual references none zero zip zilch but if Brett Kavanaugh downplayed that and the testimony this means he was a purge or we cannot sit on the Supreme Court now that he's sixty years old\nThey do here is that virus and finally they narrow it down to finally they narrowed down to what is this the nails and suggest that he lied when he says that he had a weak stomach so he used to throw up a lot well maybe he had a weak stomach and he threw up because of alcohol and order spicy food\nBut I also have a weak stomach I throw up a lot to\nThat could happen from drinking I've never throwing up because of drinking actually because I don't actually drink 'em but [laughter]\nBut they managed to thank you I don't know I Know now I'm I'm not I'm not desperate enough during managed by that that that that that that'd be just terrible but it's it's so finally they come down to one they've narrowed and on one thing one thing but the thing that I Will try and all this stuff\nBut it's just a bunch of nonsense then they narrow down to one thing and one thing only there is only a credible claim in my opinion there only a credible claim that brick have not lied in his testimony their own a credible claim is that there was a reference on fourteen of the boy your book pages about a woman named ... dolphin who's going to tend the local all girls high school\nNow of things you might need to know that we're in a\nDolphin before we actually get to the deposed why we're in a dolphin was good enough friends have Brett Kavanaugh that originally she signed a letter in support of the idea that he was very good to girls when he was in high school\nAnd she was friends with him for many many years\nAnd she signed that letter there is no accusation that she had sex with him in high school there's an organization that he sexually assaulted her high school there's no oxygen that he touched her in high school not\nSo what exactly is the claim the claim is it out on fourteen voids your book pages there was a reference to Renee alumnus referring to her\nAnd other references suggests that ... that she was ... that this was a joke about among them once you're up among a bunch of digesting that they were alumni of her genitals essentially the day that there's a bunch of guys had had sex with her and when Kavanaugh was asked about that he said that this was an attempt\nAnd when Kavanaugh was asked about that it said that this was an attempt a quality attempted affection among his friends right that that's what he said in his in his actual testimony and I want to see if I read the actual pack of testimony that I can find exactly what it is that that was that he reclaiming by me the basic suggestion\nOf of Brett Kavanaugh is that this was not in fact a a reference to sex with Renee along the ... the raid on me it's not about the fact with Renee dolphin New York times had a piece where they said that it was horrible and hurtful\nAnd here's what the New York times that\nThey had that too um judge Kavanaugh clap it hit dimensions Renee we're part of the football players and trading both thing about their conquest and Kevin ... that it was a corner the attempt\nRight they don't live with the quantity attempt at affection\nMaybe that's true and maybe that's not but there's no way to get a tape perjury first of all it's not material I writing materiality prevention and the FBI and the okay manual and second of all it's fair to say that equality or a close ally\nHere's how he prayed that well one thing in particular we were at about one of our good one of our good female friends and we would admire and what death is with had earning unit don't argue about page with the term alumnus that term a clinically you to shop action to show her she was one of us\nThere is no way to catch it anything differently except theoretically they could have gone in ... one of the other thing dies and you get your name on a page at that point that\nBecause you know what they can find anyone to testify what it meant as we all had sex with Renee\nRenee dolphin so based on him being vague about a yearbook brains chores wall when he was Seventeen he can't sit on the Supreme Court\nYeah go at that I'd had strong strong response Democrat that that's that's definitely what I think that that you ever going to catch him and so it's it's pretty obvious at this point that the Democrats will do anything to stop\nThis out by Kevin ... and it's pretty gross coming up the Democrats tried to make a last ditch effort to stop Brett Kavanaugh for last\nMinute we're shocked shocked the visor certify things at the same coming in to play the game is one of the reasons why Republicans are the last ... pretty amazing to", "show_name":
