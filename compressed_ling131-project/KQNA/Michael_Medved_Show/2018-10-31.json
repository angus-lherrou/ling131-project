I Will share some of the lyrics and then you can hear how well what it sounds like though actually seeing the music video which I'm the music video features footage of Iraq Obama crying\nI Believe he

under President Obama but I'm here the lyrics of don't lie to me and ah this is a definitely an album with a message if ... if you're one of those people who thinks you are going to be influenced in

to tell her what you think what eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six it may bring up things that are on their mind\nDon't lie to me\nIf you don't look at the video can be a more general idea but the music is upbeat watch the music is interesting not very\nIt's nice for me kind of a contemporary track innate express my anger expressed my frustration\nAnd then the\nReporter again who did a very fair and decent job the reporters name is Maggie Haberman leading White House reporter she asked the obvious question she says what about offending Trump fans who like your music and she says it doesn't matter\nI remember being on stage in Washington DC and asking I'm just curious how many Republicans are in the audience\nBecause everybody knows I'm a staunch Democrat and a lot of people raised their hands art or music transcends politics I think I Hope it does I actually said that to George Bush okay and she also talked about she had a nice conversation with Bob Dole\nBut the point is when she says it doesn't matter about offending Trump fans as he ... and then asked can you think of anything good Trump has done\nAnything\nAnd then it says a very long pause and then she says I mean\nThis is a man who's kind of not kind of he's just mean I worry about the children I worry about what is the image east projecting to them\nAnd then later in the interview she thought of something he'd done well and she said what he's done well you've asked me what I think he's good at he's good at marketing then later she she says in the interview she blames Donald Trump or making her fat\nVia the interview concludes with ... asking Barbara how are you feeling these days and she says I Want to sleep nights if we take the house I'll be able to sleep a little bit better\nAnd then my ... and if they don't I don't know I've been thinking about do I want to move to Canada\nI think she'd promise to move to Canada before Trump won the election I mean the presidential election and then she says I don't know if I moved to Canada I'm just so sad and by that thing happening in my country\nI hear what he said now and I have to go eat pancakes now and pancakes are very fattening\nWe make them with healthy flower though Allman flower\nCoconut flower okay good for her ... does anyone think it's fair to blame Donald Trump for making you\nFat and that's what she said\nAh let's go to Jeff in Seattle Jeff you're on the Michael ...\nMichael ... the the whole bomb thing going out with Trump saying you know fake news is evil or why are they the new people and the left as ... the opportunity where there for trying to trying to put a face to the people who exactly are the lawyers who is the fake news is that\nLike Lawrence O'Donnell is if you go on Rachel Maddow is Don Lemon is that the guys was you know you see is that a lot of people you know they need they need a forgery they these people who thinks is alive\nAnd well he he won't he won't because frankly he doesn't watch fake news as he sees that he ... and you heard the stories about how we only allows Fox News on air force one inning apparently got into a bit of a tiff with millennia because he caught her watching CNN or why\nQuarter to quarter to Don and why am I watch all of them you know listen to try and was bits and pieces all of them are good dogs I mean you know he says it does he watch his show but my issue is is they need to try and force them to say who are these people can come out and say I know who is\n... ... again I I I'll tell you I I think you actually I understand what you're saying and I I Do believe that\nPresident Trump would gain a lot\nBy inviting some of the people who have been most critical to him and some of the White House sit down and talk it out it's a it it actually would make you look so different [noise] but but the polarization are and to the sense of president\nAnd it's all gone away and lakes Harry ... a night terribly and then it's gone away and other aches and

you're definitely right up there the cream of the crowd is\nMichael and on the Michael Mann that show uh it's I think sort of necessary to talk about the campaign\nGoing forward and why I Do believe that the emphasis on birthright citizenship debating the topic on both sides is unfortunate and I wish the president hadn't brought it up he brought it up in an interview with actually I was a few days before the campaign\nAnd the the reason I think it's a problem is not just because it's a problem in terms of constitutional interpretation\nBut the reason that the Brett Kavanaugh\nExperience and the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh who's a credit to the Supreme Court and I think is one of the truly great achievements that President Trump has managers getting Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and that Supreme Court\nThat United every Republican and every conservative and they're really where no exceptions I I don't know of anyone who's still calling himself a Republican\nWho opposed the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh I Know I Know Jennifer Rubin in the Washington Post was against Brett how much it's it's she's no longer a Republican in a sense\nShe's no longer a Republican in a sense and basically win elections by uniting your side and dividing the other side\nAnd this not only this unites are sided also undermines the core principle and let me go back to this cabinet confirmation fight the reason that it was so important to get Brett Kavanaugh on the court is because he is what is called an originalist which means that you look at the constitution\nAnd it means what it says\n\nJohn Adams is famous for saying facts are stubborn things well words are stubborn things they have a clear meaning we're is there any doubt\nI mean real doubt about\nWhat um what this means\nUm the constitution of the United states in the fourteenth amendment which was adopted Nineteen sixty eight says all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states and other state where they reside\n\nAnd he hears a ... basically what people say on the other side they say well but it says subject to the jurisdiction there of the reason they included that is they want it to exclude the children of ambassadors people who had a clear affiliation\nWith a another country and all by by that context I think that they could say that someone who is growing up as a citizen of another country or somebody who is\nLeft the United states and live the rest of his life in somewhere else okay you exclude that person but to try to go after now\nPeople whose parents were not us citizens of the United states are not here legally the undocumented\nIs clearly a loser and there's a great great editorial today in the wall Street Journal making that point\nThe real point about this is that there is neither political will no judicial will to do this or to have a constitutional amendment to change birthright citizenship\nPresident Trump is on very strong ground when it comes to resisting the caravan very strong ground and virtually all Republicans and nearly all Americans agree with that\nNobody wants to throw the doors open to everybody nobody wants to remove borders I shouldn't say nobody but very very few and just a fringe of the Democratic party\nAnd to stand on that principle the idea that we have to have an immigration system that works\nThat's the kind of thing you can win the or by the way they they did some fake news today on CNN or they said that well in in order to change the constitution the president would have to get two thirds of both houses of Congress and two thirds of the states that's not true\nHe would need to get two thirds of the house two thirds of the Senate and three quarters of the states it is not possible\nBirthright citizenship is not going to\nChange 'em\nIf Mr Trump wants to end the practices of the wall Street Journal and again nothing new York Times the wall Street Journal which had been very supportive of President Trump's generally says if Mr Trump wants to end the practice sometimes called birth tourism\nHe can always dress and campaign for a constitutional amendment that Congress is unlikely to agree and pass a law much less than an amendment to the constitution\nTo is making this futile gesture of an executive order a week before election day Mr Trump made a political mistake this year by not trading legal status to adult immigrants brought here illegally as children for more border security than Republicans could have run on an immigration accomplishment\nAnd steady one of the political issue and will ... will soon see how well that worked\nBut here's my basic point about this politically I don't think there's anyone who was excited by President Trump saying he's going to address birth tourism who wasn't already supporting President Trump who wasn't already supporting a Republican

about top notch what services you provide\nYeah Hi thank you for having me um top notch property management in sales is a local um\nReal estate brokerage but we do property management we do\nReal estate brokerage but we do property management we do fulltime property management services so an owner hires us to manage their property on their behalf\nAnd then we also have a leasing service so some owners don't want to relinquish the full a management service to accompany then will help them find a tenant market the property and fat the tenants for them and then they would manage it themselves\nIs is a um residential commercial both residential is what our primary focus is what are what are some of the uh uh headaches you can take off of a property owner\nRight well a lot of it is I'm pricing for one some owners aren't up on the real estate market or the rental market so that cell phone maybe we can ... maximize their investment\nLittle better that way I'm In addition to vetting the tenants such a should be a very thorough process some owners don't do that and then they are upset because they don't have a good tenant\nSo vetting is really important 'cause you're setting that expectation within tenant and then those are the rules they need to follow and then hopefully you have a good experience from there\nI used to read the nationally syndicated their rules to call him by Robert brush and someone asked her why did you get out of owning real estate and he should two words time in ... and ... watch what you guys can take care of those things ... that\nIs true will handle all their maintenance on their behalf the vetting of the tenants also you know upholding the lease really says let's has a list of roles of we're there to uphold those on behalf of the owner\nWould try some mistakes to first time property owners make when they want to find the time and\n[noise] I think they failed to do a background checks and so a lot of them go off of a gut feeling kind of like them or you know they drove a nice car\nOr something like that at all the right things yeah exactly and a lot of times those people can be the most deceiving because then you'll pull their records and go oh wow I'm surprised by that and\nYeah so I think a lot of it is that and then when a problem arises they're not sure how to handle it they don't have the knowledge of the laws and if you fail to do a letter or a notification or abide by hourly access laws and things of that nature\nThen you can really get yourself in trouble that benefits the tenant and then you have a little trouble getting them out\nDo you find new property owners who believe that they can walk into their ah the property the only rich occupied by the time and they believe they're going walking at any time and do anything they want\n[noise] yes so there is a misconception that owners have it's my house um I I should be able to go there anytime well when you sign a lease with the tenant you are demanding that property which means you're giving up your right to that property temporarily for that at least term\nSo the law mandates that an owner give or anybody that goes to the property has to give at least a two day notice to be on the property otherwise there are you know the law does protect the owner or the tenants gives me\nA from people just arriving and you know harassing them some owners just feel like they can stop by a lot and that it feels like they're being harassed and watched a lot of the tenants feel that way so\nWhat area used as top notch property management unsealed

turnover costs vacancy costs and things of that nature in addition to whatever their debt is if they have a mortgage or\nOr whatever so there are properties that you can purchase that are a good investments and numbers work and then there's some that you buy that the numbers don't work [laughter] so\nDo you ever go on a ... a ... purchase inspection with their potential buyer or as a service
