honest and how long how many years did you feel that you had a problem with marijuana\nMe it's hard to gauge how many years I actually had a problem I I smoked pretty regularly for more than two decades and I would say at least the last Fifteen Years or so I I overdone it so a long time\nHow do you know you overdo it\nWell now that I'm sober I can look back on some of the uh some behaviors when I was high and realize that\nUh that pot was causing a lot of my problems you know I was having a public meltdowns even temper tantrums even\nUh getting into fights or I was doing crazy stuff in public that I probably wouldn't have done if I'd been sober you know and I also was a sleeping normally\nI I was I was ... and in addition to that I spent a lot of my time thinking about marijuana about how to get it about how to consume and about consumers with\nAbout trips I could take that would revolve around marijuana and you know it's just kind of became the center of my life for very long time\nAnd this was during a period of time when you were making a pretty good career for yourself as a writer you on that you've been married for a while right\nHave been married for Eighteen

but I I sometimes wonder\nHow much more successful I Would have been if I hadn't been soaked in marijuana the whole time and I certainly would have a you know live my life with more integrity and and

invasion\nHas done a um a couple of albums and he's done a little bit of everything but he did a lot of marijuana but no more\nHe was the author of a powerful piece about kicking the marijuana habit too quick questions and then we'll get onto our calls Neal you a question number one is obviously you you wrote\nSo beautifully frankly as the world's greatest living American writer um\nHe was so beautifully about what marijuana meant to you and how important it was to you or it's obviously an empty place in your life where you no longer smoke and haven't for a year almost a year and have you filled up that empty place with something else\nSo you know I'm doing pretty much the same stuff I was doing when I was I I still I I go to the movies of watching TV\nHi yeah I've I still I I go into the movies of watching TV and man you know with my family reading books doing yoga or exercising walking my dog yeah I've just doing it silver\nAnd a and in some ways it makes things a little more boring in some ways it in other ways it makes things a lot better because I'm able to be more ... more attentive friendly\nYou you haven't you haven't replaced the marijuana was some other um a stimulant or ... or\nI Would I wouldn't say that I had a little I had a period after I quit a weed where I uh I was that was played a lot of poker I'm\nStanding so addicted\nYeah and I built the little bank roll and then I lost the bank roll and then I thought I was playing for free and some of that but I I had to back off of that because because that that kind of became all consuming as well I mean I had the biggest why and twenty Seventeen because my mother died very suddenly\nThen I watched it happened and it was very traumatic and so the following nine months were just a you know I dealt with it very poorly I did a lot of drugs and I play I did a lot of gambling and it just was not good and so\nYeah I was but once I sort of moved to the poker into the background and I I'd say that I've replaced it with um you know\nJust a a filled up with books and movies and music\nAnd um you know other sort of as as they say in in the twelve step or would you know our circle activities things that that are are fun and healthy that don't have to do with your addiction\nRight and you don't have that is your son lives are you still fourteen\nHe's fifty almost sixteen\nAnd he's on the sixteenth okay 'cause I mean you've got a freshman up your website do one thing about your website it says it the er toward a the very end it says ... loves cheese marijuana Boston terriers the Los Angeles Dodgers classic cinema and do all of\nThat is true although I'm not doing the marijuana anymore um yeah I Know I I Need to pressure that up I don't how I got to contact the guy who was doing that for me I'm I'm not I'm self promotion I'm good at it in some ways not so good at it and others\nAre let's go to Robert in Naples, Florida Roberts you're on the Michael Mann that show with Neal Pollack\nDoing that my dad used to say it's a poor ... branches tool\nBut I uh have been ... with a lot of friends of different kinds of ... alcohol sex or whatever the case Las ... basic than what they told us some ... and ... there's a person that you have to have\nPersonality disorder where you need something to make yourself strong when in retrospect strong all along and you didn't need to do that\nSo I don't think they're just a marijuana is the person I like to issue a Neal\nYeah I mean that's well that's the thing about addiction right it's like it\nIt emerges as the response to some sort of trauma\nA which create character flaws and then you try to fill the gaps with whatever the addictive substances and he mentioned do a whole list of them you know\nAlcohol drugs gambling sex eating shopping list goes on and off so yeah I mean that's an absolutely are accurate a statement and I I don't think anyone who's ever um\nSuffer from addiction would would disagree with that\nLet's go to Steve in Louisville, Kentucky Steve you're on the show was Neal Pollack\nMichael thanks for having me on so new and just listening to talk it seems like we live a very weird life just just in different places [noise] um I kind of wonder how many people are out there and like us I'm certainly the years\nOf consumption of marijuana or I can talk to the um you know ... has it affected\nYou know you mentioned it seemed like you were a little conflicted [noise] has to know did it help your life or hinder your life\nFor me or you know I didn't have to avoid that I was trying to appeal to fill a what's marijuana or we just kind of stumbled across each other but\nCertainly the creative aspect that may be a little bit more on the artistic side of the visual side but I feel that it's it's certainly a struggle and and my main question was what\nI heard the show was what finally made you quit\nYeah but that's a good question and to address the thing you were saying is like it's just\nMarijuana is kind of creeps up on you right it's not like I'm you know heroin where your job if you get addicted very fast\nI'm so ... you can use it for a number of years it's sort of a low level and then gradually increases as for me that my moment of clarity can't echo ironically enough now that the Dodgers are back in the world series that actually came half the world series I ... I went to Los Angeles\nBecause I'd always dreamed of going to a World Series game even though I didn't really have the resources to do it and I bought a ticket off of some fraudulent third party Web site before I did that\nI managed to get as high as I possibly could um even though you know there's no reason why you need to get high and go to the world series but I needed to get hired to do everything and that was a special occasion so I got really high\nUm smoking this huge joint that has all this crystallized th ... all over the night from smoking weed with a stranger and it has an echo park I went to the stadium\nBombed out on my mind and the ticket didn't scan it was it was like I said it was fraudulent 'em and rather than deal with the situation rationally or started screaming at people and I was on I almost got arrested that got us courted\nOut of the stadium or by security guards I was in the parking lot sobbing and it's kind of took a look at myself in the ... side view mirror of a car and I just saw this you know old man with red rimmed eyes\nCrying over a baseball game and I just I thought to myself this isn't good so I Can't go on like this and so I didn't quit that day but three weeks later I I\nYou know it's kind of ... and I just I took my last puff and\nCan Daniel more rounded up and vote can can you be around other people who were getting high uh use yeah would you go into the other room\n[noise] no I can I was at a music festival in all I live in Austin, Texas and I was at the Austin city limits festival a couple of weeks ago and I was hanging out with friends who are smoking joints and puffing up ...
