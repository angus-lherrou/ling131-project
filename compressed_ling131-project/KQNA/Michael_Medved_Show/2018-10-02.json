chapter in the saga of an ongoing disease which is our government has grown so powerful so all encompassing so able to bend the power of government to favor one group for people\nTo another that this is just the latest example of how our problem in politics is not too much money\nDemo idea why another try and whether we're at our problems too much power POW we are the boundaries never intended for the Supreme Court to be this powerful to decide things on a national scope with a single to Jim and often the five to four vote\nAnd as a result because all the power in my from on some issues especially the hot button social issues is concentrated the Supreme Court people will do anything to get that power anything and that's what we're seeing in the cabin okay [noise]\nWell that that is where we are because legislatures can legislate a chief executives can do executives things and pilots certain programs through presidents are powerful Congress's powerful\nBut they are all I'm a mutual and they're on by biased by the Supreme Court and and that means that just when their disagreements they win and that's just all there is to it or is it what are we mistaken about that\nNow the Supreme Court is are unelected branch and as a result um in the court for the life tenure or we have term limits on the president\nWe have um you know elections every two years in the house of representatives every six years in the Senate but on the Supreme Court especially because the it's only nine justices someone gets on the court for life or that can be in a lifetime of your side

for a Tuesday October second Mark Davis in for Michael that was John fond of National Review I'm OK I'm going to believe him\n[laughter] he he seemed\nTo have not I mean let's say you can't guarantee things that other people will do he knows Jeff Flake I don't I Know I Know sometimes I Know people by what they say and what they do and that gives me a pretty good um\nRadar as to how to feel about them there is a rampant and very appropriate cynicism about Jeff Flake in view of his antics of lake of late but his friend John Fund says look I Know Jeff and if there's not a any disqualifying crazy new thing\nIn the FBI report that a bit Jeff will not screw us here\nSo I'm going to be momentarily comforted by that's a going to defer to Mr funds familiarity with the subject at hand uh but can I be forgiven if my bottom line position is I'll believe it when I see it\nMuch funds testimony also is that the real problem could be Lisa Murkowski fat does that does resonate this is an interesting woman a Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins these are these pro choice women Republicans\nSusan Collins these are these pro choice women Republicans were always an interesting uh uh an interesting ... of ah of political a political life\nI've noticed something Susan Collins a lot\nMore vocal you'd see her you know getting badgered at the airport a lot more often than actually talking to reporters and I think there is a shred of of decency and decorum to Susan Collins and that doesn't mean that I Know Jeff Flake lacks that\nOr that I Know Lisa Murkowski lax yet but I'm I feel pretty good Susan Collins was willing to vote for him even before all of this came about\nWas leaving and telegraphing voting for him before all of this smear campaign began\nSo I just find no reason for her to change your vote there's really no reason for anybody to change the vote but ... you know that doesn't mean that everybody uses biologic or that everybody is a scene things through a clear lead a if Lisa Murkowski you know that has some bug working somewhere of it but some\nSome strike that that does not allow her to to see her way forward to do what the vast majority of Republican voters in Alaska want if she's just in the mood to to flip the burden to them\nThen then maybe she'll do it but here's the thing if John Fund is right about Jeff Flake\nAnd Susan Collins and if my gut is right about Susan Collins\nThan ms Murkowski can go do what ever she wishes because we do need her\nBecause we can lose precisely one\nOne because if we just fifty one forty nine if we lose one it's fifty fifty and then uh then Mike Pence becomes my favorite vice president ever and that's pretty tall order 'cause right now in the clubhouse leaders Dick Cheney so uh [noise] anyway this could all go it it'll blow wide variety of\nWays um but the issue is somehow in complete without having Hillary Clinton way and I know that's just provable he falls there may be mark did why in the world is Hillary Clinton me to weigh in on anything anymore I've seen her favorability rating according to Gallup\nIt remains an all time low of thirty six percent\nOh my God sixty percent\nHad an unfavorable opinion and four percent had no opinion who those people I'd like to talk to someone who has no opinion about Hillary Clinton currently living on Mars or something I don't know a ... at the Gallup has polled Hillary's favorability going all the way back\nTo Nineteen Ninety two\nAnd now it's at thirty six percent and that's an all time low\nWhere was it on the eve of the twenty sixteen election you may ask\nForty three so it's\nIt's better rough couple of years it's been a rough couple of years so hey let's get let's let's give the woman some radio time so she ... this thing called via Atlanta festival I don't even know where that is\nAnd there was a moderator and they're talking to her and the subject a ride is where Brett Kavanaugh in in his um a moment before the is long overdue for the Senate Judiciary committee talked about how the the the torment that he was experiencing\nHad to carry the dengue ... of ... of just long standing Democrat grudges so here's Hillary having a good cackle about that rural it\nBrett Kavanaugh a said that the quote political his job and quote a directed at him a was being done on behalf\nOf the Clintons among other people your response [laughter]\n\nReally deserves a lot of laughter um I wasn't watching when he said that I was having to be somewhere else and away from a TV or and even my phone and so I heard about it later and you know look\nThought it was just part of the whole of his very defensive\nA and on a\nYou know unconvincing presentation on [noise]\nAnd I I told someone later boy I'll tell you they give us a lot of credit I'm\nThirty six years ago I\nWe started this again I get I mean it is back at Yale ... yeah well even before in high school apparently um [noise] so I I\nI don't you know look I Want the FBI to conduct as a thorough investigation as they possibly can within whatever restraints are empowered upon\nThem um but I think\nFor anyone who believe there is such a thing as a judicial temperament and that we want judges particularly those on our highest court to approach issues approach plaintiffs in defending with um a sense of fairness that there's a lot to be concerned about right\nDo tell I think that a judge Kavanaugh displayed exactly the right kind of radar for fairness\nBecause fairness ... exude from his every judicial pour it it radiates from every ruling he has a very strong sense of fairness basic fairness basic decency\nSo that when those concepts are dashed against the rocks when those concepts are ex bloated\nRiding a vehicle of character assassination from the left it is exactly his sense of fairness that infused his personality they're under questioning from both Democrats his Democrat tour mentors\nEdited exactly that righteous indignation that human instinct that anyone would have to sit on national TV and imagine the woman you love and the\nDaughters you love at home watching or having a judge circle back around into it it it into the ears of your loved ones that kind of ... lives being told about him\nTo do that he has a sense of fairness he knows how to be there on the bench\nAnd he knows how to react when the worst kind of vicious unfairness his level toward him

simple question that I I'm surprised nobody has ever brought up is why don't fluently slamming these clowns with a slander suit [noise] and it's getting worse and couldn't if they said this guy's like nickel what because it couldn't prevail\nOr for the for the very reason that this whole world that we're living in is nobody knows there's no certainty that that's why there's no corroborating evidence of a doctor forge claim 'cause we don't know nobody knows nobody says\nThe flip side of that coin is in order to have something actionable in court to just say that that even some of the lesser accusers ms sweat neck or something like that\nTo to to nail her properly on slander you've really got to prove the fall sort of something and that's pretty impossible so it's it's the logical Corning if you want to use that\nThe ads the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence and other words there's no evidence that X happened that doesn't mean that it's proven that it did not\nAnd you kind of need that for a for for slander fighting or any other real reason is that all judge Kevin wants to do is get on the court and then he's going to get on with the rest of his life

forty eight Seventy two hours\nI plan on making a run for the president thing and it occurred to me as I watched Jon ... up here on CNN which shocked when they get a case like Martin ... is everybody thinks he is either\nA ... yeah he did get caught for Ohio jobs um they took him to court and they won a and he did ask yeah I mean there is no one can find anything about it and if you Google you anything about it nothing around\nNo and no and no one no one is going to care what they are going to care about is what the idea is that a Jeff Flake or a John Case it would bring to a presidential race I think they would have strong appeal for Trump haters\nThat have strong appeal for people for whom the president's conservative governance is a little too spicy to sort of the center right the moderate issue voter that that is a voting bloc I think that that that both Jeff Flake and John Case account a fan base not nearly as big as a home\nPhone I felt very badly for but she has already

you know registering play with the based on the short so it just kind of evolved from there and I'm In a in some more characters are born and everything you have to do to make a story and hour and Fifteen minutes\n[laughter] now did they did the old lady has any idea of the value of this record\nNo not at all [laughter] that's sort of the fun of it\nYou know there there's ... there's a little trace of the story that reminds me of the Jack Black or John Cusack film high fidelity\nRight right right [laughter] a lot a lot of musical passion as well\nYeah indeed now I understand that the way you describe this record is both treasured and rare but cursed why is that\nWell the there is a myth about it that if I'm whoever plays that will commit suicide or or or encountered death somehow um because the legend as the Jimmy came Baldwin who went into the studio to record it had just come from\n[laughter] just come from killing his girlfriend a lovely yeah Betty sharp and so the thing is that people say you can hear her screaming and the and the chorus throughout the thing so that's what and and people with with\nYou know bad in there and our heart cutting it affected by\nNow you understand to not only are these two guys chasing the record but they end up doing something terrible spent many years in prison and start all over again when they got her Britain correct\nThey do they um what happens and they don't really do it it's kind of ... at the accidentally happens but they get blamed for it of course the old lady dies and um they get put away\nAnd once they get out they resume their resume their chase for the for the record again they find themselves Twenty years later still lying for\nNow or what kinds of reactions to the film and have you seen that festivals and in critical reviews\nI'm good I mean a lot of laugh um some people think it's a you know it's a true story\nUm some people think it's a you know it's a true story um which is funny when we get those key when a questions um it got up a couple of best feature awards one of the Jackson a crossroads festival another one of the Lone Star film festival\nIn uh Fort Worth and um yeah we're excited to to get it a little you know little wider with our relief\nNow viewers who see chasing the blues are going to recognize a few a very well known faces aren't they\nYeah I Love it [noise] um is probably the biggest face not that he has the biggest base but he um ... as a a major part of the story um steak or Gutenberg has a a a cameo role\nAnd then a Mrs walkers played by Anna Maria Horsford who um it's been in shows like a man and um and then there's a couple you know new people who uh we haven't been out before grant Ross Meyer and a Ronald Conner who play the record collectors\nNow take me through the script writing process starting with a very basic thing did you write in long hand or did you use a script writing software\nNo I I use a script writing software called final draft ... um it's just yeah it's a lot easier because basically if it's\nYou know it's programs I'm a in a format so as you are writing you know you don't even think about how your ... because of just intuitively go so the next thing I guess if you're doing a new Shane or\nUm you know if there was a conversation between two characters once you return to cut out a a U.S um\nPredicts much character mhm is having a conversation\nSo when I Lived in Los Angeles I went to the same little fringe bookstore\nAnd I and I and I thought I had a screen play you know a percolating within me so I picked up a copy of final draft pro and I asked the clerk why is this over two hundred dollars and he came up with a great line he said behind all draft pro freeze you from the tyranny of the tab key\nNot I'm sure the script writers can appreciate that yeah you just rely on the returned key and stuff [laughter] now one of the\nBlue as lovers in music lovers get from watching chasing the blues\nWell I mean as you can imagine years I played a huge part in that um I have a huge passion for for music in general um and you know we were pretty selective um\nWith the songs that we have we played in there there are a lot of older blues um like from the peg leg how will I'm been missing a Mississippi John Hurt\nA southern ... you know so\nWe have a bunch of the stuff in based on the scenes um I listen to you know a lot of music and we were lucky to get\n'em you know to get to get a lot of it\nAnd it wasn't you know too expensive to license ... and I'm On top of that we have some original music\nWho by an artist named the bones of Che are Jones and um he did our a title track and then at the end of the movie there's a really cool re mix 'em by a guy named Cecil laughter\nWho um you know it sounds a little hip hop into it so we kind of you know modernized which was really cool\nNow I understand chasing the blues is opening at theaters friday in LA Phoenix\nPortland Columbus Philadelphia Dallas New York all over the country's biggest markets and the next week it'll open in smaller markets like New Orleans buffalo Salem Chattanooga this is quite a a a an achievement for you is this your biggest a movie success so far\nYeah yeah it certainly is um it's the yes the first one that's gotten this wide of a a distribution ... which is really exciting\nNow is the director I assume you did the casting forward also uh-huh take me through the casting process or what are you looking for in a role in in more to the point\nHave you ever had a certain idea what you were looking for under certain character and some actor came in auditioned completely differently but got the wrong\nYeah I Would um a couple of answers like us down to your first your last one first I'm Jon Lovett is a perfect example of that um as you know as we were writing the script the character that Jon Lovett had was not what I\nPictured I pictured kind of a a little more serious weathered kind of kind of guy I'm and I'm John got got the script from his age at which I didn't even know a ...\nShowed a lot of interest in it and we talked and I'm so sort of re imagine some of the scenes um rewrote some of it you know and then he because there's this characters from New Orleans he wanted to put on a\nYou know a southern accent and I'm so he's he try that out for me over the phone and he was\nReally funny about it so uh so that's the case of kind of like um you know rolling with the adapting you\nKnow my vision um otherwise passing takes it's different thing kind of different ways like lord Chicago we went through a casting agency at the same time we were talking to some agents are getting at actors and a different ways\nUm but um I typically look for actors who are more\nA little more subtle and take you know and obviously take direction um you know really well and are called very collaborative ... like I like that on on a set just kind of like\nFrom being elected again to the corporation commission and that tells us exactly what we need to know Sandra Kennedy is who you need to support and if you want someone who will always stand up for you the consumer\nTo keep your utility bills lowering vote for Senator Kennedy he's on our side\nNot until it paid for by Kennedy twenty Eighteen authorized like Kennedy twenty Eighteen [noise]\nYou're listening to talk of the quad cities cake you and I want the Ghana here's your host DJ fall and we're back\nWhy but two forty we always love having folks here from the Prescott Center for the arts they have a very intimate show coming up it's up playing at the perfect\nA venue at stage two three dumpsters down in the alley just by the PTA mainstay stars of the show playing Mitch annoying we have a William Larson and Jonathan ... pitch a William Tell us about your character\nWho is actually [noise]\nAnd uh he is a a young man at the beginning and talking about his college ears and as it goes along he describes his relationship with his favorite college professor and sociology professor Maury\nAnd just how close they were during their their time together in school he kind of life happens as he says and moved away go to New York becomes a jazz pianist\nAnd loses his was touch with his old professor and doesn't see or speak to him or hear from him for sixteen years before\nA finding out that he's dying of a a less and decides to reconnect gives them a phone call and and you know reconnect so that'll professor and learns a lot about life after that\nSo Mitch album who you're playing the the ... the playwright and author of the book he was a jazz pianist ... I had that wrong oh yeah absolutely because he's I think he's better known for being a sports writer in Detroit froze years boy talk about a renaissance man\nYeah he put himself through school playing jazz bars late at night\nHere isn't that something and a J. P. U. you portray Maury correct yes now that's got to be physically a very limiting role how do you act the way in a role like that with so few resources available\nWell it's actually a a wonderful challenge um being\nAble to just be restricted to head movement or nine movement in the last couple of scenes\nJust creates a whole different way to communicate and I've heard from a few people who've seen it last night and then in rehearsals that um that's part of what they respond to that focused communication between a Maury at the end and and Mitch\n... when you were going over the script what struck you about what made you want to to be Morrie\nWow [laughter] it's a beautiful book and it's a really well written script adaptation of the book um to be able to play more Schwartz is a it's just such an honor and I hope that I'm bringing justice to the role\nOf what he was able to share with his students and other people in their lives and then of course with Mitch as book with the rest of the world\nAs a something very very close to my my heart my philosophy about the way that I like to live my life or at least try to\nUm and the messages that he delivered in the manner in which you deliver them as what drew me to this character\nAnd William as Mitch a kind of your character kind of reflects what I see from an awful lot of educators I interview who say the greatest part of their job\nIs one years after the top of the student the student contacts them in thanks them for being tough on them when they needed to be tough on when they needed to expand it out of her comfort zone and try something more challenging and it made a better life for them and you can identify with that cancer in that character\nAbsolutely yeah another student as recently as a twenty fourteen\nUm you know I've college professors that you know really pushed me when I Need to be pushed and also we're more gentle when I needed that as well and a Mitch immediately as you'd see in the show the ... you get to see the moment when Mitch and more a meat and that first class and\nIt's a media we kind of put on a you know pushed out of his comfort zone by by Maury\nAnd that continues through their college relationship um and then of course it rears its head again when they reconnect a Mitch is\nAfter sixteen years is very comfortable with his life as a sports reporter and um is very proud of himself he you know proud of the fact that he's making money he's got a big house\nUm and Maury at a very different set of values from Mitch and so Mitch has to kind of put his ego aside at times which is very difficult for him\nBut he's also confronting a lot of emotions about a death and his family he loses his uncle a at a at a young age and only Twenty one\nAnd that really hits home because his uncle was the one who taught him to play piano and and so that is a terrible terrible experience for Mitch and so he kind of pulled back from the world\nAnd Maury dying himself as shows Mitch that that there's no reason to pull back from the world especially in the face of death\nMhm and you know we mentioned before he went on the air the irony that\nThe main stage production that just ended guys and dolls was written by a sportswriter Damon Runyon as was Tuesday's or with more he of course a and Jonathan if you can explain for me um when you prepare for a role that's going to be a stage to\nWhere everybody is so close to you how does that how do you change from being on the main stage\nThere's a big difference and the intimacy level is the biggest difference being able to [noise]\nUm and particularly this with a man who is losing his strength losing his energy losing his ability to speak\nAs clearly as lovely as he was before um I Can't give we originally talked about doing this as a fundraiser for a for the new theater in the main stage and when I heard about that I thought this was going to be a challenge you know in a way that I don't think we'll be able to get the intimacy and that's just\nThe challenge you know in a way that I don't think we'll be able to get the intimacy necessary when we change the two states to it felt perfect and it is perfect that uh you know those if you've been to stage to know this feels like you're sitting in the living room yeah pretty much so and and it gives me the opportunity to\nFind more subtleties and to trust them and relying on that as opposed to having to broadly you know bark out\nYou know very quiet and and and intimate lines and so yeah it's a great venue for this and also on the\nMain stage are you having to play to the back row always Oh absolutely yeah whether it's filled or not [laughter] yeah and of course in stage to there is no back row is very [laughter] yeah you can see all their faces and it's a very emotional\nPlay I mean a deals a lot with the death and loss and um we keep it very light we keep it very it's a very funny play more a sense of humor is\nBeautiful the way that shape he delivers it is a perfect and the guy you know I have hard time a hard time not laughing\nOn stage at some of the parts are but it it does get very emotional and uh we had our our preview last night where we got to see an audience for the first time and home and you can see that\nAnd the tears coming down you know ... there's no distance between you and the audience so that was actually harder than the actual scene for me was looking out and seeing people in the audience\nOr who were feeling the ... the taint of emotions that we were\nIn stage to you can feel like yourself cancer absolutely and I was\nJust kind of saying that you can actually feel like going on that emotional ride with Santa Claus sitting there with you one of the things that I Love working about working with Kathy is her creativity and\nAre interesting approach just some of this and she was incorporated some multimedia into this production so they're um we had a a local filmmaker a rod Milligan who's just the terrific work with us\nAnd uh he shot quite a bit of stuff in one of the things that he was an improv seen\nA more a as a teacher at Brandeis University I'm teaching students in a sociology class about poetry\nSo we went and shot that and I'm turns out that a country like that so much the way it turned out that she's playing that um while the audience centers in okay do you want to make it really clear that as people come in and\nThat's just the allowing people to get comfortable and get seated it's not necessarily part of the production we had some people come in last night you know seven to ten seven Fifteen thinking that they were late because they see this movie happening so I just want to make it clear to everybody that uh\nThe play I'm actually the courting and seven thirty\nBut between seven o'clock and seven thirty they'll be this a\nVideo piece a like an old classic Morris so he's\nA William I know you and the P. C. A. are working very hard at planning a new Ninety nine ... version of stage to is that correct\nAbsolutely a black box theater right there on ... around it right there on our campus yeah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "02"}
