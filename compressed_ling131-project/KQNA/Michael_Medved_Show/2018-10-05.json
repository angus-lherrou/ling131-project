witness together a historic moment of decision\nWith the very memorable speech by Susan Collins the senator from Maine\nThe confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to be an associate justice of the United States Supreme court is assured\nOccur sometime tomorrow in less through common concern they move it up\nTo respond to this moment in history this historic hinge and I think it is that this is the most contentious Supreme Court confirmation battle\nIn history nothing close no not cars well or ... worth were actually voted down not Bork who was voted down\nThis has been the most ferocious battle royal somebody who was um had his own battles royal as Bill O'Reilly who um is a friend of the show and a friend of mine and joins us now\nUh with reaction to what we've just witnessed a bills you do take this\nI'm bills you do take this as important moment as I Do\n[noise] certainly is a turning point a for America historically and on the short term I think it will have a big influence on the vote coming up in November\nSo it's hard to say that there's not an more important story I mean as soon as it um which one do you want to check first\nWell let's let's first or take a look at what you think the impact is likely to be on the vote November\nWell I think it's going to be a tremendous backlash against people um who espouse no presumption of innocence which is the Democratic party the only one Democrat voting for a cabin on that show managing the senator from West Virginia one\n... you know the other what forty seven of actually saying look we're with a mop\nWhere with the people who are accused Kavanaugh without any corroborating evidence with the FBI is all ready now said there isn't any\nAnd we're still with the mob we we want to get the pitchforks and the and the fire porches and march up the hill okay so Americans are getting that they're getting it\nAnd they say well what if this happened to my father or brother or husband would I Want no presumption of innocence would I Want the man to be destroyed by obligation\nAnd of course the answer is going to be no throughout the Republicans are smart and that's a big death [laughter] I'll tell you that they run on two things the economy and the Democratic party rejecting the presumption of innocence and I think that both of those things will be helpful to geo care November\nNow one of the other things we now have officially the lowest unemployment rate in a forty nine years [laughter] three point seven percent\n... you have to go back to Nineteen sixty nine\nTo find and unemployment rate is low that's that's no worthy to I I ... you talked about the presumption of innocence now again you're in a unique position talking about anything having to do with hash tag me two were accusations about\nA Himalayan tribe of Harry Eighteen\nFoot yet he's starting to discover that contrary to legend there really is a human being and they're mixed and how do they separate\nFact from fiction and legend think happy feet meets rocky and bowling don't get their mountaintop guru is Diane Douglas threes sunrise headache settled for for those sweetly subversive small foot\nThat you were the two and they send them in a time\nMake you and I send them in a movie review as been brought to you by links lake cafe\nGardening in the mountains can be very challenging for tips in tricks tune into the mountain gardener with

you'll be a tree grow up to this week's show\nThe mountain gardeners three times every weekend Saturday mornings at eight and eleven and Sunday mornings at eight on the talk of the quad cities get you in a\nYou are tired of winning that really [noise] [noise]\nThat was the president of the United states last night uh speaking at a rally in Minnesota I yeah\nAnd he did not a quote mock or in any way speak disparaging lay about\nChristine Blasey Ford\nI'm joined by Bill O'Reilly who are whose analysis and insights on the whole cabinet controversy can be found up the bill O'Reilly dot com he's also the author of a new book almost sure to be another number one New York times best seller it is called killing the ss\nThe hunt for the worst war criminals in history I'm a bill ... everyone seems to agree and I know that you do because I've read you on this subject\nThat this confirmation process for the Supreme Court is just broken and I mean is broken beyond recognition that senator Collins said as everyone has said\nThis entire thing devolved into a circus unworthy of the United States Senate and then we're the spring court what can we do to fix it\n[noise] well I don't think uh [noise] that's going to happen anytime soon the fixing because there's too much money being made in ...\nBecause there's too much money being made in media precincts\nBy playing one side or the author that I always come back to this because it really is the driver of how people uh come to conclusions politically socially entertainment wise you have an eating out is making a ton of money either hating Trump or liking ...\nAll right so the cable news stations are divided won support strong Fox to hate Trump CNN MSNBC but all of them are making money from Trump\nAnd they're not going to stop hating them or liking him no matter what he does\nThe newspaper industry is dying and the only newspapers that are a visible are the hay Trump papers like um the New York times in a Washington Post Wall Street journal editorial page is fair to Trump but\nThey're a report Hodges anti Trump now they're all doing it to make money so the New York times understands it will go out of business if it covers Trump fairly even fairly\nIt has to hate Trump in order to keep it subscription rate high so when you have money a driving media coverage which is what you do have now\nAnd you can extend it to talk radio where you live okay when you have that situation you're not going to have fair reporting you're not going to have moderate commentary you're going to have extremism because extremism is good for the wallet for these corporations\nWouldn't you think that the New York times as the journal of record 'em could survive and maybe even thrive if it were more unpredictable as it were more up to the middle of it weren't so reflect ... liberal\nYou know I think the New York times is now so ideologically driven if you look at their um if you look at the people running the paper from the owner on down um they're all far left people\nThe whole history is that and they're invested in that so they will never do it could they have a business plan and expands I doubt it younger Americans don't read newspapers you know anybody under fifty doesn't read them they read it on the Internet\nUm so they got to go to the people that they know what we knew the subscription and times case it's liberal New Yorkers and liberal people out of town back all let's reading it and um the Washington Post is gone the same way as you would\nThink that with the legacy the post has said it wouldn't you hire a guy like Martin Baron [laughter] to be your editor I mean this guy it's been a committed left this for his whole life\nI mean it's like Christine Ford as soon as I saw that Dr hire the most extreme left lawyers in the country I knew that Dr forge presentation was only about\nWhat may have happened to her but it was about politics\nAs soon as I saw her attorneys were I knew it was politics and that has been now proven\nThat they're the political component in the whole Ford a hierarchy the whole crew was designed to get Kavanaugh and all the people in the crew were Kavanaugh haters\nAnd that's about if you were an aggrieved American and you had been mistreated you don't go out and hire an ideological lawyer you hire the best forensic lawyer you can hire that's what you do\nSo it was too much money and there's too much political shenanigans going on for me to be optimistic that we'll ever have a fair process of confirming anyone in this country at least in the short term\nDon't you suspect that and by the way I Do think that it's more likely than not that President Trump is going to get in his first term and and that's even assuming that he gets his second term but in his first term he could very well get another Supreme Court appointment\nWhich we had ... on our last legs [laughter] you know I don't know what I'm saying that way she's such a you know I I mean she's eighty five ... now she's eighty five eighty five yeah she's nine I'm Brett areas or why he's seven a year to yeah he's\nHe's yes I think he may be Seventy nine he's yeah they're they're both under\nThese are too liberal lions and um the as you said I mean it could happen any time so but the court now is uh where Trump wants to debate even if you a Republican you voted for him you know like um you know like a style you know like he handled himself you know I'm the court is a traditional court again\nI mean basically if he if Trump and let's say that Justice Ginsburg resigns and President Trump a points Amy Coney Barrett who apparently was the runner up\nTo Brett can't own and then she will be the next nominee if Trump gets it yeah and and it'd be the one and and don't you think they will try to attack her as a quote Catholic fanatic seven children and of course I Do uh they'll try to paint her as some Amish person [laughter]\nDoesn't get any more [laughter] not not not that there's anything wrong with Amish\nYou know I mean the extremists are never going to be not screened and that's the lifestyle they live\nUm you know a lotta shows just back to the media and Alice is which you've just been putting forward don't you think there should be room for the same way that Roger Ailes or started Fox News recognizing there was room in the market that there needed to be a conservative voice\nUh don't you think there should be room for something more up to the middle than what we've got right now\nSure uh and I think that you could make money doing it [laughter] but [laughter] it's not easy and it requires a tremendous investment um people come to me all the time I go and say once you go back on TV once you do this once you do that\nAnd you know I'm not going to do that because I like right on my own show on Bill O'Reilly dot com on the c._e._o. and I'm the commentary\nOr what about the O'Reilly network\nYou know it takes it will take two hundred million dollars that's what it's going to take to get up and running and compete so it could happen somebody could or could go I'm or could come out movement and I think you're absolutely right that and make money what about the Koch brothers\nI don't know much about the Koch brothers I met one of ... and I think it was David Koch I met him once he's you know he's doing fine I don't know much\nAbout their charitable people\nAnd I think they do believe in a um\nA more up to the middle a column as you see I'm kind of conservatism a coming coming up a Senator Lindsey Graham just focus on the Senate

L. I. M. A. X.\nUh we um we are now focusing more than ever before on the upcoming election and one of the crucial things about the election is trying to keep this economic growth going you may not have heard the news well of course you have because we talked about it but\nThe um the unemployment rate the applications for new unemployment benefits\nWere like the best in fifty years so how do you keep it going and nobody better to talk to about that than Alfredo Ortiz was the president and CEO of the job creators network they're all about\nCreating jobs and continuing this spectacular spurt of job creation that we've just had Alfredo what's the most important element to keep this prosperity going\nOh Michael bank you first of all for having me on your show the most important thing to keep it going to make sure that we have the right people in Congress and they said that know what it takes to get the economy grow I write\nA obviously the president as a job creator and so you first and what it takes to make jobs and to create jobs and to keep them going which was a pro growth economy\nHad lower regulation less red tape\nLet government and lower taxes and these are the three things that are small business owners were asking for and they got in the navy and small business optimism sky high consumer up in the sky high\nAnd you're seeing the results right three point seven percent unemployment rate record low numbers are in terms of unemployment rates panic black you up for example weapon eight percent I heard it below ... percent now I mean it's incredible\nBut we need folks who understand what it takes to make an economy grow\nAnd those are the people currently have in place right now\nOkay so what happens if um these the a disaster happens for conservatives and the Democrats take over the house of representatives and they immediately focused on trying to wipe out the tax cuts what happens to the prosperity\nIt's going to go away I mean there's there's no other question I mean they have to point blank promise a you know we heard Nancy Pelosi say this\nBlank promise a you know we heard Nancy Pelosi say this we've heard was the work they were for Bernie Sanders said as we heard Chuck Schumer say that right that come this November they take the house over\nBut first thing they're going to do is working on repealing the tax cuts which has made which really made the United states go from one of the most competitive countries across the globe to the most competitive country\nAgain back to be the envy of all trades are across the country because of wonderful trade deals that have now are are now happening across the board look at the new NAFTA for example the U.S MCA as presidents calling it misses now jumpstart it and making may factor for example be alive and come back and true\nHere in the United states over a million a factory jobs are being created\nAnd President Obama if you remember that that could not be nuts that may actually it was done in this country\nYeah and and what is bizarre here is a again they not only one to raise taxes or they want to kill Medicare and effect because when they're talking about one third of all the Democrats in the house or co sponsoring a Medicare for all bill\nRight what happens to our whole Medicare system if you get into a situation where you're giving Medicare to people who are sixteen and twenty five and thirty\nA instead of reserving it for the senior citizens of actually paid for it\nI mean I could listen this is this is one of the biggest things that we have to talk about the nobody is actually talking about the thank you for bringing us up this Medicare for all the expect the cost for that is thirty seven trillion dollars\nThat's really an ... billion trillion ... billion dollars\nI I mean if it's absolutely over ten years right so so there's no end of that sustainable what's going to end up happening is Medicare for all medicine for none\nRight as far as I'm concerned is going to be the same thing that happened with Obamacare you're basically setting up that's going to vote on it because they can just not survive that way we're going to eventually go back exactly where the Democrats want to go which is a single payer system period\nOkay rain now these congressional races are so close I I Do want people to get involved and you can get involved by going to tax cuts were dot com it's a great source of information and engagement\nAnd getting engaged is the crucial thing the ... one of the points that people have made is that\nOne of the impact of this whole Kavanaugh thing as a lot of Republicans who are kind of sitting back and enjoying some of the economic good news and some of the good news on foreign policy we're just taking it easy they weren't particularly excited or worried about this election time to get excited don't you think\nMichael absolutely I mean one of the things you've been around obviously a while and then very election season\nCalled the October surprise I think the October surprise here is that the Democrats are price themselves have this whole thing Kavanaugh thing blew up in their faith I'm ... and we're going to say that enthusiasm gap for example the past week alone I think we've seen that\nNot only that they like they level but across the country at closed up almost entirely and so you know people are very upset
