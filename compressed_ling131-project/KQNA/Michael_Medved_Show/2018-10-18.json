seem to be under attack under attack increasingly in our society\nAnd the ATF the alliance defending freedom is standing up for your ability to find your own path and to live your own conscience you can call the ATF right now you have a tax deductible contribution whatever it is it whether it's a hundred dollars or a thousand dollars\nIf you can give a thousand dollars then that means that there

freedom or go click to I'm Michael midday dot com\nAnd go to the very top of the home page and you'll see a banner for alliance defending freedom you can find out all about this great organization\nOr

six six nine five four three three eight eight that's eight six six nine five four\nThree three eight eight um let's just go back for a moment to this deep question about the out of wedlock birth and why it is a problem for any\nChild in and I'm not now suggesting that people will be punished for having children out of wedlock I'm not suggesting is preferable that a baby\nWho was conceived out of wedlock be aborted are dispensed with what I Am suggesting is that we get back to the idea that in this society there are norms norms are worth preserving and one of the norms would be then\nEat is worthwhile\nFor people to come together to form a durable relationship\nAnd to raise a child in that context\nIt in the truth as a matter isn't you've heard this a lot on this radio show but it's always worth repeating it is a common lie is a misconception it's not just a misconception is a total distortion\nThat most marriages or even half of marriages don't last anyway so you could get married before a baby and well then the baby no no it's true not all marriages last but the majority do\nAnd particularly\nFor four people today today people are getting married a much older age is an average American Woman\nNow has her first child woman who's going to have a child at age twenty seven that's still pretty young that's up from twenty to win Nineteen Seventy\nAnd one of the things that they're blaming for the out of wedlock birth rate is the fact that people spend longer in school but this the idea that you're getting married at age thirty or age thirty one or age thirty five or aged forty\nThat ... that doesn't mean that it's not valuable\nFor your future children\nTo be in a committed long term and chances are permanent relationship one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six the traditional progression of western life has been reversed says John ...\nWho teaches at Columbia University\nHe says cohabiting partners are having children before getting married that's a long term trend\nAcross developing nations okay the idea that they get married later find good lead to see that but what about all those couples and and we know this is couples who are cohabiting\nAre much less likely to last long term than couples that are actually married\nAnd there's a wealth of data that makes that clear let's go to Bob in Cleveland, Ohio Bob you're on the Michael Mann that show\nI think instead of trying to go back to the crash\nInto society we should uh adapt to these new trends and I'm finding new ways of helping these kids ... and I just want to say it is you know back in you know maybe a hundred years ago uh you know that my gallery rates were so high\nThat often a parent would die in the child would or maybe you have to live with their grandma parents or relatives or other relatives show I think this can be done ... as long as we are open minded and adapt to these translate\nWhat does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends are it sounds very open minded and terrific but what does it mean [noise]\nI Would say that we need government program of course\nThat would help that would specifically be tailored to kids living in a single parent situation\nYou know what kind of ... thinking of you want the government to send babysitters you want to establish government day care centers\nI think the American gay character would be one way I think mariners where you dip your pay people who are professionals to go in and spend time with these ... these children and help them out\nOkay how do I let me just mentioned something to you Bob I I understand that sounds very generous and very nice but you know what there are some times families who are married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children\nAnd their financially press is it fair that people like that or having a tough time financially\nWith their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income to provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nI I Know you're going to hate the fish but ah I I I'm going to say this spring because it's just it's just not natural Sherry and we should also raise taxes on the rich\nOK well of course when you say I'm going to hate this on my shelves you down\nBut the idea that cutting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on interest on the national debt than we are on defense and in my opinion I think the independent most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd some of the very ambitious social programs in the worst one of the things that has happened in this country has been shown by a wealth of books and information\nA there is uh Charles Murray wrote the first book that the blue the lid off the welfare system and the way the welfare system has been designed particularly by Lyndon Johnson the great society actually encouraged out of wedlock birth\nAnd there are Democrats who are written about that than you'll Patrick moynahan [noise]\nWho was a moderate Democrats [noise] road about the problems with family structure in the United states and he predicted exactly where we are government rule wars out of wedlock birth of course they're going to get more of that\nWe'll be right back uh with wind has a a public figure go over the line and expressing hates\nBy assure you I have never before endorsed a pain relief product not until now not into relief factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solution for

com that the death of the nation\nMovie dot com let's go directly to your calls and to Lou in Cherry Hill New Jersey Lou you're on the Michael ...\nMichael thanks for taking my call again you Mary Jo um so I just want to say oh they're they're they're friends of the impact of statements when it's coming from there\nOh the impact of statements when a coming from different groups fed or disparaging other groups and what I mean there's there's a history of white supremacy throughout the world for a long time\nAgo in particular when you're looking at white versus black or white versus views you have Germany you have the United states for different places where you know blacks were\nOver centuries in factories and generations um attacked in that way that hadn't been the case of a history of black supremacy on food or on white people or something like that so there are different impact of that\nI I agree I agree and again I I think it's obviously much more serious if somebody in public office say\nIs saying something that is negatively racist then if somebody like Louis Farrakhan saying it however\nI think people were right to challenge President Trump when he was a candidate for office about support he'd received from David Duke because even though David Duke is a joke and a loser and a creep and a former\nKlansmen and a former leader of the Nazi Party and all of the above a she she still it to to allow him to be associated in any way with someone respectable\nIs a very real problem and this brings us to Farrakhan because if you look at Farrakhan history of just a cop Khamenei anti American hatred of his own country\nThe idea that he should be on stage as he was at a recent Franklin's funeral he was just a few seats away from a former president the United states Bill Clinton\nAnd I do not believe that Bill Clinton is anti Semitic in any way I don't believe he is a racist\nBut it you you simply can't all of a sudden sale because Louis Farrakhan his old at this point and because he associates himself with um\nWith with black people and as a representative of black people than anything that he says that is filled with racial hatred and its racial hatred by way against white people in general and it's still toxic instill deserves some kind of sanction go ahead last year\nBy by understand that Michael connected one more point go\nOkay so my point is that where this is coming from where they misled or in my opinion a a black people who are very hatred of ... of wide where it's coming from\n... is a kind of a revolution are fighting back about what happened to them at the people over time\nWhereas the other direction when it was the Nazis or whomever they wouldn't have packing people not because they did anything to them they may get off and fear if the area than and made off that these people were doing stuff against them ... it really\nOkay I look I I understand but if you're talking about this goes into the for instance hatred of Turks against Armenians\nAnd the Turkish genocide against Armenians one of the justifications for that genocide which was real and it happened and and also big knowledge or the record so the Armenian people were cruel to the Turks and they were undermining as it doesn't matter\nIf you were going to express irresponsible hatred toward any group\nBased upon ethnicity or religious faith or there ought to be sanctioned and that doesn't mean that you ought to be shut down by the government but it means that respectable people should John you let's go to Calvin in Columbus ohio Calvin you're on the map that

their fault it's actually our fault back in England they um they outlawed bullfighting and other fighting and so people can take dogs inside under the ... no one would see that\nAnd so they actually started fighting with this breed which is really sad because their main temperament is actually very very kind so we've actually condition them\nJust fighting now the great thing is we live in America

she's the co chair of the St lukes a Native American ministry committee for those who haven't heard about this is Sherry tell us what is the Native American ministry at St lukes\nWell two years ago in November two thousand sixteen and we decided to form a committee um to help bring more knowledge and an education to the public about Native American issues and\nWe have a mission statement it's called we build bridges with understanding through learning carrying respecting and interacting with their Native American brothers and sisters\nDo you have is there a large Native American population in the county\nWell our county has yeah the ...\nWell our county has yeah the pie and you have a pi Apache and some hope the but our entire states has twenty two tribes why a lot of people don't realize that and ah Arizona has the largest amount of tribes and the United states [noise]\nSo there's a lot we don't know so we're trying to help 'em educate and bring some more knowledge about that\nNow this is a risk ... church of St Louis is the Episcopal Church maybe when we're American ministries at the state wide program [noise]\nYes it is um we have an appointed cannon to a statewide ministry her name as Reverend Debbie Reynolds and she's a member of a the total owed them tribe and so there this is a statewide programs [noise]\nAnd how did the whole now you mentioned how it got started but you've got a a presentation of public presentation coming up tell us women where that is\nOkay yeah we we're focusing on a quarterly presentations and pay and it's open to the public can no charge and our next one is this Saturday October twentieth\nIt's from eleven AM to twelve thirty PM or in our parish tall [noise] um [noise] our presenter is Manuel ...\nAnd that tells about a little bit about men well what is going to talk about [noise]\nWell he's going to talk about native contributions and historical events um manual as the U.S army veteran Native American studies scholar and he's also the assistant director of the smoke ... museum\nOkay now I I remember having a guest on previously from St Louis you had a guest speaker present or\nA few months ago who normally play the flute but makes them makes them from scratch although that was a fascinating interview and on this topic here or will the audience to be able to ask questions of ...\nAbsolutely a we have an hour presentation and then the last thirty minutes is open to questions and answers\nWhat are some of the most comedy questions you get from people about the Native American ministry\nWell um I think\nSome of the the things people aren't aware of is um\n[noise] again the amount of tribes we have in Arizona and so they you know they they want to know about that and they want to know more about the different tribes and um\nI really think it's important for people to understand and try we try to erase the stigma stereotyping of native brothers and sisters it's always amazing to me the kinds of statements they hear at times like\nUm they're false and through lack of information people seem to ignore the fact that we live in the most in state with the most tribes and ah you know the most we hear about using or the Navajo which that's fine\nAnd what we have a beautiful Hopi tribes up on the three nieces and we have all the southern tribes [noise]\nAh so I think the questions arise from the not knowing versus the knowing you know they they they want to know more about about all the tribes\nHave you heard of any particular customs better a common with the tribes are on the reservation land that would surprise of the rest of us\nOh probably so some of the tribes you know most of the tribes still\nHave a strong element of keeping their traditions and especially the ... tribe they follow their of traditions very very strongly um and a lot of people don't think that they think that all the tribes or a simulated into our culture\nWhich some of them are and they they live in two worlds\nSo that's part of the challenge to\nOf introducing\nThe tribes the way they are\nBut also the all the accomplishments in the way they contribute to our society\nDo you think a lot of people have underestimated the importance of the tribes to our culture\nOh absolutely you know and I think I think that the reason again that we formed this committee is because there are some of us who really love to know more about the cultures of the natives\nYou mentioned before a misunderstanding stigma things like this do you still find people who just won't talk to people or you know from the tribes or maybe they just have this mistake in fear those on um on diagnosed fear of other people\nI think south some\nI think some and I think also there's ... there might be some uh uh underlying cultural guilt to you know and uh so and also the the there's a tendency to think that our native brothers and sisters don't participate in society as much you know the picture of them\nAre doing their Indian thing on the on the reservation and we have beautiful prominent Native Americans that are that have positions and there's there's a female Native American Congress person running this year\nAnd I'm first time so you know there's there's a lot that that people don't realize how\nDoes this go back to the schools are the schools teaching enough about Native American culture different\nA lot of what\nPeople have learned have been very incorrect misconceptions you misconceptions and\nInteresting and the best way to overcome those ... get to know some people face to
