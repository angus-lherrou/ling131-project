continues to be a painful reminder of some of the more troubling aspects of America's passage the dividing line according to race\nBetween black and white or or you can save between black people\nHave had a unique experience in the United states coming here originally as in slave individual and uh everybody else\nAnd uh there is a new book on this subject by someone who was in the past is very very

lose\nWhich of course there's a line from President Trump and the subtitle\nWhich of course there's a line from President Trump and the subtitle is Trump's more on civil rights a won congratulations on the book\nThat's wonderful and I appreciate you having me on because Michael is is you know I think an intriguing topic of the rich topic but especially for conservative audiences sometimes a very difficult you know kind of prickly issue uh but I think it's so important that's why I appreciate the opportunity\nWell one of the things that I liked about your book is you give proper credit or to the Republican Party in particular to Senate minority leader at the time Everett Dirksen\nFor the landmark civil rights bill let's let's start there because one of the things you remind people of is how profoundly that civil rights bill was passed a with very strong Republican support in Nineteen sixty four\nChanged America and changed life or your family how\nWell first of all the book is structured in terms of the civil rights act that fixed before so that you know we'd go through everything housing education voting rights are and you come to the idea that this would not have passed

you in a [noise]\nOh no Michael Mann that show ah we have our Juan Williams with us he is the author of the new book what the hell do you have to lose Trump's war on civil rights\nAnd um\nWe were speaking a before about basically okay a\nOne you questioned polls that show the president's approval\nRating I'm a strengthening\nAnd I'm I'm In improving particularly among African American people are but\nIf you were to advise the president about how he could bring the country together could improve his standing of an service to the black community will be the first thing you tell them\nWhere I think the number one thing would be economic so you know the president whenever there's a chart of racial in fact the New York that raise their going to turn his language or tweeting\nOr his policies he says hey what are you talking about historic low black on employment\nBut you know again you doesn't say that in fact most of that took place under President Obama and then he doesn't mention that you have twice the level\nThat you have twice the level of unemployment among blacks if you have a white\nBut what I Would say to him it's let's look at the policies\nBecause I as I was saying earlier Michael the number one achievement of the civil rights movement to me is the growth of the black middle class in this country so you want things that support continuing growth that black middle class you do not want to destroy programs intended to help black entrepreneur you don't want to destroy\nCommunity development program\nOr you don't want to go after people who are in middle management in terms of limiting their ability to get overtime pay you don't want to diminish efforts to try to get people into better schools by saying oh we're opposed to all affirmative action even when we know that gosh\nThere's a tremendous history of people being\nHeld out of the school you you got it can't do that and then expect people say oh yeah we like Mr President because your program is offensively directed at damaging their ability to get a foothold\nOkay I just it just about\nLet me to finish the play I spoke to earlier about the growth of the black middle class the tremendous story but they're still remain as not only twice the unemployment rate for the huge gap in terms of wealth between blacks and whites or even or blacks have been moving up\nThere still striving to achieve or to recruit that kind of wealth that exist in black and white America your stocks bonds real estate savings and the rent\nOkay but at ... you say rightly in and I think we can agree completely on this that there is a great ... whole story of black economic progress not all of that is because of government programs in fact most of that\nAnd there's something the syringe terms have documented and I know you're aware of their work because you said it\nIs a that Steven avid little syringe drum of of of shown that a large part\nOf the black economic progress occurred before the civil rights revolution help to set it up and then it continued in and gathered steam and gathered momentum because of the civil rights bills but you're not you're not trying to say that a black progress\nCan only continue with a a government programs on you\nKnow I I don't I I'm certainly not saying that in fact I think what Abigail and Stephen ... showed is and it was a different era because then you had\nThe black community you know much stronger in terms of everything from its own baseball leagues through its own newspaper's general who were segregated society but in terms of how they could then black business prosper and grow\nA it was limited uh ... and curtailed I mean there was a it's a it was a segregated society and four and\nA government back into that segregation and obviously violence in places like how where now where we're used to estimate that black economic growth and black or business by what I Am saying is\nLet's not be in their frankly the idea that if you look at the white middle class in this country\nAre so much of it was built behind things like the GI Bill behind things like giving aid to mortgages though that people could buy homes in this country and don't forget again GI Bill job training educational opportunity\nAfter World War two and that was often gone again I'm going to segregated basis\nSo I mean government has a role to play but that's not going to be it seems to me the be all and end all in terms of economic empowerment it's stuff that you don't punish people unfairly\nLooking at the end I I think I think every all people have good well should certainly agree on that and seeing people of goodwill you played a courageous role during the Clarence Thomas confirmation fight in in defense of Justice Thomas in and I knew you were a supporter of his confirmation\nI'd do you think that history is repeating itself to some extent in terms of the the kind of attacks that have been ... level the judge Kavanaugh\n... I think it's quite similar in terms of you know somebody leveling a charge against the nominee\nIn the comic case it was a ... hill and\nYou know it was very slow to come out but then the committee the Senate Judiciary committee looked at it privately they mess that she wasn't put her name to it and then it got leaked and then it came out so it's very similar because look at for after four she sent a letter to a congressman ash too many make the way to guy and Feinstein\nI and then her name is ... or she does the interview with the Washington Post ... ... ... things similar to me is a level that charge I don't think that anybody that ah you know Clarence Thomas toll on a better\nYeah but one there's a difference of touching the other direction the charges against Clarence Thomas had to do and he was head of the equal Employment Opportunity commission was a government official and he was already yellow graduate the charges the core charges against Brett Kavanaugh\nHas to do with when he was Seventeen years old\nYeah but I think that the larger issue here is a matter of character for someone who's going to be on the highest court in Milan\nAnd that's where I think he's open themselves to his critics and I wish you hadn't done it because they you know the whole presentation of himself at the urging of choir boy he used to go to a book is the was and then all of his friends like this guy was a big grin and he loved the party has own talent\nOkay waist level if you were a U.S senator and who knows you maybe someday I'm not really\nMight have been for hope for the killing of Washington DC becomes a fifty first date which probably won't happen but many that\nAre one um would you vote for ... confirmation no on at this point\nAnd the main reason would be because the way he presented himself as the hearing\nYeah I think especially last week when he went off even making all sorts of suggestions or got Clinton conspiracy theory again and the Democrats are I'm thinking\nWait a minute ears up you're trying to be a judge on the Supreme Court you're displaying a tremendous lack with hamper meant or\nDon't you think given given the amount of money that was spent by George Soros and other than it is well known as it's now come out to the those two women who cornered Jeff Flake in the elevator or actually operatives of this open society project which is a Soros project or sometimes\nThey can can you well I\nUnfortunately I think we are out of\nTime of the book doesn't have anything to do is Brett Kavanaugh but of course\nAt the moment that is it an

was taking on Sarah Sanders about the fact that President Trump last night uh pointed out in a rally\nOr the and pointed out fairly accurately some of the inconsistencies and Christine Blasey Ford's memory the fact that she remembered exactly that she had one beer\nThat night but she couldn't remember which house it was er which year it was as she couldn't remember how she got home after the alleged incident happened which is a big thing that Rachel Mitchell emphasizes in her ... she was the prosecutor who asked questions of her and actually set them up pretty effectively when you read this memo\nIn any of that here was a Sarah Sanders and give them a pasta or about that to President Trump's comments\nSince there's something wrong with the president of the United states mocking somebody would show she\nSeemed to me that he was dating back to the doctor for herself a laid out in her testimony once again I every single word that judge Kavanaugh has said has been looked at

all the\nI think both Dr Ford in judge Kavanaugh all\nAh or victims at the hands of the Democrats I think it is absolutely\nDisgraceful what they've done and exploited this process they exploited Dr Ford there exploiting all of the women that have come out to make any type of accusation this isn't the process that should've been done and certainly everybody deserves to be hurt but that includes judge Kavanaugh and that should be part of this process and the facts\nHave to be looked at and I think you have to look at the prosecutors memo\nThose are where are you see all of those facts laid
