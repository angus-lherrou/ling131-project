gardening can be challenging but with Ken tips fixing gardening by you'll reap huge reward now welcome your can lane\nWelcome to this week's edition of the mountain gardeners this is your host Ken Lay in if you're talking about the landscapes of northern Arizona and we are into probably the best planting season of the entire year everyone wants to plant in spring and and that's a good time\nYou got a lot of choices and spring but it's the hardest time for the mountains is higher elevation or were you when it's dry real in South west when I Do my new tinder new growth heavy clay soil\nYou're almost better off waiting until the monsoons hit a in July some time because then you've got the humidity up that are bailing southwest wind is done yes you get some hail and some other stormy things that happened with the monsoon pattern possibly not every time\nA but but at least your community it says it's easier on the plant the plants have leaked out by them and they've hardened off\nThe tender new leaf is more sensitive than uh hurting the uptick in a more mature leaf of summer and then fall this is when plants absurd to hibernate\nAll plants start to hibernate some start to bloom so you're seeing snap dragging they love the fall they start celebrating by blooming pansies kale\nSnapped a mom's\nA ... a year perennials our echinacea is a uh your shrubs are what is that ... wrote burning Bush and the amber maple and\nWhat is that ... wrote burning Bush and the ... and\nThey're just there's this season for fall where some plants just go will love it I Love the cooler dates I Love the bright days and they prefer to be planted now this is when they do the only time you'll find certain plants at the garden center\nSo right now we're unloading but this is Olive Garden centers all all the higher elevations actually probably Olive Garden centers\nWe're shipping plants now through the end of October is our goal especially if the colder climates\nWe need to predict what the winter inventory needs to be how much a world where we sell through winter and so we bring all of that plant in all the all the um perennials shrubs trees for ah we bring him in now\nSo that we can harden those things off or acclimate them to our cycle of going cold and so they go through the winter months and they are now you can take it in January and December and\nFebruary which which we do plant year round I mean we have our planting crews are putting plants in the ground every month of the year landscapers come in there planting twelve months out of the year\nAs long as they're grounded not frozen were planted but you need a plant that has been acclimated or used to our climate if it's used to that freeze thaw cycle you can go play in the right in your yard be perfectly fine\nAnd so you're seeing this buildup of inventory right now at your local garden center where whether it's Kingman to pine top to paint send to\nSedona camp Verde or Prescott we're all kind of building up our image tore and if you're going to front load a lot of it with your evergreen stuff\nBecause it looks so good even in winter\nAnd then says when people ... most people most ever ranger planted now through march that that's when that's his peak window\nAnd so we're building that we're having more inventory with you've got more choices as a\nConsumer when you have your local garden center and ... shot forever grains say it's a big spruce are you on a big a maple\nWhatever it is you're you're you've got more choices now and they're larger sized so we're trying to bring in\nUh for for us as the water's garden center in Prescott, Arizona this is just a ... a we're looking for big evergreens that are in containers that are easier to move around easy to bring into your house and decorate\nAnd then take out of your house and plants and the landscape for living Christmas trees man so that's a tradition many we sell more living trees than we do cut trees in the month of December because we've planned out we've we've got enough to get through and we showed them off and\nQuite honestly I'd rather have people planted treaty then cut one down and use it throw it away I think that could be that might be considered wasteful and its way better than a plastic thing you got from China\nSo it's just kinda we we've that's our niche in the marketplace and so we\nWe grow and we purchase and we ship in the month of October to accommodate that why do they even get on that track I lose track you see now see I Am anyway you're seeing this fall mixture of plants at your garden center\nThe crate Myrtle ... we're not going to order another one of those until next summer a rows of Sharon is not going to be ordered again until next summer\nYou better grab if you want to summer blooming thing they're starting to show some color now so they're ... they're get that typically either orange or yellow kind of Aspen gold color\nIf you want those if you want a blooming Russian sage view on a cell via Greg yeah autumn stage you better grab it now because it won't be at your local garden center here in ... with ... and other three four or five weeks\nSo then the evergreens will come into their will come into their place so to Tony actors and named dean as that kinda stuff\nSo we've been busy I mean my back kind of hurt from unloading hold the trucks but it's exciting to see the new materials coming in so it's kinda fun so and that's unique to a little bit more temperate climate\nYou folks from the Midwest the east coast you're you're kind of going he's talking he's talking some foreign language to me it's a Latin I have no idea what he's even saying because we've never planted before in the winter\nWhile you're not you're in you're in a warmer climate because it's so nice here year round I mean in January\nA week after major blizzard it's all melted off and his feeling good and you're outside it could take a hike within a entered into layers you know and a vast you're not ... ... ... you don't need to do that anymore [noise] uh for for if you're a garden center odor there's several of us we're all friends friends if there was a major blizzard\nIn Flagstaff gets buried alive we all have agreements we just call each other we're hoping the blizzard ... mid week\nSo that we got we can work the weekend to take the mid week off and we rented the flags that before anyone else and go hit the slopes new skis so [laughter] that's great [noise]\nOnly in Arizona can you do that and then then you'll head down and play around a golf in Scottsdale so it's just the Arizona is the most awesome state ever welcome all you knew folks\nUh to to uh to God's Country it is a nicer here mainly because we are just the weather is so nice I mean it's not southern Californian ice but we don't have the pollution they got either so it's just better here\nSo this is the season when you're seeing a lot of that transition\nInto fall color you folks from Palm Springs in southern Cal and Tucson and Phoenix into the desert you know\nA L passes wet west of of of Austin those areas you're just not used to four seasons you're used to Amano seasons like tropical it's all the same time all the time here we actually have four very distinct seasons and so the fall season is really for our fault color\nAnd this is when the the the flat landers is what we call him the desert dwellers come up but the mountains and they want to see all the Aspen ... oh it's so pretty\nWell you can grow one in your own yard you don't have to go anywhere you can just have one right there and it turns color here in the month of October just has that beautiful fall color has that trembling it's I'm a populist ... is the Latin name for aspens or trembling leaf\nPopular or troubling leave aspens that's our native Aspen that grows here would that beautiful white bark a that's the one birch you folks in the mid west you're used to more birch trees an aspirin\nTrees and there are a little bit heartier but they get that white bark have got a little bit more pointed leaf to ... leave\nBut definitely wait bark a little bit more of a weeping pattern not truly weeping trees but ... it kind of grows out kinda wispy and then comes down\nThe the leaders don't Trimble but the branches do and what I find is and heavy clay soil the birds are actually blew tougher and he got to maintain both of 'em but they'll grow it almost any elevation\nIf you get 'em at let's say if you're going to grow those over in in cottonwood camp Verde I'm not sure about kingly your next time I flew through there I'm going to look for aspens over there I think they would probably grow if you put them on irrigation\nI think they would probably grow if you put them on irrigation I had aspens installed alley when we we lived out there that's four thousand foot forty two hundred feet somewhere in there so that's I think ... are down about five hundred feet lower than that so yeah your I bet you could grow as things out there\nIn the trunks of trees and then grubs in the ground\nAnd so it's really easy to kill and we've got a grub killers called grub killer that's what's just sprinkle it on like a fertilizer water it in ... wipes them out an application will take you through\nYour next spring so once done kind of thing so yeah they're very important I Would do not just those few moms you just planted I Would do that entire bed\nAnd I might even test they test all just to look for other areas because it's such a problem here they they attack plans by the hundreds and

you\nHas ran waters garden center\nYou are listening to the mountain Gardner with local experts can lane mountain gardening can be challenging but with Ken tips change things are named five you'll reap huge rewards now welcome to the mountains Gardiner\nSays things that I did personally in my own personal gardens at my house here at the garden center at the house is right before the storm hit last week\nUh I I fertilized everything in the landscape this is truly the the most important feeding of the entire year\nNow you can do it any time of the month of October I Would just simply taking advantage of the rain that was coming\nSo I get that food on the ground and then in the ground I mean it's actually the rain would would dissolve ... wash it into the ground the plants can start to pick that up it'll do two things if you do it earlier in October rather than waiting till things are truly dormant\nMaybe do it now you can actually change the ph of the soil if you're using the right food now I'll go into that in a bit ah how far deeper I Want to go with this\nUh what what I Do I put my own food it's got cotton seed meal and some sulfur and you're putting that on the ground now would that sold for ... it will actually lower the ph\nWould that sold for ... it will actually lower the ph of the soil you're changing not just fertilizing the plants you're changing the ph the structure of the chemistry of the soil around the plants so it makes it more acidic\nWhat that does for use it brings the color out it there'll be intense or orange intense or purple more intense reds showing up by fertilizing earlier rather than later\nSome of your your your red maples they aren't read it all\nYour red ash it's not it's not purple red at all your your your they're yellow and that's all because the ph once the ph creeps up to a certain level the colors lost your fragrance what will disappear on some things like roses\nAssume you're ... your cup flower things rooted Vecchia your mom's won't have the same you're paying these one of the same fragrance of that they're ... they're noted for it if you're a lie lax\nHaven't bloomed the last couple of years the only reason that is is because they're fertilizer starving and so when a plant can't\nDoesn't have enough food to access it will negate the flowers are just go I Can't spend any energy and the flowers I just have to keep my full of July because I'm worried about starving to death and so that's\nThat's into case you need to fertilize and for those bring blooming plants you really need to fertilize now in the fall it's using that food to form that bud through winter to show off next spring that's why it's so important\nSo if you did this is where we have very heavy clay soils very alkaline water\nAnd not much top soils you this is super important this is more important here in the mountains of Arizona than probably any place else in the country and a task to do because of our clay soil\nThe other half's has to do with our monsoon rains pick up a little bit of tops all we have and it flush it washes it or or has it float downstream and so you'll see these beautiful like against Kirkland creek or\n... you'll see these beautiful big washes with sick topsoil because all the mountains there soils actually washing down into these\nSilky a basins so especially the rich tops you know soil no soil equals no food no food equals no flowers he'd to fertilize more often so you'll find in the mountains of Arizona you're going to have to fertilize I say at least three times a year evergreens for\nEaster if you'd say thinking holidays this is one where you probably do want to pull over if you tuned in and you're driving down the road ... now the time pulled over\nBoth at pen and paper I get that cell phone app your notes here we got him a fertilize three times a year most of my landscape evergreens for and here are the holidays that I use as markers Easter is my\nIs my spring feeding fourth of July independence day is my summer feeding 'cause it's right before the the rains hit that point\nAnd then Halloween October sometime in October you need to fertilize of landscapes especially for the spring bloomers and might evergreens out fertilize at the new year and so that keeps them green and lush and dark\nSo they don't fade and get this winter closest that happens\nAnd so I encourage you and the and the most important of all of those for feeding fall fall absolutely is without doubt the number one this one you don't want to mess\nAll those different kinds of foods a scope cover that I got a minute and a half year let's see if I can go deep how deep I can go\nI like organic foods I'm an organic guy we're an organic shots are our plants are organic our\nOur vegetables or non GMO our trees are all organic me everything is that's a big thing and the reason I Do that is that yes my customers like it\nBut mainly think it would have ... owner after a lifetime of just spraying chemicals around and deal with chemicals what's the odds of you getting through the end of life without cancer about zero now I'm going to have melanoma and stuff but I don't want internal\nStuff just because I was selling round up and metal by on and die as an on and all these other nasty things a lot of them off the market anymore I Try to organic and I find my customers appreciate that as well or at least their dogs do and they're birds do so he organic we've got to organic fertilizer\nSo we spread that out it breaks down slower over the next three months the plants will absorb more and more of this food it changes the ph or lowers because we make it for us the mountains it actually has a lot of ... lowers that ph change in the chemistry so the plankton take up more of that fertilizer\nBut this time of year the point being fertilize\nI took advantage of the rain but if you didn't just get it on there you don't have to work it in just get it on and Mother Nature will send us more moisture that will do all that work\nA those are all great choices the bread prepare ornamental pairs Cleveland I'm rich ... there's a lot of different ornamental pairs they don't form pairs they formed there just flowers without the fruit to get the spring flowers but around\nHaven't even started showing color yeah maybe\nHaven't even started showing color yet maybe another month they'll start showing some color and their stunning rich red meat deep fire engine like I Want the lights on fire engine red that's a color that tree\nYeah very pretty and it feared medium country they would say the rate would ash is absolutely gorgeous there's flame maple too for small trees lots of color trees come in and check them out\nAnd it's time to plant trees so go for it so the fall color starting to show up and come in and pick up the leaves off the ground there for either in color so here waters earns interview right back with more\nOn the mountain gardeners that mountain Gardner and

or and they suggest that cleaning flour to pray Arizona flower\nLooking flowers getting any such a nice feeling it's almost like being with mom and the back yard all over again\nWant help with planning it's all on line at plants that something dead or\nBrought you by the Arizona nursery association that plant something dot org you'll have to\nHave been rising working hard and the fruits of our labor market Research Center\nYou are listening to the mountain Gardner with local expert can lane mountain gardening can be challenging felt with Ken him straight things are named five you'll reap huge rewards now welcome to the mountain Gardner\nRight let's just see if I can share go deeper into this tree thing at least it was on to 'em what kinds of trees can you grow your what what let's go from a small\nTo medium to large and I'll focused mainly on the leafy things not so much fruit trees are fruit trees I'll just mentioned that real quick yes we grow exceptional fruits we don't grow any trips\nOr avocados that's more of the southern Cal desert kind of thing but here we do grow exceptional apples hairs harvest has been tremendous Egypt oh my gosh cherries cherries grows so well the higher elevations\nOf the mountains or are they really do well um I Would say apricot nectar Marines actually will grow in your backyard\nAnd there are so fruitful only takes one tree and you're done uh plums oh my gosh the best plums you've ever tasted coming out of your own backyard\nThis this is your time to plant though and so those are your fruits that you can grow what you're looking for with those kinds of trees are chilling hours\nYou want a minimum absolute bottom line minimum you want six hundred six hundred and fifty chilling hours on that Tagalog she tell you\nA late bloomer Halley blooming it's going to be what we want is a lot of chilling hours so that what that is with fruit tree ... needs um any so many nights of colds before it triggers it's bloom\nAnd so a desert variety might have\nTwo hundred chilling hours it needs some cold but not very much so it's booming by February January up and even at the higher elevations appearance it's got an a chilling hours to blow that's more for the desert so low altitude a kind of stuff here we want a minimum apples\nI'm looking for Apple that need at least nine hundred thousand eleven hundred chilling hours so they're not going to bloom until the end of April May before they start waking up so I get them out of\nThat risk of frost by then we're hitting our our last frost date usually in Oklahoma you can get a a apricot the biggest mistake ever anyone ever makes planting in the mountains so planning apricot know do do a desert variety and so they're blooming in February oh my gosh first of march\nWill our last prostate here in Prescott his Mother's Day\nThat's the first week of may you get two months\nOf exposure to possible frost so what's the likely to get into an apricot a desert variety apricot virtually none the tree is not affected at all it's the fruit when does it blooms set fruit and if that flower or fruit gets it gets frozen it dies the fruit falls off\nThe tree doesn't die but the fruit will shrivel up and fall off so you what\nWe've got a Chilton heart cuts tilt an apricot so they have eight hundred chilling hours they're getting out there getting real close to that last frost date\nSo you have much more consistent fruiting ... type of apricot that the point being I don't want to go into deeper than that\nDo your homework you know who you're buying it from what variety and how many chilling hours it needs a minimum of our six six hundred and fifty hours even that slow I Would say seven eight hundred is what I Would do for my own self\nI wouldn't go any lower than that uh but you'll find all kinds of stuff in the mountains zero just find all kinds of this desert influence coming at ya so a lot of folks plant the wrong variety of fruit tree especially if you're shopping at the big boxes they're bringing the the ... fifty every one of my stores and all of Arizona\nSo from Dallas to Flagstaff ... up everything in between you've got the same variety of desert fruit tree that doesn't grow anyway get embarrassed\nBy what I see other folks selling their garden Centers for here\nFruit trees so if you're talking about smaller or trees in general just ornamental trees not fruit trees ornamental\nOr you've got red buts were famous for red buds a western red bud grows wild eastern red breads thinks it grows wild here they just do really well crab apples or had the show ... all of the fruiting spring trees\nA you've got right now is a service very or or what is that what's a botanical on that\nHe where there's a wild cherry a choked cherry kind of thing that grows wild here it doesn't permit you're it's got a white flour and spring but it's beautiful orange and read the colors and the fall of the year does it's a smaller tree you'll see a tree just brimming wild\nA white out in the wild and that's usually that that that type of jury\nA purple leaves plum of course is probably the most almost over done of all of the trees\nIt's probably the most almost over done of all of the trees but\nA lot of folks come from green country and I've never seen a purple treat your I Want all part all not at my bar brawl suck oh a little bit is good but a lot of it it's a good one to intermix from a design standpoint put ... spots a purple with your greens and things and it looks good\nI'd say the same thing with your purple birch are you're purple a cherries there's several trees a purple foliage on them there's even a purple red but of all things forest pansy read but\nVery interesting because cheaply but the foliage is purple so that that's another small if you're a medium sized trees I Would really we're getting into some definition\nBut I Would say ... you you California folks you love gained goes they do really well here very long lived one of the most ancient of all trees we see ... in the fall so record are from\nMillions of years ago you can you can have one of those in your backyard they're still growing today and stunning or Aspen gold color they are just starting to show their fault color a very pretty leaf to it\nI Would I Would put in that same ... I'm a category bash from Arizona ash which is a native ...\nWhich I Can't tell the difference between the two men desks or Arizona I suspect command interchangeably but it's a good medium size hearty rolled past a tree that turns gold in the in the in the fall of the year very pretty shape to them\nThen the rate would ashes much larger than that gets up maybe thirty five\nForty feet tall they're really ancient commitment thirty ... mid thirties as kind of realistic for re would ask\nFamous words purple solid purple color and lollipop shaped head to it is real pretty formal looking tree didn't didn't shade and the last one I put it in the medium sized we look at gold locus or shape master locust\nIt's filtered son have smaller leave for those are you up on a on a hilltop and you just don't like raking leaves at all you\nWe're the talk of the quad cities eleven thirty am Cape you in a press your belly and on Ninety nine point nine F.

founder of da Vinci wealth a retirement planning an investment advisory firm located right here in beautiful Prescott thank you for tuning in once again I truly do appreciate you well it's Saturday at noon\nYou know what that means are you ready if you're ready raise your hand and say I'm ready because yes we are going to blow up some islands today yes\nWe are going to challenge your footing on tariffs ... we're going to challenge your thinking on investing and retirement planning and yes of course the opinions on this program are strong so strong in fact they may be offensive\nCertainly strong enough to challenge the old dogma and the status quo\nSo let's get started I Want to invite once again each and every one of you\nTo check out investigate explore the new and improved da Vinci wealth dot com very proud of the new Web site\nA da Vinci as the and Leonardo wealth as in your money to meet you at ... dot com you can also download the new e book six critical mistakes retirees make that can jeopardize their financial future that's free my gift to you on the Web site at ... dot com All right\nI Want to talk to you today about some of\nThe risks that we all face in retirement now I Know if I asked how many of you could name the top three risks\nThat we face maybe would raise your hand see of course I can dairy right those are easy they're the ones that we think about all the time it's longevity outliving your money right it's inflation not being able to keep up your lifestyle\nNot being able to keep up your lifestyle and you know you could argue that people have\nConcerns legitimately so about the market those are the top three that everybody regardless of your aptitude or expertise or thoughts around retirement planning everybody could come up with those\nBut I'm here today to tell you that yes those are important\nBut no\nThose are not the only three risks when it comes to retirement planning before we dive in how many of you say hey I'm good everything in my portfolio is wonderful and I know where every single dollar of retirement income will come from\nIn the next year the next five years the next ten years the next twenty or twenty five years right completely one hundred percent confident about your retirement income streams and now and in the future and then how your portfolio is positions\nWell if you're raising your hand I'm hopefully going to get you to reconsider that a little bit today right I'm hopefully going to get you think about some things that maybe were not initially or originally part of\nYour retirement planning your retirement strategy my job is to get you to say wait a minute\nAnd my ... am I going to be OK\nWhat can I Do to make one hundred percent certain that my retirement plan is rock solid and bullet proof ... okay\nTwelve retirement which are you kidding me there and there's twelve come on now yes there are twelve number one first and foremost as we already talked about\nLongevity risk\nAgain this is most people are aware of this\nThe risk of outliving your sustainable income you simply live too long right\nLonger than you expected longer than you planned for longer than perhaps your savings bucket can satisfy here's where most people go wrong with this part of the equation though\nThey significantly under estimate their lifespan their potential life span in their longevity see if you're one of those who says well my grandfather passed away when he was eighty and my father passed away when he was eighty therefore I'm not going to make it past eighty\nI'm here to challenge that thinking and tell you that you're wrong\nOnly thirty percent of one's longevity expectations can be directly traced to heredity\nThe other environmental factors makeup Seventy percent of the equation\nSo it's not the life expectancy when you were born that you need to be concerned about it's the life expectancy now that you're already retired you see it's when you are retired that makes the difference and obviously that suggest to say that a a a couple age sixty five today\nThere is a better than average chance that is more than fifty percent that one member of that couple will still be here at age Ninety five hello\nWe're building retirement plans out to age one hundred and one ad Devinsky wealth because we want to be ready we want to be aware we want to be um up to the expectation that we're likely to live longer than we think\nModern science every single day is basically making our lives better and longer number two entitlement risk\nAnd we hate to use that term entitlements because to me Social Security is not an entitlement hopefully it's not that way for you we paid into it our whole life\nQuite helpfully I might add right so entitlement risk says it's the risk that government programs like Social Security and Medicare will not provide sufficient retirement income\nNow hopefully your plan is not based solely on Social Security income my sincere as hope is that your plan has some other resources and some other income sources in retirement but we need to be aware of the intolerant risk and I'm going to have my two cents worth here I\nHave no doubt that for those who are already retired and indeed for those who are my age I just turned fifty three I have no worries that Social Security will be around and will continue to pay the fully promised benefits for my kids I'm not so sure but guess what they've got a lot of time\nTo build a plan that is less\nRepresentative and less dependent on Social Security benefits for their retirement dollars but we can't ignore entitlement risk\nRisks number three everybody with me I'm going too fast I'm Darren ... this has dementia wealth radio were here every Saturday at twelve noon we'd love to talk to you about your retirement plan to make sure that your plan\nIncludes attention and flexibility to address all of these risks\nNine to eight two three seven three four one one nine to a two three seven three four one one is our local office here in Prescott were not some carpetbagger coming up from down in the valley\nDoing a radio program saying hey and then they gonna come visit you at your kitchen table trying to sell you something and you never hear from again we are here with the local press our officers right across\nThe YMCA on Whipple street and we own a home here in Prescott as well we are local local local art\nOr risk number three excess withdrawal risk and this is just like it sounds that just basically the risk of drawing down assets to quickly\nWhen I had my practice in Southern California had a client that would call me\nConstantly seemingly once a quarter there and I need another five thousand dollars so whoa whoa whoa wait a minute Frank\nYou can't keep taking out all this excess money your portfolio simply cannot sustain it well sometimes it was for a hot tub sometimes it was for his family you know helping out kids grandkids to eventually there comes a point where you have to either you have to both a rainy and your spending\nAnd be\nHave this me or them mentality right you have to take care of your own retirement needs first before you can help children and grandchildren make sure you're okay first\nSo their risk of taking too much money out too quickly is real I have clients that deal with it and I'm not afraid to be the bad guy and say no you cannot do that it is not sustainable ... it stings\nBut that's the professional thing to do that to the fiduciary thing to do the clients interests first number for\nThen even if you have higher returns more positive returns later on to make the average the same the portfolio can never recovered this is the biggest risk than most advisers\nAre unaware of or don't plan for and it can be disastrous for you and your retirement lifestyle alright number eight and then there's one that we're all familiar with\nAlthough to a lesser extent over the last ten or Fifteen Years inflation risk\nInflation or as we talked about it all the time well you know costs rise of my income stayed stagnant or my Social Security payments don't keep up then of course your lifestyle is diminished right the definition is the risk that rising costs will undermine purchasing power of a retirement assets\nSimply the money you have all by as much\nIn one of our workshops who used to do we just have prices tripled every Thirty years right think about what a stamp was in Nineteen eighty and it was like Seventeen Eighteen cents twenty cents right where they are now fifty fifty some odd cents right\nIt doesn't work the Math Doesn't work then when you start looking at some of the bigger bigger ticket items healthcare rises faster than the rate of inflation right cost of education rising much faster housing prices rising much faster\nSo yeah food and energy had been sort of stagnant but the big ticket items the ones that we all need and you can avoid actually the prices have been increasing much faster than the overall rate of inflation and if your retirement plan does not take into account\nThe impact of rising prices what I call the cocktail napkin retirement plan people pencil this out the first day they retired I go well going to get a couple of thousand dollars in Social Security\nAnd I'll take a little money out of my four oh one K. and my bills are acts and I have X plus a thousand dollars I'm going to be great\nNo you're going to be great the first day the first year probably not in five years probably not in ten years definitely not in Fifteen or Twenty years you're not going to be okay that's why you need a more sophisticated retirement plan now I'm not talking about something that's so complicated a PHD to understand\nBut you do need something that will extrapolate inflation into the calculations to see whether or not you're going to have enough money again that's our core competency uh da Vinci wealth\nIf you have a plan a written plan of where your money's going to come from\nAnd how those income streams are going to increase with inflation but I Want to encourage you to give us a call nine to wait two three seven three four one one the website ... dot com\nI Am Darren ... the owner and founder of da Vinci well I'm a certified annuity specialist as well as a certified fund specialist\nUm securities license and insurance license because it's all about building comprehensive holistic solutions not about selling a product alright number nine medical expense risk now some of you are kind of aware of this risk what you choose not to think about it okay\nThat'll never happen to me I'll be okay or I Hope I'm going to be OK okay but it has to be a part of a plan that sense of the risk of paying for\nThe growing cost of health care related services in retirement a recent study place this amount for average couple out of pocket health care expenses now this is not counting nursing care or long term custodial care but medical expenses over two hundred and sixty thousand dollars\nIs your plan ready number ten tax risk oh\nI Know sometimes we think about tax and here's the myth we've all been sold in retirement don't worry you're going to be in a lower tax bracket and\nAnyone who's retired now that is not the case you cannot avoid those required minimum distributions and when you earn too much money more of your Social Security becomes taxable\nSo that's a myth it's a law that you're going to be in a lower tax bracket when you're retired\nSo task tax Rick risk easy for you to say Darren says that the risk that rising taxes or unforeseen taxes\nCan have on portfolio or purchasing power so imagine you need to take money out of your retirement plan to pay the bills but every dollar you take out instead of paying twenty percent tax on it you have to pay thirty percent tax on it\nYou're available assets just got cut in half right you're available assets were just depleted by additional ten percent that goes to taxes\nAnd we know the tax rates will not be going down anytime soon and they just lower taxes and our national debt is twenty trillion dollars\nAt some point they are going to have to raise taxes\nSo if a lot of your money is in qualified plans on every dollar that you take out is taxable you may be in for a big surprise a negative painful surprise but most folks don't even have taxes in their retirement plan they don't even think about the consequences of taxation\nThat's a mistake\nAgain our core competency at the Vinci wealth is not only do we understand the risk that taxes and the impact of taxes on your portfolio and on your lifestyle but we build plans but typically to minimize the tax impact on your retirement assets and your retirement lifestyle\nReducing fan um income\nReducing the impact of our MDs by generating other income that is tax deferred\nA core competency it to Vinci wealth nine to eight two three seven three four one one a risk number eleven or we're winding down here personal or event risk okay this includes spouse saw survivor risk and essentially the definition\nIncludes spouse saw survivor risk and essentially the definition here says the risk that\nUnexpected change in family circumstances may undermine anticipated retirement plans thinking about it if you're a husband and wife both getting Social Security if the husband passes\nThe wife's income goes down because she now steps into the greater of those Social Security benefits and the smaller benefit falls off\nAnd oh by the way the taxes are going to go up because you no longer have\nA spouse or situation on taxes you're not filing joint where you get a twenty four thousand dollar standard action but a single Feiler has only twelve thousand dollar standard deduction that's a dramatic impact in one's retirement lifestyle and certainly going to impact ones\nRetirement plan and finally risk number twelve incapacity\nRisk the risk that as a result of deteriorating health specifically cognitive impairment a retiree\nMay not be able to execute sound judgment in managing retirement affairs what about family members stealing what about institutional ... by the bank\nOr by care facility whereabouts strangers caregivers right the cleaning lady ... tang so these are all real risks is your plan to take into account all of these
