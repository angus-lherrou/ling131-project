I'm not being poetic addressed that you're you're a slave\nTo whatever it is you're addicted to but\nThe the choice before Americans and before Europeans and before others is\nAre you prepared to give up liberty for the sake of being taken care of the answer is almost always yes and the more that you are given the more or less freedom you really want\n\nThis is the great experiment of the United states the great experiment is liberty liberty in God we trust the pluribus unum out were more like coal America trinity wrote a book on the American ... still the best hope\n\nPeople are not necessarily in sync with us take care of people take care of my if you take care of me\nTake care of my children\nThat's why people who home school their children are looked at very often negatively but a lot of the parents the states should teach your children who the hell are you to educate your own children\n[noise]\nSo this has been a revelation in my life is the ultimate issues that are because this is an ultimate issue do we do we want to preserve liberty number one\nOr take care of people by take care take being taken care of now obviously there's there's got to be an element of being taken care of we we all understand that but an element is not dominant which is dominant liberty or the other\nHuman being taken care of to the point where I don't want you to have the liberty to speak because what you say\nMay offend me there's another example of liberty being downgraded on behalf of being taken care of I I don't want to hear anything that may hurt me\n\nOkay ah let's\nGo to a are too doesn't agree so he gets on first pillow or and who doesn't agree Allentown, Pennsylvania high\nHigh than that I Do think I think people want to be typed on good terms\nI mean I can explain\nA teenager has all the benefits that you talked about they get that for the clothing that everything is like the teenager not properly culture rated the teenager rebel\nWhen the teenager even though they're getting taken care of then they go out in a in a stream and they joined a gang\nGang different culture that culture is right there forever ... controlling than anything that parents ever did and if they decide that culture the punishment is worth anything your parents ever did\nSo it becomes a question or two things one is yeah we want to make like a charm\nAnd the second thing is what was the man and a large part determined by our culture as\nWell right I don't know where we differ but ah I really appreciate your call thank you I think\nOf the gangs is a good example you're taking care of him again [noise]\nI can kids in particular the you know they scream I Want to do what I wanted to do what I Want to do but they love guard rail\nIn a moment\nAbout my friends [laughter] everybody trainer from the government can come in and tell you what to do and and watch it clean and you have to choose between\nAnd what you have to choose between your livelihood in your face [noise] don't live in a free America\nThat's Baron Hill Stutzman a grandmother and small business owner who's being sued by the ACLU and her state government if she loses she can be on the hook\nTo pay more than a million dollars to her opponents if this could happen to her could happen to you that's why alliance defending freedom exist they provide free legal services to those whose freedoms are under attack but they can't do it without your help your gift of one hundred dollars will help a BF defend your freedom\nIn necessary resources to fight these little court battle thanks to a matching grant your gifts his doubles when you give now click the alliance defending\nFreedom banner with them as Prager dot com for coal eight hundred for six nine nine six five six eight hundred for six nine nine six wives [noise]\nBy here's the great selling point of relief factor well actually the greatest selling point is that it works for the great majority of people who use it bucked the big selling factor is really the she can get all the pain relief benefits of relief factor with out the negative side effects of ibuprofen\nCouple of years ago with a great this play out of paying them I Would take ibuprofen a lot\nAnd it helped but the side effects were so awful after a while but I just had to discontinue used but that's about the problem with relief factor so that is huge\nSo if you've been using any form of ibuprofen now you don't have to with relief tractor\nGo to release factor dot com check out the pricing and please give it a try shows pain is pretty awful for coal eight hundred five hundred eighty three eighty four that's relief factor dot com\nHello this is Prescott ...

right so you have no no no no no I hear what you're saying so you have very articulate spokespeople on the other side saying folks don't vote for that your premiums will go down if we have medicine the same way we have food and everything else competitively priced\nSo we will have articulate people argue why am I hear you perfectly they'll say no no no don't worry you will have premiums obviously because it's going to be a private insurance market and then the other side will say folks don't you just want to be taken care of and not have this worry\nEvery civilized country in the

where there is a great need and most people will acknowledge it for more civility in our political discourse okay\nSomebody who's never particularly associated with political civility that would be Hillary Clinton [noise]\nShe's trying to make a comeback or what is her connection\nAnd the connection of her declaration was a surprise announcement by Nikki Haley\nI'm One of the finest members of the Trump Administration she has been outstanding as our ambassador to the un [noise]\nWhat is really going\nOn behind the Haley resignation which was announced today she isn't to resign immediately she's going to stay on and the un\nFor her sons I Know I'm again I'm not as some implying that there are any sands on the part of Nikki Haley as she has been a a terrific UN ambassador in fact one of the best ever and um\nWe will see what comes next with her and what her resignation is really all about ... who is likely to replace her and the United\nNations we'll also talk about a new poll which shows what seems to me to be a contradiction to CNN poll\nAnd it shows that\nSupport for President Trump is going up\nAnd going up fairly dramatically\nAt the same time support for Brett Kavanaugh's going down\nSo what's the story there we will get to that and also to the arrest of a a teacher for something he tweeted\nAnd it's something that is very very much shows he has woke I he is clearly on the left\nAnd he also is just lost his job what could he possibly have said that would cause him to lose a job we will get to that as well and to a a stay at home dad\nSounds like a very nice guy\nWho confesses\nThat um he's a pot addict and I tried marijuana addict and he makes the case that marijuana is a profoundly addictive drug or we will get to that as well but first the reactions\nTo what is going on in our country right now to the swearing in ceremony last night a judge Kavanaugh was already sworn in as justice Kavanaugh on Saturday Night so he's been an official member of the Supreme Court for a while\nBut President Trump I think very rightly wanted to stage a formal swearing in and it was a wonderful occasion\nHe had a judge Kavanaugh's family there had all the justice was the spring court were there Ruth Bader Ginsburg was there dancing and celebrating and oh he's thing a few Bruce gays or no that's not true that part but she was there\nAnd uh that's that's appropriate and that's important and I think the judge Kavanaugh justice Kavanaugh spoke very well\nA President Trump did not speak as outrageously or as badly as a liberal media are trying to suggest and we'll get to that place for you and tell you why but first off on this issue of civility which remains a very very big and divisive issue in the country\nHere homeowners western with every Arizona homeowners rosy on our Saturday morning nine to eleven Ninety five point five Ninety nine point nine AM\nEleven thirty cake you in a does your insurance companies seem a little robotic\nChair at Insurance

special to me she's done an incredible job she is a fantastic person really important to also is somebody that she has ... in the United nations from the beginning with us from\nAnd work with us on the campaign has been really a long time very intense\nThat was President Trump this morning\nIn a actually it was a very reassuring a press availability\nAnd anyone who believes that there was some kind of secret a Trump desire to unseat Nikki Haley or whether she's planning to run against him she's not a as a matter of fact she made that extremely clear\nA ... ... is she a presidential possibility for the future of of course he is is she just about the strongest Republican nominee one good thing go for ... for two thousand twenty four\nOr for two thousand and twenty for that matter\nNow she was a terrific governor of South Carolina we enjoyed having her on the show or she is a natural when it comes to politics and she handled the un job with so much dignity in class even when she had to work with Rex Tillerson\nWho was in an ideal partner for her as secretary of state the um\nThat she did a comment about this rumor that she's going to be challenging Trump for the nomination in two thousand twenty of course that's ridiculous she won't and here is Nikki Haley making at about as close as clear as she possibly could\nBe solved Flint's enough to know when you step aside and allow\nTo do the job how they should have\nI Will say that on our on here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can promise you what are we doing at that point in South Korea disappointing to find\nA President Trump said that's so good and uh of course it is and\nIt's appropriate look this doesn't mean that a Nikki Haley didn't have some disagreements with people in the Trump Administration she did\nA but she managed to work with the president and apparently the president deserves all credit according to all observers for allowing Nikki Haley to do our job\nAnd it's very unusual for a un representative because look you're talking about such a corrupt organization\nBut she stood up for the country\nAnd did it with class an eloquent here's President Trump this morning and and again this was a press availability where they both looked comfortable and happy and like they genuinely liked each other or they were sitting in bright yellow chairs in uh the oval office and er\nHere is what President Trump said about the first inkling he had that Nikki Haley would be leaving her job\nShe told me probably supposed to go she said you know\nMaybe at the end of the year the other two year period here I Want to take a little time off or\nHas been very successful governor of South Carolina [noise]\nFor eight years and she uh she did this and this is possibly even more in tune\nWhat's going on in the world is very dangerous in\n[noise] but she's in his job and we've done a fantastic job I gather we've solved a lot of problems or one of the prices of solving problems so the gear just wanted to tell you that uh we will miss you will be speaking all the time but we will miss your number to say you got to finish the job but I\nOkay and uh then Nikki Haley talked about some of her sense of accomplishment sheets completing her first\nTwo years or her two years as UN ambassador and she's going to continue working there until January it's unclear which he's going to be doing after that there are some rumors we will get to those but here is a Nikki Haley talking about\nThe achievements that she sees in American foreign policy in the last two years\nYour with the United states on foreign policy now\nStates on foreign policy now\nThey know that if we say we're going to do something we fall for when the president that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO saying that other countries have\nI mean whether to try and deal with the main thing they get the message and they followed her\nIf you look at the same thing here is that the Iran's\nThree million and a un\nSudan we got an arms embargo which was a long time\nBrain North Korean sanctions\nWhich are the largest and generation done in a way that we can really work for\nAnd the and the Iran deal bringing attention to the world every country needs ... can't overlook all of a bad thing to do and you have to see them for the threat that they are I think he will get the anti Israel bias and a strike\nAnd cars or the president shown in moving the embassy and showing the rest of the world\nThings where we want to\n[noise] you know all those banks have made a huge difference and the U.S\nBut I can tell you that um\nAnd the U.S her story in a way they should make all American very proud\nI this is I'm about as as strong a case as you can make and none none of what she said can you argue it it's all the truth\nAnd yes she was part of it\nBut all of this did happen under President Donald Trump\nAnd this is one of the reasons I suppose that on the CNN poll despite the fact that there is been so much hysteria on the left about having on and the the various horrors that are alleged to have been perpetrated by old white males led by Donald Trump\nThe President Trump actually saw his approval rating rising look as far as Nikki Haley is concerned\nThere's a lot of talk about her replacement\nAnd some of the talk that is most inflammatory is the idea that the president is going to appoint his daughter Yvonne ...\nWhy would that make any sense ... has traveled around the world as she speaks very well she has dynamic she certainly would have the president's confidence\nThat she will also be a terrible choice because it would be very easy for the rest of the world to see a look uh America is becoming like a banana republic or like a dictatorship or clip talk or see where\nThis family that seems to be attacked or for its financial manipulation or every other day by some kind of two thousand page New York times article very encyclopedic and while researching a way out which has gotten almost no attention even from so called mainstream media\nThe the point about all of this is evil uncle would not be a great\nChoice or who would be talking about Rick Grinnell who is um\nOpenly gay and is our ambassador to Germany as fine man and a financial faster so far is that the best possible choice will talk about it and talk about a conspiracy theory [noise]\nInvolving Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham through the un I don't think it was he would go but we'll get to that coming up on the ... that show\nHow skeptical at first but because of the pain and I was having when I Would add that state teeth tend to have to climb stairs I have a lower back can't and even need pain and after about three weeks I found that I can climb stairs\nPain free but it wasn't only pain free I could do it that overstep what out hold me on the rally I'm really happy it makes me feel like I'm
