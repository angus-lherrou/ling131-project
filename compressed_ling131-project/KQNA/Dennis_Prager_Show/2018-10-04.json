days this is Brad Stevens in the New York times anti Trump conservative the first moment was a remark by a friend I'd rather be accused of murder he said\nThen of sexual assault I feel the same way Stevens writes one can think of excuses for killing a man none for assaulting a woman but if that's true so is this falsely accusing a person of sexual assault is nearly as despicable as sexual

of innocence become for today's liberals something to waive off with an arch lead on feeling blue who well I'll tell you the answer Brett\nLeftists are mean liberals are fools but left this or I mean\nI I read my last call them my friends very important column my Columbus week explaining the left\n\nA third Bowman connected to the second listening to Cory Booker explained on Tuesday that coat

conservatives who were ambivalent or even hostile to the president now understand he's not he's not their enemy the left is how is that fair\nA fair and I think it has done has remind a lot of concern but it's a lot of Republican\nWhy they voted in twenty sixteen I'm\nYou know the Donald Trump got about sixty three million votes they weren't all the lunatic fringe data and as we know a many of those people voted for Trump for a couple of reasons that actually were about Donald Trump in so many people voted because they understood\nThat the future of the Supreme Court with that issue a Trump a follow through on that promise by nominating Neil Gorsuch and now I'm Brett Kavanaugh the other reason many many people\nVoted on the twenty I watch I don't want to vote against Hillary Clinton because of the implications of the Clinton presidency falling on Obama's two terms and they did not want a Democrat or in that office and I think these hearings resurrected both of those issues of the\nData for the Supreme Court and the the law in the United states and behavior of the Democrats and the party of health ever mind that a lot of people up\nSome of the party itself ever minded a lot of people\nOf what the faith of that a party looks like right now they're riders mobs inside the hearing room outside the senator's office a threat for people or been receiving\nI think it's all

... we live in California and and my producer is sending money to the Republican candidate for governor of Minnesota\nYeah and I think uh you know and it is going to be up to the Republican to sustain that energy I mean some were worried that uh if Kavanaugh is confirmed this weekend that way for all of a crashed and\nCrashed on the shore and the energy will go out of a [noise] what has happened here but um I think the the that the Democrats certainly intend to go out there and use it as a campaign issue and it will remain to be seen\nWhether the Republican candidates do but ah here we are a month away from that election and nothing bigger is going on in American politics right now and uh the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh was just as I say Dennis I really think it has become a finding out that\nYou know for a lot of 'em are well that's exactly the the other thing is as you and your editorial uh both at the explicitly by the editorial end implicitly by yours that we're all

for the talk of the quad cities it allowed him to the end of Ninety nine of him in Prescott in any five five FM impressed valley in common with you in a [noise]\nAmerican culture [noise] some Michael Rachel\nAnd I know there are a great day and his greatest nation on God's green earth and a great day to day in front of a great question of all of our presidents of the United states which one counts as the most fascinating the most impressive the most compelling\nI think there is a general consensus that would be Lincoln [noise] I mean basically no one like Lincoln and all of our history\nBut who would be in second place and we will leave out the current incumbent President Trump because as of this telling his presidency is still unfolding\nIt would be another president who was up there on Rushmore and no not Washington\nWho is so great that he seems in approachable and almost like a statue and no not Jefferson with his complexities in as many flaws it wouldn't be that fourth Rushmore president the president we celebrate today\nThat would be Theodore Roosevelt the all American Boy\nAnd then using that you're hearing [noise]\nIt'll be a hard time in the old town tonight [noise]\nWas used by Theodore Roosevelt as something of a theme song why because it was used for his regimen some rough riders before they went\nTo Cuba and the Spanish American war then played it virtually every rally until he got rather sick of it while he was running for governor of New York in Eighteen Ninety eight before he became president of course\nAnd I I Need to answer a couple of questions to the very beginning first of all the idea that I call him Theodore Roosevelt and uh not Teddy Roosevelt as he's often no\nWell that's because President Roosevelt always lose to the name teddy when he was a tiny boy he was called cheating and he didn't like it and he never like being called teddy and he was declared anyone who calls me teddy doesn't know me at all\nAnd I certainly hope that by the end of this broadcast you will know President Theodore Roosevelt well\nThere is also great confusion about the pronunciation of his name there are people who say Roosevelt and they will say Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt than there are other people would say no no they know that Franklin said Roosevelt because we have all kinds of recordings of him saying\nBut they'll say Theodore Roosevelt\nHe always said Roosevelt he very clearly did\nAnd I have become friends with President Roosevelt\nGreat granddaughter in other words her a grandmother was President Roosevelt don't want her\nAnd I asked her is there any doubt at all that everyone in your family says Roosevelt she says no it's Roosevelt stop with the Roosevelt\nAnd then the last question about the title of this very special broadcast on the Michael ... show calling him\nThe all American Boy\nWrong and it's a troubling pattern here since and I'm also voted against tougher penalties for criminals who committed drive by shootings really even worse for them as opposed to build an increase penalties for assaulting Arizona police officers are listening miners drive by the end of ...\nYears in cinema talks moderate and let her radical views put them all at risk for\nReal cute cinema he's too radical for Arizona but then there is on the pay phone is responsible for the content of this advertising not

construction chips and hear important information from local for fast you know don't start your morning with that yeah the by Kenny contractors just says the Asian\nOr not\n\n\nYou're listening to a special broadcast or the Michael ... show\nRecalling the president who let us\nInto the twentieth century which has been called the American century or certainly Theodore Roosevelt would have appreciated that designation the special broadcast Theodore Roosevelt the all American Boy\nHe did finally\nWith his father's help overcome\nThe limitations of the asthma that almost killed him before the age of three\nBut in the Eighteen Seventy two when\nRoosevelt was still only Thirteen\nHis father told him sickness is always a shame and often the sin\nYou must make your body\nAnd he was determined to do that one of the ways that he did it was\nTraveling with his family\nAnd a traveling in the saddle he loved riding he loved hunting his father gave him a gun pleased to\nMeet in this context his name is Justin Walker\nHe's a law professor at the University of Louisville and he was a law clerk both for Anthony Kennedy and for the uh appellate court judge who God willing will be replacing Anthony Kennedy a judge a Cavanaugh a and professor Walker thanks very much for joining us\nVery much for having me on the show\nAnd it's it's a real pleasure and I I Know that you actually you first met a judge Kavanaugh when he was teaching at Harvard law school where you are a student right that's right and if you look back can you think what was the most horrifying incident of uncontrolled rage\nThey ever saw from Brett Kavanaugh\n[noise] well\nYou know Michael I it I get the joke but on the other hand I think you know it it will be funny if this whole\n... ridiculous vicious search and destroy process or weren't so tragic um you know I I took 'em for class and I I worked with them every day and chambers for a year um his students included men and women across the ideological spectrum you treated all of them with a with dignity and respect\nHis his temperament has just as has just always been impeccable and that's what the\nLawyers who come before him um have said over and over and over again and again across the ideological spectrum\nNow as a as a law clerk you saw him a virtually every day right yeah\nAnd um what about these these charges of alcohol abuse or did you ah ever see judge Kavanaugh showing the signs of any kind of alcoholic impairment\n[noise] Michael absolutely not a hundred a hundred percent a hundred percent not you know there there were some accusations that had been made that you know I understand how some of his critics might say well look we'll never met you know they think they'll never ... I Believe I Know the truth but they think they'll ever true\nBut these accusations about things that he's done in ... what about you know the notion that it was an open secret when he was in high school or college that he was wild and crazy\nUm if this was an open secret in all his friends all of its queens is the time would have known about er and instead it's quite the opposite the people who know him best dozens scores of people from high school college over and over again say he was he he was he was not wild he was not crazy he was one of the more responsible high school students college students\nAre and and the description of him that's been painted by a few uh you know outliers audio actual roommate who you know hasn't you know that yeah they had a falling out or something or if it's just not sure\nI I think that uh Lindsey Graham has come up with a perhaps a a solution about the one kind of\nTest of a judge Kavanaugh that might satisfy the Democrats\nAnd uh uh one of the snake as as a a professor of law now and as somebody who is very well school in constitutional law whether you think that a senator Graham's suggestion would be a violation of the eighth amendment

really unfair to to judge capital and also the doctor for I think that they have both been used by Democrats on the Senate committee or for political purposes or their strategy all along has not been to try to find the truth which is a slap in the face to a doctor for\nTheir ... their their strategy all along has been to do whatever they have to do by any means necessary away for the sake of delay and I think the strategy has been transparent it goes back to you know ... years ago we were talking about whether or not a million documents was enough or whether it needed to be two million documents it was delayed for the sake of the way\nThat explains why her letter was not investigated in July when it was received that was only leaked the press against her will on the eve of judge Kavanaugh's confirmation so for these Democrats talk about um temperament or another talk about credibility\n[noise] you know it's it takes takes a lot of gumption when it comes to credibility judge Kavanaugh's way\nOne if you were speaking the judge Kavanaugh I Do believe you will be confirmed on Saturday probably with fifty one votes and maybe with fifty votes who and who knows it could be fifty to a but it will be confirmed and what would you advise him uh in order to\n[noise] to rise above and and prevent all and become the great associate justice of the Supreme Court that we both know we will be\nWhere I Am not going to be presumptuous and not enough to to I think that you need to my advice but I'll I'll say that uh we saw his judicial temperament and hasn't packet of a pack of all legal mind for twelve years on the DC circuit when he was indicated by the Supreme Court and unparalleled Thirteen times\nAnd we also saw the last confirmation hearing\nThat he was outraged about an outrageous process as well he should be and I have confidence that wants to use on the bench at the Supreme Court hopefully he will be\nThat we will see the judicial temperament that we saw for the past twelve years we don't have to guess about what kind of judge Brett Kavanaugh will be it'll be the same kind of judge has been for the past twelve years so I'm looking forward to that I share your cautious optimism I understand uh you know it's it's\n... the process so farcical at times that it leads so at Lincoln Center jokes but but I Do want to really you know he's serious that

of a sudden trashed over issues about his high school yearbook and other stupidity that's utterly Iraq\nAbout as high school yearbook and other stupidity that's utterly irrelevant\nAnd watching all of that question is what do we do to fix the process because we really do need to get back\nTo the sort of situation we had before where two justices who were confirmed unanimously\nYes Ruth Bader
