mountain gardening can be challenging public can tip certain things are named by you'll read huge reward now welcome you can blame\nWelcome you tuned in to the mountain gardener this is your host\nKen Lay in doing this a lotta years together we just share about uh the cycles what's going on in your landscape here in the mountains of Arizona and a lot of our current content the garden advice that we get at the higher elevations none of it's coming from here\nIt's deemed in through HGTV or east coast or mid west where most of the production of garden contact comes from books written from there that shows that radio that they're from over there where it's that's where all the bodies are\nFrom Washington DC north to Boston to cook it over to to uh to to Chicago and all of a sudden you've got most of the countries people live there and if you're going to create a book you want to write for them and not for the help of how many people live in northern Arizona\nHalf million maybe no one up here and so that's why we live here we get to be more secluded we can go into the forest and not have to bump into people\nSo we get some space we can breathe the elevation is just the air is cleaner brighter the pace is lower and that's why we love\nThe mountains of Arizona and so if we do get some garden content that's from Arizona it's usually from Phoenix or Tucson Tucson because our university agricultural school is you may go wild cats\nAnd all the bodies in all the students\nOh well cats and all the bodies in all the students go to school and I asked you are or Phoenix metro area and so that's where the TV stations are so you get these\nNews outbreaks it to kind of a an IRS wants here's a pomegranate ... how to prune your palm tree the second year palm tree and the and the content you know it's not for you if you live up in the mountains\nSo we don't grow palm trees that we don't grows up here we don't grow avocados we don't grow big fig trees we have some shrubs that are hard enough to grow here but not trees\nWhen we don't grow crepe Myrtle trees we grow shrub ... there are certain varieties that are hard here that that ah they can act more like a perennial if we do go sub zero really cold cold cold it'll nip I'm back to the ground and they come back fresh every year from the ground like a perennial\nAnd so they never quite get up the side you know there are some over in the ... area there's some bigger ones over there so it's more for the southern folks they want I I don't want crab apples\nI don't want purple leaves plum I don't want flowering cherry trees I Want great Myrtle trees\nAnd they just they just don't perform the cold ... back in the south you know Dallas I ah east you can have beautiful but not not here and so we try to get that information out for the mountains of Arizona the best advice I can give you right now\nIs don't give up on gardening it's still going to leave that irrigation on that even though we had a storm a couple of weeks ago you still don't want to be watering them out once a week\nFor established plant ... these are things that have been in the ground for over a year a couple of years or so or more they've got a fully mature root structure if it's a new you just planted it two three four six months ago this year\nThen you're probably watering that a couple of times a week and I'm Talking trees and shrubs maybe vines the bigger rooted stuff ... if you're talking about pansies\nYour your kale that new lettuce crop you just put in carrots ad that that's a little different because they're shallower rooted sea water mold more often but even now I'm I'm scaling back my watering but I'm not turning it off and continue to nurture\nMy plants this week I've given my some of my plants a hair cut\nTheir jets they've grown a lot they'd been happy they loved all the moisture urban fertilizing well they're happy they're healthy that color is good they're almost too happy so I've got Eli Agnes up against the house has been under planting they're getting too big so I gave them a quick ... none of full I didn't really you know like I'm back in half\nI just the long run or is that gets nip those off I hear a trim you do most of your\nThe pruning and the dead of winter you know January February march you wait till things are cold\nYou don't want to prune too much here this is this is mainly for you desert folks tropical climate areas you folks from Hawaii or for from Kelly California the southern Arizona folks you folks you want to hold off you you are used to pruning roses back in November or as when we always do it\nDon't do that here you'll blunder your way to failure\nIf you do that I keep that structure up on those plants as best you can cause that insulate the heart of that plant so if we go really cold and you never know with the mountains are going to deliver to be dry can be wet can be snowstorm after snowstorm could be\nWarm could be it just never know what it's going to be but you can't go wrong by leaving that structure intact\nSo leave that alone then you prone after the new year after the harshest in wait for a nice break day by by Valentine's the middle of February the weather's getting pretty nice at that point yeah we can have some frost yes we can get a snowstorm or two after that\nWith the weather is getting pretty nice you want to be outdoors at that point and that's when you want to start printing things 'cause you print or right before they start ah elongated start growing faster budding out\nUh so do late to printing now it was encroaching end of the walkway the patios a potato Weiner's going crazy they just needed to be just crawling all over the patio it needs to be cut back\nAnd so we just trim a little bit I did fertilize before that storm at a couple of weeks ago I fertilize everything here at the garden center I fertilized every ... at the at the house\nI Want to make sure that food gets down in there's some time in October you want to make sure that fertilizer you want to really put an an a a nutrient rich fertilizer on the ground so as the plants root there they're actively Rudy right now\nAs the leaves change they root out through the end of the year you could fertilized and you'll get a chubby or stronger fatter route so they're heartier they hibernate to better\nAnd that the food they're going to use to form the buds for next spring form new flower buds when your fruit trees euros ... new strawberries new it's going to use that to form new growth so this is the most important feeding into the years in October\nSo I just took advantage those are two main things\nThat I've done a and then as my plants give up a so some like tomatoes I no longer have a tomato in the ground I harvested them all there were ... they were kind of\nThey were just big overgrown and the production there but it wasn't like it was two months ago man I could pick up enough of them\nAre the cucumbers I Can't I just can't eat any more I don't want any more cucumbers is Tara matinee\nSo I just want okay that's enough that's put in some kale because I Love juicing Kate Hi loves lettuce fresh out of the gardens oh it's so good my mouth just watering thinking about it oh\nMan radishes you can put in now and they'll growth you just add a little bit of garden snakes a few seed and all of a sudden you've got this beautiful crop of broccoli for Thanksgiving dinner or Brussels sprouts for Christmas dinner you can have that\nThe season is so long growing cycles so long here in the mountains\nThey just have to know what is my cycle so your cycle is in in March you've got a whole planting season of cool season things\nMothers' day typically is all your summer things is when you put your tomatoes years any as your geraniums in\nAnd then right now you're starting to plant another cool season like you would in March it's another cool season planting season\nAnd then by then you get tired and you don't want to do it anymore and so you you're given you wait a month or two and you get your seed catalogues sit around Christmas new year\nThen you start to dream and then you've been inside too long you can't eat any more cookies and ... just want to be outside and then you order some seat or you get a few starts and you start all over again usually about march one and that's kind of the cycle that we deal with\nThat can vary a little bit you folks down to lower elevation the ...\nUh the the uh caught and with the camp Verde Sedona is your lower elevation got a skull ballet Kirkland those hillside those are little lower maybe you start a couple of weeks earlier but the same cycle holds your the higher elevations Williams in\nFlagstaff and pine top lakeside those or maybe it starts at ... Memorial Day instead of Mother's Day a couple of weeks\nAnd at Memorial day instead of Mother's Day a couple of weeks later but the cycle is basically the same you gotta cool season summer season and a fall planting cool season so if you do that you can have flowers virtually year round you can have edibles a virtually year round\nAnd so it's really to kill them we've got a grub killers called grub killer I mean that's what's going on like a fertilizer water than whites them out an application will take you through\nYou know next spring so once and done kind of thing so yeah they're very important I Would do not just those few moms you just planted I Would do that entire bed\nAnd I might even test they test all just to look for other areas because it's such a problem here they they attack plans by the hundreds so yes serious grub killer killed scrubs\nAnd they even go in your containers and remember no was it last year we were had this beautiful\nUm [noise] ... not ... and it was just started looking ugly and I'm like well what is the problem with that thing and went to the kind of look at it and touched it and it fell out of the pot rude neuro\nRoots yeah so it can happen anywhere pots raised beds trees shreds so it's something to keep\nOur eye on their ... beetle larva so the Beatles ... roam around they're laying eggs and things and so the eggs have hatched now and now they're actively grow and these are this years grubs you're seeing\nAnd so they'll tripled in size before next spring though so they'll they'll eat actively through mid December\nThen they'll go real deep underground gets cold to hibernate down there and then they'll come back up and eat your spring roots and then your plant blow over in the wind you wonder what happens or your who grow\nFade sorts looking terrible you pull up no roots left grass or get big brown spots and um those are all grub issues and need to be dealt with a serious grip killer be right back with ... and the mountain

you\nHas ran waters garden center\nYou are listening to the mountain gardener with local experts can lane mountain gardening can be challenging but with Ken temperature things aren't in five you'll reap huge rewards now welcome to the mountains Gardner over\nHere is a little trick I learned ... valley so I raise my family at least an I raised our kids in school belly little tiny ranch town fifty miles north of Prescott some between just before Kirkland\nThat area so it's it's in that area is beautiful ranch land we live right on Kirkland creek the kids could roam we are at ten acres surrounded by nothing but ranch we could see no one near our house it was it's concerning sometimes because kids would go and you're going to wonder where they're at I Know I Wonder if there are things I have no idea [noise]\nAh so but they always had max the German shepherd and Baja chocolate lab and wherever those kids when they were right there and so you always had confidence they were they were ... chase a cattle away or\nWere there we had elk and we had the deer tick lots of a well so I had not lions and bears and everything else\nSo everything you could think of was there a pack rats or squirrels rabbits to do everything was there and so I learned a few tricks and one I had the deer come in and they were peeling the bark off of\nMy wallet that ... that solves ... once you're seen show up\nI had a ... that solves shared will not seen once you're seeing show up at the grocery store now all those nuts the great big wallet it was that we'd pecans\nAnd so the wall that's the the deer tick a fancy too and sometimes they'll do this to aspens sometimes I'll do this to any fruit tree especially apples and pears that's her favorite they'll go in and they'll rubbed their antlers on the bark and they'll start peeling off the park\nUnderneath the bark certain trees taste very sweet ... after all that nutrient moisture and taste sweet taste underneath the bark this was very frustrating this wall that was quite large and I did not watch the dear to kill it or girl it if they peel off the bark too much\nWhat I did and this is not in any book you're not going to see this on any website this is just you and me talking over the airwaves and this one worked in my own backyard to keep the deer off\nI'm going how am I going to keep going to do this what I did is is I took some bird netting ... following me with this some black plastic burdening one inch squares you use it to cover fruit trees had it it was right there when\nI Wonder if I loosely wrap this around the trunk and staple gun it to the bark and just let this this netting kind of float around this work where they were eating I Wonder if this would keep 'em off\nAnd boy did it ever work they didn't try to touch that thing once after I put that on there they just didn't know what to do this I didn't wrap it real tight and just loosely letter to three times around\nWhen around took virtually no netting staple gun ... what you think would hurt a tree but trees don't even feel that do their shaved off the rest and they never came back to that treat appeal the bark off I think that same exact technique could work for Apple's your aspirations\nUh willows there after ... woods there's certain things they really like what if you've got deer pressure coming after your trees trying to peel that bark off and don't let them do that because they can kill kill off that Trump\nI think it might even worked for porcupine\nSo if you see bark peeling off real low to the ground usually in the first foot or so there's a there's a porcupines that roam around\nOnly at night they're nocturnal they'll come and they'll just park sit right in front of a tree they love fruit trees and peel off the bark they'll do that to ... I've seen sometimes I'll get up and do the crotch the tree they'll crawl the tree sit down on a main branch and just sit there and you'll see the bark peeled off\nRight where this ranch was coming off if you see that this is serious if the girl the tree that can actually kill it and so I think you could do the same thing by ... ... ah just lose sleep very loosely wrapping that\nA ... bird netting around that probably ... probably any kind of nothing would work just I didn't want it to be obvious\nI wanted it to blend into the landscape so didn't look like oh what what do you do there what did you read the paper on his Trump what's going on and it looks funny\nThe black you hardly even see it doesn't even show up\nAnd so if you get a lot of peeling bark peeling off of that tree then you want to come in and talk to us and we'll we'll show you how to clean it up cycle wound you want to clean it up you can't really ... or so at ... or the staples into it but you can actually clean up the the the the wound spray it with some black\nPruning paint and wrap it and that will basically help the trees you'll ever keep the insects outta that cuts rode that one where the park was being peeled off we can help you that we can go deep with that because we see it so often\nSo that's that's something that happens I here's another little one I found I'm In my lawn\nI had little tiny cone shaped holes in the long ago what the heck is going on who is eating my lawn and so it's perfect little cones it'd be like a dozen of them over this little section of the grass going what the heck is I've seen this in gardens so little tiny holes almost looks like a\nI don't know how to describe for just a cone shaped in the dirt\nAnd I found out that was skunk\nThey were going after the grubs in my lawn and so they could smell that grew up that could they know where does it take their little tiny pod dig open they make that little tiny cone shaped a an underground find the grab sip it up you know ... ... yeah I'm a ... another one so I had all these little dozens of route counter to come back\nEvery night and make more of them\nI put a grub killer down over the lawyer that garden area to

mountain gardening can be challenging but with Ken hipster things aren't men find you'll reap huge rewards now welcome to the mountain Gardner\nLet's talk about some plants that are absolutely immune to to animal pressure so there's some that are more than others note plants adapt\nAs adept at over the generations and generations of plants for thousands and thousands of years have been adapting morphine they're putting in chemicals in their sap\nTo taste bad a select you for be is no animal is ever going to mess with the euphoria it's related to appoint set up the breakup appointed branch of see this white Milky ... come out animals don't like that\nSome animals are like don't like a fuzzy textured leaf\nSo you look closely at let's say ... you'll see the top of the leaf is green the bottom a leaf as white as white powder to those two things one when an animal eats that leads to get that white powder and its throat a kind of goes go oh man\nIt's terrible it's some water end\nIt prevents that leave from perspiring so it sooner dry climate we've got a native sycamore that grows here\nSo it's fifty percent more reduced a more efficient with water use and it keeps the animals off sycamore great animal or is it to plant\nIt's got this bark the pills and flake so that the animals can't get to it can be an layer as easy to some plants are like that of course if in doubt if you walk through neighborhood and you've got tremendous have Alina problems or rabbits are everywhere or deer roam the streets at night\nIf you got that walk huge walk to see what your neighbors have the animals are just going\nTo Yuri are there in every yard they're roaming around going have Joe let's go over here let's see what new over here\nIt's all eat their yard and so you you just get to looking around\nAnd you'll see that the Alberta spruce during every yard animals don't like it they don't need that she put Alberta screws up there ... or or or Oregon grape or in every yard\nSo you can plant one in your yard and having no pressure from the same heard there's roaming around their yard will roam around your yard so you don't have you can plant with confidence that you're going to be okay with that\nI have used society garlic or IRBs sometimes I'll use a lavender Rosemary\nTime oh oregano I'll actually plant that it might containers\nAnd hides the scent of the things they like so ahead Alina love pansies a ... they they live for Kayla my gosh if you've got Catalina don't even bother with kale they're going to go after it no matter what you do\nUp but some things you can plant you can hide the scent they can't find it with with an herb I Love society garlic and so I plant some of those is pretty puts on his garlicky kind of sense to it and the animals to leave things alone in that pots and that container that part of the raised bed\nUsing techniques that generally animals don't like herbs of any sorts of Rosemary does so well up here lavender\nIf you're the only way you can kill lavender is if you water it too much they clap she otherwise ignore it it just grows and grows beautiful evergreen\nPretty purple flowers which is a great plant a time I've got a timer lawn rolling it's evergreen it blooms in the summer here is beautiful the animal my dog's even like the roll around they come into the house smelled like time yeah that's great\nAh so you can use some of those little techniques and tricks or use those plants to actually a land scape with out in your own yard\nMost you natives so I well I Can't say that he'll prickly pear handling a prickly pear\nOr sometimes ... as a the handling all pull up the ... and eat the Rudolph they don't they aren't they don't like to plant they just want the route it's a starch\nMoisture you know the cat food source and so if you see that once they get rooted they're fine but first the animals look at your yard they this is their home\nAnd they know when something is new in the yard it's kind of like where's Waldo only they find the plant to the wall of their look it up there but there's something new there it is let's go check it out they attire heard follow me we're going to check out this one New York oh they just one new fruit tree\nAnd they may or may not like it but they're going to check it out and they'll push and test and dig up and throw the side and see what's they might not even want the plant they just throw it to the side go I Wonder what's known as whole why were they digging or why they put those planted or what's going on\nAnd so you got to train the day or heard of have a Leno or deer or whatever it is at a train I'm going to listen guys you've seen it you've done it has been here leave it alone moved to the neighbor's yard\nWe've have had a you know you use herbs to hide the scent of ...\nUh you know you use herbs to hide the scent of certain things they like they are now starting to make verbal repellents that you smell like meant or closed or\nTo Rosemary they make the oils you spread the new plant that they might like with with the heavy scented herb\nAnd it's a repellent and so the animals stopper got hurt the garden center making a ... and they make it in a in a A R T you ready to use liquid spray the foliage spread the ground with a ... around\nAnd it keeps them out\nIt's highly highly effective and again once once they get used to it and they just they realize yeah go over there every time I go over there it takes like Rosemary\nI don't like Rosemary I'm going to go over the neighbor's yard eat their stuff that you want to train them to go over there that over here ... not so good but the stuff you really don't like your favorite smorgasbord is over there and so you you can you can train her to\nGo elsewhere in the lead take the pressure off of yourself every once in awhile\nI I've got a wild land will come and yet that the whole herd I think it's just the big board will come in and run around check things out oh yeah yeah he eats up a few pansies and big things up and then leaves the damage isn't that bad\nAnd that can recovered pretty well right now this is when they come in the pumpkins or right out front is decorations and they love pumpkins it's their favorite thing and so they'll come in and eat the pumpkins even tell where the handling her to have been up and down your street just by looking where the pumpkins have been destroyed\nAnd so you want to watch watch that one there's quite a few shrubs you can plant could Tony actors or at least is covered some of these um a pirate Tampa\nIs actually very very good this is one your grandparents grew but they grew because there was so tough\nIt grew fast as pretty berries and the fall orange or red it's pretty white flowers in the spring an animal's donated rubber you go

afternoon Arizona Welcome once again to bitch well radio as always I Am [noise] your humble host your humble servant Darren Jay vote ...\nSenior I Am the owner and founder of Devinsky wealth a retirement planning an investment advisory firm located right here in Prescott thank you for tuning in once again I truly do appreciate you\nWell if it's Saturday afternoon you know what that means are you ready if you're ready to raise your hand and say I'm ready because yes we are going to blow up some islands today yes we're going to challenge your thinking on investing and retirement planning and yes\nThe opinions on this program are strong\nSo strong in fact they may be offensive certainly strong enough to challenge the status quo\nSo let's get started here we are the middle of October and yes you all know what that means it is indeed that time of year again no I'm not talking about the autumn brisk\nAnd football season but indeed I'm Talking about Medicare season and I have with us today on the radio program Peter ... dean\nWho is the owner founder person in charge at wins or assurance Peter how is it indeed and I am talking to an Englishman about a uniquely American program of Medicare\nWell thank you down [noise] um [noise] that's not a question that unique to you I'm I was in the military for thirty two years um was working on the Apache helicopter program for the u._k. my home was stolen by an American lady she seduced me into staying here in Arizona when I retired from the military\nAnd I'm a fellow Terry and mentored me into this niche of senior health care which was a very difficult thing meat for me to do as an Englishman because in England are too low forms of life insurance people\nAnd used car salesman [laughter] so I had to overcome that bone in my own mind so I'm now an insurance\nSo I had to overcome that on in my own mind so I'm now an insurance specialist so\nOkay so tell us a little bit how long have you been working in this uh pro in this field for Medicare and health insurance specifically\nI've been working in this field for about Fifteen Years now so I'm no stranger to what's been happening with Medicare\nOkay and you know everyone gets bombarded with ads postcards commercials on TV about Medicare and and you know I I'm license for health insurance and I want no part of it so why on earth would somebody come to you for help with their Medicare or their Medicare supplement\nOkay well let me just explain why business model to solve that um what we Windsor insurance are specialist in three particular areas that's Medicare\nOr Social Security planning and long term care slash extended care planning [noise]\nUm and those are three areas that financial plan is perhaps\nExcelling so the financial tenants have got access to people that need sound advice so what we have is a business model it's a win win win situation\nThe individual wins because they get access to people that have gone to an increase several of expertise in these areas right the financial planning wins because it enhances their relationship with their clients and also keeps an unsolicited third party out of the Financial Times because business and I win because I get to grow my business and meet a lot more people\nFry them and and so you know look I Want you to talk to my clients because I Want them to a\nSame as much as possible on their health insurance now I have clients who are pre Medicare right and that's a big big issue how do we provide insurance during that bridge until they get to age sixty five and then obviously opposed Medicare we want them to have the most bang for their buck right up there and be buying a subtle and we'll make sure they get the best product possible\nThat obviously limits their exposure and also reduces what they're paying\nRight exactly and it's all about education education is the key for more you know the more you can plan on good decisions\nAnd just to putting his perspective um fidelity have just released up as a survey of LA investments you have to um investment for our battles correct yeah up people that are turning sixty five can look to have an our play is two hundred and sixty five thousand dollars per couple between now and they\nGet medical expenses I'm very familiar with that survey and I caught it often and I know that that does not include long term custodial care as well that is simply out of pocket medical expenses exactly ring retire yet\nAnd the good news is it's only it only went up to ... percent last year which is which is really good news [laughter] but um what it boils down to his as we get older they become ... more and more money needs to be spent on health care\nAnd there are two perspectives you know people that are just turning sixty five going on to Medicare and so the people that are already on Medicare and have 'em have experienced\nHow things change not that people are turning sixty five it's it's a uniquely\nDifferent experience because what happens in your inundated with information I can speak for my own personal experience having experience that she had\nA my mailbox is crammed with solicitations for lunches people that want to talk to my phone is ringing off the hook 'em Facebook has blown up and email us exploded with people that want to talk to me about Medicare\nWell it's been interesting to say the least um [noise] so\nThe difficult thing about Medicare is understanding it because it's a government program and and the government it involves within his own assess city complex which is a good thing from my point of view a because it keeps me busy coming up to speed on it and it keeps people um [noise]\nAnd the thirst for knowledge of what's changing\nOkay so it's sixty five everybody should know that they don't already they have to sign up for Medicare because if they don't\nNo no no ... done when you're turning sixty five it depends uniquely on your situation in your situation is different from her everyone else's\nUm [noise] what happens to you might be relevant um uniquely ah and by that I mean it's no point in looking to your brother in law who's an attorney in ... Wisconsin to give you advice\nHere and you have a pi County Arizona which is unique your situation is unique so when you turn sixty five Medicare is available to you now if you're continuing to work which so many people on the on the age sixty five by it because of the current uh the economic climate of the last ten years later it\nWas just security until Seventy perhaps as well a lot of\nReasons for another consideration right but the thing about them going on to Medicare's sixty five as it's available for you okay now you may if you continue to work and you go employer benefits screw benefits either through your employment or spouses\nEmployment you may choose to delay or Medicare which you can do providing Hugo credible coverage with an employee at um the plans provided by\nThe state exchanges and the Affordable CARE Act they go away when you're sixty five\nSo yes there is no other consideration for you at that point other than Medicare and if you're paying for your own health cats as an individual\nAgain that plan doesn't come you beyond age sixty five so to sixty thought\nThose individuals have to go on to Medicare\nFor all they will pay a penalty when they choose to do so\nUnbearable lord oh this is the Vinci wealth radio were visiting today with Medicare health care long term care expert pyramid dean of wins or assurance so\nUnique to everyone's situation okay whether or not they take that decision to sign up for Medicare ideally based on whether or not they have coverage elsewhere whether some of the other decision factors that it is not the only one\nDo let's go back to that decision because what it boils down to is a decision making process and fundamental for that is a cost benefit analysis okay and it's not just about ... dollars it's about your situation you know is your wife on your employer's plan\nHow much is your employer plan costing does your employer require you to take Medicare because I'm as we know where the Affordable CARE Act contributions from the employer and the coverage that those plans provide\nOnes increased and the other one is diminished and gets which way around that is right around so employers may offer incentives for people to come off of that group plan to go on to Medicare\nUm and the other considerations as well as a ... the question of credible coverage on cobra can come around that can be an option but that's very extend their expensive\nRight I'm Peter than your role in this process is to help someone understands a what the rules are with regards to Medicare me\nThe cost benefit analysis right what's going to be the best bang for their mug exactly if they're looking to just pay the least that's an option if they're looking to get better coverage perhaps right that's exactly your wheelhouse\nLeft us apart and he is locked in exam and kill next year's and you'll be okay All right so\nSo I Know Peter for you that this next couple of months this open enrollment period all she's me this annual in Rome appear to make it may make sure my terminology is correct was always a crazy busy time\nBecause you really have too much to do everything for your clients and prospective clients and I know you're not just sitting there signing people up you're doing more comprehensive reviews of their current expenditures compared to what they might pay in other programs right a more comprehensive review correctly okay\nSo now that we have this open enrollment program from January through march does that help you to give you an opportunity to help more people because not everything's jammed into this two month period how much switching goes on I guess is really the question well that's that's yet to be experience but what\nIs going to do is give people the wrong medicine the many times the Medicare Advantage plans chance of a second look so they thought that everything was great in the first instance and then they have a parent for more than they located in Paris on that plan is going to be so much less critical that three month period in which they can reviews things\nRight so unfortunately it's going to take some sort of a medical situation for them to know whether or not that plane as any good ride in January or February perhaps some bills come in and maybe you don't get paid if they thought might be paid right and then they have a chance to march to make some changes that small from an education\nPerspective you know they the fuel roller is over after a pay 'em all the marketing stopped because one of the things about ... is that there is no marketing aloud during only pay cash so they go to a period where they can reflect on what their decision most\nAnd if they realize that the PACs wasn't the best decision they can they can revisited in a can revisit with someone like yourself ... and how would they get a hold of you one more time again you can call me nine to eight nine to five\nFive zero eight three all through my website Windsor assurance dot com\nOkay now Peter I'm we're getting close we're doing okay on time but we're always we're always short on time you're on the radio Devinsky wealth radio by the way I'm Darren ... the owner and founder of ...\nAnd our core competency and da Vinci well his retirement planning an investment management ladies and gentlemen but for our senior clients for our retired clients the health care part of the equation is so important\nI don't want to take that on myself it's too broad of a topic it's to specify right so we work with experts like Peter to help you make informed smart decisions about your health care and your insurance choices So Peter\nWhat question do you get asked the most when you're sitting down with the individual or with a couple and it's either open enrollment time our annual enrollment time what are the biggest\nPlease help the first one is do I have to take Medicare I'm covered that and the second one that's coming up a lot of light is um to do with Medicare coverage that Medicare supplemental times most people come to say what's going on with Medicare plan after supplemental plan as\nIt's going away I Need to sign up for it I Need to change\nAnd and there's a lot of confusion about that so I'd like to clarify that I'm In two thousand Fifteen well the government have always had this aversion to the Medicare plan supplemental plans that give you first dollar coverage they see that as something of an abusive medicated\nSeven two thousand Fifteen they decided that they ... on the first to generate twenty twenty no Medicare supplemental plan will cover\nMedicare part B deductible\nNo huge rounds hundred and eighty three dollars per yeah so it's not a massive amount but plant ass in the medical suffering is the most popular plan gives you first dollar coverage anyone that's new to Medicare after the first of January\nTwenty twenty he's no longer eligible to get a ... or ... see because they cover the poppy deductible and the confusion is around that so many people off yeah wrapped around that I got\nTo we've got great here in the studio we've got some other gets here in the studio today and they're all his confused as I Am and clearly we can tell that Peter notes and stuff because he's these rolling through the numbers on party partly parts of the party part F.\nAnd we're all just going okay so we

what's cheapest but it's ultimately what's best for your specific unique situation cost benefit analysis folks that is so important are Peter what other questions\nUm changes from what's happening with Medicare we've we've covered that one thing I didn't covers ... specifically going on in in you have a pi county okay it to death\nBecause there are some big changes to Medicare Advantage plans we have got to play as a ... type ... United healthcare and came out of\nA third player is coming into you have a pi county and they are spending big bucks here and you have a pi county to put in place a really good support network of players and that's the big issue with Medicare Advantage plans because they're HMO health maintenance organization plans that\nBound to around ... okay and because it's been my county is a story that is a rural rural county as opposed to Maricopa seem very different situation America the here and you have a pie [noise] they're not that many provided so it's companies would come and go on\nAt now coming into this combat okay I'll coming into a you have a pi county with a vengeance on the other thing that's happening is that um [noise] they had never seen a realignment of the special needs planets now that doesn't affect a lot of people that have financial planners if because if you're on a special needs plan\nA jewel special needs plan with Medicare and Medicaid apparatus then the chances all you might not have a financial planner and I I Want to pull the information out there because we this realignment United Health care plan is going away the special needs plan for Jewish people is going away on the first\nThe special needs planned for Jewish people is going away on the first of January okay\nThey've lost that contract so another ... player is coming in to have a pi county with news you special needs plan which who is it and that is you had health student health and they haven't heard with no you haven't heard of before that does sound like a good sign a well\nThere are ways and means of um making sure you've still got a good coverage but the problem is you lose that plan on the first of January you need to have something else in place and there's no automatic slide over from one plan to another you get a notification from the company that you're losing that coverage so you then need to do something about putting in place that coverage\nOkay and so and they're coming in quickly 'cause we're up against that I Want to make sure we get your contact information out and it would end up coming in and do we expect pricing to be competitive or is that just because there's another going to be another network of providers coming in and it's going to make it more widely available for people to have a Medicare provider\nGates competitive about it that name their premium it's better better monitor Medicare Advantage plan for that premium is lower than the other two providers upon their out of pocket costs all law roughly the same [noise] um and
