will be bankrupt within you know thirty six hours but hey at least we'd feel good about ourselves as we you know starve to death and watch the civil war overwhelm our country and turn it into what I call Akaka stand like so many other parts of the world but what about the moral argument\nI think we should see our country as a larger extension of our private homes\nIf ... if somebody bags on your

politically\nThis is gonna happen presumably right before the incredibly important congressional electric right and uh I I I I worry given the motor bias of the media\nThat we will just have video after video and photo after photo of some American either military person or ice person or border guard are pushing some mom with a baby and then uh it's it's it seems to me they win the propaganda war\nNo no I think that I think you know how they win the propaganda war if these people set foot on us soil and then suddenly each one of them has all these legal rights and gets in at at George Soros funded attorney\nWill know that that's not the forgive me John ... the propaganda war that's winning the war I agree but the propaganda war you know I may I say right to say one of those ... let me let me just breaking point it seems to\nMe that they win if they get in and the wind if they don't get it\nI don't because if they oh good I Hope you're right I just know it'll always I pray you're right\nI think if Trump shows weakness if he tapes then Republicans across the country we just are hard saying we realize the game is over even Donald Trump can't stop this openly absurd obviously false attempt to claim asylum and refugee status\nIf even Donald Trump can't say no to something this ludicrous and politically cooked up\nThen we're we're toast and I think that would depress

be fights between Americans and civilians from Latin America\nAnd I think that will help us because I think people see that this is an invasion they can see it the people who are going to cry because

according to a new Wall Street journal NBC News poll\nBeing heavily covered on CNN and everywhere in mainstream media President Trump's approval rating is the highest it's ever been\nOkay don't get too excited is forty seven percent but forty seven percent to forty nine percent disapproval it means that President Trump has actually closed the gap between disapproval an approval it's now

planes about six this morning in Washington DC I flew from Seattle, Washington DC and from there to Pittsburgh and I'm\nIn the airport that Tom Perez on who is the Democratic national chair and uh\nThey showed in the new numbers about Trump soaring approval rating and are asking why and he had no idea\nHe couldn't answer it and the answer is very obvious is that Americans have gotten used to Trump\nThey um and most Americans like the economic situation we're in President Trump gets very very good marks on the economy and for most people the economy is the most important part of the job\nUm meanwhile with an election this close vote fraud is a huge problem we will be talking about that later in the show there is a new book that suggests that it is far more common than people on the left ever wants to lead on and far more threatening\nAnd uh there is also a um an issue lurking in the deep background which is the issue of marijuana we did um a segment on the show\nA couple of

struck by people commenting why is Beto O'Rourke willing to move so far left in a state like Texas and drug supposing that fact with his phenomenal fundraising haul the thirty two or thirty six million dollars in small thirty alienation\nYeah largely so what I think is happening as he watches Cory Booker a fall out of the race rather quickly and and I and my view was Warren\nI'm effectively disqualified herself last week probably in terms of the public relations although I think he's going to run for president he's going to lose the race and the Senate and he won't be running for president and will probably be a pretty strong a candidate given his I don't agree with the views\nBut I think he could be very charismatic and he could extend that magic to the country in the early primaries\nOkay there are two reasons I think you might be wrong I I watched a bay toe performing and it is a performance is sort of a performance art as they say\nWhen he was doing a town hall in or near El Paso which is where he's from and you know very friendly crowd and very friendly moderator Dana Bash from CNN [noise] and uh\nShe she's asking very directly about running for president and he said no if he gets elected senator he'll serve all six years of senator now of course he can throw that away but he said it's so definitively that it leads me to believe that you\nKnow he he didn't rule out running ever but he I think he rules out\nPretty well running in two thousand and twenty said that if he loses the race is going to want to spend some more time with his family of course they all say that um [noise] and some of that I might even be true okay the the other reason that I think he wouldn't be so solid for the race was he was pushed and pushed\nOn the fact that she had said before the race even began that as a member of the house of representatives he thought there was enough evidence of obstruction of justice in collusion that he could vote to impeach Trump now and he was asked about that as a U.S senator and he didn't back away from it\nHe is for impeachment he he believes even before the smaller investigation is wrapped up even before it's reported anything\nAnd yes they've indicted some people and they've uncovered some stuff and I I I think the Mueller investigation needs to finish and maybe it'll take some time to finish that needs to finish but better or doesn't think so\nHe agrees with a lot of people on the far right the Denver just forget about the investigation let's impeach him anyway\nAnd I don't think that's a popular position and I don't think it sets him up well for a future presidential run or anything of the kind hey I appreciate your call um I I'm a I Will get back to this and to David Leonhardt piece\nWhat if the Republicans when everything will we now know President Trump has made a couple of statements and I think one of them at least to sort of\nFlow much some of his age or there's talk about another tax cut that may be announced before November first that soon and very soon a and he says it's people are going to let us going to be a big middle tax a\nTax cuts middle class tax cuts and a and then there's this whole
