consider the importance of a quote that my one of my brothers share with me from our second president John Adams\nHere's the quote is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished\nFor guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished but if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemn perhaps to die than the critics will say whether I Do good or whether I Do evil is immaterial\nFor innocence itself is no protection\nAnd such an ideas that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end up security whatsoever that's partially what's taking place that's uncalled by the way to the Democrats I'd throw out there know what their unleashing do they care they're destroying one of the basic tenants of

character a mark of a judge capital right mark judge but nothing about her friend\nYeah excel sheet at all and I'll hang up yeah yeah well the answer that is that she's not the one who's been accused so theoretically although I don't know with this whole thing maybe you do you want to see about the character the person\nYeah of course she's not the one being nominated I mean that's the key thing to and as I said before\nEven if this was a false charge on the one that Laura ... whatever his name was\nYou know you can't even in ... like ... you know kept him up on a crime because you have to prove malice that they intentionally made up the stories that is so hard to prove that's probably got so we we we really have a dilemma because you can use anybody anything and I'm afraid this weekend I start I'm just I'm not even going to see what I read today\nThings are going to come out right there's always people willing to take advantage of getting the publicity or getting the fame and I

Michel did such a bad job of she I mean you know like I said I think she when she was done they were going to go out for the high Travis in Chicago a lot of calls from Chicago travesty around\nWith mark and mark how're you doing good morning to you to\nJust do what I wanted to bring up that I have been hearing all but one time on a church in Europe heroes show\nWe've all been led to believe that she has no all through your motive for doing this she's just doing it for the church civic duty and everything else but\nHow come the mix and the fact that judge Kavanaugh's mom was a circuit judge was involved in foreclosure proceedings against her parents in the nineties not too long after it's they're ruled against them and they lost their home\nYou're going to be black on every conservative talk show that there is and I don't want that I was a little bit\nYeah but we're back to a story about she's not the one on a trial and she's not the one trying to be a Supreme Court justice\nSo in that sense I and you've got to be careful look\nYou know now I'm going to be trying to see Mitchell side the prosecutor side right they they pick the woman in the first place because they didn't want to eleven men questioning or the fact that we've come to this\nPoint in the stage of America where you're the gender matters of the people questioning you just don't want the truth and you don't want the best people for a job that you got to have someone oh what am I just read California just ... I think brown signed this that on the board of directors\nThey have to have a I don't know one or two women for whatever you want enough force companies to have we women on the board why not just pick the best I've set for years\nIf you could get me and this is obviously relevant nine conservative black women on the Supreme\nCourt I'd be thrilled I don't care what their gender is why we got me into this\nBecause it's not the world was thirty forty years ago companies should want to pick the best people in California no you're mandated to have a certain number of women now so going back to my point to defend them they thought if I had a woman they wouldn't look bad I mean the Republicans were afraid of our own shadow right\nThe courage is not there there's flake cause someone a costume or wherever it was an elevator on the floors of the Senate whatever\nStarts yelling at him he admits that was part of his decision to suggest that we have a another week of the stuff I mean we're we're as the courage Democrats would give them credit for one thing they circle the wagons and they fight for their own and they know the battle or in that's been the problem with the Republicans do you really know\nWhat we're up against for them this is war this is their religion this is their God for many of them a lot of them probably do believe in God that's not my point\nI'm trying to say this is everything to them\nWho gets on the Supreme Court because they've been using it to legislate\nAnd I understand why you're so unhappy\nOr someone says something about the left than I Am maybe they dropped off to waiting over an hour but let's go to Trisha in Denver, Colorado Colorado Tricia you're on with mark\nMark ...\nI think we that\nWe needed provable desirable\nAnd and I first moved to

I I'd like it but you're you're leaving out the part I just went over they don't have the courage they're afraid of their own shadow\nThat's that by the way that was one of the reasons President Trump is so enduring for so many people yeah it gets himself in trouble with his tweets places like the first president to really stick up for what he believes in any you can't push 'em down you know and cut them off\nOr any actually says what he means kept himself in trouble a lot of times but isn't that what makes them so enduring that well we've been crying out for instead of these mushy

I said it ended up if it did that a I'm Sorry I think it was a a a a joke I don't think it backfired I think that\nSome of the candidates they're running for the Democratic party are making such an issue of the entire matter of transsexuals him in surgeries and all the rest there that it's become kind of a of a farce there because it becomes part of their public persona part of their platform yeah I I ...\nI I Would say though that it's it's so ... I'm a person with them I don't\nKnow I ... I understand your point I was younger point and I think a lot of conservatives Republicans do say things that are that if they won't\nLet them be silly and we stick to what's right I didn't let them for example it's here's the part that\nYou often ... and it's your ... how does that mean especially when the ... my wife and I live with my love of the death um that happens is we remember you know the Republican or a senator that don't understand\n... ... or you know there's there's always been that go on in their heads and those who could comments like that bring them right back\nThose comments like that bring them right back that\nI Do agree I thank you for your call it's a gratuitous come in and I just want to move on because there's so much I didn't mention that over eight hundred dead in Indonesia quake and tsunami told me rise so we gotta keep all of this in perspective we care very much about our country\nBut at ... am not undermining that in any sense but I did want to report that also the prosecutor questioned Ford shreds her case for its case I guess not her own you know five page memo\nUh I just wish I had done that sooner wall ... it was going on as opposed to who I read this much weight just take care of by the way it is my question but she she had a terrible format I've\nNever seen a prosecutor being able to ask a witness questions in for five minutes and then have some uh some defender of of the witness a or disrupt the flow that's\nThe fault of our Republican the Judiciary Committee that acquiesce to them\nYeah and that was in the experiment to try to have a female sex prosecutors done this for Thirty years and it turns out our experiment with something so important that well I ... well on the other hand they they they you know the big argument at the time was you know you want a female asking questions well she's extremely well qualified\nUh she ... she had a terrible form at the bottom line is read the reader letter it's it's on the let's\nDo that now I'm just going to do the points that the the one in ... hold on one doctor for does not offer a consistent account of when the alleged assault happened Dr Ford has struggled to identify judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name when speaking with her husband is number three with her husband talked for a change for description of the innocent to become less specific\n... for Dr Ford has no memory of key details of the night in question details that could have helped corroborate her account\nFive Dr Ford's Kennedy ledge assault it's not been corroborated by anyone she's identified as having attended including her lifelong friend\nSix Dr Ford is not offer a consistent account of the alleged assault seven Dr Ford has struggled to recall important recent events relating to her allegations center testimony regarding recent events further raises questions about her memory\nAnd my question courage you should have done this and wrap it up Dr fourth number eight descriptions the psychological impact of the event raised questions nine the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr Ford's attorney is likely effect the doctor for its account and I think these are all great point because why why did she do it at\nThe end of the first of all we all could front is that is that we're ... these are wonderful points but our whole discussion is all of this was on the the the the opponents turf there this is what we're discussing it sort of cattle that we have to do it there but secondly you know the reality is that if this were done properly the Republicans when they were going to have her there they would have been different format and secondly\nShe would have had somebody play the role of this isn't preparations there to go through all the possible response to a good crashed cross examine the editor questions where no matter what the answer may not get a quick you they know what's what's your follow up question goes a long one line or the other there and wait a minute erupt interruption do go into there and\nHe'll look you know I've talked to two to too many are women so we've been ah headsets will solve some of their but\nThe the point that they all hinged on is that this was a\nGirl who was not driving age who said that her her parents drove or places there\nBut she has no recollection of how she got to this party\nAnd she has she went downstairs out the bathroom and somehow got home without telling you seeing anybody telling anybody else at the party like I'm leaving or somebody attacked me or I don't feel well just ran out the door did she hitchhiked whatever why don't the prosecutor after they got it and I have to tell you with somebody who's been involved as a consultant many lawyers and in in cross examination and some several criminal cases\nThat sounded so inherently implausible objectively so regardless of my political view there because first of all you would have expressed gratitude the person who took you always Oh thank you very much or even watch all the details\nA gift that would've been on your mind you remember that hurdle if you don't remember how you got there maybe we're too drunk or there are there but when you left you had to ask somebody for a ride and somebody would have been considerate and said did you get home okay or whatever\nMart mark I get ...

there I draw a look we got five million registered Republicans more than any other state in America and we got a lot of great Republicans elected we just need a few more just a few they've all left to Texas I think And Arnie Steinberg whose book is whiplash from JFK to Donald Trump\nOr political out and say hey you guys when you're I'm sure you were as impressive as I was with Lindsey Graham who finally said well we were thinking right well let's go Gray Davis plain spoken or when he talks he communicates very well and passionately\nNuts consulting saying that and it was it was a great surprise to me there's been a transformation Lindsey Graham of course he ran against Trump any a brags about the fact that he got up to one percent\nSo it was always got he's got a good you know a streak of a self self reflection and humility a but he he was ... he really captured the essence of what most Americans believe and leaving most Americans are with us yeah\nWell I don't agree with him and illegal immigration but I had got what he did the other day was fantastic but what do you think flake and others like Collins and Murkowski and all these flaky Republican\nWell there are perennially that way it'd be one thing if on one particular issue they were squishy or they the they had a certain level of commitment and sincerity is this is an issue important to me but it's an issue after issue consciously playing hard to get and constantly jeopardizing the very thin working Republican majority we have the Senate\nPrint self serving because yeah go ahead well except uh they're going to be voting for Kavanaugh and I finally figured it out ... not withstanding effect that voice quit open independents moderates not to not reliable McConnell's a genius you can't count the votes\nAnd are these women are well I guess two of them are women it's like it's like a a certain certainly not and and what we've learned from the from the three maybe the holdouts\nIs that their understanding one thing if it's a Senate Democrat majority they lose all their committee assignments are they losing Ninety percent of their value in Washington DC all ... they're not they don't realize that when\nThe other party takes you staff there and and it's significant and if you're a loser all of that you don't even get invited to the New York times Christmas Party yeah you guys are too good I'm not taking Jack's calling San Antonio because it says get these two guys are on TALK show\nOh I gave me jacks numbers the producer yeah could be who knows\nHow to Democrats though overplay their hand oh gosh yeah look the party the Democratic party has been completely taken over by the class and the more extreme it you know what when Maxine Waters who's been a back venture entire life is kind of a mainstream Democrat you know they got serious problems\nAnd the irony is that with all of sexual misconduct cases most of them are Democrats you got Keith Ellison who still running for attorney general isn't meant co chaired a Democrat\nThis is why you do when I have some conservatives talk about the me too and it's all a conspiracy and so I uh against or conservative and they said it a few victims there but when you look because the Democrats are largely in power with a public broadcasting in public radio and CBS and ABC when it's on their\n... whether it's Charlie would look at the whole Romney rose and you probably have Ninety five percent of the other people have lost their jobs or been demoted law are ... are being kicked out are liberal Democrats\nAre in control than the sexual harassment by going to be mainly Democrats\nWell not only that we lost free hardworking Democrats for those very charges or one is in jail for another reason as well as in ... for the Democrats keep getting\nIn trouble and you know let me say this is going to surprise a lot of people there\nAre a while I Can't stand Al Franken the personally it is in his politics there\nHe probably shouldn't have left the Senate because he was groping some woman's behind now I'm not saying what he did was right or whatever they are but but if they want to have that standard by because let's decapitated a whole bunch of Democrats there at that threshold there\nSo that gets to my point and everybody's part what happens to the presumption of innocence this road they've gone down well not so I just this whole process you if you had true traditional liberals and civil libertarians over the years there\nIncluding Democrats or where to go forward and said you know there's a reason why we have limitations this evening is even prosecutorial now in in Maryland there and it's from the high school and at a than a Senator Feinstein was it was a person of of the principal she would have dismissed us things that I Can't do you think something happened in high school and and you know what what do we have nowadays is\nEverything is considered the same level as rape\nOr a you know and and but it's you know you you have a a a workplace where somebody calls but somebody in her hair or whatever and this makes it an unwelcome workplace so we in effect had the effect of trivialize the\nThe real serious stuff of rape and all these are putting everything on the same class what about Senator Feinstein that this was the way she wants to go out of the end of her career at AOL or slow remember how she got in in Nineteen Ninety two she was elected alone with Barbara Boxer and so called year the women there were boxer defeated\nBruce surfaced in ... and our dear old friend of mine there\nAnd there Sean mentioned Feinstein was seen as moderate only by comparison your colleague Barbara Boxer all your national lifters or the national seeing these two people

of all this I don't I don't know if I can coach girls basketball anymore and Eric Brady asked this question well should you should you and it kept doubt\nOn whether that was a good idea\nBringing forward this empty charge this and didn't last charge\nAnd elevating it into a case the judge Kavanaugh should not be able to to be allowed on a court with with a girls' basketball team\nIs is exit crumble behavior now USA Today are trying to cover for itself at the column back edited and in sort of made it made it look like an objective examination asking the question should judge Kavanaugh will be able to go back to ... no\nNo no no no no no no no no no no no excuse no excuse\nAnd there is no excuse for cartoonist named Chris ... who works for something called the Illinois times\nYou may have heard about one cartoon and it is I'm going to tell you about another one one shows judge Kavanaugh's daughter that up in the corner and says judge Kavanaugh's daughter has another prayer and a little cartoon Blum says lord please forgive my alcoholic out of control dad for sexually\nAssaulting judge for\nVery good friend of mine Rod Dreher\nWho wrote a column in American conservative saying how can a man do this to another man's daughter\nHow ... what wicked and dark hearts these people must have oh but there's this critics Britain guy he's a piece of work\nHe's a piece of something a found another a cartoon of is I put this all up on Twitter in the last couple of days is the revised Brett Kavanaugh calendar from a Nineteen eighty two would you like to hear a couple of centuries gets a little PG Thirteen\nA one day here we go a one day\nRead Bible then drink twenty five beers done\nDropped my pants or school or so it just shows some chicks my you know what\nElse some stupid girl down in grope recovered her mouth with my hand\nWatch the gang rape very cool\nRight brain life is awesome watch your other gang rape Bible study beer rape drugs\nMade up ... calendar rape drank passed out dream big\nBrett Kavanaugh revised calendar from the mind such as it is of cartoonist Chris bread some I'm just pardon me here for a second but thanks Jeff Flake for subjecting\nJudge Kavanaugh's family to another week of this\nAre worried about Jeff Flake or she makes me crazy and but it's my job to sort of put a pin in the ways in which Jeff Flake has made me crazy and I'm Glad I Am that he'll soon be gone because it gets like complaining about the weather\nBut he he is he is what he is and\nArizona voted for them and you know McCain too so God love everybody but there's\nCame to so I'd love everybody but this this this phony mode and its elevator let's say there's very delicately very strongly at the same time and I think you'll know what I mean\nIf anyone steps up into an elevator anywhere else\nTo to bully a badge or an elected official to weaponize their story of victimization well first of all as soon as they share their story of victimization\nEvery decent human being should listen and empathize and afford person respect or ... at the end and deference to that is due to anybody who's been a victim of a terrible thing okay that goes without saying\nBut the but one of these young ladies said you with your boat you're about to put somebody who was sexually assaulted a woman you're about to put that personal Supreme Court\nHere's here's what Jeff Flake needed to do pardon me for channeling Jeff Flake for just a minute because God Knows somebody has to do in order to achieve some type of clarity is Jeff Flake job and I and and by the way I'm not trying to turn them into Ted Cruz perjuring them and to me\nThis is what a responsible\nJeff Flake ought to have done at that occasion ma'am I I Am so sorry for anything that happened to you and I honor your experience and I'm open your experience\nAnd you have every prayer and every good wish for healing and and um but that's all I have to say about your experience your victimization I of exactly the the proper deference that anybody should have for that\nHowever when you identified judge Kavanaugh as someone who sexually assaulted someone than simply not been born out in the fact\nIt may in some investigation the main bill play up next week but it hasn't been yet my decision my vote\nNeeds to be based on what the evidence shows and what testimony reveals and not based on anything anybody tells me no matter how passionate they may be about something that might have happened unrelated in their lives\nNow please get out of the elevator I gotta go that's how it should go on but it didn't just now we have this week of hell\nBut wait a minute on that wait a minute on that what is this week going to do when you're together today and tomorrow climate enormously grateful to once again the talk show God you're smiling\nA Michael's back Wednesday Thursday Friday of course in and moving on from there\nBy the time we get to Wednesday Thursday Friday and we would friday being just opposed a deadline for this entire FBI dog and pony show\nI I think there's a possibility here\nBecause as bleak as it may look\nAnd as a twist it off as I Am about a very doing during this week you realize we are talking about today's left right we are talking about today's Democratic Party right\nI think the air hangs thick with possibilities that they may overplay their hand so profoundly\nThat they may reveal such a deep bug died hatred in the things they say and I do and I'm not I'm Talking about a cartoonist columnist and the United states senators and everybody in between that the pendulum of empathy may swing toward judge Kavanaugh as millions of Americans just a good grief enough\nEnough this man has suffered enough and there is still no evidence of the type of wrongdoing that originally created this problem for him\nI think by friday that may be the landscape I pray that it is\nOkay for me yeah wearing what's a let's have
