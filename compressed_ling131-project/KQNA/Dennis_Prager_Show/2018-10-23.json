Kennedy formerly known as lion Ted is now beautiful Ted which isn't appropriate because he has worked closely and effectively with President Trump and it's good that President Trump came out to use

very lengthy too lengthy I'm afraid chapter on Theodore Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt is regularly rated as one of the greatest of all American presidents he's on Mount Rushmore\nDo anything but I think this comes down to a pretty well thought out and I think inappropriate\nAnd smart strategy for including the election campaign let me tell you why because right now\nHe sees\nThat the best chance for Republicans holding the house and gaining in the Senate\nBoth of which your goal\nIs to emphasize how far out of touch the Democrats would become that's why I think the Kavanaugh hearings were so important\nWhether Kavanaugh hearing showed was that even for people who might have some doubts about President Trump and some of his character and his personality and this and that\nWhat you saw him from the Democrats which just so infinitely worse and more hostile and more out of touch and showed such contempt for basic American Standards of of decency and due process and everything else\nI think that a a great core of people on the Republican side said not that I Know and we have to come together and fight it\nAnd that's why this rhetoric about jobs not moms and that's also why the rhetoric about nationalism it seems to me\nI don't think there are many conservatives who are troubled by the idea of being a national\nAnd let me explain to there's a new book about nationalism by an Israeli writer named ... and it's it's worth considering because one of the points he makes\nIs that nationalism blows pretty directly\nWith the idea of democracy\nBecause if you're talking about a nation state is you are real try\nThen the ideas and that's been very much the way it is in America\nIs what patriotism means is that I find myself as an American\nAnd going back to the theater Roosevelt again in the new nationalism the whole idea was if you are an immigrant you drop the idea of carrying the flag of your former country you carry the American flag and your nationalism your tribal affiliation which you care about what were you and give your heart to is our nation\nNATO race not an ethnicity and the fact that\nThat there are so many people out there and the commentary and and so many Democrats who don't get that who are offended by the term nationalism\nI honestly don't think that's helping the Democratic side\nI think if anything\nOn the conservative and Republican side by the way if you're one of those people to just offended by the word nationalism\nGive me a call and tell me why one\nEight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six uh Michael

to give their lives or twenty five thousand people who signed the revolution give their lives for the cause of establishing a nation\nNonsense not a school board a nation stay with me if I Want to let
