and a male female issues in the news\nSo I decided to choose a seemingly lighter subject so I say seemingly because I think it goes to some interesting distinctions between men and women or an

simple\nWould you prefer a gift\nAs a gift and then\nMy theory is\nMore men prefer gift cards and more women preferred gifts\nAnd I have a theory as to why I have that theory\nSo [laughter] this is a\nTheory about a theory my theory is women if they receive a gift they see wow look at the thought that was put into\nThis uh getting me this gift that is really moving and beautiful or beautiful and

is basically saying we've got nothing but it would come up with ... Shakur\nThey've come up with nothing new now that doesn't mean the Democrats are going to accept the FBI report of course not an allegation about a Republican is tantamount to the allegation being frugal according to folks on the last which will get you in just a second according to the wall Street Journal though people familiar with the process set on Tuesday\nThat the FBI investigation into the allegations of sexual misconduct against judge Kavanaugh could wrap up very soon well ahead of the end deadline which we help or embrace force that\nWe don't have to spend this weekend covering\nBreaking news again GOP aid on the hill and another person's the newly or in the process and they were expecting the bureau to conclude is report as late as late Tuesday or early Wednesday agents interviewed at least four people and the Tuesday in the background investigation of judge Kavanaugh\nThe White House had given the bureau until friday to wrap up the pro centers will be shown the FBI finding it's not clear what exactly will be made public at any point suffice it to say it's not expected that anything groundbreaking will happen here\nAnd there is a reason that Mitch McConnell is going off on the Democrats overall this Senate majority leader becomes more he says look in all of this was a stall tactical all this was a delay tactic\nDemocrats who had no intention of voting for Brett Kavanaugh and the first place are suddenly asking all outraged at the FBI investigation is wrapping to do\nWhen they knew and wrap that soon because the FBI investigation\nActually had less investigative power in the Senate Judiciary committee\nThey can subpoena documents they can subpoena witnesses it's not a criminal investigations that means they can go and ask people to talk to them and they talk to people they can talk and the Democrats are wanting it away as Mitch McConnell saying listen we're not going to hold this sucker up any longer we're done here\n... minutes\nWhat their goal\nIs not moved around a\nLittle ...\nMostly wrote down the road traveling of bomb on ocean\nYou can tell Mitch McConnell and that is that it's cocaine Mitch amped up right there I mean cocaine and then it really I mean that that seriously what Mitch McConnell looks like when he was angry and em [laughter]\nNot a joke at the end there's a reason Republicans are unified on this one and it's because this feels like a witch hunt that feels as though the Democrats are fully intent on destroying a good man simply for the sake\nOf delaying Supreme Court nomination and they don't ...

V. show probably\nTell them apart that took place at the house and judge Kavanaugh was undergrad fraternity during the Nineteen eighty seven to Nineteen eighty eight school year and which allegedly featured some salacious activity of course judge Kavanaugh had already graduated when this party allegedly took place on the first year law student\nThat period as as you well know most academically intense time and most students what its allegations has all the makings of a tabloid headlines but there's just one problem the accuser freely admit to having no evidence whatsoever that judge Kavanaugh even attended his party is Chuck Grassley slapping the crap out of Chris Coons\nRather than provide even circumstantial evidence of judge Kavanaugh's attendant excuse or provide some investigative evidence he proposes that someone searched judge Kavanaugh calendars the very same calendar is your college have dismissed and divided\nTo determine whether he attended a frat party at some point in Nineteen eighty seven a Nineteen eighty eight and that's it\nAll he alleges that he wants witness installations party at a house owned by judge Kavanaugh as an undergrad fraternity even separately advises us to obtain and search judge Kavanaugh's calendars to determine if he attended we have reached a new level of absurdity with this allegation there's no evidence the judge Kavanaugh the anywhere near the party or anything to do with it at all\nIn fact the only person we can be sure it tended to party was the accuser\nInvestigators have serious work to do all the minority has refused to engage with the allegations against judge Kavanaugh in any meaningful way by investigators have tried to pursue every relevant lead and therefore I Hope that people are hoarding an allegation in the future you'll first consider whether you'd want you on your staff to spend valuable time investigating it\nThanks for your consideration [laughter] honestly I I got to love Chuck Grassley at this point do just does not give\nAny ... that the way he's like you know what we're done we're just done here we are finished it ... it it it's just great because he doesn't seem to Bernie Sanders earlier this week Bernie Sanders sent him a letter saying\nWe want a longer FBI investigation and Grassley sent him a letter back\nSaying Bernie you came out five minutes after the nomination and said that you were going to oppose Gavin you can change your mind you're going to change your mind maybe we'll talk about it is just it's amazing so all of this leads up to the fact that there's just a shifting argument going on in this started off if you recall\nWith an argument that Brett Kavanaugh was unfit for the court because he allegedly tried to rape of grown and Seventeen right that was the original allegation then it turned into gang rape that turned out to be false and it turned into a kill himself at a party no evidence of that and it turned into okay well maybe it couldn't got angry angry we had an angry people on the court because Ruth Bader Ginsburg seems like a delight\nA roommate or Ginsberg who goes out and ran an RPG than it tore his RPG yeah they should go out and she ran politically every five minutes\nShe's perfectly she's perfectly well battle to be on the corporate Brett Kavanaugh got mad when you accuse him of being a gang rape it doesn't belong on the court the shifting ballpark posts are just insane here's Hillary Clinton thing Brett Kavanaugh's behavior is out of bounds or I mean Hillary you want to be president and you drank John McCain under a table and through lamp that your husband or that\nThey are is Hillary Clinton wearing again something that she got from Mugabe's wardrobe and ...\nBut I think for anyone who believes and there's such a thing as a judicial temperament and that we want\nJudges particularly those on our highest court to approach issues approach plaintiffs in defendants with\nUm a sense of fairness that there's a lot to be concerned about because\nGot mad when you accused him of of being ... and I remember someone else getting mad when when her husband was accused of rape I remember that who that have been accused of sexual assault is probably true I remember someone getting mad about that oh yeah and she wanted to be president in the United states\nBy the way I should correct magill in reference has moved ... not ... it was a dictator and Bob way we'll go to his got through the character from the lander okay how how often the shift that the the ... ... ...\nHow how often the ... the head of the album camera on CNN there was a story about how bright cabinet back when he was in college got in a bar fight with a guide through them I had a guy\nNow let me explain how this works I went to Harvard law school a lot of great minds they're whining felt will be senators the people who are in my class and there was a guy who would go out they invited me but I ... as you all here this is not my type of party they'll go out to bars they'll get drunk off their body and then they would just suck each other and then I\nI not not a joke like they would actually just punch each other and the growing like there's an actual thing that I Would hear about later\nImagine not my kind of party\nThe accusation here by ... throwers are more likely to assault so if you were in a bar fight with all due to a bar\nThen it must be they use sexually assaulted a woman years prior\nMakes perfect sense\nMakes perfect sense and with the all the way Alice and Alice in camera out and making a fool of herself\nI think if you are known as a belligerent means fighting drunk that's relevant I think that it's relevant to ban a woman who said that you would corner her and putting your hand over her mouth somehow that I think makes more sense than if you were just a fun draw who always felt right to flee\nOkay or alternatively the two things don't necessarily have to do with one another because guys getting bar fights with other dude and then they may not touch when\nThat happened actually a fair but that's where it's like these people have never met a man if they have an incredible incredible thing\nComing up more goalpost shifting from the Democrat Senator Bernie Sanders has a new way of shifting the Gulf Coast is really irritating because let's face it the original allegations

can gauge than than evil I mean it really has been an evil profits in which needs engage getting an allegation on July thirtieth holding it for six weeks until just before the vote releasing it

Kavanaugh\nBut what I can say is the most notable part of this report is what's not in it\nAs we noted by the White House the FBI did not interview Brett Kavanaugh we have seen even more pressure for two witnesses who wanted to speak with the FBI but we're not interviewed\nOkay so I Love that she says what's most important here is what's not in it\nThat's true but not how she made it so she was the most important in all the people we have to I didn't interview\nWell that's because the people that you're talking about could provide no corroborating evidence was not in the report\nIs that there is no corroborating evidence for an end up Christine Blasey Ford delegation no corroborating evidence knowing\nThat you just had a judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley is that there is no hint of

the cabinet has an interest in her story not being true but she also has an interest that doesn't get that women don't have an interest in coming forward in high profile cases because all they're going to get the downside is just it's not accurate is just not accurate now again that doesn't mean she's manufacturing her case doesn't mean she's why but we ought to at least be honest about what

same social circle that six degrees of Kevin Bacon\nBut that that's that's like saying that you know I travel in the same social circle of send you an Airforce and his friends are in my social circle that's not the same thing at all\nAlso they say that he lied when he attempted to fabricate an alibi back in ... when he did not drink on weekends that's not true he said he rarely drink on weekdays and it don't calendar and in fact you were hurt openly and all that money it was telling her that on this day I probably right\nHow do I know I probably agree that that's out on my calendar\nHave enough that he had no connection to Yale University prior to attending undergrad and law school there but he was the lead to the ... and many\nAnd it's not really not all I can see in many his grandfather went to Yale in Nineteen away\nNot here law school in jail\nAnd so that's that's not that's not actually I think we're up any why supposedly he lied about blacking out from drinking but he didn't live out that there's no evidence that he actually did blackout from breaking\nNow the Democrats kept using blackouts and very thing because what they're ... they were attempting to establish is that he actually tried to rape\nWhat they're ... they're attempting to establish is that he actually tried to rape Christine Blasey Ford and just didn't remember the incident and that's what they are attempting to to say but there's no actual evidence of that so there is no why they're either\nNow what you could say that he was playing his his drinking in the most favorable possible light I think that's fair but that's not the same thing as as perjuring yourself at lying openly\nWill go through a couple of more of these opposing wiser by cab not told ... has a good rebels that job or political as well but first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet and like you said why would you buy generic mattress built for somebody else\nHe'll sleep has built asleep when it takes two minutes to complete they use the answers to match your body type and sleep references to the perfect matter whether you're inside sleeper hot sleep or whether you like a pleasure from but he likes there no more guessing no more confusion just go to sleep dot com slash Shapiro take their tune it sleep when they will match you to a mattress\nThey'll give you the best ways of

nice risk free right now here is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all match resource get up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off and he would sleep dot com Fletcher bureau wasn't\nWe tried that we got we didn't fully quit we received the matter is it's really terrific it came in the Malian wrapped it without it right on the bed because that inflates right in front of you\nIt's so good I got my sister a healer sleep mattress for her wedding he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro right now for a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or again he like sleep dot com slash Shapiro the matter is is a luxury masters at nominal tree prices\nHelix sleep dot com slash if you're over a hundred and twenty five bucks off so back to the supposed ally the Brett Kavanaugh told to the final ditch attempt and they said\nWe can't nominated because sexual assault their ... and then they said we can't nominated because\nOther women had been raped by other people were not by Kevin ... and then they said well we can't nominate him because he got angry and finally they came up with while he committed perjury he committed perjury\nNo evidence he committed perjury so some of the other accusations they say that have not fight in Maryland and drinking age and explaining his behavior even though he was too young to legally drink in any case the only thing is that he said in his testimony he was being able to legally drink it in the drinking age Marilyn was Eighteen to that and it's testimony\nAnd then they get to the booth thing right do they suggest that it tell you why you committed perjury when the charged with perjury for saying that in ... when he was Seventeen he used the word booth to mean parts and what it actually mean is anal sex I'm not kidding this is what they actually are saying\nThat what that everyone knows a thing as anal type of guy I didn't know the whole thing was was that that's we're\nAlso it turned out that there are a lot of different ways that people use the word ... also something I didn't know but there's been some casual research on the building and it turns out that there was no way to substantiate that as ally\nAlso the term devil's triangle\nIngestion is that Brett Kavanaugh was using a pornographic reference about Jews and one girl in a free some again he said that that was the drinking and it seems a pretty weird wage would scarier passed and drunkenness to term devil's triangle of drinking game but again there are a bunch of people on Twitter who said that they have heard of that as well\nAnd so they there's a bunch of people who said no he actually meant that now let's remember\nWhy is any of this material it's only material because of the congestion by Democrats is that he put a bunch of sexual references on his Facebook page that means you sexually assaulted a girl when he was Seventeen that in itself is an insane line and then Cory it's an insane lines have you ever read a Facebook page\nI mean people have been in high school\nI went to an all boys Jewish high school\nIn my yearbook page with clean\nSay the same for all my friends\nAre there are references that people didn't necessarily understand in your book pages and orthodox Jewish day school\nAnd I have a feeling that most high schools around the country are replete with such references\nDressing than you you guys went to high school were there any obscure we're sexual references and your your book by dude\nYeah that's right too many to count is precisely the right answer because\nOf course have you ever met a teenage boy\nI Love all the senators were drunk and allow going really oh well when you were Seventeen you wrote in your your book about drinking and making sexual references\nOkay if you're a Seventeen year old boy I've ever met a Seventeen year old boy there's not a Seventeen year old boy on earth doesn't make sexual references none zero zip silk but\nBrett Kavanaugh downplayed that and it's testimony this means he was a purge or we cannot sit on the Supreme Court now that he's sixty years old\nHere is that science and finally they narrow it down finally they narrow it down so what is it that they also think that that he lied when he said that he had a weak stomach so he's a throw up a lot well maybe he had a weak stomach and he threw up because of alcohol in order spicy food\nI also have a weak stomach I throw up a lot to\nThat could happen from drinking I've never thrown out because of drinking actually because I don't actually drink um but but the ... thank you I don't know I Know now I'm I'm not I'm not desperate enough during met a shot at such that the that'd be just terrible but\nIt's it's so finally they come down to one they've narrowed in on one thing one thing that the ... thing that I was trying to all the stuff but it's just a bunch of nonsense then they narrow down to one thing and one thing only there is there only a credible claim in my opinion there only credible claim that Brett Kavanaugh lied in his testimony their own a credible claim is that there was a reference on fourteen of the boys your book pages\nAbout a woman named ... dolphin who's an attendee of local all girls high school\nA few things you might need to know that we're in a dolphin before we actually get to the supposed ally ... dolphin was good enough friend that Brett Kavanaugh that originally she signed a letter in support of the idea that he was very good to girls when he was in high school\nBy she was friends with him for many many years\nAnd she signed that letter there is no accusation that she had sex with him in high school there is an occupation that he sexually assaulted her high school there was no option is Asian that he touched her in high school not\nSo what exactly is the claim the claim is on fourteen boy your book pages there was a reference to her innate alumnus\nAnd other reference to suggest that ... that she was that this was a joke about among them ... among a bunch of guys and jet saying that they were alumni of her genitals essentially the day that there's a bunch of guys had had sex with her and when Kavanaugh was asked about that he said that this was an attempt a clumsy attempted affection\nAmong his friends right that's that's what he said in his in his actual testimony and I want to see if I can grab the actual act of testimony so that I can find exactly what it is that that he was that he was claiming but the the basic suggestion\nOf of Brett Kavanaugh is that this was not in fact a a reference to sex with Renee alumnus the raid on his ... his act with Renee\nDolphin New York times had a piece where they said that it was horrible and hurtful\nAnd here's what the New York times that\nThey said that to a judge Kavanaugh's classmates had mentioned Renee we're part of the football players unsubstantiated boasting about their conquest and having not suggested that it was a clumsy attempt\nRight that it was it was a clumsy attempt at affection\nMaybe that's true and maybe that's not\nBut there is no way to substantiate perjury first of all it's not material I raise materiality provision in the FBI and the D. O. J. manual and second of all\nIt's fair to say that a clumsy or a close ally here's how he phrased that quote one thing in particular are sad about one of our good one of our good female friend who would admire and went to dances with had her name used on or your ... page with the term alumnus that term with ... use to show affection to show she was one of us\nThere is no way to substantiate anything differently except theoretically they could have gone and asked one of the other Thirteen guys who used\nLike except theoretically they could have gone in ... one of the other guy's name on a visit that without us\nBecause you know what they couldn't find anyone to testify what it meant as we all had sex with Renee\nRenee dolphin so based on\nBeing made about a yearbook brains chores wall when he was Seventeen that means you can't sit on the Supreme Court\nYeah go at that and as strong strong response Democrat that that's that's definitely what I think that that you're going to catch them and sell it it's pretty obvious to the point that the Democrats will do anything\nTo stop by Kevin ... and it's pretty gross coming up the Democrats tried to make a last ditch effort to stop Brett Kavanaugh for last minute we're\nShocked shocked surprised justify paying the same time they are innocent what settle halfway to one of the reasons why Republicans and look in there and that's pretty amazing adventure", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "07"}
