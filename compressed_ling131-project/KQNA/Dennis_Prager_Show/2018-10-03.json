about president from dodging taxes and he isn't really a self made billionaire and there is it feels like about a two thousand page report seems to be very well research in the New York times\nSo what is the relevance of this right now\nIt's ah obviously an attempt to shield the election in the direction of Democrats will be speaking with Stephen Moore\nA advisor to President Trump and the Trump campaign about that and about the progress on trade where there's been great progress in the markets love it we've had this week the markets have just been on fire sky rocketing\nUm why is that happening we'll talk with us even more about that will also be speaking with Juan Williams on Fox News\nHis new book about President Trump and the black community it's not a positive book toward

promise to replace NAFTA was something much much better\nAnd or against a lot of people's expectations are it appears that this has been a successful solution now including Canada nachos Mexico it's a major major event and it should be good economic news for everybody\nOn Stephen I'm more as a good friend of the show and a a good friend even off the show he um he's also a a leading a economic expert and writer and researcher for the Heritage Foundation\nAnd he has been for oh a couple of years now an informal economic advisor to President Trump as Steve you are at the rose garden ceremony

about this so I don't know maybe even more than throwing ice at a a bar fight in New haven in Nineteen eighty five\nYeah this is a big deal at the big victory for Donald Trump and incidentally and you're right I did work for a dollar drop with my my buddy Larry Kudlow is not over a running the show I the economics over the White House\nBut I used to always tell them you know Donald I Do not have ... I used to call Donald during the campaign now of course I called Mr President I I'd say you know I don't agree with you on that but I think not there was a pretty good thing\nA show you you said that this was ... you know your your introduction was it looks like we haven't improve NAFTA and I think that's a good way of putting it you know a NAFTA needed to be updated it modernized I think the president was right about that I disagree with them that this was the worst trade deal ever in fact I think it was good for all three countries\nBut it had become out of date there were some abusive practices that were happening by the Mexicans when the candidate you have\nYour your dry Donald Trump many times talk about the butter to three hundred percent there is an American a dairy products or he had a very funny line in his speech by the way at the rose garden you said at now those are those Canadians are going to buy or ice cream [laughter] you know which I think that's a good thing\nBut I I was that was a good thing for the whole continent it's a better deal for American companies\nAnd ultimately what this does I think the bigger story yet is that you know this president who's six months ago or a year ago people worried was going to create some kind of global trade war\nYou know is an interesting Michael but now it first she got that they'll build on with Mexico and now he's got the deal about what that looks like it's going to get ill dumb with Europe you have\nA ... a lot of South Korea\nReacting to South Korea and Japan and it's like these dominoes falling and the irony here\nIs this quote protection as president and I was worried about this with Donald Trump that he would pursue protectionist policies or you know at the end of the day we may end up with freer trade than uh than more trade productions policies ... with the exception of the steel terrorists which I still think was it must be\nOkay I have been a lot of people are saying that part of what President Trump is doing is trying to settle these less important trade dispute or the ones that are all to the low hanging fruit that he that he can settle a so that he has more leverage to get tough with China do you buy into that thinking\nTotally yeah I think that's exactly what he's doing and you know it was very interesting his beat people get a chance if you didn't see it live it was beautiful day by the way and and the and the rose garden that was a Seventy five degrees and beautiful day Trump got up there he spoke for about an hour and a happy talked about when I talked about the trade deal he has some ah\nYou know back and forth with the process which was retrospect I'm just as much as I say Michael that you know I've been to many press conferences over Thirty years um I I've never seen the kind of abusive treatments that the the meat you know these young punk kids they're twenty five or Thirty years old\nAnd the way they're so disrespectful of president I don't have a problem and Michael ... you know if someone from media asking the president of the question and that's why we have the media to ask that the president question but it's not the tough questions their manners and make just dripped with contempt and he started out that press conference by saying\nWith contempt and he started out that press conference by saying okay a first question was what Kevin I said look\nI'll take care of our questions but we're here right now to talk of the\nYou know the trade deal so are there any questions about the trade deal and he sort of an after work I'm Talking about the trade deal then I'll take questions with Kevin ... first resurrect what Kevin I asked her what about camera or you I was just outrageous and and uh\nAnd it just bothers me let's treat the price of the United states with respect and some dignity I mean he deserves it and I look I didn't always agree with what Brock Obama in fact I disagree with most of the things he did but every time I saw him I was always sure Mr ...\nAnd it just isn't happening there\nAnd I and I think most Americans do and I'll ... I'll tell you another thing I I Do not think it's going to work for the Democrats this huge article and honest and it's like reading more and peace it goes on and on all the New York times can you there are times that there are ten thousand words I mean it's a lot of war is\nBasically the theme is President Trump didn't make the money on his own he got all the money from daddy and secondly ah both Trump's in both father and son cheated on their taxes why first of all why do you think they decided to spring this right now\nI don't know why they did it right now I was on CNN last night commenting on the show I I didn't I didn't make it through the ... ... how many more it was Thirteen thousand yeah it was I read a lot of it I didn't make it through the whole thing I had a couple impressions I made this point on CNN last night and I'm ... and by the way they really beat me up on it\nThe first point I made was wait a minute this was like you know turning on the TV and saying you know with a hundred times you know friends episode rerun you know that you've already seen twenty times how many times with the New York times run the story I I ... I worked on the campaign they must run three or four stories about Trump cheating on his taxes\nAnd you know then they ran one last year another running this one and there's not much different in this story than the one that won multiple times so it's just like you know just by an old copy the newspaper because at the end of this movie before\nThe second point I made us look there are alleging tax fraud tax there is a difference\nMichael between tax avoidance which any good businessman them any good you know head of household will do you want to minimize the taxes you pay right I mean I don't know about you Michael I tried to pay the least amount of actually after you got the most I'm Out there was a shock\nTax avoidance and tax evasion and they are they are accusing Trump of hacks fraud went a lot of these look I'm not an expert on tax policy but it looks like a lot of these things will just legal ways of of minimizing your tax burden and is there any American in the last fifty years who can predict by the Iraq War than Donald Trump\nOkay but here's the question why won't he released his tax information he he's been very resistant to them I guess about this article is it's an attempt to try to force him\nTo make some disclosures about or his taxes and if if he doesn't that'll be a reason there are campaigning for Democrats but Democrats will force out the tax returns what do you think\nYeah once again you're all one hundred percent correct\nThat's exactly what this is about and that's what you know the CNN uh Chris Cuomo asked me about last night as well why won't Traub a release of tax reforms\nI advise Trump among many other people during the campaign do not do not release your ... because if you think this report which were Thirteen or they they did thirty thousand words they don't even have\nYou know a lot of the tax documents there's a man who has you know where are our she was full of ... tax document through all the businesses he's running through the ... and all this I mean I I just think it would be up Pandora's\nBox okay uh and and don't file your taxes in a Pandora's box Stephen Moore who is a distinguished visiting fellow in the project for economic growth at the Heritage Foundation [noise]\nWhich are very real questions and this is the point that everyone should read the Rachel ...
