this is the third are on friday of the last hour by hour broadcast we each week and we have anything that you'd like to raise an issue about\nSo Andy in Portland asked a very legitimate question on a background back on with un be why don't the folks who are\nAll\nRiled up about\nPolitically correct talk to you know you can't say you can't wear a ... year anti Hispanic if you wear a some ... to a Halloween party but then they're totally three to invoke God and Jesus Christ in their language exactly fair summation of your comment\nAnd then the question was more it ended on every\nHouse right correct they're not offended by that are critical for a while or smoke there they're not they're not so there were there were so many issues that you raise here one so I'll take that one first\nThey're not only not offended on Christians perhaps it is not possible in their view to offend Christians there is as you probably know a famous or infamous art work quote unquote would they crucifix in a jar of the year in of the so called artist\nNow uh as I tweeted out last week if you put a uh if if you put a ... in Europe and uh you would be an Islamic fold if you put a tour in Europe you would be an anti Semite if you put a crucifixion urine you're an artist\nAnd and I tweeted that very exact that word for word what I just said for that crowd you it is not only not possible to offend Christians to the rest of your ability you showed\nSo or is it ... this is ultimately a war against the Judeo Christian civilization that the west is built I Am convinced that that is the ultimate ... of the left\nThey hate the idea of a Bible based value society they're frightened by it and they hate it now the second issue is the use of the terms God and Jesus Christ it depends on the context so I Would say for example\nIf somebody says God the juicy that home run I Do not believe they're violating the commandment against using God's name and paying\nA lot of people do and I don't and I explained what I think the commandment really means because I Know the Hebrew very well and the Hebrew vet commandment these do not carry God's name in vain\nCommandment these do not carry God's name and vain not to do not take God's name in vain and the people that I Believe carry God's name and vein of the people who in the name of God do evil because that is the only one of the ten commandments that God says he will not forgive\nIt so it cannot be that it is about oh God that I have a hard day at work today or Jesus Christ I just really hurt my finger I I I it's hard to believe that God will forgive\nMurder but he won't forgive that so it has to be really bad since that's what set it said God will mapped\nForgive\nThose who violate the commandment anybody's doing evil in God's name\nThat is that's the worst evil atheist evil is evil religious evil is the most evil the Islamic to arguing evil in in their God's name\nAre doing more harm to God and religion than any atheist group that has ever existed [noise]\nOkay I was a very important thing and you should all watch my my uh eleven videos at ... university on the ten commandments and read my little book on it

that has gotten all the attention I don't need to play for you because it's in in a CNN and CBS and NBC or all over it\nAnd let me just acknowledge I think it was unfortunate I don't think it was a good thing that the president said that it was a praise worthy or a vet that basically congressman Gianforte Greg Gianforte Montana he was in ... in Missoula\nAnd congressman Gianforte and at the time I thought that John forte handle it very well he lost his temper he body slammed the reporter he knocked off his glasses\nThere were charges brought against him he pleaded guilty he apologized lavishly he made a legal settlement with the reporter heat assaulted\nAnd I've spoken to congressman Gianforte this was one of the most embarrassing moments with his wife and I don't think it's a a good idea for President Trump to make light of it I don't mean Congressman John forte would think that however\nWhat struck me about this is this is that that was a tiny segment of a very long and very substantive speech actually will Trump was doing and I think in a fairly effective way\nWas laying out the way he's going to be campaigning and very close Senate races in very close governor's

market's up a little bit today but generally the economy is coming along and there has been a great deal of good news\nUh there's more good news when you pick up the brand new book it it literally is just going to be arriving in stores if you've ever used doors are right now it's a book called Trump ... inside the America First plan to revive our economy\nOf the book is by my friend's Stephen Moore and by professor Arthur Laffer a Steve congratulations on the book and it's very well time\nUh Iraq over like thanks so much for the nice guy working idle up on writing it you know with my buddy art Laffer it was really just kind of first hand account of when we started working with Donald Trump back in the early to thousands sixteen\nI ended up and and I do think a lot of people including me a reading some of your personal descriptions are coming into Trump's office in the way he interact with people\nIt's reassuring it's it's sort of different portrayal than what you get in mainstream media yesterday everybody in the in the press and of course have been one of President Trump's economic advisors and to the campaign\nBut are people are fixated on this alleged shouting match between John Bolton and and um and John Kelly the White House chief of staff and uh do all these stories a White House chaos that's not what you see at least that's what you indicated in the book\nBut Trump is a person who likes to actually have different views at the table you know so we used to have arguments all the time I mean I like them I mean I liked Donald Trump a lot personally is a is a fun person to be around he's actually come very gracious these very charming and\nOffensive or he would like to put two or three people on the table ... disagreeing positions you know we do get out and I need\nEach other to make up his mind which I think is a good thing that's what a businessman does ah so you know so what if they're shouting at each other you know he wants to have a ... he doesn't want to be surrounded by bus yes my and I think that's a that's a good thing or about Donald Trump but you know I'll correct you on just one thing is that Michael when you said that I kind of becoming a long look\nI I think your understanding rats I this is a full fledged boom or on right now you know as you know I was out in Seattle what about a month ago when I was in your studio and I was you know at bottom everywhere from Portland, Oregon Portland Maine in ... in between\nAnd everywhere I go I'll I see is you know I saw this in Seattle I saw ...
