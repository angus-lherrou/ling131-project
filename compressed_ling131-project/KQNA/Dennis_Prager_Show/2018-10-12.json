so\nLook arrived the next day so\nThat oh that is fortuitous that is not mere coincidence\nRich I Know my question as a as a Christian I'm about George brother\nYou are writing books which I'm really looking forward to on the Torah and if the Torah equal to all the other book from the Bible is got inspired or the porous Perrier superior to books it's superior\n... and I think they're all the word of God that's\nCorrect I think there are there are a number of differences in the way Christians and Jews approach the Old Testament and there were two really there were two that are are\nAre probably the most glaring\nOne you just mentioned for the Jew and this has always been true the tour of the first five books for five bucks or ... some Christians will also cola\nOr or or an exalted status in fact they're the only ones that are considered in traditional Judaism as defined books\nThe other books or where it says God said the traditional drew believe Scott said so God set to ... than the traditional drew believes God said this was there but if you have a song for example\nUh this will this will be the authors ... you know in that case king David\nUh usually and that is or you know proverbs by king Solomon traditionally\nUh but ... that's not the word of God there that could be inspired but it's not the same as the first five books\nI think by the way I think that Jesus would have looked at it that way to adjust to a ... speaking to you as a Christian I Jesus being a very traditional Jew would have said the same thing I Am he would have regarded the Torah as uniquely a significant\nI certainly will ponder that I I don't know that I I agree with that but I Will\nCertainly don't know exactly anyway the issue is not even agreement the issue is us how does the juicy it you know ... on on matters of face\nOr you know I always say if I don't I don't expect agreement and then it's not even a significant to me so so so there's different so why but the it's the values that's why we speak of Judeo Christian values not Judeo Christian theology\nI agree but I guess it is the book of Isaiah for example divinely inspired\nNo where God Speaks to why you say it is just as much God as God's speaking in the Torah but but where you have other statements that it doesn't say I'm God said so then it's as I said like proverbs or ecclesiastical is that is not from God\nOkay that's a that's a hell for clarification of differences then I I understand that\nGood God Bless you and I mean it thank you so much focus Milky and Kevin in North Hollywood, California Hi\nYes yes Hi

brought you a more alliance defending freedom [noise]\nAnd\nWe're talking right now about the idea that resentment of political correctness can unite Americans I mean across racial economic educational regional boundaries and political correctness is at the heart of the problem of the current hostility to people of faith\nAnd you don't believe that there is that kind of hostility right now there is a campaign underway and it's being advanced\nBy members of the judiciary all of them by the way appointed by Democrats who are trying to get rid of\nAny kind of religious symbolism\nOr war memorials\nAnd this is crazy stuff\nAnd the alliance defending freedom is in this fight to protect religious liberty to to stop people from trying to change America to race any signs or expressions of religious faith uh here's a um a a brief statement\nOf why the alliance defending freedom exists\nAlliance defending freedom as an organization that advocates for the right people to freely live out their faith\nThat reminds us that as Christians called all about our faith in the marketplace at our jobs that are schools we also want people to remember that when they do that and they're persecuted for their faith that we will defend them and their right to live out their fate\nOkay this is what alliance defending freedom does all the time but they can only do it with your

by eight six six nine five four three three eight eight okay I'm\nOne of the questions about this story in San Francisco which of course is creating all kinds of controversy or I understand that there are lots of people who resent and don't like the pledge of allegiance\nBut the idea of swapping the pledge of allegiance for another early meaning orders and phony Maya Angelou quote that she never said quote says when you learn teach when you get give I look I think that if Steve on cook who sounds like he's a very well intentioned decent guy et cetera et cetera et cetera if he wants to\nAdd to the\nUh school board meetings\nBy giving quotes from Toni Morrison and James Baldwin and I'm Harvey Milk and instead of Abraham Lincoln as well that was fine but why can't you get those quotes right after you say the pledge of allegiance\nWhy try to erase the pledges if this was some kind of substitute because a pledge itself takes about thirty seconds no it really does that's all\nDon't we all benefit\nFrom gestures that can unite us right now at a time when so many Americans are feeling so polarized and on the edge and threatened\nAnd bullied\nIs even ...\nWho's an interview she may be the most bullied person in the world and no she's not told me about her husband\nWell maybe now um meanwhile\nAnd this is one of those cases that is just uh\nThis is one of those cases that is just appalling there there was a terrible terrible miscarriage of justice and it shows you why\nThis issue of judges and appointing judges is really just about the most important issue on the\nDocket after three years of litigation a three judge panel on the fourth U.S Circuit court of appeals\nDetermined that am memorial that's almost a hundred years old\nIn ... Maryland\nIs unconstitutional\nWhy is this one hundred year old memorial is to people who died in World War one no one is alive who fought in World War one\nSomehow this lawsuit is stayed alive they've been protesting this memorial for years\nAnd now in a divided court\nChief judge Roger Gregory\nUh well he actually dissented from the majority opinion that nearly a century ago Maryland citizens out of deep respect and gratitude took on the daunting task directing a monument to mirror the measure of individual devotion and sacrifice these heroes had so noble e achieved\nThe panel majorities has their effort violates the constitution\nThe soldiers fought to defend\nI respectfully think otherwise it is outrageous\nAnd one of the points that has raised an important column by a Jeremy ... is one of the lawyers involved in this case\nIs not too far away from this monument and Maryland is Arlington National cemetery\nAnd if this decision stands up it won't it's going to go to the U.S Supreme Court and there will be probably a seven to two decision against the stupidity the story here as private citizens decided to honor people from that community who died in World War one by creating a monument in their honor\nAnd putting it up with public subscriptions it was not using taxpayer money it was all paid for by donations they put up this monument to honor the war dead\nAnd now if this court's decision stands the monument would have to be removed destroyed\nOr defaced to a race to cross\nThis is outrageous\nAnd it's why the judicial issues are so important let's go to Rick in Los Angeles Rick you're on the Michael ...\nThanks so much like we're taking my call I have a couple of points on this issue that you brought up first of all the gentleman in San Francisco who
