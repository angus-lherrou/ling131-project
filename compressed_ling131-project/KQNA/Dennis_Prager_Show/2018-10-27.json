morning tradition for Thirty years joined with Don breeze talking paint products for making your job easier let's talk about actually getting to the pain now\nI don't know why did he make pockets that are so hard to poor paint out of you get your one gallon can any poured into your tray or whatever you know container year using if it's a smaller bucket for touch up on the corner there is no way\nThat I have found to tilt it back and you don't have a little bit of pain left in Iran that you've got to wipe out before you seal it tight\nOn down the side of the can send the in the trade in the seat trade for the win\nSomething at hand on the job cough because there's always a little ring a painter on the edge reading\nWell those those those tops that they've made a now for the gallon cans with the poor spouts and that got the lid on them that uh you know you can uh clothes and and you can actually just leave it that way overnight and come back to the next day um the whole thing is just basically keeping the air from the from the liquid tank so\nThey're great ah that's that's been one of the things that they've come out with ... you know in the last ten years there's been a tremendous help in a practical way for the pan or pressure the\nPortland's are great and the first time I use on a couple of years ago I was I was another thing I thought why didn't I think that this was not to hang up and another one or the paint can buckets like the handy can't that someone finally thought you know I'm going to put a magnet and this can\nSo that the painter can put his brush\nTeeth out of the pain but in the bucket so we can set it down and get a drink water take a phone call whatever the case that was a brilliant\nAbsolutely brilliant in a tremendous help it's one of the again it's one of those practical things the the industry it more and more is trying to\nUh come up with a you know some good practical innovations for for the user so they're doing some things with her ... or do not mix with a with the tools themselves are doing some practical things as you mentioned with the way that you\nA whole brushes and rollers and the containers that you're using um I like the little uh\nA court size a pain containers that they have now that they sell the plastic liners for because you know it's an easy clean up you throw it away and\nAnd you don't have any time or or any labor and cleaning that are evil liners guy for trade them bucket uh I well a ... on the pro side we were always working out of five gallon buckets\nOn the pro side we were always working at a five gallon buckets but uh we do have you know smaller jobs or or or uh things that don't require a lot of volume and paint we do use some trays and uh we didn't use some smaller containers\n'em to ah just kind of fit whatever the job is you're doing this all Weiner's for those pay trays again ... fantastic innovation because you just throw 'em away they're they're very cheap you buy 'em by the dozen down at a hardware store\nAnd those liners do create an additional waste but if you look at it you're all the water you're saving and you're not washing paint into the landscape her down the drain the pain tries to the plastic where it's going to the landfill anyway so it's a better way to dispose of\nAbsolutely absolutely so yeah you do have a ... you do have a little plastic waste in that respect\nUm I wouldn't be surprised with ... with some of the um some of the innovations in technologies that they're coming up with that sometime in the next six to ten years that does liners are actually made out of recycle biodegradable\nA products because that Bo industry and not really just a manufacturing on a whole is moving in that direction\nCorner rollers is there any that really work that no the ultimate tedious task of trying to get in the corner our tools me and it's it's only works if you're trying to do the same color on both walls\nAnd and they are they just they sell some uh some sponge tools um that are are for Ninety degree corners\nThey actually have some sponges that um that uh have radius is on them and some things like that for different ah application each did you were good for for especially for the lay person\nHomeowner just wanted to paint you know a few rooms at a time in their house and that kind of thing I'm doing the same thing with a brush takes a skill set that um you know a usually only comes from being in the in the business so I think they are very handy unhelpful\nA for homeowners they're they're pretty quick and easy to use the more that there'd been doing with some of the stuff you're going to see some of that continue a mall in some very good ways and practical ways\nTo create any kind of different look 'cause we've got your sponge in the corner all then you've got your role as does the rest of the wall I Know very few people are going to be sitting there looking at the corner of all the seats they could use different type of\nApplication that yeah yeah but you can't see your brush stroke in your role stroke ... trying to get to middle and end of\nThe students or you don't see a ghost staying as what we called him where you've done something with something like a sponge or brushing versus the roller so as a rule which news is is you want to do that that's called your trim worker you're cut in work first and then you want to roll into those areas and get as close as you can\nAnd and that's usually how you'll achieve the best kind of consistent looking very an apparent that you've done something you know in a corner up at the top of a wall and extra ceiling or something like ...\nWhen you're in your full paint mode what tools do you have on you at all time\nIt kinda depends a little bit on what phase of ... as a rule you've got to put a knife on you got some tape you always got to you know drop club with you whether you're prepping or what not just to keep your area clean\nFor the most [noise] All

at\nThat Bush and it will pick up the different colors um so when you're in the app\nYou don't have to have a a log in or or any type of account to use the ... you can just log in and use it earned open up and use it right away you do have the option to create an account with John Edwards and I I mean I didn't go that far as far as you know making an account and everything but\nAh you open it up and you have the option to either take a photo or browser photos so say you went to Sedona last weekend and he just loves the beautiful red and the rocks and you want to keep like eight that color you can upload that existing photos to the app and then select what part\nOf the picture the color that you actually watch\nAnd see this is something that could have solve Rosie's first question that he got stumped on when he started the radio broadcast Thirty years ago was the homeowner wanted the color of paint that match yesterday sunset\n[laughter] yeah so if you had a picture of yesterday's sunset upload it and you can grab that that the uniform orange team that you wanted\nOr and with Instagram I'm sure you could have jumped on there and found a picture of yesterday's sunset reactor local sources uploaded near your phone selection out and then there was a third up that we looked at the other third I\nWas um PG and the only are issues that we first came up with for the ap itself to use it on like Shirley millions and Donna Edwards you actually need a\nOutside piece of hardware they call it the Knicks sensor and it's just a little um [noise] maybe about an inch inch and a half high but maybe an inch wide and you would you do is instead of down onto a color swatch and it's got a little hole in the bottom and then senses the color and using the ...\nWhich you will connect to this device ... to ... it will then upload all that information color number shade the name\nAnd that's how the PG up works they do however have a function on their browser so you go to a PG dot com [noise] uh I think it works in any browser I use chrome and you can upload a photo\nAnd so I think I took a photo of the conference room\nAnd it gets you spoke to select surfaces like flaws the mantle you know and recognized tables and chairs the obviously not going to be painting and for the most part it did a good job and you know you you lose out on the color match feature because unless you know you have to somehow to\nLet you go the Knicks to scan it you know you go to the browser ... tough luck in that regard but you can if you have an idea of the color you can at least go with ...\nAnd his color nix is that correct color Knicks it's just an accent I acts and all the Knicks color censor it even when you put it on a surface it's supposed to look at that surface and then give you the closest ... ... if you're trying to match that one right [noise] so\nThat's for color matching it does have the function where you know you could take all these different colors and put it over your surface so you can see what different colors you're trying to trying to change the color\nRight yeah you can and I mean for the most part it works well you know what the wall you left the color and it'll you know visualize that for you\nLike this could be because I took that photo but there were a few times where it was mistaking things were not paid to surfaces as the wall and so the picture you get is just would make no sense you just have to refresh it and\nSo I I Will say it could have been just a bad photo on my end of the building out again [noise]\nBetween all three of these did we have a of an agreed favorite or it's a closely enough minus the the Knicks color match future\nYeah I think the Sherman Williams was our number one Donna Edwards very closely following it showing lines because you have that option to kind of use live view and hanging out with a couple of other you know ... of what you can do what the paint there so\nUm that one was definitely first of all by Donna Edwards um you know just for the fact that it was really good at picking up the colors and an even kind of auto selected different colors so you didn't have to be too much messing around on the screen and\nYou know you can save and favorites and all that stuff so\nDefinitely both very user friendly um you can open them right up use them you know no problem there's not a big learning curve or anything to them\nGoing back to Android or a apple app which ones are which you know\nI'm ... and we both have a Android took care of all the apps that we tested when you you can download them not to the place door on Android um we didn't ask them on an iPhone I Would imagine that they weren't just the thing though\nI'm checking my app store right now just checking and getting fatter [laughter] uh woes color snout\nAnd which one of those colors that that was the butcher a dark out last week was discussing that yeah so they're nurse ribs right there ...

M. K. two sixty ...\nMountain Gardner is paid for by water garden center and solely responsible for content\nWelcome to the mountain gardener on takes you a name with local garden expert Ken Lay mountain gardening can be challenging but with can tip certain things are ... you'll reap huge rewards now welcome your can lane\nWelcome to this week's edition of the mountain gardener this is your host Ken Lane was you're talking about the landscapes of northern Arizona and it is beautiful oh my gosh this is that this is what follows all about this is why\nWe live in northern Arizona it's just been so beautiful you know your thought winter was here and then all of a sudden it's nice to get we call the Indian Summers or or you remember back last spring\nYou thought it was warm thought it was warm thought it was warm and then it got cold\nAnd then it went back up and it was like ... it was like this violent warm and cold warm and cold and and the temperature would swing like forty degrees between daytime nighttime and\nAnd that's one of the prostate the last frost date of spring at most to the elevation is going to be the first week in may you higher elevation folks in Flagstaff and paint up lakeside and at a Williams you're you're going to be\nProbably the end of may you folks on the lower elevations caught and would camp Verde Sedona Kingman you're probably down towards the\nEnd of April but basically if you took mothers' day plus or minus a couple of weeks and they decide\nThat lasts for us it seems like in March we could we which we get tricked into wanting to plant too early hours summer blooming things\nAnd so they get zipped the fruit trees get tricked into blooming too early and they get in zip to the fruit just taken especially if you're if you're planting the wrong variety is for the mountains so if you're planting a desert variety let's go to your\nBig box store a big big cops go phrase thing and and and they've got these fruit trees out front and there are so tempting 'cause they're like fifty bucks off a great deal\nOr the wrong variety many many times they'll grow but don't ever\nMany times they'll grow but don't ever bloom and fruit\nAnd so that that's why timing is is is important and then also the variety is important right now we're into the fall blooming things I thought it would cover some of the things that shouldn't be planted right now things are best planted in the fall right now\nIf you see ... do you see a ... a ... at your grocery store and they go to here here's the take home and then then planted\nIt will not grow outdoors from this point forward it'll you put it out there within a week dead\nThey're made for him in doors or in tropical landscapes or or interior landscapes are made for how his house plants kitchen seal things he I've even struggled growing bagel in my window sill\nBecause if it touches that cold lasts in January and February it it does not like that if you close at courting down in front of it and it's between the pain and and that's and that curtain it will it gets too cold there it'll just keel over and die\nAnd so they're made to be where it's warm\nRight now you can plant Rosemary you can plant lavender you time oregano salt series chives garlic ... there's a whole series of plant that love to be planted now\nYour best parsley crop will be planted now through\nOh the end of November So\nYour best a lettuce spinach cauliflower Brussels sprouts they're all planted now and you're harvesting those for Thanksgiving dinner for Christmas dinner and they'll keep blooming or producing or you can harvest rapes through winter I Would say if you're into kale\nHealthy you know there's no more antioxidants than there was an kale or be those are best planted now\nSo that you get to work out four seasons the big mistake many people make when planting\nIs they'll take that last cool season crop in may we've got our last frost is only going to get nothing but warmer we quickly go from seventies beautiful everyone celebrating the spring season two Ninety it's just hot the mountains\nAnd and those spring blooming things don't like that equally if you go plants right now the summer loving things things that love the heat will the heat's pretty much gone at this point yes it's nice days\nBut there is a chill in the evening and it comes down to nighttime temperatures for most of these plants and so this is when you do want to plant your cool season things let's talk flowers year you're pansies love the cold\nAs one of the biggest mistakes a lot of folks think their thumbs are are are black\n'cause they miss timed or misjudged wind a plant that crop of\nOf pansies and so it it quickly ... it just falls over dead in the heat it's above eighty five degrees paying these they're not happy and there's no amount of water or shade you can give 'em work to keep them alive\nThey love to be planted now the only thing that would be better if if your plants in about three weeks we get a light snow right on top of ... thanks giving they would absolutely celebrate that some plants like the cold\nSnap dragons are that way dusty Miller are that way\nViola as an ornamental kale there was actually edible ... which is very sweet very delicious\nMy mouth just watering thinking about like Lisa actually sprinkles or she makes a stupid it's gotta with fresh Lee cut up tail to sue good into soup although it's so good [noise] um and then there's ornamental kale\nAnd it's just meant to be pretty and they're typically reds purple and white they're just gorgeous and of course the most famous of all of the fall perennials moms or chrysanthemums\nThey love to be grown they love to be planted now and they'll keep coming back every year bigger and bigger and bigger it's my mom's I planted as of ... a gallon I forget and now they're they've gotta be\nGotta be two feet across their glorious they've set to they brought some twice they bloom late summer and now they're blooming again so that's just really what you want to see out of those perennials but it's about the timing sometimes it's not you\nThat has the garden issue sometimes it's the nursery you're you're the advice you're getting and the timing you're getting the wrong variety where you're painting the right variety at the wrong time\nAnd it ended doesn't succeed or fail ... struggles and you're wondering why did I Do wrong it wasn't to you it was\nIt was you were sold the wrong bill of goods basically so that's why we're so big here at least our garden Centre of of garden information so this is our fifty seven year of being open\nA fifty seven seasons fifty seven years we started in Nineteen sixty two is to do the math right pretty sure um that's a ... and and our formula has always been be friendly be neighborly\nAnd and neighbors we're just we're leaning across the fence we're just sharing the advice that you really worked in our backyard and if you do these things that will also work for you and your back yard and and if you teach someone how to garden\nThey'll get the bill catch that bug and then want to do it more and if they're really good at those to tell it to their friends now now we've got the next neighbor leaned against the fence and sharing it with their\nWith their neighbors and so ... and various social that way and so it's all about\nGetting that timing right so right now this is a tremendous time to be planting those fall perennials even if they're starting to fade let's say the hostages are out there right now ... says are great big route basically\nIt's it's a it's a flashy route\nAnd so this beautiful soft foliage comes up it's a shame to plant in the mountains of Arizona with a very fragrant white flour\nUh they they just sit there and they had been at the beautiful thing right now is they are a true perennial\nThey're green foliage was will start to turn brown kind of a gold collar kind of a little later than than Aspen gold none of butter yellow but kind of a bright gold color\nAnd as I say this search the triple back and then then start to turn brown a you it'll just to hibernate while it's doing that there's tremendous route wrote that happens underneath that\nAnd so hostile tend to be kind of wimpy and no more sunny area if you plant them now\nThey root out through the end of the year they'll route out again the extend those same routes even farther and so by the time you get to next summer's eighty Ninety degree weather in the mountains at least they're going to be much heartier and if you wait to plant those in may where they really haven't\nHad any time to root\nThere there were coming into summer and they struggle so they get brown temps there's a real advantage to fall painting if you can find the fault perennials\nMoms are that way I Would say for coke me a there's a beautiful like an iris looking grass has his fluorescent orange flower it's from summer they've

rotate and put them in different spots in the yard so for me I Do I Do a raised beds maybe a hundred and twenty square feet\nAnd then quite a number of container pots I probably have another forty

market Research Center\nYou are listening to the mountain Gardner with local experts can lane mountain gardening can be challenging but let's can tip strengthens our name five you'll read huge reward now welcome back to the mountain Gardner\nStarting to hit the peak of the fall color season right throughout the whole region\nUh we're we're hitting it right on so it it really looks good right now especially in that six to five thousand foot level\nYou folks in the higher elevations have been yogurt the groom creeks and the highland pines you you've been in there for for probably a couple of weeks already we're just now hitting the stride at the little bit lower elevations\nAnd you folks that you know thirty five hundred of five thousand foot level you'll be a couple of weeks after us to just has this pulsating waved to put on your elevation and also\nNoticed your neighborhood much in my neighborhood in the house is it fifty seven hundred feet a there is a very hilly neighborhoods eagle rich so there's probably go from six thousand a probably a five hundred foot elevation change routine the highest hill\nA house and the lowest what you'll find is those folks that are on the south facing hills they're warmer\nAnd so the plants are a little slower to turn color\nThose plants those houses are on the north facing north side there are a little bit cooler more shaded and so those trees those shrubs they'll start to pop the sort of turn color faster sooner\nThat's also an elevations change if you're near a washer dryer wash all that cold air in the evening settles in runs down that dry wash so those plants planned to closer to that low spot in the landscape\nThere there'll be chilled they'll turn a color sooner so you'll see the same plant in the same neighborhood turning it different weeks maybe you've had a low seven to ten days difference\nBetween when the first one goes the last one\nAnd so my maple maple syrup and beautiful in our neighborhood they been in full random kind of jealous going to win his mind maple gonna turn color and it just just turn this week is starting to go\nAnd so it's not quite there another week and it will be full glorious read just beautiful so it's a Prescott blaze maple it's just stunning a hammer maple\nHas turned ... this week or the other name id flame a maple it's kind of like a it's sort of reminds me of a Japanese maples got a small maple leaf small footprint small format\nTypically comes in a multi stem format so a Japanese maples typically cabinet single truck with a miniature tree farm up to about ten twelve feet this one's typically as they shipped multiply stem ...\nRed maple the reason that flame maple is heartier or better or a better choice for the mountains of Arizona\nIs at our elevation the sun is pretty intense\nAnd so it's too intense for most Japanese maples it's just hard for my southern folks to really understand Japanese maple grows and full sun\nIn a in Missouri it does not do that here\nIt needs more protection needs more shade will a flame of maple which kind of has a similar look he loves it just hit the hotter the better I mean planning out full sun surrounded with asphalt is happy happy happy\nAnd so it's and it just turned a the most intense read\nOf most of the maples minutes like fire engine red head fairy dust to watch it glow I mean it is that kind of intense\nAnother one that's all right behind that this kind of a shrub a taller shrub get to talk about ahead higher so six maybe seven feet of a little bit shorter than a flame maple but burning Bush burning Bush or you want them is\nA is a botanical name but burning Bush it's how we all reference it because it looks like the thing is on fire it's fire red is glowing red\nRight now the stock we've got here in the nursery it's got kind of a purple whew so it goes from from dark rich green who's purple hue and then right before right after that it goes right read I mean like\nThe the the cord like a red straw it's that color I mean it's a bright bright red or it's that color and it is a very hearty plant for the mountains it's a great time to plant I Would say this is your ideal time to plant because you can see the color\nYou see all hardy it's going to be it's going to keep rooting out through the fall and then after the after the foliage drops because these are all deciduous plants deciduous means it sheds or leaves and has bright Paul color\nA evergreens are going to be or con of hers are evergreens so it's kind of some some horticultural definition there get those out of the way up but you want of us has is most interesting bark it it's not\nSo has the most interesting bark\nIt it's not like appealing markets got these ribs up and down the stems that are striking\nA they're beautiful to just cut off and bring it as a bundle I use them as a decoration on the table\nFor Thanksgiving or Christmas her to bow on 'em around a bit just they're very very unusual that's those are one of the plants when I had to get my certified nursery professional certification or this is pretty intense you got to know all your ... names be able to identify a plant\nBy its with or without leaves the true what are these\nThe truth deciduous I mean no fault of dramas plant burning Bush in this identification and yet ten plants that id you go down you've got to get the Latin name and the botanical name of that and the and the common name\nScott okay wow was pretty tricky I got I got I'm writing my past\nI Am certified professional but they through one of those and I'll never forget going back but I remember that park this very distinctive once you take a close up look you go you'll never forget the burning Bush is one of those plants ... one for their fall color\nAnd now's the time of you plant those typically there'll be in a two to five gallon size plant\nI should probably cover that to what sizes are best planted and when right now if you're planting and the autumn season now to the end of the year through throughout the new year it's better to plant a little bit larger root ball\nThat way if we do happen to get bitter cold all of a sudden in the ground freezes bigger is better more insulated more roots uh you'll get a larger route mass for next summer as well\nFor the talk of the quad cities eleven thirty AM change you in a brigade rally and on Ninety nine point nine of them came to sixty me I'll get\nOn the talk of the quad cities eleven thirty AM Ninety nine nine and ... and Ninety five five ... cat and more than ...

C. audit and accounting solutions seems joining us to talk about some tax\nIssues can you believe that right see welcome sir thank you there and present you have me on today well we're glad you can join us we know you're very busy this time of year you just finished the tax deadline right tell us about your\nPracticed a little bit aren't definitely we did we just finished her extension deadline and typically right after the extension deadline we start looking into the tax planning for two thousand and Eighteen or the subsequent year and this year as you know some big changes in the tax laws and and I think that we'll discuss some of those today\nOkay absolutely so short window here and now the last couple of months of twenty Eighteen for folks to sort of say where am I sat and what's it look like going into twenty Nineteen and perhaps make some changes sure okay\nAnd you mentioned some some tax changes that occurred in twenty Eighteen most folks maybe are familiar with that by now that maybe we can just do a little refresher here absolutely so the law was\nCuts in JOBS Act and it for some clients took effect towards the end of two thousand and Seventeen for certain transactions ah mainly for business clients acquiring assets um which I think the date and specific\nSo it's um which I think the date and specifically was after September twenty seventh two thousand and Seventeen\nYou started to be able to utilize some of the rules from the new tax law but here in the two thousand and Eighteen I think we have more or less to different buckets of clients that that come into play here where you have your business clients and your individuals' clients and so your business clients who have businesses\nUm maybe even a states that are that are out there that's the business side of things and then on the tax on the individual side is where you have some other laws that have effect says well okay and we deal with clients that have that they're really from both areas strike\nAnd my practice of dementia wealth primarily individuals not so much on the business side but anyway the jewels who are either I'm close to retiring are already in retirement how would they be most impacted\nYou know it's a good question daring and and I think that your clientele is probably fairly similar to a a a good portion of the clients that we service over at our company and for our ... our clients that are retired\nThere was a couple of changes but I don't think that they're they're super I'm a significant to them in ... they're going to see a big difference in what their tax liability was in two thousand Seventeen\nVersus what's versus what it would be in two thousand Eighteen within you know within the norm if we had in the norm but uh some of the bigger changes that we will see is a or give me an example the introduction has doubled um but with that we've also seen that the exemptions that are going away\nSo you look at a client and it picks up some additional standard deductions in some cases but they're exemption goes away when you look at the net impact it may not be a significant as you might have once thought it might be right that's what\nWe're saying is maybe you know percentage or to or a thousand dollars either direction right perhaps allow let\nUs I think that's probably accurate you know have a a client who is retired and you know maybe there in that middle middle income range where they're they're making somewhere between eighty thousand in even up to two hundred thousand I think those clients are not going to see a significant change\nUm you could have a situation where the clients are itemize and the first place and then there than their standard of their exemption goes away and then they may lose a thousand or whatever the figure might be in their individual case\nAnd perhaps this is a good time for some clients to rebuild that whether or not they still need or want that mortgage if they're no longer able to itemize the interest maybe that's a discussion about hey should keep this mortgage should be paid off since we're not qualifying\nFor the itemized deductions right or and boom or interest adoption is still available they did a lemonade for equity a the equity portion of a refinance you cannot you cannot deduct the interest points on on a\nOn a refinance or the loan so that did change sucking rooms to right the way they got away from it as well as the second loan now up to seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars of financing you'd still get the same ... on your home on on your on your on your primary rack\nOkay so um [laughter] are we going to be able to follow taxes with a postcard next year is that rumor myth or wishful thinking well so I recently had seen\nThe new the new tax form a new ten forty and in fact it does look like a postcard it's basically a ten forty which was normally two pages\nKinda folded into a half page which is front and back\nOf the reality is is that some clients may use that I Would expect that the majority of our clients and the people that were working with here in the press who the area will never file of tax return on a postcard uh although in theory sounds nice but it's just really not practical\nUm I think that there was talk\nIn the past where they said well you know what the simplification of the of the tax law and and doubling of the standard deduction\nYou know won't accountants have less business and you know I consider that as well but when you really start to look at the they tax rules and some of the you know just some of the intricacies of how everything's working I think that the tax rules about to become more complex and us but I don't\nGet started on this special interest in Washington piling on and carving out these exemptions and therefore is in in if then right well sure and I and I think that's certainly\nAnother story as well but I'm In this case I don't see that you'll you'll see a lot of uh people falling on postcards and if you do that and there'll be lucky and and the fact that there will be a very simple tax return and they shouldn't have too much to deal with in that case and\nI'm Down below the da Vinci wealth radio remember we're here every Saturday twelve noon right here on cake you in a we're visiting today with a CPA and owner of\nS. C. odd and accounting solutions Mr Steven Crandall or Steve's office can be reached at nine to age\nSeven seven eight six seven six oh the website is W. W. W. dot S. C. H. A.\nSolutions dot com and of course we'll post all this information as well as this radio program up on da Vinci wealth dot com so if you miss that called the um contact information will give it out different world chimed in radio program\nAnd you can also catch it at ... dot com speaking of the website to bitch about dot com I Want to take just a second to invite each and every one of you to our next\nUpcoming financial workshop and and now even hesitate to call it a financial workshop because we're actually doing a two hour class\nThis is going to be on Thursday November eight we're going to start at six PM at the press get public library gonna be talking about taxes in retirement as one of the sort of sub topics if you will\nThe main topic of the workshop where the class is called the new realities in retirement so taxes will be a big part of that obviously investment management and some of the headwinds that investors and retirees face\nGoing for here late two thousand Eighteen and into two thousand Nineteen you can get more information about that class\nA ... a workshop and da Vinci well dot com that's dementia Leonardo ... wealth as in your money or by calling us nine to wait\nSome pretty significant I think if I recall correctly hers or ... or something like Fifteen hundred dollars a month she earns one extra dollar it's going to college or Eighteen thousand dollars in lost premiums\n... okay and I'll go ahead and I'll come\nIn on this and I sit down with clients um every year at least these past couple of years as a new tax law has been in place and inevitably will have a scenario where the client and thought that oh wow I'm I'm getting these a health care subsidies which was great and\nAh maybe your premiums in that case would be\nFifteen hundred or two thousand or twenty five hundred I've seen it you know clients have premiums all the way up to\nForty five hundred dollars among out ... and\nThey get these premiums and they're not putting together for for whatever reason the fact that if you if your income exceeds a certain level\nYou qualify for no premiums whatsoever and if you did receive any premiums you'd have to pay every dollar of that back and it happens on your tax return right I'm\nShocked shocked and so they kind of dig it they can do the math and they go okay I've got X amount from Social Security maybe they have a part time job right so they got they got X that amount\nAnd then you know they might be getting close and then all of a sudden they own what I've seen is they own a basket of mutual funds fried right and they have no control over that capital gains that get paid out on those mutual funds and then all of a sudden they're sweating it at the end of the year going what am I going to do\nOr they're in a situation where they can't sell anything in their portfolio even though they might need cash fried we have a you know our hands are tied in terms of selling anything that might generate a capital gains\nThat's correct and we see the capital gain dividends it'll come in on their ten Ninety nine at the end of the year and\nClients that oh I didn't ... that you know 'cause it's not part of my retirement income that's coming in every month it's not part of my Social Security it's not you know maybe potentially from interest or the evidence\nAnd so it's hard to predict and and another scenario um that's hard to predict because I have a lot of clients that will be the recipient of the state or an air to you know beneficiary\nAnd in some cases if you um are are the recipient of a of a trust and and your taxable income coming from that trust right um that income right there can actually throw you over the threshold I talk lately that\nTrust I'm a non spousal beneficiary IRA that were distributions are required right or I mean all these things and and and with regards to the capital gains the stuff you might see online Thirteen right mhm that's what we call phantom income in our industry right on that all over you got your term forward as well because oftentimes\nThe mutual fund to pay out these capital gains in December they're required to by law\nAnd often they're just reinvest it and so you basically have a a a really a transparent event if you will ride I only X Y Z I owned a you know a hundred shares of X Y Z mutual fund they paid out of capital gain and that that money it was just she used\nTo buy more shares of the ... the mutual fund and now I have just more shares that are worth a little bit less in between I have to pay taxes on this I received a ten Ninety nine short\nAnd you may be the situation in order to come up with the money to pay those taxes or to pay back the bunker subsidies you may have to depend do accounts which will create an additional amount of tax for you as well so\nIt can certainly penalize you in in multiple ways and so I think it's important for anybody out there\nThat is receiving any type of substitutes for from the Affordable healthcare act\nTo evaluate where you're going to be and understand that income plays a huge tractor and again if you go over by even one dollar you could potentially have to pay that back and I think there's some opportunities to plant against is\nUm it's hard to plan to plan so that you you can ensure that your income doesn't go over that level\nI'm ... and I'll give you an example if you have a state or fully aware\nYou have some lawsuit that were built up maybe made a bad investment\nUm you may be a scenario where this might be the year that you want to work with your financial adviser and potentially sell off some of those so that you cannot sought to offset capital losses against potential other capital gains that you may you may be receiving unexpectedly right away and I was\nAt a ... year financial advisor needs to know about that that there's a reason I'm Talking about this stuff on my radio program leaves and junk cause I'm keenly aware of these issues right\nWe went through this just this week with a client she called me sit there and my cars in the shop I Need some money you know the gap some money I said well we've got to sell against the law says because you can't have any more income she's right up against it on the threshold in fact we're going to use her IRA contribution\nTo get her down below because that is one area that\nI'm can impact and actually you're allowed to use it irate contribution to diminish or reduce that income right to keep it below that threshold but she's up against it I said hey we we have to make sure so I'm On the phone with a trading desk and her portfolio we're managing saying look we need to raise some cash but please harvest tax law says\nDon't sell anything that has a game in it so you're advisor needs to be aware of these issues in order to make sure you don't end up with a giant\nHealth care premium bill at the end of the year and oh by the way if you have to pay that premium then
