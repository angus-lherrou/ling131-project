she did not author a book justifying slavery I'd been unaware of runs a sense this book but it looks and sounds pretty good\nThe um the book is called dreams from our founding fathers of first principles in the Obama era and it's obviously a play on dreams from my father\nAnd here's the section of the book that the Gillum campaign is pointing to and uh it it is very clear very explicit in in the book\nThat the census beliefs that slavery was a great evil\nBut what he talks about is how it is that founding fathers who are very anti slavery like Alexander Hamilton who was there the constitutional convention\nLike Benjamin Franklin who was one of the originals originator is the American anti slavery society how they could go along with a constitution that didn't mandate slavery but it allowed it\nAnd here is what time what the census said just so that you understand he said this is why there was no\nJust so that you understand he said this is why there was no real chance of the convention constitutional convention would abolish the peculiar institution of slavery some of the notorious compromises the demonstrated a toleration of slavery such as the federal ratio which allow the slave holding states\nTo count five slaves is the equivalent of three free citizen the free states did not one slaves counted at all because they did not want political power of a slave states to be enhanced were even wants to be necessary to ensure ratification Hamilton\nA counselor to the New York man your mission society menu mission means the freeing of slaves\nLeaders lamented that without such a compromise no union could possibly have been formed similarly Benjamin Franklin who served as president of the ... Pennsylvania abolition society\nDeclined to read a letter to the convention delegates from the society that denounced flavor in religious and Republican grounds Franklin did not want to derail the convention by further inflaming the delegates over the issue of slavery and believe that the United states could not last without a new federal government for is he wrote in his final convention speech\nOur states are on the point of separation only to meet here after for the purpose of cutting more than others throats for anti slavery delegates like Hamilton and Franklin abolition of slavery\nWould be a moot point if a failure to erect a functioning government snuff down the ideals of the American revolution in their infancy then the future of all Americans a free as well as the slave would eventually be as serves\nTo despotic government OK doesn't that sound like he's defending slavery it it it\nIs completely bogus and utterly irresponsible and I imagine that a mirror Gillum never even picked up a book that he's condemning\nWhich sounds like it's kind of worth picking up and vote justify slavery and I'm a [noise]\nAnd then there's this I mean if if you talk about Democrats just going way over the top are carrying a tia who is a columnist for the Washington Post was on MSNBC with Morning Joe and make a Brzezinski listen\nIt is a global western corner then that score so right now in our politics it's something that is\nI think what we need to understand it's not just about right or if it's not just about political points about flip all think people's lives are on now on the line and going back to the Republican Party in going back to the trouble\nIs just the three men in Kansas for convicted of trying to bomb Somali refugees and they said in court\nThat ... every time I was on rhetoric health to influence their decision to take people's lives is is not just a matter of of rhetoric of distractions of a cultural ... this is a matter of people\nDying all over the climate that's being created by a by not only the White House and condoned by by people like think paying and Lindsey Graham but that\nPeople are dying people are literally dying over there and I think I think that in one thing that Americans need to consider when they go to the calls is this a country that we want to be right now the last week that we've had the last two weeks\nIf I were any other country I mean it's showing travel or ... to the United states over the climate and over the violence that we've seen\nOkay really\nIf you look at the murder statistics we're still at less than half the murder rate that we had in the Nineteen eighties and this is something that all Americans should be proud of it's not just a Republican achievement\nBut there's a new ad frankly that that was run by the Trump reelection campaign though this is not the Republican campaign committee\nThis is the Trump twenty twenty election campaign and the ad is one of the best Republican ads I've ever seen I'm really mean it it hits exactly where this problem came to order\nWhich is why is that right now the places where Republicans are facing the difference challenges are privileged suburbs places that have done very well that are earning lots of money lots of new jobs lots of new businesses lots of new construction\nOf those places that are doing so well why\nAre people in those communities leaning against Trump\nAnd yet in down crowd and communities and places in the mid west in in rural America and small town America that really have suffered recently and haven't yet partake in fully of the new prosperity\nThat's where Republicans are doing well have the party's flipped position the Democrats are now the party of the rich and the religion that comfortable and secure\nAnd the Republican Party has become\nParty of the aggrieved and the struggling\nWith regular life and they do and for most people they start using relief factor was a dietary supplement full of natural good stuff for your body\nThat relief factors starts working in five or six days you can feel a real difference and for the great majority of people over Seventy percent nearly three quarters of people who get relief factor\nFind after three weeks which costs just Ninety five cents a day after three weeks Nineteen Ninety five they a result really factor works so well that they get more of that you have nothing to lose but your pain\nAnd the whole world to gain go to relieve factor dot com that is relief factor dot com when we come back I Want to play the bad which I think is much more effective than other ends in this cycle\nFor the Republican side will we're coming right back on the method show\nMichael ...
