continue to talk about some of the things we've been talking about the last few hours but I said I Want them to talk about illegal immigration especially with the caravan approaching I've talked about illegal immigration for over Twenty years now and I've never wavered in my position the issue is really not that difficult if you'd knowledge and the simple fact\nThat people across the border illegally have come here legally as one caller pointed out\nWhich is why those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone illegal aliens so you have to term undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or lost them\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over if they are legal then they're not allowed to be here and a story if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in\nThey wouldn't be able to say they belonged in your home but they just lack the proper documents similarly if someone walked into your bank and wants to take the money out of your account they ought to be asked to prove that it is their account if they said it was their account but they just didn't have the documents approving the banks would not permit them accent\nWhich is why so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as if they are entitled to your house and bank account if only they could find a misplaced documents\nFor years now I've said that the left as one of the argument over language whether it's undocumented versus illegal livable wage versus minimum wage global warming or climate change whatever it is the moment\nBut the left is much better to finding the terms and using the language to their benefit of course it helps to have a media on your side perpetuating each false it's so so those on our side or off and on the defensive even though they're explaining the obvious\nAnd the most recent case being parents with children\nTrying to get asylum if that's really the case if they're not just coming in for the benefits of work and

doing today well Joe\nGood I got a um a ... point to me and my son was in the military and when he was honorably discharged\nAfter he mended you went to work got minimum wage\nIn Illinois here it turns out he could have been getting instead of the eight dollars nine dollars an hour minimum wage\nI could have been getting a twenty two ... two forty if he would have taken all the benefits for welfare\nI Would propose that why don't we met not welfare down to where it's a forty hour week minimum wage pay check you spend it on the phone just spend it on ... whatever that takes care of the welfare of side\nBut those people who are on welfare who want more money from go get a job be picking fruit out of the out of the\nOrchards or what have you and actually have the potential of earning more than minimum wage\nYeah makes perfect sense that's a good idea and we thank your son for a service that's got a rose in Simpson Advil South Carolina rose Ron with mark\nHi Mark you're doing a great job thank you very much um my condo live these people from the caravan\nUh eight people from the caravan are carrying flags from their country what makes me feel like they're invading our country when you treat that's an act of war\nAnd I would say we should be treated like an act of war it clear that that that war declaration on your mama whatever might treat when they're holding and get in the hell out of here\n[noise] and that's the most incredible thing of all roads that they come into this country with no gratitude the way our ancestors came by to talk about it Ellis Island they would never carried flags from their home countries they were seeking freedom they were ... sneaking a new life\nThe whole point and it's so discouraging when they come here they bring a lot of the same culture in terms of even voting for people like try to get away from the get away from governments who try to tell them what to do with their lives and they both the same thing when they get here let's go to Paul in Littleton, Colorado Paul you're on with mark\nAnd mark Patrick taking my call true hey I wanted to follow up\nOn your comment earlier about the term illegal alien or got in a different a vein a you know the advocates of amnesty and\nHigh levels of immigration of always described the illegal alien population there's one made up of otherwise law abiding people who've done nothing more than cross the border illegally mhm\nWell the reality is is that they're coming here for jobs in order to find a job\nThey've got to fill out of nine Ryan form that when they do that and say they're here legally to commit perjury which is a felony or the other thing is is that they routinely make up Social Security numbers\nOr feel somewhat Social Security numbers a surfer Immigration Studies suggest that about Seventy five percent of the illegal aliens that are here to work uh have been violating these laws\nBut nobody ever mentions it or not otherwise law abiding it's simply a ... my daughter was actually a victim of a ... by illegal alien\nUsing her Social Security number was ... when she was a child mhm\nSo uh I don't know why the ah conservatives Republicans don't push back on this whole illegal thing a by by describing what's happening here in internally when people come into work [noise]\nYeah just the one one of the many problems with this whole thing it just seems obvious to me there's got to be an orderly procedure that house someone gets into a country we call that legal immigration you have a plan that makes sense you give the opportunity to the people you want to give the opportunity\nSeems so obvious to me and that's why you have to have when the language war because otherwise they put it in terms of ripping babies away from immigrant children and having immigrants always been a terrific a boost to the United states of America you know legal immigrants but you changed the language let's go to Rick in the Bronx Rick you're on was mark\nThanks

states of America forgive me even people with disease right they haven't been ... as one caller pointed out\nSo you have to have some means of doing this some orderly process that's the whole point\nThis argument seems such such an easy one to win\nIf you frame it in the right terms use the right language you know be compassionate people okay you want to come to this country I think we let

most beautiful things I ever heard I really mean it was the announcement\nAnd it was based upon a statement by the Anti Defamation league which monitors\nAnti Semitism and anti Semitic incidents they reported that the horrible attack on Pittsburgh and yes it was horrible and was nightmarish one was pure evil\nThat that attack was the deadliest single attack\nAgainst American Jews\nIn the nearly

it's horrible and it's nightmarish\nBut uh I think perspective is a hundred percent necessary and what Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a White House press briefing I think this could be her best press
