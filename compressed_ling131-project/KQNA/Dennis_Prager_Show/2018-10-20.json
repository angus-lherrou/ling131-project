quality paint every type of additional added to the right type of machine the highest priced acrylic the name brand pain and if you didn't spend time\nPrepping the surface it was just all for nothing

that's really how do an understanding or appreciation for each and everything and looking at a good color scheme isn't done by accident and you think a color selection of that shouldn't be a hard\nThing but there are people that are professional and make a living at color selection and it really allows you to dig deep into the world as we're doing the research for these topics and have an appreciation for\nThe profession of color selection and it's\nSomething that years ago we had a couple of colors of paint you know you've got your colors of the rainbow you pick up a color we'll today

well my turn to dance but Dale ... yards me Dave the other guy\nThat's okay um I I'm a gardener I Do a lot of color stuff I talked to a lot of women that do directing is what they want and what I come to realize or believe is that women and men see colors different like\nFor instance and especially the reds versus oranges and I was just curious if your guest has had the same experience\nWe will ask Karen that question she's joining us here right after the bottom of the hour news segment so your your observation is that if I see read a color red uh my wife Amanda would look at that and say no that's the orange\n[noise] she's more likely you'll see something that is a dark orange\nAnd she'll say that's red and you'll go no it's orange and and I've I've given up this argument because I always got to please the customer and but there is a all around Sally is a plant that it's pretty common and it's a it's a boy or injured or darker orange\nAnd I've had numerous where my customers telling me that things are at I'm taking a bow than it is rather silly is orange but\nYou know I get 'em to color they want and and everybody's happy but I'm curious ... with other professionals if they've noticed the same thing\nAll right I don't know if we're going to be able to [noise]\nYou know I I'm not sure if our guest is has a what what is optical ... up to ... to ... the object of the optic genetic makeup of male versus female and how color is received to the brain but ah we'll we'll find out here shortly as a we bring our gets in the conversation\nNot here shortly as we bring our gets in the conversation on our color selection topic when you go into a paint store it it's so easy to get overwhelmed you know when we did Landrieu's room a couple of weeks ago [laughter] a couple of weeks this was like a year and a half I think um\nAnd I've noticed a little bit of wallpaper coming back that's something we hadn't seen in a long time and I saw more wallpaper selection come in but the the matching a wall paper to paint a it is a completely separate topic\nBut what's interesting about the wallpaper that you cannot do with pain is the different kind of patterns you can do\nAnd the adoption of layering different colors you know this this creates a whole nother thought process I like the very clean blanket of one color on a pain but there's layering you can do for both finishing and different\nTexture appear you can take a smooth plaster and do a full finish and looked like you've got the expense of marble they were shipped in from Italy that you put into your uh on this round column as you walk into your front entry way\nBut it's just an illusion of the right paint application from somebody that's spent a lot of time learning this technique so not only does one color on one wall coming to a factor but are we going to layer it and that can create a very um [noise]\nVery affordable way to look like you've got an a very expensive finish and last\nYear on the interior a very long time\n[noise] so we've got an additional layer for full finishing but the the tools that comes into play we're not doing a lot of rural pain that maybe your base but we're using a lot of ... techniques that change\nChanges our uh our skill level you've also got to be able to live with imperfection when you're doing that\nYou can over design it all on a full finish\nAnd it's going to look so fake\nPut that in terms of artificial turf when it first came out it was so perfect it's so green so perfect it was so obvious it was fake it started to catch on when they developed imperfections into it to look like it is and it's natural state and that's a very easy thing to do on\nA full finish when we're working on what was to perfect it so meticulously when you're done and you step back you're like man that that is just thing I've ever seen any amount of time it takes to do a full finish you the last thing you're going to want to do anybody wants to do is start over\nBut that's one great thing about paint you can start over get all white finish\nGo over the top let's get a clean slate it's it's not exactly an eraser type solution but\nIt's a whitewash out to start over is is a reality show it to something we're doing our self and it's a wall\nAnd a sitting area that it's okay to have a drop costs in front of her for a couple of months while we finish it a perfect whatever technique we're trying to finish you know you could do that and just live with the fact that this is\nThis is a creation this isn't just a blue and go job you're doing something you're creating something for your home and living space that you're going to that look at it as crazy as it sounds stare at and enjoy\nWhile you're just living in your home whether it's [noise] watching TV you're going to find yourself looking over the wall lawyer\nPlaying a monopoly with the kids while you're eating breakfast\nYou don't realize how much time you've been looking at those walls until you actually do the project yourself and parents going to join us next two segments talking about the finalizing that color selection so that we only do this once\nYou remember the last

state representative I work with opioid addicts I also wrote a book or just how unscrupulous the marijuana industry would\nBe the target teenagers by selling pot of cookies candy and soda they would even call recommending marijuana to pregnant women we need to stand up to them but David Stringer won't do it\nYou voted with them if you send me to the legislature I Will fight them harder than anyone a doctor I go to prove that failed\nThe color we're showing that you can block out what's currently there and influencing that new color\nSo it it is tricky but we have a lot of tips in tricks that help walk you through this is our profession and this is what we do every day and we have so many people say wow I cannot believe\nI got to the end and this is great this is just what I was hoping for\nAt the end of the appointment you typically will be speaking with your customer we prepare a shopping list a color list for them to to keep and their samples they get to keep it at the end you're talking to them and the samples are all laid out\nAnd you could tell on top of their beautiful granite is sitting maybe four to five six colors and they are a beautiful palate and you can see just right even they are laying down on the countertop\nWhat a beautiful palate is going to work with their things\nIt's not about the ... what the caller consultant thinks it's beautiful it's about what the client wants to say what looks good on their clients' home and they're lighting\nAnd when we say client you know you'd think business you'd think professionally think adult so many clients I mean when I painted it for landers room she picked the colors she's three [laughter]\nYeah your hand stat it sometimes is a really great and when the client maybe picks a color that you know they're in the right color family\nBut like you were talking earlier about the gold do you need to knock it down that's what we'll give the advice and it's you know it's gentle will just a poll did you think about uh you know Tony down to this and they will give the reasons why\nEverything's in contacts there's a reason for why in all of design and especially color\nSo when people are trying to select some color and it's sometimes random I'll say well you know why do you like that caller why do you want to put that color\nAnd they often don't have a good reason and they can if I'm showing them something else they can off off and understand why that isn't a good color without saying yeah that's a terrible color [laughter]\nSo it's a process and most people are are very open to it and very delighted at the end with what they have\nAnd when you see terrible color terrible color for this one particular ... can be the perfect one for another project another project uh-huh how many different color we'll do you have I don't see how many colors total but did well and you got like a band\nYeah than to act so current our our latest ... has over Fifteen hundred colors in it it has historically correct interior colors and historically correct exterior colors so let's say if you're in Arcadia and you want to go historically correct we can help you by pulling out that palate um\nWe have other older ... have you know colors but they constantly keep updating it adding new colors because trends covered go sell the current one we're working with you know it's about Fifteen hundred plus colors\nAnd in a band that you say historically correct so when we're mixing our paint when we pick a color you know the the mix or in the back he was like okay for this color need X amount of drops of this material X amount of drops of this material all mixed in here and shake it up and that gives us this finished color how\nFar how long do you keep that recipe for that\nColor [noise] they have a social Williams began in Eighteen sixty six they have all their recipes from\nForever so you know they have everything is Eighteen sixty six yeah it's a hundred and fifty two year old company so when we're talking historically correct we can be matching something from turn of the central yeah that's what I'm Talking they're beautiful too and in reinterpreted and use it in New ways they're beautiful as well\nSo there are fun palate to look over and see how they're applied\nAnd with the new age and technology and the digital era when\nWe can save those you know can save lives in a ... computer system so that somebody coming back to update their pain you know like all things time fades where but if it's a or maybe we're getting ready for some company we need some touch up\nAnd the paint can is five years old under the kitchen sink\nIsn't paint quality that we want to apply to an existing or exit thing while they can come back and you got the records indicating exactly what color number that was in you can take the color number the paint mixture and they can say All right here's my recipe make a cordless paint\nCorrect so one of the cool things and we have shown Williams is something called paint perks where you become a preferred customer of ours so every time you shop with us\nIt records in this paint parks what you've purchased what product you've purchased white sheen you've purchased\nSo that when you get in trouble like you said your started you're paying out of the same but it's been five or ... years and it's just old and you don't like it that consistency so you do need a new product\nYou can go goes chart showing Williams and tell them you're preferred a a number of phone number they look you up by and a ... new\nOf the same color

gardening can be challenging but with Ken him certain things are meant by you'll reap huge reward now welcome your can lane\nWelcome to this week's edition of the mountain gardener wow it has been a changing week this has been what happened to summer I went from summer to winter just like that\nSo uh it it's been moist actually the planting the digging this soil is easy to work with than ever the maples have turned the Asher beautiful purple you're starting to see all the fall color showing up in the mountains of Arizona\nMiss is also the time that you want to plant those things if you if you're from the desert split south where you just don't see a lot of that that northern or mid western fall color or the mountains of Arizona for color and you want a beautiful new aspirin or new maple or new Asher new\nThis is the best season for planting those for choosing those\nBecause you've got a tremendous selection at the garden centers it's also a good time in that adds up plants turn this magical fall color you also start to reach the root for the next month or so so\nThat's really what you want plant and then habits start rooting right away if you're painting now though I mean this kind of weather we've had this week it doesn't always happen that way sometimes we'll get dry spells through winter\nIf we get a dry spell you need to supplement water that new planting it goes for anything that's been planted this year really so don't turn the\nIt was for anything that's been planted this year really so don't turn that system off next month we're talking two three four or five weeks from now or your landscape is going to go I'm going to shut down the system\nAnd then expect plans to go for the next five months with no water you may have to drag the hose out what her by hand especially if you're gonna plant that beautiful new Colorado spruce or a new Austrian pine or a new maple\nYou'll want to of water that to keep it healthy it's going to form those new route hairs but then if that ground gets crusty and dry and just bone dry those new routes can be shriveled up and so you'll lose that growth you would have\nIt would have been such a benefit to have that additional six eight ten inches of a real growth that fall doubled down on that next spring\nAnd by next summer you've got a super hearty super healthy can take on the heat take the wind take the whatever summers got for us it'll take it 'cause you planted it in the fall than it is a tremendous time to be planting\nWe've also what you'll find is your garden centers are bumping up their their winter evergreen inventory\nBecause we need to bring that him in ... now so we can acclimated and and we're predicting how much in the tour when to sell to winter because once it really gets cold um talk in the new year or so\nOr you know two thousand Nineteen ... your new year two thousand Nineteen you can't start shipping plants into the mountains of Arizona then if they're truly dormant in ... they've lost their leaves\nAnd you bring up those are okay but if you're bringing more\nNamed dino are heavily bamboo or or red leaf a ... or a silver Barry Eli Agnes could Tony as these broad leaf evergreens if you bring those in from a warmer climate into your market into your see flag separate White Mountains or ... or\nTitan or wherever it is you're bringing those plants in and they go into this deep cold they're just not used to that yet either not acclimated so we're trying to predict the computers tell us okay kind you're gonna so three hundred and ... to ... between now and\nFebruary fifteenth order that many were bringing 'em and now so that we can acclimate them and that way that landscapers homeowners that are new to the area they can come in and still plant be confident\nThat plant is used to our climate used our cold temperatures warm temperatures and they can planted with confidence\nSo you'll see a an increase in the varieties and choices of evergreens at your nurseries right now it's a great time to plant also you'll see some big like this week I got some really big uh Colorado spruce pines these these big Christmas tree looking\nYou know central leaders swooping branches kind of plants ... seizures\nA red woods you know there's a there's a variety of sequoia that will actually grow in the mountains Arizona we've got those in now and bigger sizes and you wouldn't be able to find other seasons in spring or summer of next year it's a good time the negative\nIf they're big they're heavy [laughter] I mean it's ridiculous some of those soils I Can't believe we're there building houses right now it's crazy a fact I just had to put a Seventy pound Jack hammer humble painting truck\nThirty five pound or which is a normal cutesy\nYou know to just ... pop straight through uh the clay soils and things it wasn't a hack and at the guys were begging for bigger hammer would get your goal for it get get the bigger the bigger impact hammer to a head on it to get the get the space that really knocks out the clay soils\nBacks away at the chipped away at that rock get it out of there\nIf you're having a big tree delivered to your house consider having your gardener your plant or your nursery plant it for you they'll have the tools hopefully\nThey're going to have the tools on the truck they're going to have the right to the game or the rate they know what size whole so ... with a big let's say it's a thirty five gallon a thirty five gallon spruce tree that thing is probably thirty inches wide the root ball and about Eighteen Inches deep\nSo when you're planting that you'll want that whole to be about the same depth as the bucket about Eighteen twenty inch\nYour years testing the soil underneath to see if you think that soil will drain the or not so if you've dug enough holes in the mountains of Arizona you kind of get a feel you just know oh man\nAt jackhammers bans bouncing off the bottom of that whole the single never drain your were digging a big bath tub here if that's a case will take the Jack hammer trying to fracture\nThat soil underneath so we break it up so the water will search seeping into the next soil band underneath the roots of that new tree you need someone that can make some calls like that\nAnd and you're going a lot lighter so I'm going to be thirty and she's going to be sixty Seventy inch wide hole because the roots goes sideways they don't go down\nAnd so you're digging a hole sideways\nAnd pulling out the junk the anything bigger than a golf ball of an old roots rocks you'll find bricks timbers of the builders Chuck didn't buried in the front yard you want to pull all that stuff out so you're left with a screen it are screened\nType of soil and other routes can go through that then you want to men that state get to get it going there was a technique to planting the main thing the reason I don't plan to larger plants of my own backyard even though I Am very capable I Know what to do\nI meet the planting ... out there with cooking and tea and water and\nI'm Out pop a chair and kind of guy at the great hey guys what you do and how what you're doing this weekend I'll I'll converse with them but I'm not planning on it because it's too heavy\nTo back surgeries\nAnd can't feel my right foot it's hard to mountain bike with it 'cause it's kind of like going around I don't want to injure myself any more uh so I have anything over let's say a Fifteen gallon size plant I have the planting crew do it and it's worth\nEvery dime I mean that price at our place everyone has a different way of of charging for that sometimes it's just the labor just have a guy's power and\nThrow the plant in the ground and leave so their prices pretty inexpensive hours includes everything so we are throwing the mulch the food the stakes the fertilizers the [noise] the route and grow them into I mean everything more more time in the whole so half\nOf that cost typically have had at least the friends I hang out with their own garden centers they are about half that price has got to be the product all the stuff it takes to plant it correctly\nAnd then the rest of it's going to be hit chips is expensive to roll guy than a truck and haven't bland and\nGet all the stuff out and go plant to just take this time for the people to go do that it's not free you need to pay for but it's worth it for a big plant that's specially\nIf you've got a gardeners sometimes you're more and blow your maintenance guys they don't necessarily know that much they know there's leaves that dropped on your crushed granted any new blow it up they know that much but how to plant an actual tree may or may not there you might like like\nThe actual tree may or may not there you might like like if you're buying a plant your waters garden center we have these planting guides\nAsked for the planting guide when you go to your nursery that tells you exactly how big the hole should be how many stakes were they should be placed\nBut they're right there by the house we don't really think about um they're fine they always winter over there very old I think I think kids would be equally as tough\nThing to watch with your containers since this is a container sounds like container questions [noise]\nMake sure if you're gardening through winter that you water those plants if you get a a cold snap that seats in January\nAnd the weather is going to oh my God it was just going to be a big storm is going to be a cold wind people run to the grocery stores and they ended the shells and they go and they hunker down and they hibernate per week all the storm passed as if you see that kind of a dent\nMake sure that your watering your plants before the colds comes a hydrated plant will go through that cold snap no matter how cold because it's got it's got as moist so the antifreeze within the structure of that plant can move back and forth if it's a dry plans kind of counterintuitive\nIf it's dry you would think oh it'll stay warmer wetter ... it'll start shivering if it's wet no plans don't shiver only we do\nYou do hear you keep the that that moisture in that plant especially container plans 'cause they dry out a little faster they drained faster it's easy to grow in him because of all those factors but the you just want to make sure you're moist knows those plants up so they can take that cold\nOr if you put them up against the house it takes a little pressure off but er an altar magnolia this evergreen beautiful southern magnolia that takes cold it takes the cold\nDon't worry

gardening can be challenging but with Ken hipster things are named five you'll read huge rewards now welcome back to the mountain Gardner fall\nIs the absolute most important feeding of the entire year\nThis is if you're only going to feed once your landscape you should be doing it more than that but if you're only going to do it one time middle of the what the landscape starve the rest of the year this is the one you do not want to miss I thought I'd go over the different kinds of fertilizers\nAnd I'd start with fertilizer steak so to some of the competitors are making the rounds making sure we're in the marketplace competitive some going out there's lots of fertilizer stakes these hard ... spikes that you can drive into the ground and they're supposed to last year\n... don't use those stopped selling those Twenty years ago and here's why in the mountains of Arizona worry very alkaline water and and rocky soil that that fertilizer steak will actually stay there for a year or more\nOf this so it's it's slowed to release the problem is where are the main routes on your plants it's almost impossible to find out\nOn your plants it's almost impossible to find out\nAnd so if you had a lot of top soil and that that bubble around that fertilizer steak where the permeates and seep and in a week away and and and actually fertilize a larger area volume of soil it would be okay\nBut first of all they're expensive because of the number that you need to drive around a larger tree it's just it's just difficult one doesn't do it you're going to need ten around a big Arizona cypress are big spruce or a big maple you didn't need more\n... and then where do you play some you'd be better off crushing that thing up\nAnd sprinkling that underneath the canopy or the drip line of that that tree or that shrub than you would the drive in the ground because at least then to that granular that your ground up what would slowly permeate breakdown go to the soil the plant will pick it up and you've got the entire\nA tire radius or underneath that drip line fertilized properly\nThat's called a synthetic fertilizer these are chemical based up petroleum based typically Kim of fertilizers Scots and somebody's or does these these brand names or Arizona\nThere's several of them that are chemically based there they're they're made from petroleum your sprinkle those things around basically\nThey released when water had some go underground and then for life to plant that would be better than a bike 'cause at least you know where it's going to go the negative they released too fast so within a month\nAll that fertilizers pretty much been released with the reins gone into the soil\nAnd sometimes it's in a form of the plant can receive sometimes it's not so ammonium ... sulfate is better in the summer ammonium nitrate are better than the winter so sometimes plants can pick up a boy I didn't want to go this deep into fertilizers but basically it's temperature related when it's cool\nThe plants can pick up certain kinds of food and they can't their summer foods so it's kind of like a burgers and dogs that's for fourth of July weekend\nBut I ain't going to have that outside of the yard when it's a you know twenty degrees out I'm going to have taken potatoes or chicken soup\nAnd so really that's the benefit of an organic fertilizer or all natural so we make of I made a fertilizer years and years ago ... huge following go all purpose planted not a very original name but it's seven for for all natural the main ingredients are\nCaught in the seat meal which lowers the ph at the nitrogen source vertical into it is to put a bag it's got kind of an earthy smell it's ... it's just easier to spread but smells are the because of those cuts the meal and the\nAnd the bird wanna sulfur iron some other stuff so that's the same greedy it as those organics break down they break down much slower over a very long period of time typically about three months\nSo it's not releasing all the food at once and so the plant can pick up more of that food then let's say an organic would just release all at once is picking up parts of it the rest of it is flushed away and gone that's synthetic an organic to plant can pick up virtually all of the fertilizer\nAnd use it so you get less waste ... longer a feeding then you would a synthetic I highly recommend using organic organic granular fertilizers for most of your plants landscape it's kinda like\nJust like an antibiotic I mean it's going to make the plant hearty healthy it's like chicken soup for the soul bats what organic fertilizer is set in the in the fall of the year if you've not done that I cannot emphasize\nThis enough the benefits for the mountains and it's because you folks in the mid west you poor folks\nFrom the mid west you just don't you eight foot of topsoil you no longer have\nWe've got eight millimeters if any topsoil and your landscape and then we we put the fabric over top of the soil and then we put rock on it to make sure no organics ever get down into the soil again\nYou're going to have to fertilize more often up in the mountains of Arizona just because our soils we just don't have a lot of top soil\nSo you need that's where the nutrients are held you have to fertilize it more often so I suggest to three times a year minimum four times if you if you have a lot of evergreens\nUh it'd be Easter did you think holidays Easter fourth of July and Halloween that's when you fertilize New Years for lots of Colorado spruce theater cedars pines and then\nUh I Would say for your your native evergreens they would greatly benefit from fertilizing with an all purpose plant food and\nIt was just a coil redwoods right oh right and I think a lot of people don't even think about 'em but they're another tree that has very susceptible to over water yeah that's true so it was a plan to get rid of it and then to collect it and watch it grow [laughter] don't neglect it would yeah [laughter]\nBut don't make likes it too will yeah [laughter] so it is a good time to come look for if you're thinking about living tree for Christmas maybe um I Would say don't wait too long because I think they're going to go fast this year\nYeah I think were infected team is going to put together a\nLiving Christmas tree kind of package kind of thing you could give to as a gift to someone ... we were selling more living trees and we do cut trees anymore so we saw hundreds of countries of Christmas trees in December will this is the this is the front load for a living trees living Christmas trees evergreens\nNow so it's a good time you can pick up the best one or you can add so yeah that's good [noise] generally Selena end to the mountain

northern Arizona is especially of Prescott we kept the most interesting people that live here and they come in they shop plants and you get to talk and tell me oh\nThat's a great story we have to capture that on there and so I've got two gentleman a John Murphy and Daniel Blake who are\nLocals there here don't want us there kept its great garden\nVision great garden projects going and I thought you would take an interest in that as well so welcome John welcome Daniel glad you're here in the studio thanks for having us I guess so so now this is the make one hundred healthy foundation now that caught my year in a in a time when\nYou're jalapeno peppers are coming out of Mexico with ... all over 'em and then you put them into Safeway or\nFries or cause wherever and they can kill you and this happened two or three times a year\nThis is becoming a problem ... massive agriculture your goal is\nBringing local are absolutely we want people to bring back the art of backyard gardening mogul gardening and why it's so important to get your nutrition from food that you can control it starts really not just the luxury anymore and the whole idea of backyard gardening\nWas a big thing back in World War two victory gardens were patriotic duty buzz right went away and now we have forty percent obesity so or make one hundred healthy foundation mission\nIs to help fellow Americans grow one million organic vegetable gardens over the next five years and we're kicking off right here in ... at right here a lot of us who have been these things don't have usually this New York city or Chicago or someplace\nSo now you've also got so so they make one hundred healthy foundation has got this goal but then you partnered up\nWith Daniel Blake which is an old friend we've been going back decades I Know I Know he's a gardener and I know Daniel you have traveled\nThe world helping people farm better smarter for me in third world countries that's been your passion now you're back home and your partner with John you're going to share that expertise with is how does that partnership work\nWell Ken uh when I got the opportunity to leave the country was always because there was a great need there were children that were sick and they needed to have better food so I had an opportunity to go down and teach now I Want to do it here\nLocal so that's perfect so now you were to set up gardens\nAnd then you're going to bring expertise that'd be like you even smarter than I Am as far as gardening or you can make things he could make the microphone restricted to put it in the dirt\nYou're going to health over here and help us to start growing her own foods here here locally that try wanting to do that a little gardener backyard garden yeah so how does what give us tease me what what's what's something that maybe we can do in our own backyards list are\nOver ... king men or fly could could use right now there would maybe make their game their guard game a little better well\nCan I get a closer to the soil and I started digging the soil with a digging fork and I start adding organic matter to it and gypsum and other minerals to make it alive\nSo what kind of organic struck horse manure use chicken coop used gypsum or fertilizer worth what how what are you dig in would that fork and what happens when you hit a Boulder a dig around moving [laughter]\nSo we're just shared earlier with ... with the audience we just bought a Seventy pound hammer for the for the planting truck because the rocks are becoming their like growing or the where people are building are on ... more and more seems like there's less soil there it's hard to grow things without the soil\nWhile I Would have had a gypsum is important because uh all the nutrients piggyback onto the gypsum and to the calcium to get into the plants they got to have the calcium and now that I write form of calcium for Arizona soils and then I add organic matter and then I started adding a nitrogen and phosphorus potassium\nAnd I work that's why I get close to it I ... I saw\nThis square foot gardening or is this row gardening or how would you prefer if you want to maximize let's see I've got a backyard\nAnd I'm only going to have a hundred square feet of ten by ten area raised bed goes up I don't have any other soil elsewhere so I made it out of tempers are block or whatever how ... how would you what would be the formula to make that go\nForeign were not formula I well let's just say is him set would not want to use a native soil 'cause that's not good stuff\nThat's true some of it isn't very good but then some of it is so different parts of press going to have clay and most people don't like to dig and clay\nParts of Prescott have clay and most people don't like to dig and clay clay holds your nutrient veteran hold your water longer true so I got to do there is admired ... matter to it and that kind of makes a sweet and healthy\nGotcha and what's your favorite plant grow what's the most let's see your third world country you're helping wherever you helped grow or help third world community is\nEat better Mexico believes a nurse and Africa gotcha oh okay so to countenance looks pretty good and a growing part of the sudden now you're going to third this is not there were there were third world but\nYou're here in America helping us grow smarter that's right what was the main crops but they like to grow their\nTo rice and beans or or what are they mainly doing they grew every vegetable you can imagine that ... absolutely gotcha okay not just tomatoes yeah or I was thinking peppers or something like that there's a spicy pepper they love and Mexico ...\nSo we've got an event foundation coming up there and you're going to share some of these tidbits of of what do we need to to to do\nTo grow better will tell us about the

Vinci well radio has always I Am your humble hosting servants Darren Jay\n... senior I Am the owner and founder of Vinci wealthy retirement planning an investment advisory firm located right here in Prescott\nThank you so much for tuning in once again I truly do appreciate you it's Saturday new you know what that means are you ready if you're ready to raise your hand and say I'm ready yes we are going to blow up some islands today yes we are going to challenge your thinking\nOn investing and retirement planning yes\nThe opinions on this program are strong certainly strong enough to challenge the status quo and may be dare I say\nSo strong that they may even be old fend sieve let's get started and want to remind each and every one of the out there that you can catch previous\nVersions previous episodes of the radio program on the Web site at da Vinci wealth dot com that's da Vinci as in Leonardo wealth as in your money\nJust click on the radio button in the upper right hand corner and that will link it to all of the radio page where you can see the past\nFive six eight ten different I'm a previous episodes of their online at ... dot com I Am so excited to de\nBoys and girls ladies and gentlemen because we have\nLocal attorney Mike men love joining us in the studio Mike good afternoon sir that furniture and thanks for having me on my pleasure so Mike is an estate planning attorney with the practice in Prescott valley\nThis time of year as we approach the holidays people start bumping into family members and perhaps some estate planning concerns\nBegin to emerge so I thought it'd be a good idea to have my ... you're talking about some terminology\nYou'd have Mike ... you're talking about\nSome terminology some tools to tip some strategies cetera\nSo um we're just going to roll through some questions that we've got that I Do I get all the time from clients added Vinci well fair enough might there okay All right so here's one always yet\nUm if I have beneficiaries named on bank accounts on investment accounts on real estate even why would someone need to trust\nThat the question that I get off into there and and um [noise]\nUsually what I can sort of my clients is is um I counsel with them about their family dynamics so why would you need a trust to trust would be beneficial for a family circumstances where you'd want to control that wealth\n... beyond just an outright distribution so if there's anything in the family or whether that's creditors or a special needs circumstance or any situation at all or you feel that it would not be in your beneficiaries best interest\nTo receive an outright distribution that's where we need to have a management tool that management tools called the trust and we can draft the trust to fit whatever circumstance your family has\nOkay so that's something that people often don't think about they just think about how do I get my ass it directly from point a to point B but want to point B is not a safe place right okay so you mentioned creditors so how can the trust help protect against creditors\nGetting that as a ... as the assets transfer\nSo that's a that's an excellent excellent question and\nThere's a misconception about the the typical quote unquote family living trust that is um Ninety nine percent of what people have so that doesn't protect against creditors for the people that create the trust but the beneficiaries who received the trust that sets\nThat protects against I'm against the creditors going after ... and yuck attaching to those assets okay\nSo creditors is one way that we won't want one thing I Want to protect against let's say the beneficiary is maybe not so good at managing money or had some other issues in Prescott we have a lot of folks that have issues they all know what I'm Talking about right\nSo that the truck is a good tool to manage that risk as well [noise] yeah essentially\nWith creditors or the bad money management or even the um the beneficiary with some kind of special needs\nThe trustee the trucks is drafted so the trustee has discretion to withhold or restrict funds when it's in the best interest of of the beneficiary\nOr are you talking about inserting some specific language into what we call it standard trucks and then\nIt standard language for all of our trust 'em because we never know in those circumstances are gonna rise we don't know um is a benefit you get sued and there's a law suit and a critter coming after and we don't know that so we inserted into all of our trust 'em [noise]\nAnd it definitely if there is a known circumstantial plan for it but\nExcellent okay [noise] um so then what happens if you don't have a wheel or a trust\nSo if you don't have the will or trust you go through the [noise] the ... the four letter word probate than um everybody thinks is the worst thing in the world and uh that's a little bit of misconception but it's a it's a longer more expensive process okay so\nLonger meaning months years what's appropriate typically looking like these days\nSo there's no um but there's litigation nobody's fighting over any of the\nAny of the assets um then I can get through you probably plan about a year or you might be a little bit less than that and then there can be circumstance or it could be less than that but um this is the the timelines that are set up with through statutes say state laws\nUm are are your plan on about a year okay\nSo I often hear from clients well they are and I have a well so I don't need to talk to them I ... I don't need to worry about its trusting I already have a will and correct me if I'm wrong but we'll is really a one way ticket to probate court correct that's all it's going to do\nNow and we'll just go through ... okay now they guide probate so that you can point the executor Z I'm and named the beneficiaries that you want but it's still go through pro\nI'm Darren ... they tend to be the wealth radio were here every Saturday at twelve noon thank you so much for tuning in we are visiting with local estate planning attorney Mike men love\nMy can be reached at nine to eight seven seven to five for nine forty nine to eight seven seven to five for nine for you can also contact me there and I mean she wealth\nNine to eight two three seven three four one one nine to eight two three seven three four one one and we can get you all of my contact information as well we're going to get that out to a few more times\nDuring the radio program here today so a Mike we can we kind of jumped ahead a little bit and we talked about pro made a little bit and we were obviously trying to avoid probate but what exactly is probate\nProbate it is the courts process of transferring property I'm upon somebody to death so if there is NO NAME beneficiary\nUm then the transfer of that property either we have to determine who the rightful owner is in that process is probate OK okay from the old England so\nRight so expensive and time consuming okay All right so\nYou know I have clients that come in and we have beneficiaries named on all the assets whether they're IRAs or individual counts with transfers on death I always tell them you should still have a trust\nBecause it's not about when I say yeah I mean to me clarify the trust is not necessarily about who gets the assets after you passed but rather the trust can act\nOn\nWishes desires care et cetera while someone is still alive but perhaps incapacitated either cognitively or physically that's why I think everybody should have\nA living trust her family trust whatever terminology and he is not to determine who gets the assets that's easy to do but really it's about while they're still living can you tell us about why that's so important and what actually a trust does\nTo protect the grant or while they're still alive so\nThe D. C. or after the person dies correct so they have no authority or power prior to okay if you think about it on a timeline bases\nPowers of attorney or while you're living when you die than the executor takes over after they'd been appointed and\nUm the truck the kind of can merge trustee I'm both right okay but typically the truck the doesn't have health care powers so they don't have those powers to um to make health care decisions and made an agent on health care base it's right in with HIPAA laws they won't even get information yeah okay um\nAnd there's also more usually there's broader powers to financial power of attorney the nerve trustee okay so trust the limited to the Trump assets so is your bank accounts are in a trust\nAnd then in the mail it already has no way to manage hours of attorney usually they're brought up enough to cover all of those\nOkay so someone comes in your office Mike are you on the radio program I Want to talk to you but I Want to get this trust trust would include [noise] so package for\nExample in a package would include I mean if it's appropriate for the client or what I Need than it would include the trust will only call to pour over will um and then the financial power of attorney medical power attorney meant to power of attorney all your powers of attorney and then also living will or health care directive\nOkay so you mentioned poor over will and and just want to just sort of estate planning one on one here tell us what pore over will means and what it does it\nAnd what it does is it the rather than a will that I'm identify specific beneficiaries and the um half of my state goes to Johnny and half of my state goes to Jean Schmidt says everything in my eyes that goes to the trust so when you have a trust and poor it's a safety net and it pours it back into the trust\nSo anything is not specifically mentioned in the trust basically this poor will catch it like a safety net and says that should go into the trust to follow the trust instructions\nSo it's a truck isn't funded properly and I see you know fairly often right there's not assets you know the trust is set up an established and it's awesome but the assets were properly put into the trust\nThen those ads will go through probate the will catches that and dumps it so that it will be administered through ... you know the terms of the truck right okay\nAll right and then um you mentioned mental power of attorney\nAnd that in Arizona I'm there are specific to the mental\nUm agent there has to be specific language that you are pointing a agent to make a mental health care decision so a broad general medical um appointment of an agent um there has to be specific language that you're pointing that\nYour agent to make mental health care decisions as well\nOkay fair enough I'm Darren below this is Devinsky wealth radio were here every Saturday at noon right here on cake you and thanks so much for tuning in we're visiting today with local estate planning attorney\nMike men love ... men love lie in Prescott valley\nYou can get a hold of Mike asking any questions you might have scheduled appointment nine to eight seven seven to\nFive for nine for that to nine to eight seven seven to five for nine for the website is Menlo law\nDot com and of course if you're driving I Want you to stop and write that down and want you to be careful out there you can always give us a jingle at Devinsky wealth nine to eight two three seven three four one one or online at Devinsky wealth dot com and we can get you might contact information as\nWell All right so um this is something that I come across often because most of our clients here in Prescott are are you at or near retirement are already retired but what about young people\nHow do how would a young person either a do you think they need to trust why would it be important for a young family for example to have trust in place\nIn my opinion as a young a\nAs a young father on kids I think\nThat ah estate planning or will or trust is just as important for younger families of those for the retire in their retirees who has a bunch of wealth um so it's not necessarily about wealth it's about protecting protecting your family um and that's really what we're doing with the state Senate\nPlanning anyway as we're protecting them\nSo if you don't have a wheel or a trust and you're a you're we're married and you have children I'm upon you you're passing you and your wife's passing if there was an accident or something happens and you have minor children\nGoing to be the guardianship proceeding and somebody has to petition to take care of the kids and that could create contention between you know two sides of the family parents for example yeah grandparents from one side say no and that's it you know they got to go\nTo court and they got to lay out of money for attorneys' fees and they got a deal is with the courts and what happened to the kids while that's in them\nBut here's the biggest thing is that the the kids will be taken care of they'll go into a temporary situation but the kids have\nJust lost their parents ... they've they've gone through an emotional trauma and now you have two sides of the family fighting over who's going to take care of all\n... and to me\nI don't want that like I don't want my kids go through a man I don't know what I'm going to go out on my life's gonna leave fry a you know leave the earth and so if if I can plan as much as possible to avoid that situation then I'm going to do it and you it when the will and trust you point those people so you make that decision ahead of time\nAnd then you know genie\nA crazy and kids don't like or I don't want her coming in China because you know maybe there's money or something involved we're going to point the people that we use\nThere's money or something involved we're going to point the people that we fit that our kids know that will fit their you know their dynamic ... best and that's why it's really just planning for the children\nRight amen amen another reason is is is a financial part is I don't want my kids to receive\nThe large lump sum when they're
