there's been an enormous amount of attention and always properly so about women\nAnd always properly so about women and women being able to come forward and come forth and speak truth and be able to come out and make accusations and be heard and to be believed if their stories stand up to scrutiny right it's a big gift a lot of people forget that oh believe all women guess what no\nSo let's take all stories at face value and see what we think of them and there's been a lot of attention very properly so about women and accusations and et cetera et cetera\nWell some folks have dared to step forward a lot of them have been women who said what about my husband is the next what about my son is somebody going to sabotage Iran's reputation ... was a an sourced uncorroborated charge you know from from the orbit of Jupiter\nAnd President Trump had a little something to say about that said that this is I'm a scary time for guys you're the president\nSo very scary time for young men in

have to be a woman as everybody say somebody could accuse you of something\n[noise] you're automatically guilty of this route you are truly guilty until proven innocent that's one of the very very bad
