remarkable college they're not asking for money they just want you to know about their courses in about them prime is an about their students and so on Prager for Hillsdale\nAnyway back to you professor and we're talking about his book in defense of Andrew Jackson\nSee what we're not allowed any longer and that this is I I lay totally at the feet of the left we're not allowed to have any moral\nNuances it's every body basically who lived before us was uh in various states of sin\nAnd the left today is the purest of the humans that has ever left that is really how they look at themselves I promise you folks I'm not in any way exaggerating and so all of these ... the founders were were were worthless because they had slaves\nAnd uh you just go down as a roster\nBut the the Indian issue was a very very complex one and there were there were terrible things done to Indians Indians have terrible things to others including blacks who may enslaved including other Indians who may and slave and torture was for some tribes routine\nSo it's so there's no is no easy answer to this problem Andrew Jackson made his reputation aside from the war of Eighteen twelve in fighting a ... Indians and uh he adopted an Indian child now so I just am reviewing while we\nAnd the Indian child now so I just reviewing what we've said do you recall the point that you were making ... by move on\nYou know actually things didn't answer that I Would love to jump right back in the court was and of course I I'm I understand ready to go to commercial but the point I wanted to make was that\nAt the time Jackson was actually considered as a moderate on the issue of American indian some people may have been really\nReally went after him for being as they would have called it an American Indian River and the reason was because as president as he's really cutting costs cutting the budget which he did very effectively she also was laying out tons of money for the removal of the union for resettlement west\nThere were a lot of people who thought why is Jackson spending money of white people so that read people could settle in these great areas on the great plains\nI it was really sought after land\nSo Jackson at the time so different from the day and as you say we have no moral do what we left at the at the time it was a really complicated issue and chats and was very worried without question was worried that the whites and blacks would have very very high procreate a birth rate\nThat they were just going to destroy the Indian culture simply by surrounding them and out populating them so removal to the western territories was a way to actually protect the Indian cultures that we used to be thought now the again the execution of it was horrible\nBut his intention I think was generally a good one\nThat that's fascinating and that's one of the book is an important book or you don't normally defend him on the Indian issue you have a general defense of Andrew Jackson\nYou know it's one of the things I found so I think we all know that and it's true that Jackson was an incredibly violent and there's just no way around that in every way he was but he also had really certain rules so that violence never ever could be applied to women or children\nThat was the same actually for blacks as well as for Indians and why\nDid the prospect strangely enough thought or beautiful enough yet it's strange interesting respected women a very deep respect to the point actually he's almost warship bullet times anti traits again Indian women as well as black one white wearing\nVery very well but the other thing I found about him so he's got this violence but he's got this ethic that's really interesting\nBut I also found that has been you know counter so many current politicians\nThe guy was just unbelievably honest in everything he did\nAnd then I think he would've killed his soul to have done something that would have been misleading or dishonest that that's how much of a stickler he was about living out this deep deep profound honesty and his integrity it's really quite stunning\nHow did he get the I I I don't really get his a bullet wound\nOh
