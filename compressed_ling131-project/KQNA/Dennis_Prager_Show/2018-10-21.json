people housing lender member FDIC\nThe docket quantity cake do any\nOf them back in the ... bureau show turned out that Elizabeth Warren the senator from Massachusetts not Native American but she kept claiming she was three years well why didn't you just stop blaming it and then apologized for having done so like five years ago there are a couple of good reasons for nothing there was a story that came out and tell her purse of it here in the Boston Globe\nAnd it just got a jury is issue for Elizabeth Warren was Senator Warren actually a professor at Harvard law because she clean Native American ancestry in other words machine granted special status that sort of gave her an upper hand when it came to her job and University of Pennsylvania\nOr at Harvard law school was more article from the Boston Globe ended up for research found that vote at Harvard said that her Native American planes had nothing to do with any of that that her Native American claims had nothing to do with our actual ability\nTo be granted professorship at Harvard law school\nThey interviewed some like thirty one professor many of them were on the emissions many coming from I Know people like Charles Fried who I have a contract and didn't know when we hire or it had nothing to do\nWith her climbing Native American ancestry in fact we didn't even know that it's time we assume she was white and the internal documents suggested that University of Pennsylvania treated her as a white person and taught at Harvard law school until it became beneficial for them to claim\nThat you as a minority heritage for purposes of their diversity curriculum that they had to claim that they had a certain number of diverse professors and so they sort of take it and said that she was Native American but that doesn't mean she got her job\nBased on Native American Native American claims\nWhy would that said why didn't Elizabeth Warren a month and a half ago simply say look\nI was told by my family members that I had Cherokee after my mom used to tell me that my uncle and aunt used to tell me that and because of that\nI simply assume that they're right on with him to my relatives were lying to me those are the story that I was growing up I guess that was wrong and so I never should have done any of that stuff but\nIt didn't have any impact on my actual career trajectory that career trajectory was going to be great no matter what it had nothing to do with those claims so I Apologize Native Americans are having taken seriously the stories my family without checking them\nBut with that said to claim that I was a beneficiary of some sort of affirmative action and simply untrue\nBut why don't you do that well there are two reasons you didn't do that and both of them are telling really number one she figure that she couldn't get away with pretty much anything because the media would cover for her\nWhich the media didn't yesterday there were headlines in the Daily Beast saying Elizabeth Warren proves Native American ancestry there was a headline over at CNN Elizabeth Warren provide solid evidence of Native American ancestry\nSo she will generally threw out a study that church was not Native American and counted on the media the thing that the study showed you would actually Native American\nAnd then it all began to fall apart because people can read and that meant that her narrative began to collapse in on her\nSo she thought she can get away with it because the media would cover for her and why not why wouldn't you think that I mean to me I have covered for the fact that they don't work in Texas with being treated as an Obama at Kennedy yet new young figure\nThat that guy was involved in a DUI when he was twenty six then bought him crossing over a median line smashing a truck and then trying to sleep on the scene and they're still counting and is the big new next democratic thing now what can I somebody had my license suspended for driving too fast\nAnd obvious about that I was not driving drunk and I didn't crash into anybody it was on an empty freeway\nThey don't ... I was driving drunk and hit a diet and then tried to leave the scene while he was drunk and the media have basically said that's a big nothing and the the media that tend to George W. Bush and the wind back in the Nineteen seventies disqualified him in two thousand for money for the presidency like two weeks before the election\nDon't own horn had good cause to think that the media we're going to cover her no matter what\nThe media cover Democrats the way they called the Republican half of the candidates for Congress and the election cycle would be told they would be the ... bombing in as a New Jersey would be done\nIn the ... honestly he'd be gone\nClaire McCaskill in Missouri would be done course in Santa Monica in Arizona would be just host but they're not because only for like every other Democrat knows that there is a great\nAs a buffer zone\nThat an established for democratic candidate and so she can simply claim Native American ancestry without any group and the media will continue to cover for her as much as humanly possible right and then it'll just continue to cover for her endlessly\nThat's the reason number one that Elizabeth Warren felt comfortable releasing a study to actually contradicted her main narrative line coming up\nThe second reason though wasn't before and self in it that that needs to continue cleaning Native American ancestry even though she was about some relief aid has seven frightening she had no Native American ancestry we'll talk about it as an engineer\nHe's not going to do any of that so that the bad story for Democrats meaning meanwhile\nClaire McCaskill is running a very tight race in Missouri and James O'Keefe me kind of ...\nAnd James O'Keefe me kind of\nLike he's going to shock journalists over a project baritone he's on some good work before he sent his workers in the sense from his folks into Claire McCaskill's office and he got Claire McCaskill people to acknowledge that she is campaigning parts in the right of where she actually is on the issue here some of what that sounded like\nBecause she does their fair [noise]\nBecause I wanted to say things like this to my own mother\nWere switches [laughter]\nI'm like oh gosh [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nYou can run\nInto she's basically been sending about her own positions so Claire McCaskill in trouble in Missouri\nOr some kind of just three weeks ago was leading mark MacPhail in the Arizona Senate race and now it turns out\nThat all of her path to come out in my case so Kirsten Sinema in the Democratic nominee in Arizona according to the Washington Examiner\nShe apparently takes sorcery very seriously email detained by the Washington Examiner show cinema was invited say prominent come in a feminist which is in

that year and a apparently she talked about singing and spiraling into pagan circle only five rose from the police line\nI and then the police arrested everybody jumps up and just doing humans work on

was such a good news cycle\nThe economy was doing great then then new job numbers are just terrific\nWe have the highest federal collection of income taxes in history and twenty Eighteen\nSo if you if you just look at the numbers we're collecting more income taxes than ever before it even though we have lower income tax rate than we did last year why because supply side economics works when the economy grows and the government actually takes in more taxes and if the economy is stagnant and we have higher tax rate the economy has been going great guns under President trouble getting the

from India\nLike actual people from India have more Native American blood that Elizabeth Warren ... it's an amazing thing\nAnd with that said President Trump decides to step on himself with Stormy Daniels and calling people course fate miss is the only line of attack that Democrats have it's just a tax on President Trump and so this is what they're ratcheting up down people's he was looking at a bad Senate map right now\nShe's trying to suggest that President Trump is now in the pay of the Saudis that the reason that President Trump hasn't been harsher on the Saudi Government with regard to the murder of Jamal ... an American resident who was a critic of the Saudi regime and also than in Muslim Brotherhood\nShe sends a reason from hasn't been harshest 'cause maybe he's being paid off by

adventure you get to make up your own story here that the American dream the American dream is people who are coming from across the the place they did not know to an environment that we're not used to\nAnd building lives for their families and creating prosperity from the ground up\nThe American story is people crossing the Appalachians into wilderness and they did not know places that had not been ...\nGoing to areas where they had no allies setting down roads and trying to build towns in civilization\nThat the American story the American story is poor folks who have an idea and go find funding for that idea and then build that idea in some of the great companies in American history\nThat the American dream the American dream is never you're here therefore we give you think that was never the American idea coming up the big problem\nWith this new vision of America as a place where you ... just kept saying that it takes away the truth the American ideal to the African American personality that have been a central element of America has the greatest country on earth will talk about that in just a second year of\nAnd then we say okay well what can we do to provide that when what can we do to get all the obstacles out of their way what can we do to remove the barriers\nThat's being there in a way it is not the American way it wasn't you know in a comfortable to stretch your wings in any difficulty at home and maybe hard any of that\nIt's somewhere just going to make sure you know you never have to\nBuy when we're going to Cato you we're going to make sure they are

to intervene your children you can't innovate your communities and you can't intervene our country on the basis of empathy alone and that is the best case interpretation of want to get the Democrats are doing here\nThe worst case interpretation and something much more cynical purpose for innovation I'm an entire sector of the population specifically to gain votes and thereby political power\nAnd after you look at like Detroit it's hard to imagine that's not what's been going on there for decades because a failure of this sort of of thinking is evident in major cities and counties across the United states\nAnd he actually wants to\nReinvigorate the American spirit we're going to have to teach people the same watching the gods taught Abraham at the very beginning of the Bible\nI get up

become better to tell the world becomes better trained becomes better as well you have a cool stuff\nIt's white culture has become better because they experience and bounce off of other cultures\nAnd this notion that we can hunker down now because we've reached paradise and all we have to do is help her down and live in and redistribute what's in our backpacks those backpacks are going to run out ... any of this war okay Joe and jumped the second I Want to talk about this fascinating article in the New York times\nAbout why scientists are are now attempting to avoid actual research out of fear

club dot com slash than\nA dollar shave club dot coms Washburn so there's a fascinating article in the New York times I Want to talk about\nBecause it speaks to the lack of objectivity when it comes to the intersection with politics\nThe article from New York Times is titled why white supremacists are chugging milk\nAnd why geneticists are alarmed and here's what they say which may harm and no one on the agenda of the annual meeting of the American society of human genetics being held in San Diego this week and the topic leading many of its members\nThat are occurring appropriation of the field research in the name of white supremacy sticking your neck out on political issues is difficult to Jennifer Wagner a bioethicist and president of the group's social issues committee\nWho sought to convene a panel on the racist misuse of genetics and found little fraction of the specter of the field ... has passed which includes support for the American eugenics movement lose large for managing editor in light of today's white identity politics they also worry about how new tools that are allowing them to hone in on the genetic basis\nOf hot button traits like intelligence will be misconstrued just that racist ideology is an argument that I have a pretty frequent basis with a friend of mine Jane ... box or Jane is black and ... and I think rightly has great sensitivity and the British upgrade sensitivity but I think Jane would suggest that her background\nContributes insensitivity on with regard to the rape has passed of the United states and the and the racist association between politics and bad science and so this has led to some serious conversations between the two of us\nAbout political correctness about whether in fact there is an appropriate time to talk\nAbout I ... for example or standardized testing for example or about that natural differences between men and women\nLike when you talk about biology without being condemned and sexist or racist he's a real issues that we happen to Scott and take on head on unfortunately the scientific community has decided to quash a lot of actual science because they're afraid that people who are racist or going to take that science out of context\nAnd then use that to Columbus admission and minority group and that's basically what this New York times articles about says in recent months some scientists have spotted distortions of their own academic papers in far right Internet forums others have fielded confused where he's about Clinton White superiority\nWrapped in the jargon of human genetics misconceptions about how genes factor into America's stark racial disparities\nHave surface and the nation's increasingly heated arguments over school achievement gap immigration and policing instead of long discounted proxies like school circumference and family pedigrees according to experts you track the far right today's proponents of racial hierarchy are making their case by in misinterpreting research on the human genome itself and debate that have been largely limited\nTo ivory tower forum that scientists whose job is to mind you in the humanities genetic variation\nIn a collective good are grappling with how to respond and here's a ... put out the science and then defend that science that's the way to respond all the instead the scientists afraid that there are scientists ones me misappropriated misinterpreted or used for bad reasons\nThey have decided that they are going to simply squash all this discussion internally\nJohn of Emory University of Chicago evolutionary biologists studying human genetic diversity an easier in a society where diversity is clearly value and celebrated right now that is very much on my mind once my doctor November his folded into his recent talks to fix a group of white nationalist trucking milk\nAt a two thousand Seventeen gathering to draw attention to a genetic trait known to be more common and white people than others the ability to digest lactose as adults but also showed the social media posts\nFrom an account and to called entered the milk zone with a map lifted from a scientific journal article on the trade to evolutionary history and most of the world the article explains the gene that allows for the digestion of lactose\nSwitches off after childhood but with the arrival in the first cattle herders and Europe some five thousand years ago a chance mutation that left to turn on provided enough of nutritional led up to nearly all of those who survived eventually carried it\nAnd then the post show this habit of hate speech urging individuals' an African ancestry to leave America\nSaying if you can drink milk you have to go back well I mean ... and they're idiots in one of the great ironies of of white supremacist into the stupidest people on the planet they're constantly talking about white people are superior and they're just dumb ass it as one of the things that's so funny it's like if they're going to proclaim white superiority\nAnd you really should send your best is I'm In a commentary that accompany the paper in the journal genetics documentary warn that research is wrapped in numerous habits that are likely to get lost in translation because\nPeople are flaunting DNA ancestry tests indicating exclusively European heritage\nBut the problem here is that we actually have to look at what science does have to say because it is a con founding factor when you look at attributing racism to America so take for example\nRacial disparities in education so there's a lot of talk these days about affirmative action and whether people are performing at certain levels eligible to get them into college\nAnd me to judge in is that it is historic American racism that has led to that has led to the education gap in American higher education system in alternative would be that the test scores do not wind up equally among various ethnic groups and that's true not just with regard to black and white it's not too with regard to white and Asian white people score\nLower on the SATs and Asian people do as a general matter in the United states how much of that is genetic how much of that happens to be environmental we don't actually know the answer to that that's a hotly fraud question in science but suggesting that racism is to blame for everything without looking at other confounding factors like for example test scores\nIs a mistake and leads us to the wrong outcomes and leaders to the wrong measures due to deal with those outcomes\nGenetics is not the answer to all of these disparities but neither is racism\nNow these are questions we have to be very careful that because obviously you don't want to give 'em material to people who are suggesting that people some people are near inherently\nWorse or more evil or more violence or stupid or because of the color of their skin genetics doesn't line up that way but\nYou also have to look at questions of science because you're a scientist\nSo it it is and it's fascinating to watch this debate play out in real time\nSo there there are doctors who have organized meetings and social scientists and it's got the social implications\nWhoever the organized meetings and social scientists in the social implications of the field newest tool David Nelson a Baylor College of medical geneticists is president of the human genetics and society and they will not stay completely quite on the issue and there's no genetic evidence to support any racist ideology\nWhich is true because of racism is a moral view and genetics and they tend to view and scientific racism in the USA Science in order to be racist and it's not the use of science in order to pursue good and\nSo it it here silencing research because you're afraid of how people are going to use that research and I would think they are misusing science and we need to have some very hard conversations about actual science actual problems natural solutions without falling prey to the idea because bad people are going to mention the information we have to wash the information at all okay\nComing up a penny of actresses
