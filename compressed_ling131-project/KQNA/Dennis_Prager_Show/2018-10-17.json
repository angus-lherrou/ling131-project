got married we both recently joined the army and we were active duty soldiers and I'm Ari uh we were heading off to Colorado we were stationed in Colorado so\nI ended up getting married um and then we just had a nice little dinner found the cheapest a hotel we could in Chicago\nStay the night together um and then a ...\nA couple of days later a packed up the car and drove to Colorado to start a new life now being that we were both I'm active duty military we for the first thirty six months of the first three years of marriage we were together physically together approximately Eighteen months at that time you know\nWhat I ah my point your for your listeners that\nWe principally are are pretty frugal people and when I look back on our on our uh we brought up this topic and I applied my own um experiences of a honeymoon um\nI'm experienced a of a honeymoon um\nYeah but ... you didn't have a whole lot honeymoon right that's the point I\n... it's basically yes because we couldn't afford it\nRight you didn't was yellow cake so and so on\nYeah go on a stay at the point being is that down ... ... that was a foundational principles and our relationship is we didn't we don't live outside of our means that we felt that if we had this\n... tone a county anybody who stayed the night of his marriage at the cheapest hotel in Chicago is frugal I got that\nWell it was that I cast for all of our I fly ferret out it was a cat up for us All right but it all serious mission you are you you're actually your story which I thought\nWould actually negate my ... my provisional theory actually sustains it is that there really is no relationship between the honeymoon and and marriage it it it it might be good at might not be good I mean you're another example of no honeymoon great marriage\nRight well we we also had planned that even though we discuss today well ah you know where we can afford it and the time is right well we'll take a hunting within a couple of years ago we

enjoyed the the goofy net you know I I was worried about ...\n[laughter] I think he was half the time why am I here yet and I'm like well let's get your book Donald drain the swamp by Eric ... is the illustrator\nNot only is he the illustrator but I wrote it with him Tim ragweed I or creative partners we've done a number of books together people look it up online some of the most beautiful illustrations you've ever seen or his books but when I\nReally was thinking about who do I vote he's the guy that convinced me to take Trump's seriously he said this guy is a folk hero he's an American folk hero and that's okay\nHe's an American folk hero and that's what gave me the idea to write the book Donald drained the swamp I said he's a larger than life figure I Need to write a kids' book or a or I mean this is the kids but but it's also humor book for adults in other words adults are going to find humor in this children's book\nThat kids aren't going to find I mean obviously there's a there's a little blue bird that tweets\nAre there is a there's somebody you know the first swamp creature is lobbyists or us I mean kids are not going to get that and uh and then there's another swamp creature that looks a heck of a lot\nLike a crying Chuck\nI don't know if you've heard of crying truck but he's a senator for yeah I'm sure there are there that is George\nAnd then there's the the the biggest bad a swamp creature of them all the Georgia saw us and you know adults will get that but kids I think I'm part of this book really is that I think we\nWho have supported this president we need to have some fun we need to celebrate and we need to have something a narrative that's a positive narrative about what's going on we don't need to be in the weeds every day with all the details and everything we need to just say something good is happening in America and by the way\nMost people understand that we're being reconnected to our government were never supposed to have a big bloated\nBureaucracy we're supposed to be a free people who govern ourselves\nThat's what this big as the book is all about and I really think it's important that we remind ourselves of that and we teach our kids what that is and so this is a fable about American style self government\nFeaturing a caveman named Donald and the swamp creatures and all that kind of stuff I mean I have to say it's sweet it's innocent it's not mean spirited so I Hope people\nWill will will use it\nTo teach their kids but also just for adults to have fun I think a lot of adults are going to give this\nTo other adults I Hope conservative adults will give it to a to they're never Trump or friends you know just as a joke or something because it is not mean spirited meant for us all to to laugh

you are in a weather is next to you by Bradshaw family dental ... news timing to well over five\nWant flowering cherry trees I Want great Myrtle trees and they just they just don't perform the cold ... back in the south you know Dallas uh east you can have beautiful but not not here and so we try to get that information out for the mountains of Arizona\nThe best advice I can give you right now is don't give up on gardening it's still going to leave that irrigation on that even though we had a storm a couple of weeks ago you still don't want to be watering them out once a week\nFor established plants these are things that have been in the ground for over a year a couple of years or so or more they've got a fully mature root structure it's it's a new you just planted it two three four six months ago this year\nThen you're probably watering that a couple of times a week now I'm Talking trees and shrubs maybe vines the bigger rooted stuff ... if you're talking about pansies\nYour your kale that new lettuce crop you just put in carrots ad that that's a little different because they're shallower rooted seawater Moammar often but even now I'm On scaling back my watering but I'm not turning it off and continue to nurture\nMy plants this week I've given my some of my plants a hair cut their jets they've grown a lot they've been happy they loved all the moisture urban fertilizing well they're happy they're healthy that color is good\nThey're almost too happy so I've got Eli Agnes up against the houses in under planting they're getting too big so I gave them a quick haircut none of full I didn't really you know like I'm back in half I just the long run or is that gets nip those off I hear a trim you do most of your\nPruning and the dead of winter January February march you wait till things are cold to\nYou don't want to prune too much here this is this is mainly for you desert folks tropical climate areas you folks from Hawaii or for from Kelly California the southern Arizona folks you folks you want to hold off you you are used to pruning your roses back in November when we always do it\nDon't do that here you'll blunder your way to failure\nIf you do that I keep that structure up on those plants as best you can cause that insulate the heart of that plant so if we go really cold and you never know at the mountains are going to deliver can be dry can be wet can be snowstorm after snowstorm could be warm could be it you never know what it's going to be\nBut you can't go wrong by leaving that structure intact so leave that alone then you're prone after the new year after the harshest in wait for a nice break day by by Valentine the middle of February\nThe weather's getting pretty nice at that point yeah we can have some frost yes we can get a snowstorm or two after that but the weather's getting pretty nice you want to be outdoors at that point and that's when you want to start printing things 'cause you print or right before they start a elongated started growing faster budding out\nUh so do late to printing now\nIt was encroaching into the walkway the patios a potato Weiner's going crazy they just needed to be gets crawling all over the patio it needs to be cut back\nAnd so we just trim a little bit I did fertilize before that storm hit a couple of weeks ago I fertilized everything here at the garden center I fertilized every ... at the at the house\nI Want to make sure that food gets down in there some time in October you want to make sure that fertilizer you want to really put a ... a a nutrient rich fertilizer on the ground as the plants root there they're actively Rudy right now as the leaves change they root out through the end of the year\nYou could fertilized and you'll get a chubby or stronger Sater route so they're heartier they hibernate to better\nAnd that's the food they're going to use to foreign the buds for next spring the form new flower buds on your fruit trees new rose McGowan euros is new strawberries new it's going to use that to form a new growth to this is the most important feeding into the years in October\nSo I just took advantage of those are two main things\nThat I've done a and then as my plants give up a so some tomatoes I no longer have a tomato in the ground\nI harvested them all they were down they were kind of they were just big overgrown and the production was there but it wasn't like it was two months ago man I could pick up enough of them\nAre the cucumbers I Can't picture can't eat any more I don't want any more cucumbers is Tara matinee so I just went okay that's enough has put in some kale because I Love juicing Kate Hi love lettuce fresh out of the gardens oh it's so good my mouth just watering thinking about it oh\nMan radishes you can put in now and they'll grow with you just had a little bit of garden space a few seed and all of a sudden you've got this beautiful crop of broccoli for Thanksgiving dinner or Brussels sprouts for Christmas dinner you can have that\nThere's a fine line there but just real sporadic doesn't take a lot of takes every couple of weeks pick a nice day you want some fresh air go broke blood Paul bows auto plants right up definitely\nOkay and\nSo since then was planting moms and other perennials in her raised bed you know she saw some white fat worry me looking things\nDown and you can you put it like that where we [laughter] we have a great deal of perfect actually there you've got grubs they're highly active right now so grubs are high up in the soil and they're actively\nFeeding and they're trying to fatten up before they hibernate they'll go down real deep in the soil and so they live off of roots of plants and so this is extremely serious I mean I Can't put that enough\nYou have an issue and those plants will will definitely suffer will be stressed and could easily die if not corrected so if you're digging around the soil and you see some weight worms those are ... most of our issues\nIn the mountains of Arizona because it's so dry are are the insects go for where the moisture is with the moisture in the soil for it's in the trunks of the trees it's in the structure of the plants so the bugs are in the plant us where we have such problems the bark beetle flooded had ...\nIn the trunks of trees and then grubs in the ground\nAnd so it's really easy to kill them we've got to grab killers called grub killer I mean that's what's going on like a fertilizer water it in ... wipe them out an application will take you through\nYour next spring so once and done kind of thing so they're very important I Would do not just those few moms you just planted I Would do that entire bed\nAnd I might even test they test all just to look for other areas 'cause it's such a problem here they they attack plans by the hundreds and so yes serious grub killer killed scrubs\nAnd they even go in your containers ... was it last year we were had this beautiful\nUm [noise] ... not ... and it was just started looking\nUgly and I'm like what is the problem with that thing and went to go kind of look at it and touched it and it fell out of the pot rude neuro\nRoots yeah so it can happen anywhere pots raised beds trees ... something to\nKeep her eye on their ... beetle larva so the Beatles who's black buildup flow roam around they're laying eggs and things and so the eggs have hatched now and now they're actively grow and these are this year's grubs you're seeing\nAnd so they'll tripled in size before next spring though so they'll they'll eat actively through mid December\nThen they'll go real deep as a ground gets cold to hibernate down there and then they'll come back up and eat your spring roots and then your plants blow over in the wind you wonder what happens or your who grow\nFades sorts looking terrible you pull up no roots left grass or get big brown spots in um those are all grub issues and need to be dealt with

beautiful ranch land we live right on Kirkland creek the kids could roam we are a ten acres surrounded by nothing but ranch we could see no one near our house concerning sometimes because kids would

were right there and so you always have confidence they were\nRight there and so you always have confidence they were they were ... chase a cattle away or but then we had elk and we had the deer tick lots of ... also had mountain lions and bears and everything else\nSo everything you could think of was there a pack rats to squirrels to rabbits to do everything was there and so I learned a few tricks and one I had the deer come in and they were peeling the bark off of\nMy walnut that occur pay all that solves ... let's see what you're seeing show up at the grocery store now all those nuts a great big wallet was that we'd pecans and so the wall that's the the deer took a fancy too and sometimes they'll do this to aspens sometimes I'll do this to any fruit tree\nEspecially apples and pears that's her favorite they'll go in and do rubber antlers on the bark and metal ... peeling\nOff the bark underneath the bark certain trees taste very sweet and so after all that nutrient moisture and taste sweet tastes underneath the bark this was very frustrating\nThis wall that was quite large and I did not watch the dear to kill it or girl it if they peel off the bark too much\nWhat I did and this is not in any book you're not going to see this on any website it is just you and me talking over the airwaves and this one worked in my own back yard to keep the deer off\nI'm going how am I going to ... how am I going to do this what I did is is I took some bird knitting I followed me with us some black plastic Burnett and you know wanting squares you use it to cover fruit trees had it it was right there when\nI Wonder if I loosely wrap this around the trunk staple gun it to the bark\nAnd just let this this netting kind of float around this work where they were eating I Wonder if this would keep 'em off and boy did it ever work\nThey didn't try to touch that thing once after I put that on there I just didn't know what to do this I didn't wrap it real tight just loosely led up to three times around\nWhen around took virtually no netting staple gun it what you think would hurt a tree but trees don't even feel that do their shaved off the raft and they never came back to that
