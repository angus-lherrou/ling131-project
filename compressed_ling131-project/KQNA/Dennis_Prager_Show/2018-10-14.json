well you'd actually have to control government to do any of those things and also to kind of work\nBut that that was among just tapping number two which is that women are suddenly under attack everywhere from everywhere one of the great life it's being perpetrated it's being perpetrated by folks like Valerie Jarrett Valerie Jarrett you'll remember what the top advisor to President Obama and she tweeted it that I think it's some up well the argument being made by felt channel that's close\nTo all of the survivors of sexual assault and women and wonder if they will be believed that they are attacked no there's a growing powerful and moving up support there will always have your back\nWe believe you we will stand with you we will defend you change is coming to the idea here is if you supported Brett Kavanaugh your nor and women\nWho make allegations of sexual assault\n... it's so trends parents and it's really quite vicious in discussing I did not vote for president from in large measure because of his treatment of women\nThere are lots of people are not happy\nWith sexual assault allegation Susan Collins the senator from Maine who came out in favor of broadcasters basically the deciding vote she's been ripped apart for what she had to pay on CNN but there is nothing innately wrong with what you said on CNN here's her explaining that\nWhile she believes something happened to Christine Blasey Ford she just doesn't believe that according to the proponents of the evidence that Brett Kavanaugh was it was the guy that\nI Do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh was her family and so I Do believe that she was assaulted I don't know by home and I'm not certain went but I Do not believe that he was the ... ... ...\nOkay and that prompted Mazie Hirono to come out and say\nHow could Susan Collins doubt how could she was in college that was really funny because I remember that like a week ago literally a week ago there was one in Julie sweating it brought forward by my ... and she cleaned Brett Kavanaugh gang raped her\nOr the he was involved in gang rape you never hear her name any more from the Democrats why don't they believe all women\nDon't they believe that all women ought to be believed or the atlas of whether there's any sort of their Bible or corroborated evidence\nBut Julie ... she was gone so not a not believe all women it's believed the women we want to believe because they're slightly more credible and then Republicans say okay well we agree that port with like the more credible than sweating it but we don't believe that she's totally credible either early ... story isn't corroborated\nAnd then people are like no no no that means you don't you're not leaving all women or I mean you don't believe about women you don't really want you to Broderick ... Jones ... sandwich by Ted Kennedy and Chris Dodd back in the ... it's just it's maddening but here is made in Iran and saying how could Susan Collins even have a child\nHow could you even have because this is a free country where we do not condemn people without due process of law and we certainly don't condemn people's lives do the ash ... history simply without any corroborated evidence whatsoever\nOr can say that the things that back and forth to match you with us out there what is that and see them there were cooperation because he had talked about this is talk to her husband to

lost the battle with regard to the capital of winning the cultural war the cultural war is going to be\nThat men verses women and women always must be believed and that men who do not buy in or women who don't buy in our ... ...\n... the only thing they told them it was on meet the press so I wasn't allowed to shut up and meet the press effort showing up at the hearing because of Dianne Feinstein has a very serious senator Leno and she explained were winning the cultural battle\nI think a lot has changed but I also think a lot has changed and yesterday we we may have lost a political battle but I Do think we are winning the cultural battle and often I don't fight for them when I'm fighting so that generation and [laughter] I don't have to deal with the abuses of power that would that we've had to deal with\nJoe this is this is what Democrats are hoping and they're hoping in the most ... while possible way coming up if the solution to what ails us his gratitude maybe we ought to take a look at some of the statistics\nSurrounding how good we have it here in the United states and I heard a lot of that and about how American income magnate in and how things really haven't gotten better since Nineteen Seventy nine I actually want to what is your life better than it wasn't I didn't have any material answers why that is when you hear\n... all the products are getting are better and you're getting them for cheaper here is what they did they divided the Nineteen Seventy nine nominal prices by Nineteen Seventy nine average nominal hourly wages and two thousand Fifteen nominal price is by two thousand Fifteen average\nAnd two thousand Fifteen nominal prices by two thousand Fifteen average nominal hourly wages and they calculated the time costs of household items in each year that's a number of hours it would take to buy a washing machine for example so for example\nThe time costs may thirteenth cubic foot refrigerator so by fifty two percent in terms of the hours of work required at the average hourly nominal way so if you could buy two refrigerators for the price of one and that makes you Richard regardless of what your top line income is\nNeedless to say the above price productions greatly underestimate the totality of wealth or again by the average American ignorant qualitative authentic and environmental improvements on commonly use item again those products are better today than they were yesterday\nSo it's pretty clear it is pretty clear that when it comes to products that we can buy we are much better off than they were in the Nineteen seventies so where are we short\nOr short in education health care and housing because the cost of those things has written at a faster pace than total compensation however it is true that today's houses are larger and health care is better and education is more high tech\nAnd it's also true that the reason that house that houses have risen in prices because of tremendous regulation on the part of democratic administrations for the most part and major city the Reagan easy housing shortages in Los Angeles which is the most sprawling city you know in in the country and it's where I live is because of heavy regulation and zoning\nSo what is the standard of living well it's certainly ... it certainly better than I was Nineteen Seventy nine for the vast majority of people in the American public the average apartment is bigger the average stuff you have in your apartment is bigger the average house is better the average stuff that you have in that house is better all of that\nShould suggest that maybe we should be kind of grateful\nFor the country in which we live and stop trying to tear it down and stop trying to tear each other apart in the name of some utopian vision Democrats might be wise to start there especially because the more and rage Democrats or Republicans lagging behind 'cause we we are not fond of the rage but\nIf you enraged ... when you wake up sleeping giant it's not good for you ...\nIt is not good for you okay well in just a second I Want to talk about the Democrats' failure to recognize that basic truth in what they are saying now about justice cabinet but\nFirst let's talk about your sleep quality I don't think that while on the road you know why because I don't have my helix sleep mattress with me there was nobody on the planet like you to why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else healing sleep they'll to sleep when they take two minutes to complete\nThey use the answers Metra body type and sleep preference is the perfect

good\nWe got one for my sister for her wedding go check it out right now he likes fleet dot com slash Shapiro\nOkay so let's talk about the fact that the west doesn't seem to realize they live in a a great country and that they believe that we all ought to be living in fear every single day now fear mongering is never a wonderful thing if you're going to get exercised about problems in your lead you probably should be exercised about problems that\nAre truly prevalent know things that are actually a threat to you and suggesting that every woman in the country is at risk of rape every second of every day is probably not a good way to bring people together it's also not a good way to view your neighbors because the truth is that\nWomen are not at risk of sexual assault every day in the United states on there and they're pretty they've country for women in fact it's a free and safest country for women in the history of mankind so there's that but there's a song and it's now become very popular on Twitter and Facebook\nI'm not sure what and get her name is Mercedes wins I got a and she was put up this song and folks on the left are just ecstatic about this on because it suggests that\nMen should not be concerned about false allegations of sexual assault\nWe should not be concerned about it anymore so\nYoung men who are worried that in the aftermath of the Brett Kavanaugh nonsense that anybody can be accused at any time without any corroborating evidence they should sit down and shop because women have a tough now there's a logical flaw at the root of it which is two things can be drawn women can be afraid of bad men and men can be afraid of bad wondering why these two things are supposedly mutually exclusive and beyond me\nI Do not understand why\nSaying that women have a right to be afraid\nWhen a man of cost them and treat them terribly why is that mutually exclusive with my man has a right to be afraid\nThat a woman will make a false allegation against him I'm not saying that the fears ought to be equivalent in nature I'm not saying that the\nLevel of of the or should be equivalent or that the level of prevalence of these events is equivalent to say that I shouldn't be afraid of something bad happening to me because something bad could happen to you makes no sense at all just on a logical level and the reason I say this is because there are cases many cases across the United states particularly on campus right now\nWhere men are being accused of things that they did not do and it's costing them time money and credibility\nSo here's the story of ... I mean the story James and I'm going to get into this lady's song so James was a freshman at the University of California David this is according to reason magazine who's on his way to math class when he received an email that would directly his life for\nThe next few months university title nine office which handled sexual misconduct disputes between students was investigating a complaint against him this was in February twenty Eighteen\nRight after Harvey Weinstein and Al Franken and all the rest James and this was not a good time to get accused of something like that the email from the title mine compliance officer\nWhen into great detail about the seriousness of James situation it would be investigated in accordance with university sexual assault and sexual violence policy as well as the student code which covers physical assault threats of violence and conduct as written health and safety\nOf finding a responsibility could result in suspension or even expulsion but the email the short on details of the alleged conduct according to the title nine off as a female student and Becky had complaint is that James touch her on the bread and butter over and under her clothing without her consent James to Becky they didn't classmates and drama and briefly friends on the even among Tobar twenty\nTwo thousand Seventeen they'd met up with some other friends to play music eventually finding themselves alone and back to your dorm they kids for a few minutes engaged in some light sexual touching before other students interrupted them in James's view they encounter had not only been fully consensual it was also mutual\nBecky bore just as much responsibility for initiating it as James as Becky would later made clear to the investigator should also touched him it's actually she explicitly describes her own actions and her official statement\nFamous attorney wrote about the incident and ah and here's what they wrote Becky to count of the incident at set forth in the summary of her investigative interviews does not on its face\nAllege any act to prohibit and conduct of matter investigation continued until may first at which time the officers student and judiciary affairs finally concluded that James was innocent even though ... afforded the opportunity to appeal the decision consistent with university policy is dictated\nBy the Obama administration the education department and costs James twelve thousand dollars in legal fees to defend himself against an allegation in which the girl admitted admitted that she was mutually involved in the sexual conduct\nI mean it's pretty astonishing according to Becky complain\nThey can't sing followed a night of mutual flirting and started out romantic eventually she either ask him to close the door closed it herself that continue kissing and also touching it they grind it against each other\nAnd he stayed he says my hands started making my way of ...\nAnd he said he says my hand started making my ... multi respectfully testing the waters and to open it I make sure that he was enjoying what's happening she seemed to enjoy it and so he touched her over her clothes and removed his shirt and she told them to drop it on the floor so in other words you involved in every step of all of that\nRight at one point James became too forceful he was running against our troops but yet the closet door in fact he asked him to be more gentle he agreed and toned down the writing Becky admit that you catch the changes that\nI didn't think she gave me that she did however asked whether he was into certain types of sexual activity and she said that humans aroused by all of that so she says all of this to the title wine cork it cost him twelve thousand dollars anyway so should be worried about that sort of thing\nWhy not why wouldn't they wouldn't you be worried about the sort of stuff but according to feminine because women have a completely separate\nSet up fears some of which are justified in some of which are overstated\nMen should not be worried about anything but Brett Kavanaugh was guilty because bad things happen to women is basically the logical blessed and then they wonder why folks on the center and on the right or not interested in that particular point of view\nWell here is that this song for Mercedes Benz expressing that's been our point of view that bad that women are threatened bad things happen to them therefore mentioned shut up here she had thing about the Titanic five million used on Twitter it's gone viral of course\nI Can't remember the name of nine in June and I can go to a room and I live in the\nOther for one second so she can do all those like all the things you've got that you can't do that you can do I agree\nThat men can be picked and women are at greater risk of being targeted by men and that are ... what does that have to do with the price of the in China it really has nothing to do with the main topic at ... ... something bad happened to me or could happen to me therefore you should shut up about the possibility of something bad happening to get which is just a line of logic I Do not understand\nComing up President Trump has stated\nThat the left

right now\nI'm the sadness overwhelms me at times if I have to take a break to go cry in the corner and just rock myself and eat ice cream that might be happening a little bit later in the show we'll try to avoid as best we can Nikki Haley made that announcement in the White House with President Trump today it was a shock announcement here's what she had to say\nHow it is and and honor and all I I you know I said I in\nLeave they can't raise and serve\nReally been a blessing and I want to thank you for that\nKnow Nikki Haley was indeed a bad asking her job as the UN ambassador\nShe basically spent every day going and yelling at death but which was great at it I mean she would go in and she would talk about how the United states was exceptional and America was unique plates and our allies like Israel rich supporting and how the UN was basically been all sides of the international institutional\nSort of lay out and she was exactly correct about all the things I Will miss Nikki Haley greatly explains some of the things that she got done as you an ambassador\nTo kind of\nYou're with the United states on foreign policy [noise] now\nWhat they know\nThat if we say we're going to do

that\nOkay so they're building a bunch of rumors about what's going to happen next\nPeople suggesting that Nikki Haley is going to take Senator Lindsey Graham spot Lindsey Graham is going to become the the UN ambassador that's not going to happen I'm just going to say that right here right now Lindsey Graham has no interest in giving up a tendency to go the UN ambassador it would be a great solution it'd be really Machiavellian to move her into the Senate where she could just do battle\nWith Kamala Harris on a daily basis it would be spectacular I Would enjoy watching it and Lindsey Graham would actually make a terrific UN ambassador because it would be full time Lindsey Graham ... boy no that's all that he would do all day long would be Lindsey Graham to point out and just yell at people would be amazing but unfortunately I don't think that's going to happen there are some rumors and maybe it'll be Dina Powell who was a former member of the administration\nOr or maybe it'll be ... we're now who would be terrific he's our current ambassador to Germany I really doubt that they are going to call him back from Germany to make new on about that are there are few other possibility Nikki Haley is is not going to stay with the administration she that she is not going back to the Senate might get to the G is going to go back into politics maybe a couple of years from now\nBut I get the sense from her from from folks you know her that she actually does just want to take some time out that you sort of been burned out on the job and I hear I mean that's that's a

saying and doing a number to having to go in with some of the worst people on earth and tried to negotiate with them on a regular basis so good for Nikki Haley and she certainly has\nAll sorts of

times column today called white male victimization anxiety and here's what he said that he's had during the swearing in of justice Brett Kavanaugh on Monday Donald Trump took it upon himself to apologize to cabinet and family\nAnd a half our nation that he terrible pain and suffering you have been forced when you are repeated the tire line that he and Republicans hope will stick and you're the common touch base with electoral for her that accusations of sexual assault against cabinet or part of the campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nPersonal destruction based on lies and deception\nThey were and what happened to the cabinet family by like every notion of fairness decency and due process it did but here's Charles Blow perspective to me that was not just the president and party\nWorried about and approaching blue wave and trying to take lyrical advantage but moment to victory it was an outright and increasing amplification of a reactionary white male victimization syndrome and it's consumed modern American conservatism\nVox had called at the unleashing of white male backlash this is very bad by the way white males are not allowed to defend their right if they do this is just evidence that they are privilege so if white males are given to prop that then that shows that they are public and if they're not given due process and then they get angry that also shows that they are public\nSo just like every other major left his argument each day that conclusion is already assumed it's just a question of how you got there\nAccording to Charles Blow the woman accusing the white man of assault learnt the victim instead the white man was the victim well to be accurate the actual accusation\nIs that the women at using the white man of assaulting had any corroborating evidence which means that you were trying to get this guy without any corroborating evidence whatsoever in some people's eyes as low he was the victim of political correctness majors overage a check your white male privilege culture drunk on its own self righteousness which is owned which is true\nBecause that's what happened but that's not really what this is about according to Charles Blow Kavanaugh's belligerent and Trump's dismissal of the accusers he mocked one at a political rally and called the accusations of helps you'll recall that some folks like me criticized that and said\nThat he shouldn't have mock Christine Blasey Ford because he didn't know the facts either\nAccording to blow they represent for many many back against the wall north they start treatment of fighting back uh pushing back a standing proud and their patriarchy and proclaiming that it will happen\nNow due process is patriarchy now presumption of innocence patriarchy\nContinued they're saying enough they will be no or ground there will sharing or power they'll accommodate no more than in the end validation of the press one out of the word allegedly a press there because again none of those allegations have actually been supported by any evidence he says that is what they're telling us and they are speaking\nThrough Trump he said that the victim sensibility Trump is articulating is not generationally restricted in January a PR I MTV Paul uh Fifteen to twenty four year old\n... forty three percent of young white men pay discrimination against whites is that your essay problem is discrimination against other groups twenty nine percent of young white woman agreed with them and nearly half believe efforts to increase diversity won't harm white people because by\nNature the definition of the left to attempt to increase diversity include harming white people meaning what the last one from diversity is not ideological diversity or diversity of experience what the what that is that we should give lots that be moms you qualified white people do while if I'd non white people is an actual pointed to let

appeal only twenty six percent of black Americans consider themselves liberal nearly half of Latino to argue that many people nowadays are too sensitive Muslims are treated two and five black folks say that immigration nowadays is bad for America\nIn other words this notion that demographics is destiny which has been pushed by both sides of the political out has certain extent is just not true and there is no shrinking white majority that is going to inevitably lead to liberal domination and there is no inevitably increasing liberal majority that is going to lead to incredible victory over time\nPeople's minds can be changed in other words we're individuals we are not just members of groups\nThat's really important to remember in the middle of what is a very very polarized news cycle and this is why the left have some serious problems even going forward now that doesn't mean that the right can you think to alienate folks the right obviously can do things to alienate folks and\nI Would say there is the difference between being politically incorrect and being a jerk and this is where the right has to be careful\nNot everything that you say that as offensive is just you being politically incorrect sometimes you being a jerk if you use the N word that's not and you being politically incorrect you being a jerk\nIf you say that men and women are different status politically

you've been accused of inciting violence and I'd say well you've been here the whole time have you heard anything that you think would incite violence and she thought about it for a second and she said no\nOf course not of course not\nThe reason that folks on the left suggested I incite violence is because they disagree with me that is why well it turns out that most Americans would rather have disagreement than a few violence and somebody who's not involved in violent and when the left equates speech and violence and then says it their own violence his speech\nAll they're doing is alienating the vast majority of the American people the weapons now playing a game the Democratic party is playing a game\nSpeech of the right they say is violence because right when it was a bad and their own violence is speech so in the left goes in towns on the doors of the Supreme Court and acts threatening that's just a form of speech that just the anger according to CNN but if folks on the right say stuff that offends people that's now form of violence\nOn CNN headline news when I say a man as a man and woman is a woman and some\nTransgender woman grits me by the back of the neck and Britain's me bottle bodily harm\nThose two things are equivalent me saying man as a man and woman is a woman according to the left is the equivalent of somebody grabbing me physically on national

out in the Trump ... in in the Trump era\nMost Americans don't buy it and that doesn't mean that from going to win from here to attorney it doesn't mean the Republicans always when\nRepublicans are not good at the game they're not and again when you mistake political incorrect for being a jerk or vice versa you're making a rather large mistake yourself\nBut it is important to note that this notion on the left at the local majority is just all the black people and all the women and everybody else it's just not true statistically and that's a very very important thing to keep in mind we still have more in common than than not and you can be fooled by watching our politics are watching social media I get fooled too\nBut it's not reality I mean speaking of folks who are not living in
