when there is any kind of attack on\nOn a left wing targets then of course it's instantly I blamed on right winger is even when there is no evidence and all that there is a political motivation one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six but when there's a left wing\nPresumed left wing attack\nOn a right wing target even one was a resulting in a shot in the chest and the guy seriously hospitalized and broken glass and real damage which thank God there hasn't been here then of course nobody asked well uh somehow how did uh\nSome of the harsh rhetoric by Eric Holder or by Hillary\nClinton or by anyone else on the left contribute to it no one asked that and that is a double standard when I'm Talking about is just\nVery quickly\nThis um attacks that occurred\nUh three days ago\nWhere a guy named George ... who is thirty eight years old\nAttacked a Fox Fox five television now again I understand Fox five is not the same as Fox News but in the eyes of the general public you see Fox of talks\nAnd if you're on the left you hate it\nIn any case through to pains of glassy came into the lobby and then he was shot by a security guard\nThat anybody say well he must have been a left wing or it turns out he was a left wing or he was an out of his had her he was a crazy homeless person\nAnd somebody who had been charged with murder\nIn two thousand two but was released he was involuntarily committed\nIn two thousand Fifteen he placed a death threats against D.C police and the D.C offices William in human resources and against a federal judge who had dismissed one of his many law suits you had more than twenty four lawsuits in recent years claiming that he had been\nApproached ship plans in his head up so I don't know left wing or right winger know crazy person is it entirely possible\nThese are bombs\nThat were sent out to people could be such a person\nOr is it just reasonable in any phase of the imagination\nTo jump to the conclusion that\nBecause there are a lot of left wing targets here\nPeople like Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Eric Holder and President Obama and\nPresident of a and a President Clinton and Secretary Clinton because those are targets apparently this attempt\nIt must be someone who was inspired by President Trump and President Trump is to blame\nThat seems to me outrageous and unfair you want to hear an example of it uh Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York right after he gave a decent statement praising and police praising bumps but then this\nThe heated rhetoric good toxic environment\nIs part of this yes we are being done to forming gratification whatever a suggestion of the pattern is that they are politically or related\nAnd I think that's a caution to all political officials elected officials candidates and Americans we can have political differences we've always had political differences that's what made America America\nBut let's have our political differences with civility a and let's avoid the hostility and the rhetoric and the rancor and the anger because we are out of boiling point\nOkay I I mean there are a lot of Americans who are the boiling point and I agree with the general settle sentiment that it's better to have reason the conversation but for goodness sake what a hypocrite\nAnd why now and why is it that there was a race and which is deadly that was delivered to President Trump at the beginning of this month the same race in was also delivered a general matter but secretary of defense\nOr did that get the same kind of attention here\nThere seems to be just as much damage that was\nThere seems to be just as much damage that was done by that attack as this one namely none\nOr is there media\nManipulation\nGoing on with the coverage of this event\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six it seems to me that there is a ... the New York times and their initial coverage of the attack on this Fox News station that was an attack with damage property at least in one guy with a bullet in his chest\nOr they ah said the shooting of the station comes almost four months this was in the New York times the day after the shooting at the station comes almost four months after a man's formed a newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland and opened fire with a shotgun the chilling attack killed five people and left the world of journalism really\nPresident Trump condemned the newsroom shooting and offered his condolences but he has often portrayed the news media is the enemy that people\nAfter the shooting the publisher of the New York times AJ souls burgers had in a statement that he told the president in private meetings that quote his language was nachos divisive but increasingly dangerous in other words what did they have to do with the newsroom shooting in Annapolis\nOr the attack on Fox News which is where this appeared in the paper\nIt'll be interesting to find out we do know be on any shadow of a doubt that wins Steve skull east was severely wounded and there was an attempt and and so we're Washington officers severely wounded designed to protect and congressman\nAnd other attempts to kill other Republican congressman\nThat was politically motivated\nThe guy was clear about it\nBut listen to what Nancy Pelosi said at the time when a and this is more than a year ago this is June of two thousand Seventeen right after Steve ... was shot she asked about uh some Republicans would condemn some of the hospital democratic rhetoric and here's what she said\nThey have her comments for most of us in\nIncluding
