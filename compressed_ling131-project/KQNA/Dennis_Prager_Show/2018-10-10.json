the country when the other side it's just completely off the rails\nAnd and bizarre we will get to that with Governor Jindal and I also want to speak to you about the proposition of revolution and the civil war their voices on the left and on the right\nTo say we're in the midst of a civil war\nOr a cold civil war and may not be actual bloodshed\nBut when you have people ranging from Carl Bernstein to on the left and Thomas Friedman the New York times on the left to people like Victor Davis Hanson on the right and they're all saying\nYeah civil war is here we're on the verge of fighting here is what Carl Bernstein had to say on CNN\nAbout why she believes were in the midst of a civil war listen\nBut I think one thing we need to understand is the larger context of all of this and that is that we are in a cold civil war in this country\nAre then these two events are both lower investigation and the catalog nomination are almost a the the Gettysburg and and the ... absolutely essential battles of this cold civil war in both the Democrats\nAnd the Republicans unfortunately uh own understand that and are exploiting their\nUh instead of having two parties committed to finding out the

two oh six to eight out\nEight hundred pardon me\nA three to six to eight oh\nLet's go back to this question about\nThe forthcoming civil war Thomas Friedman the New York times he's won two Pulitzer Prizes and big big deal and he said a veteran commentator on foreign affairs and Thomas Friedman\nSays I began my journalism career covering a civil war in Lebanon I never thought I'd end my career covering a civil war in America\nAt a time or does that mean you're you're planning to end your career but the civil war in Lebanon by the way there are two hundred fifty thousand people mostly civilians who died\nThat terrible terrible horrible horrible horrible thing\nUh perpetrated\nBy all kinds of crazy an awful people who hate each other and we're willing to kill each other\nBased upon some of their religious\nIt was one of the Shia versus Sunni fights and to some extent ethnic differences in any event\nHe uh he writes we can't find common ground on which to respectfully disagree today the other side as the enemy we showered each other on television and follow each other on Facebook and fire verbal mortars that each other on Twitter and now everyone is on the digital battlefield not just politicians\nBut that doesn't mean people are willing to kill each other one of the things about the perspective that I think you should gain from this horrific hurricane Michael I Know I Know it's I'm troubled by the name too\nBut hurricane Michael this disaster and it's hitting a beautiful part of the country in a part of the country that I have enjoyed and love which is the Florida Panhandle and yes it's the most conservative part of Florida but I don't hear any liberals in Florida saying hey we're not going to help people in the panhandle\nBecause they are right wing or\nI don't think anyone needs to fear a rescuer comes up and then we'll rescue from some of the devastation of this hurricane\nAre based upon you're wearing a mega ...\nIt's it's not going to happen that way and again I think that Governor Scott of Florida who's doing a terrific job and yes he's running for Senate as a Republican but I don't think people are going to say oh I don't want to get help from Governor Scott because he's a Republican I mean at a time like is it doesn't matter they're all Floridians they're all Americans\nEverybody is going to need a little help in that part of the world cleaning up from this disaster it said it's a complete complete disaster and it's a serious thing\nBut I think that looking at that perspective\nIs important when a Hurricane Florence hit in South Carolina North Carolina\nI didn't hear anybody no not even the Spartacus not even the most outspoken not even Mazie Hirono crazy Mazie\nOr didn't hear any of these people saying no no no no no way no FEMA no help for North and South Carolina because they both carried for Trump and these are very conservative states already South Carolina\nOkay if you didn't hear that\nAnd that's different from a civil war isn't it let's go to a your calls to\nA Melvyn in Columbus ohio Melvin you're on the Michael Mann that show\nHello how are you I'm doing well\nLike I I had economy regarding the um there are five war I think it's um it's important to make sure we say that it's a cold civil war 'cause it's kind of strategic\nAnd awards on the wealth and the resources that were alligator governed by the white male you know the bill\nAlligator governed by the white male you know that was built the last two three hundred years and minorities and women are trying to get the largest share of that so that's where I Believe the wars of\nWell if you turn around and trying to get a larger share of well that depends on how if you're talking about going into somebody's house and tying them up and and then breaking into their safe and stealing their money okay then use that as a kind of civil war\nBut if what you're talking about is we're going to perform better and we're going to start our own businesses and we're going to build up our own community and we're going to earn more\nThat's just normal American competition that's what the free market encourages\nThat kind of like a facade of all your power you're ... if you look at it and if you buy power\nOkay then you give me can you give me one indication I understand what you're trying to saying now than I Do\nBut let me ask you this can you think of one law that either a justice Kavanaugh is going to shore up or a law that he's going to strike down\nWhere he's going to act to keep power concentrated for white males which which laws are you most concerned about their\nOr what I just signed a law start with their those acts like a ...\nWell that's that's the that's the fourteenth amendment to the constitution and that's where the fourteenth amendment of the constitution guarantees every citizen regardless of color or national origin regard the equal protection of the law right and\nGo ahead well that was the Supreme Court level looking at all that kind of ... how are you going to get out of it goes on I watch it\nYeah but when you ... what what laws do you think right now concentrate power in the hands of white males\nAnd your name one\nBecause that would be unconstitutional\nRegarding up equal pay what women's rights that that's been in the last night in sixty three right but they're not being put me in the lab it of course it is of course it is if I Know I look Melvin if I dared\nTo uh offer a different salary for someone based on his agenda alone\nOr I Would be struck with a lawsuit so fast and they have lost its like this all the time but the the point is and this doesn't mean that there aren't cases where sometimes people are opposed to hiring men by the way\nThere are cases where people are a whole post hiring men and some weather imposed hiring women but the idea that that it's a gender gap in terms of pay is because of discrimination it has been answered so many times let me suggest you go to the website of Christina hot summers\nAre a woman by the way who's written about this so persuasively and and the idea that right now this is a problem for our world will get into that a little bit more close to two thirds of all graduates of four year colleges and universities in America are female and ah I suspect\nThat by the time my granddaughter is Twenty one right which is a little
