for a message and realizing that President Trump is president Hillary Clinton is trying to come up with a way to combat that once you come up with\nBelieve it or not federalism Hillary Clinton one of the great advocates a federal power\nOf the modern era she is now discovering federalism I got amazing how this works Donald Trump comes along and suddenly Hillary Clinton and the left are discovering that states are kind of great here's what she tweeted yesterday in reality image approval court with a right wing majority isn't the states are new important front in protecting civil rights especially the right to the most vulnerable among us\nIs that really a new important front and protect with them or I\nOr does it turn out that the states were always an important front in protecting do right now folks are going to say well think about the fact that stage where Spock as well for him ... that's true it was also take the or responsible for failing to abide by the fugitive slave act in an Eighteen fifty leading to the civil war the federal government was trying to force state in the north to abide by the fugitive slave act\nThey ignored or refusing to abide by the fugitive slave act\nState are only as good as the people who comprise them and their policy is only as good as the people who comprised than the one thing that it's certainly true is that the United states as a mixed\nState and and national test them as it is putting federal thirty nine\nOr they mix system state governments are designed to preserve the sensuality of locality in American Jurisprudence\nAnd the fact that the lessons only now realizing this as soon as somebody who's in office they don't like in the head of the federal government demonstrates shutdown dishonest they are because there is nothing Hillary Clinton and her ... if they ever gotten charge again how long do you think they'd stick by the state's rights proposal how long do you think they'd be in favor of states' rights the answer is five second five seconds\nAnd the left is junk that's honest about all this stuff that they left that proclaims that Donald Trump is just on a business is on when Hillary Clinton says she likes states right\nNow what Hillary Clinton mean is that she wants to use any optical to prevent President Trump governing attended actually believe in states rights and she actually believe in that state's rights and presumably should want to demolition of ... in the states from the federal government across the board including if she'd been president\nWe all know that that was never going to happen will not ever going to happen instead the truth as Democrats really want is to copy the policies of Scandinavian country\nWhere people forget to tell you this but the policy and Scandinavian country is not just the math and social welfare state is the amount of social welfare state paid for by enormous unbelievably catches\nThe taxes in places like Denmark and Norway fifty to sixty percent on everybody making more than ... your ... grand a year\nSo we're not talking about taxes on just the wealthy\nEven folks on the left are not willing to be honest about what exactly it would take the paper all the crap that they are talking about\nInstead what they will do and they will just kick the can down the road so what exactly are they proposing\nSo they're not really proposing federalism and they're not obviously proposing ... legislation the left is proposing spending a lot of money so now we're going to get in the twenty twenty primaries when the Democrats who can spend the most cash so we have Kamala Harris is proposing getting every poor family five hundred bucks\nBased on nothing we really don't know where exactly this money is going to come from how they're going to spur the economy any of that Cory Booker says well why didn't five hundred why not do a hundred times five hundred what getting everybody grant\nSo why not give me five hundred grand by the way we are not five million by helicopter pallets of cash over Newark all just drop out of cash mean hopefully people get out of the way now there'll be crushed by money and die happy\nThat apparently the idea of Cory Booker so corn into Vioxx which is the repository\nOf all things too but that's not saying that everybody at boxers do but\nThere is some intelligent folk debacle of why they were made there is beyond the senator Cory Booker is introducing a bill aimed at closing the gap between rich and poor his idea is to get lower income kids a sizable nest egg\nNearly fifty grand in some cases that they couldn't use for wealth building purchases like a down payment on a house or college tuition these opportunity a counselor theoretically make sure all children have significant out that's when they enter adulthood rather than just those who are up in wealthier home\nThis particular proposal relied on people to use money well you know what else relies on people to use money well basic reason and free market\nSo dropping cash on people\nWithout actually using that cash for the purposes is counterproductive coming up the president of the United\nStates points in response to the migrant caravans bearing down on America's southern him or is he right well yeah he kind of it and the fact that Democrats refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of the United states over our own more what you want to measure\nThat is not a recipe for victory\nAnd that's why President Trump the Republicans are going to win on his regime and Lindsey Graham was a real tough on immigration right Lindsey Graham famously one of the gang of eight along with John McCain a big fan of immigration form even he said listen this is not something we can do now\nAnd of immigration from even he said listen this is not something we can do Nancy Pelosi would welcome the tournament I don't know what happened Lindsey Graham whether he bumped his head or something but Lindsey Graham to point out the reset is really good and here's Lindsey Graham senator from South Carolina saying Nancy Pelosi will welcome these Caribbean\nYou want to be the country of people are running up and down the hall and spit on you or do you want to be a country of a of of of Republicans who can actually deliver for working families out there that will foot good judges on the court that will stand up to the to the enemies of this country Nancy Pelosi well welcome to care of and fear\nA Donald Trump and the rest of us will stop them\nOkay well that that is exactly right and that's not out of lack of some of the U.S because of a country that has a rule of law must abide by that rule of law Democrat to continue to push the tissue aren't going to lose it's funny because Democrats are so ensconced in their own bubble and what poll showed that Democrats have far fewer Republican front and Republican Democrat friends\nBecause Democrats living areas actually see Republicans as nasty evil human beings and so they won't even talk to them\nThey actually believe that it's a mainstream view that people should be able to flood into the country they actually believe that it's a mainstream view that gender insects are completely separate\nAnd not only that that is a man calls himself a woman that that man is than a woman the latest evidence of this is I mean there's an amazing story is the way the media are covering an attempt by the department of education to to find what title nine actually does so here the headline from the New York times today it's an\nTransgender could be defined out of existence under a Trump Administration\nNow when you read that headline what does that sound like you it sounds like the Trump Administration is saying they're no such thing as transgender people or people who suffer from\nGenerated for your gender identity disorder that's what it would sound like from that headline is that what's actually happening\nNo that's not what's actually happening because that did he oughta\nThey nobody is saying there aren't people who are transgender what the Trump Administration is saying is that under the law was that have to do with sex discrimination or specifically focused on biological sex they're not focused on you thinking you were a member of a different track so when the civil rights act was written\nAnd it included language about men and women and sex discrimination it did not mean that it affects discrimination for you to say that a man who shows up in a classroom a fifth grade classroom dressed as a woman\nAnd you say that's not cool we're not going to do that\nThat's not the same thing as saying woman can't work in the classroom that's not sex discrimination\nAnd that's that's what the Trump Administration saying they're saying\nThat behavior by men is not the same as being female\nThat the actual what I'll read the actual article it doesn't it doesn't ban transgender people that's what they're doing the media is so dishonest with regard to how they cover transgender issues because they refused to even acknowledge the fact that there is such a thing as biological sex it's orderly self defeating\nWithin the what the ... the gender insects are exactly separate but gender is that\nRight so generous acts are completely separate you can be a man or your gender is female and that makes you a biological female that makes you an actual woman\nThis is how they want to read the law and make no sense under any circumstances I explain in just one second they think it's a winning issue I mean it's just it's insane

H O here's what they say the policy prompted by sober bathrooms dormitory single sex programs and other arenas or gender was once seen as a simple concept conservatives especially evangelical Christians were incensed I Love the New York times conservatives especially evangelical Christians when it's done this is a way of slandering religious people as they get\nPaid not people who actually use their brain and recognize that there are men and women and these are two separate categories\nAnd that maybe they're women's groups that one I mean women's groups and not have men who believe that women in those groups\nThat one I mean women's growth and not have men who believe that women in those girls\nAnd the same thing for mental growth and the same thing for bathroom now must be that there is those crazy people believe in the genes and it's those people the people in the ... I Believe in the ... then it would then everything will be fine that we can all acknowledge the men and women are that way in the same except for a little bit of appendage and blow\nHere to the New York times has now here's the bad stuff okay what's the bad thing that Trump's administration dead\nNow the department of health and Human Services is spearheading an effort to establish a legal definition of sex\nUnder title on the federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination and education program that we're seeing government financial according to a mental obtained by the New York times the department argues in his memo that keen government agencies needed to adopt an explicit and uniform definition of gender as determined\nOn a biological basis that is clear grounded in science objective and administrative all\nThe agencies propose definition when they find second he's a male or female on changeable and determined by the general the person they're born with according to a trap for you by the time and just being about one in fact what happened he clarified using genetic testing\nHow in the world is that not just basic rationality and he later woman I should be able to get to tell whether you're a woman or not it shouldn't be up to age and get to you to buy\nAn amazing made at the same let that has now come around to Elizabeth Warren is not a Native American because now while education a Native American why don't you Native American should they why not she's more Native American and Caitlyn Jenner as one\nSo what exactly is the problem here\nIt's truly amazing so\nYou wonder why the right doesn't trust the media you wonder why people are resonating the right it's because the ... in ... that we absolutely properly bottom eyes ourselves on basic concept like what is a woman and what is a man and we're supposed to pretend it's a great evil when the Trump Administration says gender discrimination means discriminating against women not discriminating against men who believed that women\nIt's an amazing thing coming up I actually want to analyze the new law in the United states\nUnder title mine wasn't specifically meant that went into this mess feminine may or may only be obvious that you want to play with them in a very long at all\nWe're to talk of the quad cities eleven thirty am Cape you in a broken belly and Ninety nine point nine F.

that he doesn't understand what he means any refers to nationalist or\nAny of these other terms that these are not just dog with her friend his phone line it's racism and basically for many people as a um anti fanatic as white supremacy he knows very well what he's talking about even if he professes otherwise\nOkay ... my antenna is pretty high up there for\nIt's amazing my antenna is pretty high up there for for anti Semitism when the president has nationalism I'm not hearing nothing he is saying that he prioritize the United states has more security\nOver the human rights of people trying to

or so on and that care of and without offering any proof and then calling herself a nationalist in front of thousands and thousands of people I don't think it's a stretch for a lot of Americans out there to wonder whether or not the president is secretly considering himself a white nationalist\nSo much journal is making so much objective journalism from Costa is anyone or that people ask whether the president denouncing when he when he said things like we should protect our border and nationalism\nI mean flashback to block Obama two thousand five thing exactly the same thing in Morocco mama actually had right here's Obama circuit two thousand five when he was a senator barely a glimpse in the nation's I there he was saying exactly the same thing that Donald Trump\nOr a generous and

white nationalist as well it wasn't just Costa who at this point basically everything that he says the profits year diary\nBecause he had all the quiet out loud it was almost anything in Peter Alexander more objective journalism being from the mainstream media on the issue of nationalism\nYeah it definitely does mean under tones that are not just racial they're just being a photo back and says something to the presence in sort of shied away from in the past obviously nationalism was a phrase that Steve Bannon a obviously embrace over the course of the campaign and a lot of the president's opponents tried to pin this idea on him\nNow with it I'm somebody who said that I prefer patriotism to national is melting the nationalism alone is enough I think there are tied behind it that history and culture but what actually make the United states the United states is a real idea embedded in the declaration of independence and the constitution and backed by two thousand years\nOf Judeo Christian History a rabbit three thousand years in jail Christian History\nAnd that's what makes the United states the United states and the idea of classical liberalism combined with cultural conservatism and that's what makes the United states' unique data unique idea in world history so I'm not to drink than even the president using nationalistic language but just injected as white supremacy is just anything\nBut again this comes back to the basic idea and you want to raise the temperature in the country you want to raise me me me half old people on the other side\nAll you have to do is just a question motives day in and day out and that's what we are now in the business and doing the truth is that in a country where we agree on Ninety percent of our values we really do I think in the end a grand Ninety percent of our valley the only way you can divide up by\nCaptivating people who disagree with you on a manifestation of those values as evil nasty bigoted horrible people coming up\nTo CNN believes President Trump is responsible for these heated rhetoric at least the violence in and obviously doesn't have clean hands here either it\nIn a statement released Wednesday afternoon they're jointly condemned the statement from the president issued earlier in the day expressing his concerns over Syria's infected explosive devices sense a prominent Democrat thinking we listen with great interest in the president's remarks this happened and we all take an oath to support and defend the constitution\nAnd protect the American people and that at first responsibility however President Trump's words ring hollow until he wrote birth of his statements that can do an act of violence\nTime and again the president has condoned physical violence and divided Americans on his words in action expressing support for the congressman who ... or the neo Nazis killed a young woman in Charlottesville and supporters at rallies and get violent with protesters dictators around the world who murdered a citizen and our friends in the free press and the enemy of the people\nNow I think President Trump and a lot about how about that on a clear about that but you're actually going to blame him for this bombing ... this is what you're going to do now\nI can remember somebody Nancy Pelosi just got a year and a half ago who was asked about the ... nearly being shot that you own died okay he was in critical condition he almost died it's a miracle that he let me ask you blow the saying how dare you blame or Bernie Sanders for his rhetoric that could have been connected\nWith the guy going on to a baseball field and shouting adding gunning down members of Congress\nAbout health care that's really what he's doing he was he was standing there screaming about health care kind of murder members of Congress there was Nancy Pelosi's response time she was right then she's not right now what the difference\nResponse time she was right then she's not right now what's the difference now she gets to target right winners\nHow dare they say such a thing how dare they chose this individual that something despicable and it was horrible what he did have lied for them to all of a sudden these sanctimonious and see if they don't never seen such a thing before\nIt's just it's it's just amazing so she's worse I mean I Wonder what changed oh what changed his who was going to get one that's what changed so there is no such thing as a sword that cuts both ways\nAll we have in the United states at this point are a bunch of habit I Belong on one end directed toward you and sharp on the other end directed toward your opponent we don't recognize that well we're actually holding in the store and if you use it on your opponent it can easily be turned back on you every store and has two edges\nBut according to the left it's just a hatchet and you can bury it in between the shoulder blades of your political opponents Hillary Clinton does the same thing so the former first lady senator presidential candidate sheets that wasn't as an American I'm worried about the level of our rhetoric\nSay well as a person I'm great as an American I'm worried\nI worry about the direction of our country's\nWorried about what kind of the world will be waiting for them when they're\nTeenagers and young adults and beyond\nOkay and it wasn't just Hillary Clinton saying that's our top aide fleet brains who is really want to most vicious people in American politics he was on MSNBC and he explicitly just blame President Trump's rhetoric for all of it\nThis is someone who has weaponized Trump's\nTwitter feed and made it into a hit list he is addicted to their response and their response they are addicted to his um betrayal\nOkay so next time somebody who is a big Hillary Clinton fan decides to go and shoot up an office mate of Fox News studio\nBut I guess we can blame Hillary Clinton because after all I recall when a minute ago one minute ago Hillary Clinton was saying you cannot be civil what the other side it was it was ... what's the day today today is the twenty fifth okay so would you know at least twenty ... ... fourteen days ago Fifteen days ago Hillary Clinton said that\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that twin civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to recognize and respect strength\nHey everybody is completely full of crap everyone is completely full of crap will get to the fullest of the crap\nIn just one second but first let's talk about what you do to get ready every evening I Love the dollar shave has everything I Need to look feel and smell my best very long you been more is the fact I never have to go to a store\nIt was about two hours you have to wait in line you have to find the products have to deal with human fancy doesn't make it away and I think they deliver everything I Need right to my door and they keep me fully stocked and when I use I never run out here's how it works\nDollar shave has everything you need to get ready no matter what you're getting ready for them that you covered head to toe hair products skin ... they've got it and they have a new program where they automatically kicking stocked up on the product\nYou use do you determine what you want when you want to show the bread at your door from month to month once every six months I particularly like their ... the wasteful and keeps my skin silky mood\nI also really enjoy their black pepper and stage shampoo really smells good plus with their hands some discount the more you by the more you have right now about a bunch of stars that you can try for five bucks\nLike they're all haircut after that the restock box ships regular size product at a regular price so what are you waiting for get your stars that for just five bucks right now at dollar shave ... dot com slash been that dollar shave club dot com slash then again\n... everyone it's all crap including\nAndrew Cuomo and bill de Blasio both of them came down they said listen we have to turn down the temperature in this country and have to start at the top\nWeird I remember when bill de Blasio was saying the police officers were just shooting black people for no reason and I remember when Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York so that everyone who disagrees with him on politics should get out of the state that is not an exaggeration he said that there is no place in the state of New York for you if you don't believe in same sex marriage\nAnd his views on social issues let me explain if you are getting around that I ended going it's always the rhetoric on the other side of this problem\nBy a freaking near\n... everybody has a role in temping down some of the rhetoric here\nAnd that also means that blaming the other side and suggesting that the other side of responsible for violence is leading to a worse country it's so funny everybody thinks they're fighting violence\nWhen they suggest the other side is responsible for violence when they just use mainstream political rhetoric you're actually increasing the chances of violence when you do that because you're eating everything up your suggesting the other side is so evil at the very outer ends of their ideas is likely to lead to death and destruction\nThat isn't that an an American perspective on American\nBernie Sanders' can say whatever the hell he wants no matter how wrong he is an emergency is actively saying go should people on a congressional baseball field that it's not his fault and Donald Trump\nCan say whatever he wants and you don't have to like it or whatever Donald Trump says he has a right to say that's a long and she's not saying go beat up somebody right now go bomb someplace right now\nIn my town and weary of all of that just because I Am weary of all this really I mean if we're going to have any sort of level headed conversation when to stop blaming each other for every crazy person who does the crazy thing\nEnough is enough I felt really really ... it looks out making the country worst place and other new\nNBC News is actively hyping this Megan Kelly whack base thing and it's really stupid it's really stupid so speaking of stupidity in politics to Megan Kelly we talked on the link yesterday Megan Kelly said on a show that she doesn't really understand why this woman who was in the real housewives of whatever why this woman\nWas in trouble for dressing up as Diana Ross at a party because when she was a kid people in the dark and their skin for Halloween costumes and wasn't a big deal and a bunch of folks had well blackface has along in a glorious history in the United states at insensitive shit you know what I learned something today that's insensitive I was wrong\nThat seems like that should be an end of the story does anyone really believes making Kelly's approval vicious are racist they don't actually believe that of course nobody believed that nobody actually believe that Megan Kelly thinks black people are inferior genetically and black people are worse black and one morally culpable at a\nHigher level than white people or any of that no one actually believe that that NBC and it just shows you that capitalism when used by bad people\nYou know is not great OK NBC wants to get rid of making Kelly they want to get rid of making Kelly because they've tried to push Megan Kelly into a box that is not properly fitted for Megan Kelly main Kelly is an excellent interviewer she's an excellent question her she's a former lawyer and prosecutor\nThat is where her role as best they try to fit her into the Katie Couric wop wop morning news routine and that didn't work for them\nAnd to the ratings were not good and so they had signed her to an inordinate amount of money and now they're trying to push or out the door how are they doing that\nBy accident by actively stoking racial resentment in the United states is ugly stuff NBC News is now saying they're going to air tape the episodes of making the show this week and then they're going to seek to terminate her contract\nBased on her saying that she didn't understand what the big deal was\nAbout somebody darkening their face for Halloween costume\nAndme anyone really believe that the NBC brass has really upset about that or their boycott is on his way or that this was actually vicious brutal KKK style racism they would actually think that no of course not this is just NBC News trying to stoke racial resentment for purposes of being able to fire somebody\nOr they are the head of NBC News Andy lack the openly went into Kelly after she apologized ship holler drive and then lack said well there is no other way to\nHer she apologized ship holiday either that or there's no other way to put this but I condemn those remarks there is no place on our air or in the workplace for them very unfortunate and then left her whole car her comments on any lenient\nAt the end I mean the decided to eat their own by going after making probably it's amazing how convenient that it\nI Know one on CNN criticizes CNN nobody on NBC News criticizes and the news unless they are preparing to shop somebody up and throw them in the winter\nAnd that's basically what NBC is doing here\nI Wonder why nobody ... let me get I mean that's really a great media story of just how corrupt the media are\nThere is no question that NBC is just the kind of think claim that the still playing here in or is that they can make a move by making Kelly that they wouldn't otherwise be able to make contractually so well done over at NBC making the country at worst place they can save some money on a host that you yourself box in the wrong way\nComing up the presidents of the United states is using his cell phone apparently in ways that it's totally stink worse than the United states to foreign eyes and ears and the sound bad because it really isn't Mary ...
