sexual national and religious as examples identifying as your sex identifying\nWith your nation identifying with their religion it makes you a happier person\nThe alternative is to be well if you don't identify with any of those forgetting the sexual for a moment ... ... you would if you don't have a national religious identity then what are you\nYou're a human which is lovely\nObviously but\nThere is no happiness and merely being human I'm human as opposed to what frog\nCow or I don't I don't see why that\nGives you any sense of happiness I think\nWe should all care about all humans that's a separate issue that's a moral question I'm not speaking about morality now I'm speaking about happiness and identity\nThere's no identity human as opposed to what as I said you're not a ... a turtle\nAs I said you're not a ... a turtle\nI don't see how that can contribute to one's happiness I can see how celebrating being French or being Japanese are Being American contributes to your happiness but I don't know how celebrating being a human as opposed to\n'cause it all of these or in distinction identity by definition is in distinction\nTo obviously that's fine no there's nothing wrong with that it doesn't mean that all those are bad or that you hate others that's that's that's what you learn to graduate school but it's not true in part because you did learn to graduate school\nSo uh if if you if you celebrate being French then you're not celebrating a bean Paraguay him\nAs that is correct or American that's fine I I think it's great you celebrate being French good long is I mean it was only there aren't obviously immoral components to your celebration but there'll be true but anything\nBut if you're a human you're celebrating um human as opposed to what is it doesn't mean anything there is no other things that you could be\nOkay that was important okay everybody let me\nLet me talk to you Long Island New York Susan Hi Susan Dennis Prager\nHi thank you for

push of if you will um Alaska forces which are attacking these identities I\nI don't know how to handle it any longer I truly don't because I feel that's how much of who I Am but so many people I have to kick and about\nAnd I try to I think that ... that you know try to kick shut down by it and also with my friends peace in the household peace in the world but it's becoming increasingly difficult because\nI think they can move towards feeling slightly isolated especially in the demographic where I live I live in New York I live in New York santhara then and there you have it so I feel what I

do you have these conflicts with\nA more of a trend more likely than friends and family friend who um extended family and\nWell look I I hear you I don't want to talk too much politics on the happiness our but I'm not going to deny reality of what what she says is true\nSusan wants to know how you handle it ... the only way to handle it I mean while there are many ways I shouldn't say the only one way to handle it is to find to intrude spirits otherwise you'd be very lonely can be\nBut if it's a challenge to find kindred spirits to that in New York City isn't it interesting I mean of course I don't know Susan but as soon as she said she celebrates being a woman being an American and being a Jew I just assumed they knew her politics\nBut interesting very interesting disarming

noticed that shoulder divorce\nOftentimes really struggle with their identity who my parents where did I come from where my family uh it's a struggle internally and then often times I think particularly in the culture today they are trying to lose in her daddy you know choose who is my parents\nAnd that that choices based on who they feel comfortable with or who may have more fun or something like that so they lose that family connection they lose aren't logically where am I from and in a in a culture that has\nYou know a so much given up and the notion that we have a creator who created\nThis even doubly difficult so they you know I'm just lucky mud I Will choose my identity I don't know who I Am and it causes a great amount of mental health problems that can be last a lifetime [laughter]\nAh I just wanted explain to people that this is based on the subject of the happiness our which was identity and my advocacy of\nUh in terms of happiness that people have a sexual identity of the words I Know a male and female or a national identity I Know where merit and I know one French on Japanese I celebrated and a religion\nFees I celebrate it and a religious identity that if you have the more of those you have the greater the chance for happiness so I'm just explain where you're coming from\nA very interesting like site or about who who what is my family 'cause family was been raised by a color as another source of identity happiness\nOr another identity source of happiness\nSo that's interesting my look I'm not I have I mean in in a sense I have done a lot of counseling through the radio but obviously you you're a professional with this and I and I\nAre certainly honor that fact ah my I'd be curious than\nTo hear your response to my general take on divorce and children it is not the divorce that is most troubling but what happens after the divorce if parents do not sniping one another\nAnd maintain listen we are not married but we remain your father and your mother my experience in life including out of my own children has been that that works but so many times like I was a long\nWays okay you know it goes a long long ways yes\nWell that's clinical yeah go on\nWell and particularly when either one or both of the parents remarry and you're bringing in a one or two more years old that are writing\nAs parental units I think it's extremely important and in my own divorce that was a not the case was not a what we call a a good divorce if there is such a thing and it did have a major impact upon our children\nAre there things there are mistakes that I made certainly there were things I was not aware of but uh I think you're absolutely correct on that on that issue it doesn't alleviate everything but it does go a long long ways to help them deal with what is\nNothing but a I mean almost all the time a bad situation for the kids there are certainly exceptions\nYeah we don't bill are not in the lab easily harmlessly yeah you're very thoughtful man and I appreciate it a few words substantial agreement look life is filled with obstacles to happiness and filled with landmines\nAnd that is how we navigate our life that ultimately determines or ability to handle that hopefully and with some degree of happiness\nHave a lot of a lot of lot of thoughts on divorce and I should I haven't talked about it in quite some time I talked about a much more in the past and I will address a began thanks to this call\nBut he and I both agree that the issue is what you do after the divorce more than the divorce I mean many things are factors including what age you you divorce court trial the child's age\nIt's it's very different if the child was too that if the trial was twelve or the child was twenty two\nThat's that's it is there's no comparison in fact\nBut\nBut the the most calamitous results by obscene or when a parent\nThe parent the parent ties as the other parent deal a Jew demise is the other most children are attached to both parents and even if you are right\nShirt and you're right\nThe deal legitimize of the other parents in in all but the most most egregious cases is a sin\nAgainst against the child against your family uh how're you doing there yeah All right I Want the will to call because we're going to take a break in the moment\nI think that\nPeople just need to understand\nVery few logs or move including kids from intact parents\nHow many people are at the psychiatrists and psychologists parents never divorced\nThat's not to say that all things being equal but the ideal of course the ideal\nShall return and the moment I'm Dennis Prager\nWithin a Springer show live from the relief factor pain free\n[laughter] about my friend that everybody is Rina from the government can kinda tell

once again have performed extraordinary things in keeping us all safe and getting a very dangerous and very deeply deranged individual\nInto custody and in solving the mystery of the great bomb scare with fourteen different packages sent to fourteen different people around the country getting that thing solved in record time I know I Know I Know it's always tempting\nTo try to jump on the president the United states or to jump on people in the mainstream media or to jump on one party or another party or this one or that one\nAnd say boy did you ever get it wrong boy has this terrible boy are you to blame I uh I I Want to try to avoid that because honestly we have every reason to celebrate the country and President Trump has been speaking recently\nAbout the need to come together and to see things and harmony and to see things as Americans not as Republicans or Democrats or pro Trump or their anti Trump or his\nBut basically to look at this thing citizens and when you look at this thing uh this has been remarkable and one of the things that and I literally just moments before I got on the air here\nI put out a tweet that said look this should remind everybody of how lucky we are\nTo have people in place like yes Jeff Sessions and yes Christopher Wray the head of the FBI and yes all of those extraordinary people who work every single day sometimes putting their lives on the line\nTo keep us safe through the FBI and the rest of the law enforcement through the New York city police there's a local Florida police we just had a um a moment with Jeff Sessions are announcing\nThe arrest if you haven't heard it and you probably have ... who is fifty six years old\nWho um it\nAt least as far as I can gather has known employment appears to have been living in his van and yes his van is festooned with all kinds of\nA political bumper\nStickers and posters it's actually kind of artfully designed\nBut the messages on the van are insane and a despicable and dare I say it deplorable in any event he was a arrested today taken into custody he's having multiple charges filed against him\nHe was being interrogated in what they call a national security exemption in other words they can't interrogate him without an attorney president dinner fear I think that what they're trying to do is to determine whether or not he had any accomplices or had any associates and he doesn't appear to\nA a guy with a very very long criminal history\nA guy who as I mentioned may or may not have been living in his van recently uh before that during another very serious criminal charges in during another bankruptcy\nThat he declared he was living with his mom and I'm at ... we're not talking about a an ... an upstanding or model citizen\nVery unprofessional auction prices low

endorse Martha ... percent and I think that a candidate for US Senate\nBy ... percent it's\nThe talk of the quantity cake you in a [noise]\nAnd on the Michael ... that show uh the whole country I think is celebrating or should be celebrating\nAmazing work by our law enforcement professionals to apprehend a a suspect\nWho apparently has now sent out a total\nOf fourteen bombing packages and and by the way don't be surprised if there are more the turnout\nOut today apparently they identified additional devices one went to Cory Booker so uh the senator from New Jersey Spartacus I Am sure now feels that he must have been feeling left out because there's so many other prominent Democrats who've gone\nOn their material and then there was another a device that were sent to the offices of a Kamala Harris uh\nApparently the senator from California and uh there there could well be more I'm Robert Deniro has come out with a statement he was of course yesterday his bombing\nHis intend to bomb had been identified and Robert Deniro of course came out with a statement saying the only way to answer their bombs is to answer it with our votes\nAt ... that it seems to me as very glib but it's very dangerous because it's not their bombs I've ... I've heard no one repeat no one\n... and I don't care how far right you go or what kind of crazy or not or who you are nobody who applauds these bombs this is one guy and I think yes he is deplorable in every way but he is in no way representative of up people who support President Trump\nAnd he certainly isn't representative of President Trump one of the things that was upsetting to me was looking at the photographs in detail of his van\nI at one point in one of the windows and the very bottom the window he has this he says uh I Am Donald Trump and I approve this message well the president has made a very very clear he does not approve this message and that's appropriate\nUh Critz for re the director of the FBI appointed by president Donald Trump to replace James Comey when he was gone Christopher Wray was there at the press conference just moments ago it's about a half hour ago and he had this to say about the scope of the investigation just concluded\nThat the attorney general has confirmed we have arrested sees are stray off\nIn connection with this investigation\nAs our investigation is still ongoing I may not be able to answer questions about his background or about his motive [noise] what I can say is that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous scope of the greatest imports are investigation ranged from New York\nTo Delaware to Maryland to the district of Columbia to Florida to California\nAnd as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we've got including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division in our world renowned experts at the FBI lab in Quantico\nOkay and then he concluded Christopher way right on this point a lot of people have said what's the big deal well this is the big deal\nWhich we can confirm that Thirteen IDs for sensitive areas individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe small clock a battery\nSome wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material they give off sheet and energy so reaction to heat shock or friction\nSo we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work on our folks at the at the Iowa based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelope containing ... had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is that for Cesar say\nThere is also a possible the connection between samples collected\nFrom pieces of two different high eighties mailed in separate envelopes an example previously\nMales in separate envelopes sample previously\nCollected for say Iraq in connection with an earlier rushed down in Florida\nOkay or that basically lays out how this was done and uh it's it's very important it seems to me\nTo understand for people on the left who have been\nTrying to see the activists are evil mad man\nAnd he has both evil and he clearly as a madman he's also a total loser will go over his arrest record coming up it's meant that takes almost a segment on its own because he has an extensive prolific arrest record including a prior arrests record for threatening to blow people up with bombs\nAre there are real questions about why he was running around out among us and um the point over here is I Would just\nTry to get folks on on the left including that I heard earlier today a congresswoman Jackie Speier who was just way over the top and this is a little reflective of the hatred of President Trump and it's all President Trump has that can you imagine anyone\nCelebrating if one of these bombs going off\nThink about it and for conservatives and I mean we would feel\nHorrible horrible\nJust as I I Know that when ... was shot and almost killed when there was the would be killer and the congressional baseball practice who fired at Republican members of Congress\nI didn't see anybody on the left celebrating I didn't hear anybody saying oh I Wish he'd killed Steve beliefs\nAnd and maybe we can think in those terms and let that inform some of our rhetoric\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nI'm let us go to your calls and to a Don in Columbus Don you're on the Michael meant that show\nBut yes I make sure I'm I'm a beginning on your show even argue with like a joke about growing by right wing nut jobs going to bomb the immigrant doing it\nYou would have a totally different spin on it and I heard a caller in your show Colin bad that before the man was a a ... that they thought it was Democrats all of the Republican\nRight and you learn our lives out there that have you heard what I said to that and I've also tweeted about it I think it was always ridiculous to assume this was some kind of false flag operation\nUm I don't I I I I Do not believe that there is a ... would be some kind of conspiratorial Democrats would be willing to sacrifice himself\nOr in order to try to kill\nSome members of his own party ... none of that makes the least bit of sense so fine done you're right I mean ... but for you to assume do you think that things are say on this guy represents I'm a big segments of the Republican Party\nNo okay well we lost him because he clearly does not I I honestly I I was the last night was in Minneapolis\nWith a dentist Prager Larry Elder and our friend ed Marcy from hot air and their eight hundred people there are nearly and\nI honestly and there's no one no one out there and says oh gosh I Wish some of these bombs in reach Maxine Waters and and Hillary Clinton\nI assure you I have never before endorsed of pain relief product not until now not in through a relief factor came along
