it\nOh he doesn't like that's that's a big punishment [laughter] okay fine but I always call it anyway thank you all for calling in and uh\nI have to say you know I'm a little crazed about accuracy I Am\nTruth to me is the truth is what is it they used to say 'cause I mean this is next to guarding this truth is next the golfing\nComing this is a close third I think it's up there because if you tell the truth and you smell bad uh got to say my attraction to the truth is minimized I I Will admit I admitted incidentally\nYou know my view I I\n... a bad mood to a bad body odor\nAnd just like you take a shower to get rid of your body odor you have to take a shower as it were to get rid of your bad move that's right that's my analogy we shower and brush our teeth in large measure for us\nWe shower and brush our teeth in large measure for others as we should so to wash away your bad mood if you can\nAnd you can a lot more than you think unless there's a you know there may well be a physiological source and that that's a separate issue\nThe happiness our theme today is a biggie Harris my list my friends only have like a rooted up during the break health friend's\nChildren parents\nOh and marriage of course marriage so that was a six items very few people have them all really good so you have to get happiness where you can maybe one of maybe if you don't have any of the others\nAnd you have friends that can compensate maybe if you don't have any of the others and you have marriage now have to save this health is a health issue we generics health is unique because\nIf you don't have any if you don't have friends who don't have happiness from friends or children or parents were worker marriage and you have your health\nWell that's not enough\nHealth care health is health is more capable of ruining your happiness than it is of giving happiness so it it it it but I'm sure it has to be on the list because I'm living in reality\nFind happiness where you can okay that's the point instead of concentrating on where you don't have it All right and every body on let's go to your calls one ape Prager\nSeven seven six and\nJulie in Chicago I've been waiting for ... for many years Hi Julie\nThis feeling is mutual so thank you thank you so much for taking my call on my question to you\nIs is um is there merit and trying to improve the areas of your life that you don't that don't bring you happiness as opposed to accepting a status quo and and you sort of credit and looking for happiness\nBut it's a wonderful question uh my my my answer would be\nThat you do both you you uh [noise] you can't in other words you can't wait until that success for you to be happy you can say oh when I fix this I'll be happy you have to be happy wall fixing so I Want you to fix if you can\nIf one of those areas where two or three of those areas are or not sources of happiness I Would love you to pursue those areas but you can't the for being happy until those those successfully\nAccomplished so that makes sense\nAbsolutely it's a very good answer I think it [laughter]\nOh You're welcome thank you that's the best\nQuestion answer good\n[noise] uh I like that\nWhat if you do this is from ... what if you do if the other person in your life fails to realize this can you be happy with someone who has a real I was just talking about a a a a love interest you're talking about a friend\n...\nWell I Would answer it let's say even spouse let's say you have a spouse that isn't on board and in these matters that twice said then you still have the hopefully health friend's children parents or work I'm remember or not end or\nTo be sources of happiness this is so I wasn't I was kidding about nine point nine four seven six for three to four seven three six to but I'm not kidding about how important\nThis is\nAnd you can't that's why Julie's question was so important you can't pay this is how people live I'm not happy but I Will be happy when I get a raise\nWhen I have a better job when I moved to ah to Baltimore oh well as a bad choice I'm kidding Baltimore I'm kidding I'm totally kidding there'll be offended okay when I get married when I have children when my children got to get married\nWhen I live right right that's good when I lose this weight that's right yes there's always a wet and I'll be happy when you can't do I'll be happy when\n[laughter]\n... that's the boys than all this time until when that happens is wasted\nOn ... and you don't know how much time you'll get anyway you know people die young just for the record\nYou don't you don't we don't have any guarantees you celebrate what you can now\nYes it's very important\nThe when issue ... people have that up that I have talked about but not as the women issue I like

those categories and I'm just wondering I mean you know I think it's easier how their happiness our I mean if\nIf you are you know sort of been a successful and all those areas I Know that if I were successful in those areas I Would probably have that happiness our I'm On my show every every day I mean\nNow it's a young okay mackerel that okay it's a very important and difficult question because I I really do have to open up to you I of all most listeners of a long time you know I have not had a pain free life by any means\nI've been divorced and uh it was a very painful period in my life\nAnd if the only time in thirty five years of broadcasting where I had two years well broadcasting was one of my ... to the end of my marriage or my Seventeen years and I\nI went through a lot as a result of that or I mean it's not been a smooth road in my life\nI did not grow up in a happy child I became happy in high school but before that I I was not happy so in fact if I didn't have all of the pain that I've had I don't think I could do happiness so in ... the question has merit\nI think if you if you have everything that I listed with no glitches\nAnd I think about ten percent of the population does one out of ten people I think ... might well I don't think you could do what happiness our I don't think I could have written a happy this book I wrote the name of my book is to give away happiness is a serious problem\nIf I had all these things how can I write a book happiness is a serious problem I Would write a book happiness was effortless\nLet's look at the book would have
