bad\nOkay and this is not to say that politics is unimportant in your new book which is hosted up at our website the book is called them why we hate each other\nAnd how to heal and it's already a best seller and it should be a very important book but one of the points that you make again and again and again is politics didn't get into this mess and politics isn't going to get us out what do you mean by that\n[noise] yeah so I'm sure we're gonna talk something today about politics and life does matter so I don't want to mislead an ever your audience and thing but it doesn't it truly does\nBut what we're going through right now even in the calf and our politics really didn't originate in our politics I think we need to know kind of where we are an economic and cultural history and we're going through a digital revolution which is awesome and lots of ways\nWe're going to produce more total goods and services than the world has ever known and all of human history a partly because of this is it a revolution but one of the things that it does is it enables humans to think that we can be ruthless at exactly the same time that we have a lot for social science literature now confirming what people have\nKnown for millennia of through philosophy and be allergy which is being rooted makes you happy do you have a family or do you have a few deep friendships do you have meaningful work do you have shared vocation some projects with co workers in your community the local Washington community if you have those things you tend to be happy that's about rooted nuts\nAnd yet our technology is letting us be ruthless and we haven't figured out the habits for this digital age this this route lift age and so traditional tribes good tribes family friends workplace et cetera there and collapse and so we're trying to find meaning grand good and evil meaning of politics and it's not going to work\nAnd and this is I think an important point that I can of emphatically agree with is that part of what has happened here\nWith um Americans believing that you're either all on our side on the other side and the other side is pure evil and our site is pure good\nThat kind of political talk flows from the fact that people don't have more what used to be called normal uh relationships in support systems and so they look to politics I was thinking\nI did you follow the story senator I'm sure you did a of New York in Portland, Oregon there were fights in the streets between Proud Boys and ...\nAnd and the two groups of of Todd's who seem to get great pleasure about

isolated out there I Am in past writing have written about\nThe uh the notion that a lot of people live and sort of suburban Fort Apache where they're prepared to defend their home turf against hostility\nBut they don't really have a lot of alliances even right next door and that's one of the themes in them why we hate each other and how to heal it's the new book by Senator Ben Sasse\nThe senator from Nebraska many many of our listeners were extremely grateful senators ask for your common sense and perspective during the Kavanaugh hearings\n'em ... before we we get back to that and where we go after the Kavanaugh hearings you were talking before about teenagers\nAnd how isolated teenagers are by age and they have in today's world very often are not serious relationships with people who are older\nOr even people who are younger and a ... one of the cures to that it always seems to me is provided right in that religious context you're talking about which is the Sabbath\nThe idea of one day a week where a lot of these other demands\nA take precedence I was just reading about President Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd she tormented his six children and they were all required to go to church with him on Sunday and then they would have a Sunday dinner and that was required for the kids and a lot of them resented it of course as adults they were grateful for it\nOr what about that as a means to heal as you talk about in your book\nUh yes I Am a man uh so I mean the ... tradition at does maybe be recovered and you do see places in both Judaism and Christianity now where people are recovering it\nUm the ... the intergenerational stuff you were talking about a minute ago kids are less happy if they spend their whole life as a Fifteen year old or an Fifteen year olds 'cause they're not a lot of wisdom there there's constant immediacy and there's value in knowing not just forty five year olds but Seventy five year olds\nAnd so and the crowd her die who's written a pretty interesting book called the cat lives family\nA local guy and he he talks about one hour a day one day a week one week a year they lock up all their technology\nAnd there are people in that tradition that haven't dealt with them now they're jokingly say they're trying to be almost almost Amish out with their approach to acknowledge what they mean is all the technology you can use in your work environments\nBut being really self conscious about the ways that technology can crowd out real satisfying human relationships\nAnd your family and in your social life there's a bunch of data now and the happiness literature which shows if you go from a few hundred five hundred social media friends are from five hundred to a thousand social media friends you don't get any happier I covered that's in them\nUm why we hate each other and out of jail um but if you know the person who lives two doors away from your in your neighborhood your statistically much more likely to be happy and it's got a few invite people over for Sunday lunch or or Saturday I found that the punch or if you have people over for dinner and of course of the week um you get happier\nYou'd you'd get into a service posture would realize your whole life isn't about your own consumption and you start to build was a girl relationships in a neighborhood that aren't transactional and they end up making you happier and so I Try to spend a lot of the book on that constructive kind of topic\nAnd dance Senator Ben Sasse senator from Nebraska his new book a them why we hate each other and how to heal\nA let let's talk for just a moment about the aftermath of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight and thank goodness you were a very cheap part of winning that fight for a justice Kavanaugh and I'm sure he's going to be a big credit to the Supreme Court and do a terrific job\nBut what about this idea I I Know your colleagues Senator Graham and some others have talked about not letting it go going after the Lakers and the people who set up the ugliness that America saw going after Dianne Feinstein for instance I'd do you think that's productive\nAh I I don't know the right path from here in the Judiciary Committee that it is broken as the committee on which wasn't there and I said that they're loving loving Republicans and Democrats\nEdited a terribly broke and circus right now um it didn't serve anybody who are kids or the cabin our family or the Ford family or a search for facts and truth it didn't hurt anybody well because the Senate and the Judiciary Committee in particular decided they wanted to be\nGet the Senate and the Judiciary Committee in particular decided that it wanted to be swallowed by cable news television instant instant certainty on everything\nWe did a really really bad job as a United States Senate but senator Feinstein's team did some really horrible despicable fangs\nWhich I Do think we need to sort out how did we get to a place where these allegations were always treated in the circus like atmosphere as the first bite at the apple when I sat on the Judiciary Committee now for two years\nWe'd get lots of allegations all over the map about stuff ends up being real some it ends up being great from it ends up being clearly made up\nPolitical hits and there's a way to deal with that with the FBI and then in the Senate confidential process\nThat does it start with everything as cable uh reality t._v. screaming and there were people in our Judiciary Committee who decided that's what they wanted to start and the tie that back to the theme of our half an hour to gather here\nI really do think there is a desperation for some of our political addicts and Washington to try to act like blood sport politics\nOr forever more is what they want well they don't really love their neighbor they don't really care about your listeners kids and grandkids because they're not trying to solve long term problems they're trying to make politics and our other gladiatorial fight and that's not going to work in a republic\nYeah I mean somehow World Wrestling entertainment is not what you want for uplift of of the kids are from the American future a speaking speaking of which one of the things that last night I I I gave a talk or to a neighborhood group bleeding had a couple of hundred people there was great\nBut there's this general sense that our politics is broken and I found myself ... when it's being to you today\nA talking a little bit of a would I be wrong to say that the Nebraska Legislature which is non partisan and you and a camera on there's only one house in the legislature that things work a little bit better in your state than they do and many others\nAnd they do a ... there's a sense of printing constantly for the cameras and even though my state is you know one of the four or five most conservative states in the union and that's one of the reasons I as one of the most\nConservative or rather than the United states elected from here\nEven though we're a very conservative ... probably two to one Republican legislature people do not officially ... really parties and argue that camera all our one one house a state legislature and so what people are mostly doing is wrestling with ... gr term pragmatic question\nHow do you get a good infrastructure and highway and bridges bell that's cost effective\nUh they're less certainty that you're going to find the line between good and evil of for people who might have slightly different priorities which bridge in which highway to find it's a much healthier thing to do bridges and roads by politics\nInstead of trying to do a good and evil heaven and hell but ... if\nIf federal politics do what they should in America the constitutional for them we can maintain a framework for ordered liberty approaching the idea that people are created with dignity and the image of God and they have rights by nature and government is our shared project to secure those right\nGovernment is the author folks are right then government could do a small number of big bang\nOr we need to build the fiber of strategy for the digital age et cetera but then most of what's meaningful can happen back in communities where people actually live next door to their neighbors\nWhat ... what a concept change from the bottom up not the top down that's part of the theme of them why we hate each other and how to heal it's the new bestseller by Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska\nAll I can say is keep it up senator we need you there in Washington and across the country\nOn the book
