M. E. Y. E. R.\nV. discovery Institute is one of my favorite places these are a bunch of scientists\nWho have the audacity to believe that there was actually a divine and\nThey create are involved in the universe which is to me is the single most rational position one can have the notion that intelligence comes from um intelligence is not intelligent that was a new one like that I think we need a microphone here in the right you're not a\nI think we gotta we look like my guest is Dr Steven Meyer\nAnd his latest book he is editor of is a collection of essays the aesthetic evolution a scientific philosophy for philosophical and theological critique\nOf the notion that a God that is behind evolution and there's a critique of that so let's go to evolution itself I periodically have you on as far as I'm concerned that could have you on every day\nAnd I mean I adore your wife or your work\nAnd you have the requisite scientific background to to answer these issues fish that you just reported that the royal society in London would have a conference on\nAnd tell me if my summary is is is fair\nTenable to continue to believe in the Darwinian notion of a of a creative power of mutation and natural selection as soon as the key proposition that that's right under consideration so so\nWhat you were led me to wander stand and I was stuck on evolution much of my life I didn't really care I Believe in God is the creator and and the methodology did not interest me but I don't want to believe in or even be it must take about something that\nBut believe it or even be if not stick about something that just isn't a pill by scientists so what's the biggest weakness\nThe biggest weakness I think has to do with the problem of the origin of form new innovation of a new fundamentally new forms of life\nBut that requires a prior innovation and that is innovation of information the creation of information since Watson and Crick in Nineteen fifty three\nWe have understood that information and the digital form inscribed along the spine of the DNA molecule is essentially running the show at the cellular level and biology if you wanted if you want to build a new form of animal life you've got to have new tissues and cells types but new cell types require new dedicated proteins to service them\nAnd pro teams are constructed on the basis of the information uh for character code that is stored in the DNA molecule\nSo new form requires new information\nAnd the and as we've understood more about the digital nature of the information that really isn't it's alphabetical type of graphic or digital and character\nAnd uh and we understand that by reference to their own experience with computer code\nThe idea that you could randomly start to change very specific arrangements of characters that are designed to construct one thing and turn them into another message that will constructed another completely different thing it's implausible you take a section of computer code and start randomly changing the zeroes and ones\nYou're not going to produce a new program or operating system you're going to introduce glitches and bugs and you'll ... ultimately destroy the function of the original sequence that you had\nAnd the genetic sequences similarly vulnerable to that kind of\nA random a mutation will change and yet the new Darwinian invoke random mutations the agent of innovation the agent of creation when in fact it's either a an Asian of destruction or it can and introduce very minor preserve ... changes that might slightly weaker optimize\nOur eyes I hear you say this I'm thinking of all the ... pre eminent scientists of the last hundred years who have believed what you say is not\nTenable what does that say if you are right what does that say about
