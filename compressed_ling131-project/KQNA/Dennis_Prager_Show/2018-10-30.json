them most die that is essentially you meet to July ...\nThat's why hip and with all the Jewish babies most die\nSo it's a it's been a\n... it's a very serious hatred but again my my question is do you think it's increasing in the United states where do you think that that's a exaggerated\nI I it is increasing I'm a ... but it's increasing to my opinion on the left aware or anti Zionism as substitute for anti Semitism anti Semitism is a form of anti Semitism I ... a folks if if you have any intellectual integrity you look knowledge that I'll\nJust say that the only state in the world the only people on earth do I have no right to a country oh the Jews is anti Semitic okay if you if you think Italians don't have a right to Italy then you're ready to tell you to tell you even if you

show\nSome of the worst in our country but there are also some stories\nThat show the very best\nAnd one of those stories\nAs it struck me and I'd like to begin with is before we talk to a little ... from Pittsburgh it's another story about Pittsburgh and about the way that this entire nightmarish attack was handled which is very very much to the credit of some of the participants ah there is a

that people would have criticized him\nDeath [laughter] I Know I should be expanding on that I mean basically yeah and\nI really don't want to get into it because I mean I agree with the rabbi of a tree of life a rubber Myers and that's one of my shows and she said he's my president and I just welcome here and hopefully he'll be greater\nI respectfully and you know five or five people because he's the president on stage and not only that and I hope he takes away what I Would really offered media but it's been here this week I think\nPeople are really getting at what a wonderful wonderful community we have here\nAnd how tightly knit it is and\nI got to get off on a tangent here but I mean I think one of the things this guy wanted to do which was came right to kill your kind of did that he wanted to do damage somehow to our community and quite the opposite as has happened I mean it's it's come together and we are and\nHow much eight well you know the terrible thing and it is certainly not people murdered and our town\nBut it it shined a light on really what is it like a jewel of a community chew out your Jewish community and show a broader community\nWell the broader community I saw this morning that the Muslim community of Pittsburgh has raised a hundred and Ninety thousand dollars a year to help their Jewish neighbors you saw that\nHad fantastic and a ... attack at the surface of the night there were just every every ... at the at the federal I went through this morning I'm In the entire Pittsburgh Steelers can for the for the for the visit\nAnything really right yeah that's what I\nSaw Franco Harris outside of the show and that's what I think it was Brett keys or what news that I mean a giant among a fabulous small jurors that they're pushing one of the caskets and while I mean it's it's\nThe parents are everywhere something tonight on that thing if it really hit the community heart and this is going to sound crazy but you know\nIt shouldn't happen anywhere and plays and group of people can deal with this is the Jewish community and the community Pittsburgh\nUm what what uh what do you think the ah the president should or should say a ... when he lands and what should he avoids say\nWell I mean I think he should know gift to officers and talk about ah\nAnti Semitism and what a terrible thing it is and I mean those are the kinds of things that would help any politicians and and and how he mourns along with us and how he feels the grief\nOr along with us and now you know he\nNow feels this solidarity with is certainly still shows up with the state of Israel and not in those kinds of things that you're wonderful comics them back I mean\nHow many people are trying to political politicized this of course people who are not part of our community and people who are here and they're starting to make it uh the I I just [noise]\nThey should not do it when Abraham I ... in my column I talked about Abraham going into the city of Saddam is gone and trying to find a pen rights is a man that good man\nWell he wasn't going to like you know I've not read the fine nice people he was going into the worst place on earth to try and find good people and so I mean generally speaking I I think that um we certainly have to respect the office and hopefully he'll be wherever he goes I mean\nUs and hopefully he'll be wherever he goes I mean help you treated that way not just politics one way or the other I think it's because it's awesome it's unfortunate and I think it's a good or better\nAt it it is and and again ... out of respect for the losses that the families feel I ah I just read a that apparently the sixty six year old physician I I forget his name Jerry yeah he who you know you know\nThere are better with that I bought a new look it's crazy I knew him he we haven't I have multiple sclerosis and there's a spike team that rights under my name it he writes with all the people in our group I said you're you're riding with our group will put on a short be part of our group is now I'm I like to go down alone\nAlone person and uh [noise] so anyway\nHe was that he was apparently ... from the initial response but he rushed in to line of fire because as a physician he was trying to help people who were wounded or something\nToday that he ... the most well some of it he doesn't have any kids\nOr what ever anyone in the community would die he went to college for them because he didn't have anyone to say cash for him but I Know the average you in the city of Pittsburgh and every ... around the world district that will be getting up and saying ... ...\nA memorial rare and and honor the departed you let me let me pick up something in in some of the little time we have left ... one of the things that struck me about your column you referenced\nThe portion of the ... the Jews everywhere around the world in Pittsburgh and in Seattle and in Tel Aviv and income undo every Jewish congregation was reading the same story of Abraham bargaining with God to try to save the citizens of Saddam\nAnd a very great rabbi the last generation whose name you know rabbi Moshe Feinstein asked a question about it\nAnd he asked the question why is ... why is Abraham are concerned about these evil people these citizens of Saddam y and Z bargaining and there'll be have\nA drive to save the whole city for the sake of a few righteous people and the answer that it gives the says look when it says love your neighbor as yourself it's easy to love people share your values\nIt's easy to people who agree with you what's hard is finding loving your hard for people who are completely opposite of you and that was what Abraham was doing a\nI read something on a ... Rabbani sack I'm not sure but he said only by acknowledging the humanity of the author during an altered in ourselves and you're right I mean I think that a lot of mankind it's very hard to love your neighbor special if Yunior my neighbor just\nCare [laughter] of looking at it what what would you had to contribute to all of this is is so profoundly important and\nAnd again and I hope that the rest of the country can actually benefit from Pittsburgh to example and to be stronger I I didn't know that the Steelers actually showed up at the funerals\nUh today and ... and again that's that's a beautiful thing and ah maybe maybe in merits of the departed um ... we can\nWe can all do better in in terms of the spirit of community larger community for our country was posed new wife says
