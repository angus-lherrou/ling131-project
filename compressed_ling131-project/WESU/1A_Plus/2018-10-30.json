U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado north of Denver is reporter Michael ... Michael glad to have you with us\nHi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is reporter Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us I happened to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H M public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them in the weeks and months to come but\nAccounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth ... court in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting looked like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase that over the last midterm election so I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges if I had the ... election just couldn't turn out is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during presidential election so we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTony fourteen we had six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million at of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in the state\nMichael do you want to what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nWell it's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred Nineteen thousand of them\nAnd I'm more expected this morning a we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day and on election day and um it's a it's too early to tell but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the\nI'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots in\nAnd Brian agreement what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs falling out of those those national trends there's a there's there's many of the counties across the state of reporting a record or a near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting you know\nUh there's they requested in in one of the most populated counties Johnson county by near Kansas City uh they've had requests for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballot\nProbably let me stick with you how does early voting worked in Kansas to people tend to find it\nI think it's it's a county by county the way they decide um\nObviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the mail so vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request that you can get sent out um\nSo it it's kind of reasonably are open to people who'd like to early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas or we've had early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it\nI'm somewhat acceptable to to to vote or she would like to take that option\nWe heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research candidate amendment or proposition at leisure while completing the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado how's ... how does early voting work\nWell ah basically you get your ballot in the in the mail they mail it to you um you you got to do a lot of research in Colorado this year it is a very full ballot and um you go through the subjects one by one it's great because\nUh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro brew we love that here in Colorado and\nFill out that ballot and then um get it off in the mail or or\nSome other kind of relaxing recreational or kind of a cup of tea my whatever you want to do with\nThe ... um you know and so uh uh you know a lot of people I'm like this system in Colorado a but not everyone um you know that ... ... ... world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last\nUm and now you've got to think about a delivering it by hand or just going in on election day in voting I'm Glad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting are male and voting should bear in mind that there is a certain cut off\nBy which your ballot has to be received November six times and I I don't know how it is for your three states\nBut every state I've lived in election day is the day your ballot has to be in not just the day that your ballot has to be in a blue mailbox so that it comes to mind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be in an election officials hand\nOn election day not a postal carriers hand on election day to get some of your comments as to why you do or don't like voting early\nMitch tweeted I don't vote early details may change through election day I Want my vote to be cast exactly as it should be since there are no do overs or take back\nRachel is in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Rachel emailed I Love the convenience of early voting I don't have to worry about long lines or work or travel on election day that would prevent my voice being hurt\n... tweeted no early voting for us in Michigan we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day ... do you have to\nLie to vote early and Michigan for all practical matters yes so basically how it works in Michigan it's if you want an absentee\nBallot you have to ah basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say a and there are folks that go and say I'm going to be out of town\nAnd and why are they are also some other ways that you can get absentee ballots here in Michigan one is to be over sixty years old or another is may be due to religious reasons or if you were in jail awaiting arraignment or trial but no it is well known\nYou have to do with voting early or possibly can make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is that there are long waits let's say for example in the city of Detroit it's going to be cold and maybe the idea is that if you know you don't want to Seventy eight year old having to test it out by let's say in a wheelchair for three\nFour hours and wait to vote for that is one a one way that that you can get an absentee ballot\nWe're speaking to Philly Clark program director at Michigan Radio based in Ann Arbor Michael do you want to an investigative reporter with Kay you in the public radio in Greeley, Colorado and Brian ... who covers energy and the environment for K. E. M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas\nRicky tweeted I early voted because I have an hour commute and a twelve hour a day on Tuesdays I liked being able to look up all of the issues and candidates I was more informed and took more time with my ballot voting from home\nAmen to that ... I have done the exact same thing especially living in California where our voter guide was about as big as I think one if not two of the hobbit novels like stacked on top of one of it was a ridiculously fit guide and it just took a little time to go through so I hear you on that\nOnline at W.

you W public radio\nIn Wichita, Kansas today we're introducing won a across America will be spending the next two years traveling to communities across the country that don't tend to play an outsized role in national elections before ... come come back to ... let me get to a few more of your comments Linda tweeted\nI voted in Hamilton County Ohio over a week ago no lines was fast and easy\nCounty is in Illinois and county wrote on our Facebook page I'm choosing to vote on election day because I bring my children and want them to see and feel the importance of this right\nAnd Melissa tweeted I Love to vote in person I enjoy seeing all of the people getting out to the polls and making their voices heard\nThe way I Love you to react to a message that one of our listeners since we're at one a vox pop from Michigan and told us three reasons that he's voting this year and all of his reasons for voting have to do with voting\n... from Michigan where all three branches of government or a Republican controlled and have been for a number of years\nThe main driver of my voting this year\nOr two constitutional amendments that try to rectify the Republican attempt to suppress or control election participation won't proposal aims to put redistricting in the hands of a nonpartisan commission\nThe other makes registering to vote easier makes absentee voting available to all\nAnd finally to permit straight ticket voting\nA voice mail Rosen through the ... what would you say the trucks call is that the kind of reflected in why a number of Michigan are voting this year well\nLet's say yes that I mean there he is speaking about proposal to which is a redistricting as he as Chuck said and then proposal three which is being called promote the vote and and that would allow no excuse absentee voting earlier of course we're talking about whether you have to lie or not to to get an absentee ballot that would change how that works um [noise]\nYes uh particularly a prop too which would create this independent commission has just sort of taken the state has been a a barn storm of a\nA ballot I Am most ballot initiatives like one would like to think right that it's some people some community folks who are like we want to change the law in Michigan let's gather together and let's go you know get enough signatures and put it on the ballot no no no that is not usually how it works in this state usually a\nOrganization some kind of a political organization pays\nFor signature sometimes a dollar two dollars per signature to get questions on the ballot but I'm the voters not politicians as prop to\nChanging redistricting a young woman Katie Faye he twenty eight years old when she started this all grass roots organization got four hundred fifty thousand signatures\nAgain grass roots volunteers to get this question of redistricting on the ballot and this is just sort of fascinated both voters and political watchers in general\nHeard from a number of you who are reacting to some of these initiatives in Michigan pat emailed in Michigan's seniors over sixty are allowed absentee ballots I Love not having to stand in line at the polls\nThis year a referendum called promote the vote is on the ballot which would allow anyone to use an absentee ballot too many people having trouble getting to the polls on election day\nAnd John emailed I live in Ann Arbor Michigan I voted with an absentee ballot\nWith the voters not politicians group and supportive prop too which is passed will make Michigan one of only a handful of states with fear of voter district de ... what's the the kind of the split in terms of who is supporting these measures\nAnd who is opposing them is it kind of a partisan split or do Michigan voters tend to kind of agree that the time has come for this how how does that shake out\nWell I mean again if you're going to take this idea that this grassroots organization that four hundred and fifty thousand signatures one would portend that that is going to create some turn out on election day or for folks who got absentee ballots I'm\nBut you you have seen the Michigan chamber of commerce which tends to lean towards conservative Republican candidates ah come out against a proposal to you've got the freedom fund which is um\nI I get money from other device organization just last week or putting one point two million dollars against proposal to again this is about redistricting\nProposal three though which is the promote the vote which would allow an shrine I should say straight ticket voting automatic voter registration same day voter registration and no excuse absentee voting\nWe really haven't seen a a organization fall and wholeheartedly come out against this proposal because for many folks are not only are these popular ideas but\nA majority of states in the country twenty seven states in DC all allowed no excuse absentee voting\nMichael do you want to let me come to you with another proposition that seems to be energizing voters in Colorado and that might affect other races Jennifer's in Colorado and she left his voice mail explaining her view on prop one twelve listen\nOne twelve on our ballot this year would increase the distance between new oil development and any building that is designed for him and I see it would increase it to twenty five hundred feet which is less than half a mile and it's not unreasonable to me but the ...\nFires going to rain down from this guy it's ridiculous\nJennifer thanks for calling in Michael can you give us a little more context on prop one twelve particularly this couch or argument that ... says she's Jennifer ... she's been seeing on TV ads\nSure it will be a ... to put a finger pointing out at right now there are also a current step back distances which are\nA five hundred to a thousand feet depending on where where you are an ... supporters say supporters of on twelve say that the wells are you know just like Jennifer or or to already too close to people's homes schools places at work\nAnd that's a threat to their health because there are these are basically the industrial sites that are dangerous and uh the MIT pollutants um the oil so the other side of this is the oil and gas industry which is ... which is big and Colorado um they say a this measure what essentially run them out of business because\nUm it would be difficult to find sites that are twenty five hundred feet away for every potential new site\nA but just how difficult that is will you know that's debatable the the state's oil and gas conservation commission\nUm did a study a is saying that as much as eighty five percent of new development would be halted\nAre but there was an analysis from um another one of the Colorado School of mines that used a slightly different methodology\nAre taking into account possible drilling strategies and they came up with fifty eight percent so still in either case you know the industry says that's a lot of business for them that would be lost in with it\nUm there are jobs in a potential economic impact um estimates are into the billions of dollars one real high estimate was four hundred and Seventy billion dollars\nUm but you know let's go back to the other side of supporters\nIt's now about five percent of the state's economy here or there are about thirty thousand direct jobs um and ah you know they um note that the um uh current oil and gas operations those wouldn't be affected at all\nOne W ...\nAttack on the Pittsburgh synagogue reminds us just how vulnerable houses of worship can be our faith

Springs Texas earlier this year there was of course the church shooting in Charleston South Carolina a few years of a few years ago what is it about places of worship\nThat make them such targets [noise] well I think one thing Joshua is that places of worship segregate people according to their religion and to some extent according to their ethnicity or race so\nIf you want to target and Jews where would you go you go to a synagogue cars going to be all Jews there if you want to target Muslims you can go to a mosque if you want to target black people you can go to a predominantly black church I mean so it's convenient in that sense you know in this in the sense that it allows the\nThe perpetrator to sort of zero in on the people that he wants to hurt\nIt's also really a challenge to

largest Methodist Church\nBack in Nineteen Ninety he founded the church of the resurrection in Lee would Kansas that's suburb of Kansas City the goal was to attract what he calls thinking Christians with little or no engagement in their faith\nToday it has more than twenty thousand members across four campuses it's considered one of the most influential mega churches in the nation\nPastor Hamilton says that he has observed deep divisions within his congregation that reflect the nation's divides what's his plan to get people of faith thinking differently we discussed it this summer when we were both in Aspen, Colorado for this year's Aspen Ideas festival here's the first part of our conversation\nJoshua what's great to be with you today thank you describe your congregation United Methodist church of the resurrection in leave would Kansas\nOr tell us about your company that sure we'll leave it as a suburb of Kansas City we've got four campuses throughout Kansas City to downtown

found out that forty nine point two five percent of our people are Republicans and fifty point seven five percent of our people are divided between independents and Democrats\nThe Republicans were divided between conservatives and ... you know conservatives on social issues and those were moderate progressive on social issues but conservative fiscally but Democrats\nWe're pretty divided congregation and I think we represent the country you know fairly well they're kind of divided within divisions ... exactly that's exactly right and so it's an interesting thing when you come you know you have to as a religious leader\nSpeak about the issues that are happening in the world you know I'd I constantly have not constantly but I regularly get emails from folks saying well you know you're being too political I Wish you and talk about politics and\nAnd I have to say okay wait a minute I'm not standing endorsing candidates I'm not even talking about the candidates\nBut what you're calling politics I'm calling ethics and morals and values when we're talking about\nJustice issues we're talking about people who are being hurt\nWe're talking about moral issues we're talking about ... and so if you think about what forms or politics what is it is it just thirty second soundbites on you know and radio spots or TV spots for a campaign or is it a deeper sense of spirituality in a deeper sense of the meaning of life and why we're here and and surely I pray that\nWhen you're doing your politics\nYou're doing it through the lens of a deeper moral system to value system\nHow much you as a as a pastor is a minister lean into the political debate\nAnd a religious lens on them as opposed to trying to have times where you may be lean away from them like I imagine there are some weeks where you think let's just do a sermon on you know typing earlier I just do is turn on the story of the garden of anything but\nYeah so here's a so for the folks who are upset by it they feel like I'm doing it all the time\nBut here's the way I Try to look at it is um if I were reacting to the news stories every week and in particular in the ... been the Trump era there's always some you know big thing that's happened in the last week I Would be rewriting my sermon every every Saturday\nBased on what happened in the news that week and then probably Sunday Morning fan and again probably something morning and so what I've said it's a that's not how I'm going to do this I outlined my sermons a year in advance you know actually I have ideas for two years in advance and yet somewhere in the ...\nPeople are hearing so much news all the time and so much political rhetoric and so much divisiveness that when they come to church I'm not sure they always need one more\nYear round of what they're already getting every day\nSo what I'm trying to do is is carefully choosing where one of the moments when I Need to say something this is this has to you know something has to be that when there was a school shooting\nAnd even then there's so many school shootings I'd be preaching about school shootings too you know or violence in in our society so I said we're going to talk about that a couple of times this year but I'm not going to talk about it every Sunday\nI Try to build into the into the year at least one sermon series it's going to be focused on Christian ethics the entire series we're going to look at one of the issues that were that are dividing us or one of the issues we're facing and our society and then we're going to take a look and see how you know for it to be a permanent and not just a an ethical lacking electron ethics\nWe're gonna look to see how to scriptures speak into this how does our faith shape our response to these things I Want to try to do the approach I tried to take us to say okay I Know we're divided about these things I'm I'm gonna try to help you see things through the eyes of the other and so we're going to try to understand what might be the truth and this complex moral issue that this one side has\nWhat does this side of bringing to the tables were having this conversation and then I'm going to say now you know with all the humility I can muster you can disagree with me but this is how I see this issue right now I could be wrong but to see this issue right now\n... guns as a as a great example of this and uh recently I preach the sermon on gun violence in schools I did a sermon on a on gun control and and gun legislation to a year ago [noise]\nAnd as I did that you know I surveyed the congregation and laid out some basic common sense kind of measures that one can take to um\nTo address the prevalence of guns and how easy access to them and [noise] and it was interesting how how many people agreed on both the left and the right on some of these basic things now that sounds like potentially risky ground because it begins to ...\nWould what would we as people of faith how how might we respond\nTo you know the issues of shootings in school so the shootings in the schools is the presenting or just violence in our communities is presenting issue and so and obviously there's no guns in the Bible but there are swords and spears so he got plenty of plenty of places where we talk about\nHow do we respond to people who are our enemies so we've got Jesus saying love your enemy is we've got Paul talking about you know doing good to those that would harm you you know you've got a lot of things you could [noise] so so there's a part of that that is going to be about those basic biblical principles but then there's going to be another part that is going to say so are there any solutions and is there any way that we as people of faith\nOn the left in the right can come together to find some solutions and in the end we found that more than two thirds of our people who were gun owners agreed with us for you know we lifted up four or five basic things that people said yes that that makes sense and in the end you know part of what we did as I said you know\nFor those of you know it's easy sometimes in the ... in the world around us to think that those people are and they are in RA are all gun toting nuts\nBut I I have friends and people who I loved dearly who are in the in our and they love to hunt and they're not gun toting nuts and they grieve every time there's a shooting in the school on the other side you know you've got the these aren't people who want to take all your guns away\nThese are people who want to figure out we've got we've got to do something we got to come together so when you can when you can treat both sides as human beings and you can help them hear each other it opens the door to finding answers\nWhat does your congregation want from its religious experience at your church do they want a place to deal with the social issues\nThat they want a refuge from the politics of the day do they just want you to stick to the scripture but do they want you to be more prosthetic on the issues of our times what is your congregation expressing to you know the answer is yes [laughter] I don't know if I get emails\nAcross the spectrum I have people who are like you know I it just it makes me so mad when you talked about what you know what's going on\nAnd uh but I've got other folks are like so immigration on the border when a when the children are being separated from the news broke about that\nYou know I'm hearing this News I'm out of town I'm hearing this news throughout the week I'm studying and I'm like do I talk about that this Sunday or do I spend another week really trying to see how it's going to resolve because I have a feeling within a week it's going to be it will start to be resolved and sure enough within a week there was an executive order and it's not all resolved but\nAnd I have people who are really mad like why didn't you you should have preached on this this weekend and I had other people were like thank you for not preaching on this weekend and the next week and I did I did that it was Father's Day weekend I did talk about it but um\nSo I it's all over the map on that are there but here we we also serve the Carter who's ... we find out we were doing a worship survey to find out about music and different things what they what they want but we asked about the sermons which the Germans or do you find most compelling than the number one response was when Adam deals with current issues where he's dealing with what's going on in the world\nBut for every person says that there's somebody else who's saying I Wish you wouldn't do that and you just stick to talking about love\nWe're speaking to Adam Hamilton to founding pastor of the United Methodist Church or the resurrection in league with Kansas outside Kansas City\nIs the author of more than two dozen books his latest is called unafraid living with courage and hope in uncertain times I Wonder pastor Hamilton how you see the United Methodist Church more broadly dealing with social issues dealing with\nAnd the government name from eleven AM to one PM units you\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station [noise] I'm from farmers insurance committed to helping people understand the ins and outs of insurance so they can prepare for life stepson down coverage options and more information can be found at farmers dot com\nAnd from American University's ... school of business committed to business being a force for meaningful change through graduate in to undergraduate degrees mission driven curriculum and hands on approach Morris co God God I'm Eric and ... we've heard so much\nAnd being sent by President Trump but it's not a one way street here's some of the messages you left in our inbox\nThis is Steve from suburban Park Maryland my concern is the constant resorting to violence and quote quote in your face politics and actions by both sides the left and the right the Dems and the Republicans\nHounding people out of restaurants is not a good way to start a good civil political discourse\nWas uh Tom from well I hear your focused on the political like when he seemed to more of violence benefiting the political left as an example Hillary Clinton saying that it will not be suitable until later on power what's the opposite of being civil bumping by\nMy name is Audrey I was in the synagogue when the shooter came in we need to stop teaching hate everyone who hates has been taught whom and how to uh rationally blame accused threatening\nTarget we've lost some of the finest people in our community people always put loving and caring ahead of everything\nWe do is teach our children that for thousands of years we've been the targets and we expect that it will continue\nIt's our job to be stronger and to keep trying to teach everyone a better way of life but\nWe've lost these particular tones and the canvas of our congregations we've lost their chair and their laughter and their boundless optimism may their souls be bound and the bonds of life eternal we are greatly reduced without them\nYou're always welcome to add your voice to the conversation feel free to leave us a voice mail at eight five five to three six one a one a let's say five five to three six one to one to\nHow we move forward as one is something we talked about with pasture Adam Hamilton he founded the church of the resurrection which is America's largest Methodist Congress\nCongregants and pastors are both split almost fifty fifty between Democrats and Republicans that rising partisanship is particularly challenging for pastors like Hamilton and that's what we pick up the conversation how do you\nHelp your congregation see themselves as children of God first I think it's very easy today to just see people as jets and sharks this kind of political ... which to me is both boring and the humanizing right and it's just negate the three dimensional allegory of of humanity\nI Wonder how you as a faith leader especially with a gigantic congregation that help the people being one another in an equivalent way and and through and around and pass the politics yeah so that is\nSomething that we talked about regularly and I try to model for them\nThe modeling of treating people with dignity and respect and hearing their voices and not that they're all equal voices but just being able to treat people I mean the so and the drink juice up to how sixteen I had our our congregation memorized ... versus\nA do it others as you have them do unto you I Hope you'll have this memorized already but if you don't we're gonna memorize that and I want you to think about that every time you have a conversation about politics\nWhat does it mean to do unto others as you have them do unto you and then there was a a ... I think I actually have three I think the second one was love your neighbors you'll have yourself so what does it mean to love your neighbor who's a Democrat or Republican or somebody across the our somebody's ... loves Trump or somebody who hates Trump how are you going to love them\nYou know in the end God God doesn't really care so much about what you thought about this or that President gutters deeply about whether you love your fellow human beings and John says if you can't love your neighbor who you can see how can you say you love God you can't see\nAnd uh and so we talked about that in another one was a passage from Paul where he says let no evil talk come out of your mouth but only what is useful for building\nSocial media how are you allow your words to give grace to others as opposed to the humanizing them or you know so if you can\nFollow him on past it offers some people who we just need to lead have it feels\nSo good I mean really like we're having this debate about civility right now you know and I feel like it's just it's shoes satisfying\nTo take the moral high ground and say what you know those people whoever those people are are need the here and I have the answer and you need to hear it and this is America and doggone it\nIt's my turn to talk and I'm tired of bite my tongue judge now feels to satisfy the finally let her read I think that's exactly right I think that's what we feel that we have to guard against I think it\nIt naturally now there's not this isn't saying don't share what you think but sharing what you think in a way that reflects the humility like I could be wrong about this I don't think so but I could be wrong about this\nAnd that treats the other is a human being is really important and most of the time when we send those zingers out it feels really good and what if I'm quoting the Bible I Know one right 'cause it came out of the Bible yeah yeah yeah well that goes back to our question about the second ago about the nuances the Bible and how we read the Bible it's not quite as simple that cause I can pull out\nI can pull it up first and I can then you with a thousand different versus\nThat aren't really in keeping with the spirit of scripture but I certainly pulled out one versus out and made it made it saying\nHere's the thing especially when it comes to complex arguments political or moral arguments is you cannot have a complex argument\nIn two hundred and eighty characters on Twitter ... with a double the amount of space we have so we went from a hundred and forty to two hundred eighty you can't do it you can't have those kind of arguments and you're you know a nifty responses on Facebook to somebody's post\nAnd you also when it comes to posting on Facebook to figure out how can I so here's the thing I challenged people pastors across the country we talked about prophetic preaching and prophetic preaching has to do is saying the hard things you know in addressing\nDo you want to irritate people are influenced them it irritating people's easy it's just not hard to say something that's going to\nHurt their feelings or irritate them or make the mad\nBut if you actually want to change somebody's mind or you want to influence their thinking you've got to figure out how do I do that\nSo if you if you're on Facebook and you want to influence your family and friends who might have different views you got to say how could I Do that in a way that my mom who feel totally opposite of me might actually go well I hadn't thought of it that way before\nAnd that's why you know when it comes to preaching on controversial issues I typically my approach is to say here's why thoughtful people on this side see this see this well here's what buffalo people in this let's see if this way both quoting the Bible\nHere's where I come out I appreciate the folks on that side on this side I find myself more compelled by this but if you're on the other side no how much I Love you and you I mean I've had people come and go I came in and I knew you were preaching this and I was gonna hate your sermon 'cause I kind of had a feeling where you're going to let it came in ready to hate oh yeah yeah but then the way you approached my side\nOpen my ears and my heart to hear what you had to say\nThat kind of be hard for you though was a pastor I Know you're not trying to do harm no just personally in your own and I I Know I got to let you go shortly but in your own spiritual walk\nI Wonder how you are dealing with this as someone who has a tremendous responsibility over a huge congregation who knows the obligation on a pastor\nAnd who's trying I'm sure trying not to hurt anybody and doesn't like being told I was ready to start arming Iraq believe it started to\nBefore I let you go pastor Hamilton how are you dealing with this what's your spiritual walk like these days to be prophetic and helpful and resilient in these crazy time I actually feel like that's a a that's a part of the\nAnd how God is wired me so I I feel grateful to have a chance to do that and and I feel energized by having a congregation is divided in that um\nA polarized nation and we're we're a place it's are defining value is love so if we can't figure out how to do this together in our congregation\nWhat hope is there for the world so I Want you to be in a small group or a Bible study or Sunday school class of people who disagree with you in a way to figure out how do you listen to each other and treat each other as brothers and sisters and how do you come out with a stronger view a better view veteran form because you've listened to both sides\nI mean it's seldom are issues that were really divided about as a country\nCompletely black and white if they weren't we wouldn't be divided everybody degree but instead there is some truth on both sides there and so so anyway I when I was younger I'm fifty of turned fifty four next month when I was in my twenties and thirties\nEvery one of those letters just felt like an arrow driven into by heart it was so hard and I feel like I'd have to ratify paid response to them and I would stew on it for a long time you know and I was ready to quit if I got twenty of those you know emails in a week and\nAnd uh at fifty three almost fifty four", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Middletown", "day":
