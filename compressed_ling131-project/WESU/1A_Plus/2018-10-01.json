the late Justice Antonin Scalia from two thousand one to two thousand two professor fitzpatrick welcome thank you for having me\nProfessor Rosen let me start with you and the confirmation hearing it seems like one of the big\nComplaints about the hearing was just the way that it was done that it was public at all as opposed to behind closed doors the timing of when the allegations from professor for war investigated I'd love to get both your sense professor for Patrick sense of just the\nNot to put judge Kavanaugh Supreme Court yes as you suggest I think it's fair to say that both sides think that the process was unfair\nUh Republicans complain the allegations were brought out at the last minute Democrats say they're not being investigated properly and it's remarkable how little we've learned since Anita Hill in Nineteen Ninety One remember Anita Hill's op ed where she said we must have a neutral nonpartisan body to investigate allegations\nInitially confidentially and they should only go to the Senate to bring\nThe a nominee and the\nComplaints together after there's been an investigation that wasn't done since Ninety One and now we have a no procedural rules no sense of what the standard of proof should be complaints about the FBI investigation and its scope\nAnd it is frustrating for anyone who cares about the nonpartisan legitimacy of the confirmation process and the rule of law to have such chaos professor fitzpatrick what\nDo you think I think that this has been a very shameful process and I think it could have been completely avoided when these allegations were made in July they should have been turned over to the FBI at that time\n\nSupport for NPR come from this station and from bona with the bonus certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring

calls let's get to one now from Florida David is on the line David what's on your mind\nHey Joshua how are you good what'd you think can be a hearing last week\nBut the impact on the nation are you just said the impact of the nation that's a ... exactly what I Would comment on I feel that uh I'm actually glad that the um that the hearings were made a public because it allows us\nAs a nation to weigh in on what exactly is going on in Washington with our politicians and how they're making decisions\nFor us or with regard to these things so uh I think it was very important that we all uh chime in on what's going on in the guard less of a or political or aspirations uh I myself have a belt with the alcoholism in my past ah\nI found recovery in Nineteen eighty five I I understand the struggles of alcoholism but I also understood stand up\nUh in my youth when I struggled with alcohol as I grew into adulthood I ah was able to me I was able to hide a my drinking and to justify my drinking and this is a characteristic of alcoholics they\nAre very adamant about defending their drinking and also at the same time admitting that uh they do not have a problem so um\nI think it's very interesting for us to see um individuals or come to terms with their past and how it affects their future and how that affects the future of all of us\nDavid how ... how do you think is how do you think this will affect the confirmation\nOr not what impact do you think the last few days might have\nOne particular clip I saw CNN was when I'm One of the senators was questioning him about er an FBI investigation and he refused to answer he falls silent as he ... he explained that he was open to what the committee\nOr would a welcome however he personally would not comment on whether or not he would accept an FBI investigation and it was very interesting to watch his wife\nOr her response to him because when he was not answering that question was staring at him very sternly and I always also wonder what exactly what she faking when he refused to answer this question regarding FBI investigations\nYeah you're you're ill that your friend that was enough that senator ... Illinois puts a price have enough and\nThere's nothing to hide we should be open to any possibilities\nYeah David appreciate your calling in thanks very much and that was the question that Dick Durbin of Illinois put to Brett Kavanaugh and he paused for a long time and then Chuck Grassley who's the chairman of the committee a Republican chairman of the committee jumped back in and then after that Rachel Mitchell question for the G O P basically lost her job and then the GOP senator started jumping back in\nLet me get to some more of your comments David thanks very much for talking to us Catherine emailed\nAs a woman listening to Kavanaugh defend himself last Thursday I didn't find his presentation appropriate\nIt smacks of bullying and intimidation aside from that conspiracy theories like revenge from the Clintons aired in Senate testimony is a major qualifier in my eyes before we bring our next guest professor fitzpatrick if I could ask you to respond\nTo Catherine particularly whether or not someone who began by making a partisan broadside can be trusted to sit on the Supreme Court and administer\nOur Supreme Court justices come from the political world the work for president if one party I'm often times or the other ...\nYou're listening to the point one FM W E s U Middletown standby for a test to Connecticut emergency alert system [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nIt's Thomas including a it was to be asked to just just to stay like Clarence Thomas they they they will tell you I don't just like him I Love him going swimming as to what am I came to Vanderbilt last year and talk to her students and she said that I Love Clarence Thomas and so I think\nWe'll get beyond this um but there's certainly going to be some awkward moments for a year or two\nLet's get another voice to our conversation joining us now in Studio is Elizabeth why drug the presidents of the constitutional accountability center of public interest law firm is think tank based in D.C Elizabeth welcome to but you know let me start with the question that I Begin with\nFor professors Rosen in fitzpatrick just your general sense of tearing both the structure of it and the testimonies we heard from professor Ford and judge Kavanaugh and how well that might affect the ultimate big decision about whether Brett Kavanaugh should become an associate justice of the United states\nBut I think you know harkening back to what the caller a just a year you're I'm listening or just mentioned about the presentation that judge Kavanaugh made and talking about revenge of the Clinton you know there's definitely been a divide\nJudge Kavanaugh's opening censoring the political talking about the Democrats talking about uh whether or not they should have leaked her letter and disregarded her request for anonymity you know I think that ah whether or not you think Senator Feinstein should have\nTried to raise this another way earlier she was trying to respect that clear requests for anonymity from\nThis traumatized survivor and maybe it's telling that Republicans would have just leaked it anyway and disregarded her request but Senator Feinstein was trying to give her the respect that she and her experience deserved and I think that trying to make this part of a political gain\nGame like she came up with this decade long con detritus dot judge Kavanaugh from getting to the Supreme Court\nIs frankly offensive it's offensive to her and her experience and to the many many many many others who have experienced sexual assault and have not come forward because of fear because of shame because\nThey worried frankly that what we might be in this case would be true for them\nThat they would finally find their voice and the courage to come forward and it would not matter\nI Wonder Elizabeth if there was any way around the politicking of if it was just bound to happen no matter what I mean we've got a lot of comments very critical of the Democrats alluding to what you just kind of reference there of emailed the Democrats are showing the ugly side and the people see right through their deception they should be ashamed\nBut that would require morals which they lack\nAnd Joe emailed I'm a moderate conservative as are most of my friends we've discussed the Kavanaugh hearings and Democratic senators behavior extensively if the Democrats think their behavior will go unanswered I'm afraid there ...\nFor the court both the lower court than the Supreme Court is broken and you know it it's certainly a problem but I think that that's kind of a dodge you know okay let's talk about that\nWell let's first talk about Dr Ford and her very credible testimony an allegation and what it means for judge Kavanaugh getting a job promotion to the Supreme Court\nI think it's very important to note this is not a criminal trial no one is at this point trying to hold him criminally liable\nSo it isn't a beyond a reasonable doubt kind of thing if they let's try to get all the facts which is what the FBI investigation should be doing and I think we'll get to that soon\nIt's not be with you\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the

Democrats are promising that if Kavanaugh is confirmed and they take the house they will hold impeachment hearings on the alleged misstatements in the confirmation hearings and they range not only from\nA his testimony involving Dr Ford and his college classmates insistence that he was a heavy drinker even though he says he wasn't and so forth but also about alleged misstatements and the first part of the hearings where he said he didn't know about or emails involving lower court confirmations which would Ellen's ... programs and the evidence suggests that he did\nSo regardless of whether the Senate chooses to decide that I'm small misstatement as evidence of a larger one the Democrats are determined to press these and they're not going to go way\nWho's your mom but tweeted sometimes supporters of lenses overrated I Am a moderate Republican women and so many women that I have known experience to solve like Dr for describes a friend from my church a high school friend a cousin a neighbor we believe her because we have been her\nPamela tweeted this is an impossible situation\nFeel deeply for Kavanaugh as I have a father and brothers there was no way to prove his guilt or innocence I should also note that we've been getting a number of voice mail messages about this for across the country and even from around the world already in Hamburg, Germany left it snowed in our inbox\nThe Kavanaugh hearings have caught the attention of the German press\nBeat the to Georgia tied to him when he died the opinion though is uniform it's an absolute shock at the lack of respect being shown by the Republican Senate toward the Supreme Court and its own history as the world's greatest deliberative body\nThe shock is not at the partisan tones and the hearing the right left battles are left right battles happening here too\nBut what's shocking is the tenor with which the Republicans have been speaking to the Democratic colleagues and the tenor with which the nominee himself used to address the Democratic senators Thursday\nAlready thanks very much for commenting to us in just by way of context to ... is a major paper in Germany if you remember our conversations about the Panama Papers the big international investigative report about money getting an offshore bank accounts to ... I took was one of the major papers that helped drive that forward\nI Wonder a professor for Patrick what's your take is on what all of this means for just America's image around the world how the world is reflecting on us because of the way we're handling\nThis well after last presidential election I'm not sure image can get any worse um but uh you know I I think that it is a shame that the judicial nomination process has become so broken part is and\nUm and you know the Republicans are just as much to blame if the Democrats what they did to Merrick Garland after Justice Scalia past\nAre and what's so uh I really think that in in order to make the system worked better we're going to have to come up with some major overhaul and and I think the one solution\nTo kind of restore the dignity or judicial confirmation process is it's a big change but I think it's necessary change I think we have to ask do we think Supreme Court justices should have life tenure\nIf they didn't have served forty years it wouldn't be Armageddon every time someone retires and there's a replacement\nIf presidents had a knowledge that every two years they would get a Supreme Court nomination we would normalized this process and it would become more\nI'm sane [laughter] I'm In law professors have been proposing this Eighteen year term for Supreme Court justices yeah time\nYou have her I've I've I've heard it was when I was just gonna ask you about that I've heard that suggested that if it was Eighteen years you know there are nine seats and you know every two years basically if he would come open kind of like clockwork\nThat this might not be quite so much like already making this decision that will look like and our children and our children's children it would still be a big deal but you know Eighteen is less than thirty or forty the question is whether or not that's politically viable\nI Wonder if that just depends on whether we the American people are willing to pound the table and demand it until the law changes it's not impossible to change the law it's just difficult but ... what do you think\nYeah I mean I think that's probably going to be an unlikely or a\nProposal for the particular set it up right now I'm like you know I think that this isn't just about the Supreme Court in life tenure because I think it's about this particular nominee I don't see the issues around Brett Kavanaugh as being a case\nThe dish and to the fact that he would be taking over Anthony Kennedy's seat on the Supreme Court Kennedy being the vote that basically has preserved meaningful access to abortion preserved major civil rights and protections and so on and so on you know\nDon't they ...\nEven made me laugh\nGreen true or false government gets nothing done [noise]\nMaybe true with the federal government but chances are your state house is highly productive\nFrom W.

Scott Greenberger I Wonder if we could talk a little bit more about red flag laws and their impact the Jerry Brown the governor of California the outgoing four term governor of California\nJust vetoed a bill that would have expanded that states red flag ball Jerry Brown is a Democrat very progressive but also thoroughly pragmatic and has\nYou know in this case he felt like it at perhaps you know with some of the concerns that ah Richard raised that uh it went a little too too far um and a richer noted the question of of balance but I Would add also I think it's interesting that generally speaking a that a lot of the debate um\nPost a Parkland has focused on\nA these so called red flag laws or I'm\nA limiting the gun access to guns for people a domestic abusers you know the argument or the ... argument for for such a long time was that a\nGuns don't kill people people kill people and it seems that now rather than trying to revive a for example on assault weapons ban uh the assault weapons ban from the nineties\nOr people who are in favor of more um\nUh safeguards gun control are pushing on red flag laws are they're pushing on background checks and it seems like that a potential uh common ground between people who are\nA very strongly support their Second Amendment or what they view is their Second Amendment gun rights and and folks who would like a more a control and safeguards speaking\nOf the end are a governor Larry Hogan of Maryland who's a Republican had an a minus rating from the national Rifle Association he or she is endorsing a red flag law in this February\nI've said for years um that we need to do more\nTo keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill\nAnd people with criminal backgrounds\nThat's why we will push for and support what is known as red flag legislation in general this policy would allow family members for law enforcement to petition the court for a lethal violence protective order issued by judge which would prohibit the individual\nOf causing injury to themselves or to others individuals with a mental illness should not have access to borrow\nThat his Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland worth noting that who's a minus reading from the un already dropped to see as a result of the few support of these kinds of red floodwalls Chris I Wonder what impact you think\nThat that kind of influence would have on more states passing these kinds of extreme risk laws\nI think it has a positive impact absolutely a and I think governor Hogan\nActually there are a he's doing the right thing and be you know he's a politician and he has to be aware that that has an impact on his NRA rating it has an impact on the rating that Brady give them as well and I think it relates back to the initial point\nThat I made that is part post Parkland really there is a groundswell of activism on this issue a huge new slate of polls that have been taken which show in every state across the country\nA vast majority well over fifty percent normally in the seventies a supporting exactly these kinds of measures\nThey're sensible measures they're pragmatic measures and they balance appropriately uh the you know the second Amendment rights of of gun owners with uh the idea that we all want to be safe in our communities one of the most heartbreaking components of my job\nIs getting polling data back and focus group information that really yields two different things and I think it's really important to think about these laws in this context first\nAmericans overall when they ask about their fear associated with being shot\nShot yet\nAnd and that is a very concerning saying this back and as many Americans are actually a shame\nAbout the epidemic of gun violence in this country and they want pragmatic solutions so I certainly applaud governor Hogan forgiving the right thing here but I think he like many politicians are looking at what their constituents want\nAnd moving forward knowing that these are popular and populist positioned to take\nA here you Chris in terms of the pragmatic argument but you know when it comes to gun laws their constituents in their constituents I mean Vermont is a good example of that I mean ... was one of the states to ban bump stocks as part of a larger package of legislation on guns this year back in April Vermont's governor Phil Scott who was a Republican who had an a rating from the n._r._a.\nSigned these laws in these bills into law\nNobody's got that he changed his mind about them after police\nFoiled an alleged shooter's plans to storm a local high school and basically kill as many people as possible now here is some of the sound from the signing ceremony as he was signing outside the Vermont state house he was being heckled by opponents to gun restrictions listen\nI support the second amendment [noise] [noise]\nAre where are you currently doing everything we can to make our kids in our community safe\n[noise] they got\nA point where our kids are afraid to go to school and parents are afraid to put them on a bus [noise]\nHer police don't have the tools they need to protect victims of violence or families can step in the event of a loved\nOne or taken my palm\nThe Republican Richard Feldman Feldman when you hear that moment from the signing ceremony ... what does that tell you about the the nature of this debate in states across the country\nI think in many ways the pro gun community led by the national Rifle Association is somehow cornered itself by its own success\nOn the politics of this issue trends and for policy of this issue and their analyze so much of the problem in getting this debate focused in a way\nThat we can achieve results that work for everyone and we can but not when we focus on the politics but only on the policy we really have to well wind those two\nAnd dealing with the press captions versus the realities in this society it's highly unlikely that anyone you are I Know directly it's going to be shot\nIt says ... testicle thing but of course it's going to make news and we're all I'm In the same boat when when we see things day in and day out we feel like it's all around us we deal as human beings with these perceptions um\n\nSupport for NPR comes from ... added from progressive insurance offering a way to buy a home insurance with their home quote explorer tool custom quote and rates

into trends on new state election laws for redistricting proposals to voting rights what's happening now in your state on redistricting reforms are voting rights on the ballot this November if so

a vox pop to send us a radio quality audio file and to keep up to date on future topics will share some of your stories next Monday when our series the state or in continues here on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Richard Feldman Chris Brown and Scott Greenberg or a few more different kinds of laws that we should touch on before our time is up\nWe should talk about the minimum age for purchasing long guns and rifles four states California Hawaii Illinois and Florida passed new laws that would raise the minimum age from Eighteen to Twenty one uh Florida State representative who ... who was a Republican\nSponsored new legislation on new gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida he had an eighth grade from the n._r._a.\nSerious speaking on WFL our TV in Miami about why he agreed to raise the legal age this is an edited version of his interview\nA determining what age someone can do something is a judgment call and we do it in in many areas of our of our law making and so I think was bird that on was the fact that he had an Eighteen year old a who did purchased this weapon I think I think without that particular fact he probably wouldn't have seen that\nWhat about law abiding Floridians who are Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old some of whom have gone and served our country and fought for our country overseas what do you say that those who feel like their Second Amendment rights are being infringing\nLook particularly that group of people that you mentioned are covered in them all so if you have if if you're a correctional officer if you're a parole officer if you're a law enforcement officer or or you served in the military society has already said that you're trained and can carry a firearm so this bill would not impair that even at those ages\nThis law particularly because an array of challenging it in court\nYes than our as challenging it in court I think a Marion Hammer has been a very effective lobbyists there for the\nNRA for a long time um had a suit filed within twenty four hours of the measure passing\nI think that it will certainly withstand judicial scrutiny from our review 'em and be upheld and I think it's a natural reaction to the a mass shooting involving you know that are often\nUm with schools individuals who are within that timeframe\nOf Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will note that Florida passed a package of laws uh the minimum age being one all of which were a really designed to address the the type of issues that we saw\nA from Parkland at the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in the home where he stayed on secured\nAnd that's why the extreme risk laws so important that we're seeing these kinds of package fills a reviewed and introduced that the most notable point for me is it passed in the state of Florida red has long been one of the strongest a sort of incubator\nOf the n._r._a. legislative agenda and I think is very telling on obviously the reaction so Parkland and the the activism that took place immediately following a the Parkland shooting\nI Would like to come back to sleep storage in a moment ... ... by the way we did a program when we visited Salt Lake city about guns in the mountain west states and and the nature of gun suicide in the mountain west in which the state representative who joined us showed us one of the storage lockers that does open with your fingerprints I tried it it it worked\nOf gun legislation Richard Feldman I could I just get your sense in terms of\nThe NO raise real view on gun legislation DNA has said that some measures like bump stock restrictions could be examined maybe through the administration's authority on a federal level rather than the state level\nOr we just kidding ourselves here should we just come out and just stay the n._r._a. is not in favor of any new gun legislation that can be passed on a bipartisan basis are we trying to make the n._r._a. more ten fifth wheel and more collaborative than it really is\nWell first led to find something I'm always a little bit of a loss to understand when people talk about the n._r._a. on an endowment number the n._r._a. there five million NRA members\nUm there's the board of directors is the senior leadership there the consultants there are many and our race\nThere's my uncle was a card carrying life member of the IRA and we'll show you his hard on demand if you ask with great pride has\nSo many will myself included um but I I I think we're talking about the senior leadership of an already here\nAnd um again when I said earlier an array finds itself institutionally boxed in a corner of if you're calling it gun control no matter what it is it could mandate\nThat when you turn Twenty one you're given a gun they're almost institutionally has to be against it because of the terminology and the politic position of the terms gun control\nThey don't mean what we sometimes think they mean are they mean different things to different people at different times\nWhich you know what I mean about Wayne LaPierre Oliver North of the leadership\nGuy with a gun is a good guy with a gun it's those ads within the last day you know they are coming for our freedom and they use their media and the n._r._a. as you know the you know liberties last safe place that NRA that's who I'm Talking about\nWhat you're talking about that's politics\nThat galvanizing the true believers that's about membership that's about fundraising that's about a organizing for the next a political event both sides to it and there's nothing unusual about that whether we're talking firearms or the environment\nOr any other hot button issues and America\nEverybody does it that way perhaps we see it a little more distinctly in the firearm debate than others when we've been put on that side Scott Y. disorder sides\nI wanted to ah just to to to add to that that you've seen on some of those issues issues you just mentioned in perhaps a we're going to begin to see it on gun control as well that in cases where state legislatures are gridlocked and the power of a\nUm the gun lobby is such that uh that lawmakers won't pass anything I'm a there is a another outlet in many states and that's a ballot initiative Washington state will have a ballot initiative in November that would raise the minimum age to buy a a\nSemi automatic rifle to Twenty one uh Oregon people in Oregon and supportive as similar measure came close to getting out on the ballot so we may see that I mean that's that was a pattern with the marijuana legalization for example so that that might be a that might be coming in the future\nLet me get to a few more of your calls and comments we did get a call about state gun legislation in Missouri from a person who was working for a democratic state reps office this is what she left at our inbox\nThis is Emily ... calling from Missouri state representative tracing decrease office in two thousand sixteen misery\nPull that allows domestic abusers to possess firearms since two thousand sixteen there's been a bipartisan effort to close that loophole\nLeadership and the Missouri legislator will not move this bill or make it a priority to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers\nInstead during the past session we spend our committee time focusing on bills that expand gun rights like house don't Nineteen thirty six known as the guns everywhere bell that role lemonade almost all of the state's gun free zones things for your doing on money", "year": "2018",
