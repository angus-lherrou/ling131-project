A. M. U. dot org\nAdam or go see a before we move on to our next story I Wonder if you could respond to that tweet from Michael that reads this just further reinforces that people solely look for media that confirms their already set believe\nHow do we break out of it than show the people that those you disagree with are still human Adam\nBoy uh I don't know [laughter]\nI think uh the technologically enabled a fracturing of media is a really really significant factor in the status of our public life right now on the other hand I'm not sure that it's the causal agent um it might be a corollary uh\nI think that um you know we can talk all day about the norms as to the discourse breaking down but a nice that's very\nMental values that are really really wide and work perhaps paper over for a lot of years by the media mano culture and now we're able to see them for what they are\nI Am personally kind of amazed that more political violence doesn't happen in the United states given the depths\nOf these differences um I don't think it's just in how we talk and who we are talking to and who were listening to I think a lot of what we're experiencing here is about fundamental differences in what we believe to be important in life and what we want government to do ... we\nHad fundamental differences forever and what we believe that but I think\nThat the increase in rhetoric I think I'm demonizing people making people your enemy making and then you just the enemy of the people had made a difference and I think that people don't generally talk to each other anymore there's not enough people that go up I mean I\nKind of because I'm a report I talked to everybody but I Will ask people did you vote why did you vote who did you vote for people don't talk anymore they look at their phones and they are in their little bubble\nIn Eugene I think it's important to note that and I don't know if you encounter those working for the Washington Post but certainly I Do on a program that's on NPR is that the people who comments on our show or not just our fans are critics listen to I mean I understand the idea about the division but\nIf you hate NPR so much how do you know what we said on one age to criticize us if you ate the Washington Post much how do you know what it was printed there to criticize\nAnd quite frankly I think that that a behavior is exemplified most\nFrom the president himself who really hates CNN but seems to watch a lot of it um and it and I I'm blown away by how many people are are engaging to don't want us to do what\nIt is that we're doing and and it's unfortunate because I think we all need criticism or the media needs to be criticized we need to be held accountable\nInto the coverage of this story over the weekend please just remember that the stories moving really really fast we're going to try really hard not to jump to any conclusions\nAbout what has happened there already been some details in this story that had been clarified a walk back so that is common in a fast moving breaking story like this keeping your on your NPR member station for the latest and an eye on NPR dot org\nA few more of your comments before we move on\nMatt emailed if Trump is responsible for the bombs are Democrats responsible for the shooter at the Republicans baseball team practice both of these statements are untrue bleed mass referring to the the congressional baseball game in which Republican congressman these beliefs of Louisiana was injured\nPhilip emailed the suspicious packages may have originated in Florida but the perpetrator or perpetrators tours are not necessarily based there the Unabomber lived in Montana but traveled to Utah and the bay area to physically male his devices in order to do the law enforcement\nAll right let's keep moving on with some other stories and if the story continues to move in the next few minutes we'll certainly much no but let's talk a little bit more about politics particularly with President Trump he was at a rally this week in Houston and he made headlines for a different set of remarks was\nThat wants to do well frankly not caring about our country so much [noise] and you know what we can [noise] you know it's sort of make sure it's a nationalist\nAnd really we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nUsing Scott I Wonder if we didn't get to a clear ...\nThe what President Trump says it is\nKnowing and neither is a global if I'm a according to President Trump to to be charitable or a nationalist it's just someone who put America First um but the reality is anyone with a it's a historical context of nationalism knows that it is a worldview\nEmbraced on other rising uh that has led to\nUm you know genocide and violence and separating people not like yourself a\nFrom a space that that would give them rights that uh we we deem a central and important to human beings um and so a Trump you know early in his campaign I'm really distance himself from the term nationalist when we saw a Steve Bannon associated with it primarily because\nUh the ... the form of nationalism that what's most\nA familiar with a band and the brave our community what that of white nationalism which we've seen um you know sweep Europe and I even hate groups in the states um and so it it's been it's been deemed by most people to be problematic\nTo the Trump embrace it um while misrepresenting it or put him on the receiving end of significant criticism\nAdam reduce the I Love you to chime in on this I Know that you are a stickler and rightly so for precision in language and I wonder what your take is on the use of the word nationalist versus say patriot\nParticularly because words like nationalist often heard in in places like white nationalism global list has connotations of being anti Semitic give it to parse the words parts of the language for us here\nI mean I think Eugene has already done a pretty good job of that I'm a I'm a little bit mystified by this whole story um the ... the idea that for President Trump to say hey I'm a nationalist is remarkable is kind of nuts to me um\nAmerica First to secondary campaign slogan is a perfect crystal ...\nIn front of a group of people and said hey my hair is kind of weird\nWill die we all know that um I suppose it's sort of remarkable that you said it but you know it it it's a truth that is right in front of us I think a lot of why the comment has gotten the attention is that yet I'm as Eugene fed 'em nationalism has really really bad track record in the twentieth century of leading the genocide\nAnd a World War Z I'm On the other hand I don't I think that some people have been around being nationalist up to white nationalist and that's a pretty big trip\nNow you could make a very cogent argument that President Trump is functionally a white nationalist in terms of his rhetoric in terms of his policies that that's an arguable point um but he didn't say I'm a white nationalist he said I'm a nationalist and he is manifestly so I don't get why this is a big deal\nA few of your comments about President Trump's word choices Mary hail emailed when Trump recently called for unity she did so in the tone that it's clearly not his usual one it is as if he was saying to his followers I don't mean this but they're making these

Eugene this is not the first time the Trump Administration has targeted the transgender community there's this ban on trans people serving in the military that's working its way through the court\nOf reality start Caitlyn Jenner published an opinion piece this week in response to this proposed changing the definition of sex by age or just in the Washington Post she wrote quote\nThe reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president the leader of our nation has shown no regard for an already marginalized and struggling community he has ignored our humanity he isn't salted our dignity this is politics at its worst unquote\nNow Eugene we interviewed Caitlyn Jenner on this program some months ago and she said that she knows that a lot of ...\nI also had to push back on her a little bit 'cause she knows the people in the room clearly do not want her there what do you make of her comment I mean she can't be surprised by the president's actions on this she just can't you know it's been really fascinating\nShe uh is arguably one of the most visible transgender people in America and um has actually been criticized significantly by the transgender rights community because uh she does not seem to be deeply informed about the political history that the community has\nBeen a fighting for ah the idea that she likes to be at the table almost implies that no one has tried to be at the table before her\nUm and and the the administration has been criticized by the broader community perhaps a for not a being a a boat advocate of the trench under a community and and gender has been a critique for parents that have just noticed that\nOne of the things I'm most fascinated by a I think this story right here reveals how\nPeople in different or identity groups can listen to the same candidate and walk away with different things in general and wrote in that Washington Post op ed\nThat seat back Trump because she heard him\nInclude algae BP communities and hit a speech at the Republican National convention she saw people applaud and so she thought he would have bad algae beat the rights\nSocial conservatives voted for Trump because they believe he would reverse algae beats he writes a that perhaps went farther than they would have liked them to go and the Obama administration so it's just one of those amazing moments about how different Americans hear different things\nWhen they get to a few of your comments before we keep moving Kirk emailed when was the meaning of gender changed to reflect the psychological state rather than a physical identity gender has always been a polite and more specific sending in for sex centers routinely used as such on birth\nKirk I'll take this one on actually that's not correct your

communities destroyed by two thousand nine military coup with which the U.S had a hand also want to acknowledge lots of you were commenting on this idea of nationalism let me read a few of your comments there\nIrrepressible youth tweeted a quote from George Orwell nationalism is hunger for power tempered by self deception\nDaniel tweeted why did Trump used the word nationalist instead of saying he was an American and\nMatthew tweeted amassed tweeted equating nationalism with white nationalism\nAnd demonizing their political opponents\nLet's talk about economic policy the president made a statement to reporters this week that he will propose a new ten percent tax cuts for middle class the president was somewhat vague in his timing for this to happen but said that quote will do the vote after the election\nKathy Lohr I'd love to get your sense of what this means whether this was just something to say during the midterms or whether it seems that President really has a plan to continue making more tax cuts\nIt's just that I hate to say that but I don't think he had to play [laughter] I think that it is I'm playing to the base maybe trying to expand its base because the original tax cut that he promised\nI don't think it helped middle class people as was promised the first time so maybe this is an effort to do that with an effort to get ... voters out\nFor this election and I asked them how do you see it\nI I don't think that we should even be talking about it on a news program until there's something more substantive for us to talk about an actual policy of everything about this is just so ... serious I'm right now\nAnd I think that if anything that we are playing into the president's a political a gambit by even acknowledging the existence of a plan that isn't even a plan I mean to to to bring it back to what we were just discussing with the migrant caravan\nUm uh making its way through Central America this is another place where I think the way that we are talking about it is inherently a complicit in\nUm uh in reinforcing really unrealistic and politically craven view of what's happening I'm four thousand people marching from uh the northern triangle countries' interests uh bought 'em all in all Salvador um through Mexico hoping some of them hoping to reach the United states\nThis does not represent any kind of significant uptick in the number of people seeking refuge from these increasingly violent countries they just happened to be in a big group it's ...\nYou are not being noticed um that made them vulnerable to all kinds of hazards along the way and so there's a new strategy to try to go in ... openly in one big group that's all that's going on here border patrol apprehended\nUm about a hundred and fifty thousand people from the northern triangle countries in twenty Seventeen that's just the people that they caught right\nThis is not a significant number of people and therefore I'm not even sure that we should be talking about it that much it we should be talking about the broader phenomenon of migration from Central America and us complicity in destabilizing those countries and causing the violence there

thing that happens every day and less organized fashion it's become though a weapon or for the trumpet for for Trump to use in advance in the mid term elections they look at all these carry people coming towards our border there might be middle Easterners and they're you know how do we know that they aren't bad people in that group which is just to quote his terminology used\nUm and this is kind of a poking at\nThe that that the existing um tensions that exist in this country between people who are sympathetic toward the people who wants to come to the United states for various reasons of personal safety and economic instability and everything else\nAnd those people who think a scary outsiders don't let them in his plays real well with Trump's base Trump is trying to whip up his base in advance of the mid term elections because the Republicans need to hold on for dear life to make sure they keep\nThe majorities in both houses of Congress because housing specially seems like it's quite likely to flipped\nA it's a very emotional issue for people on both sides of this issue and this is a classic uh politicking for how it's being portrayed right now I'm In ... on television not nearly as as we are like two weeks out\nLoud you mix away from around the planet lights and everybody's going to cast their ballots healing how they feel about you know that it does it affect the country and how the president's grappling with them\nBefore we continue talking about the care of and I'm Sorry I forgot to clarify something earlier and what we were discussing Michael Goldfarb raised the point\nAbout treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and we clarified that he did not attend the conference this so called Davos in the desert that is true but just to be clear the treasury secretary did meet with Saudis crown prince Mohammed bin ... on Monday in Riyadh he did not attend the conference\nBut he and the crown prince did meet one on one earlier this week on Monday just by way of clarification\nRavi president troops that President Trump sent troops\nTo the U.S Mexico border during the spring defense secretary James Mattis is authorized deploying eight hundred more troops\nTo the southern border give us a sense of what role these troops might be expected to play there and how that might factor into this whole saga regarding the the care of him\nWell it it really is the court room was pointing out apply of thoughts that play into the political debate here in the United states about the migrants making their way to to the United states and the whole notion of securing the border is also it is a strange one on this because\nI mean if you look at who these migrants are and what they're escaping from they are tired they're hungry they're escaping of countries like Honduras and El Salvador\nGuatemala where they are escaping violence they are extremely poor they they as they are walking up a north towards the United states\nThey think that they could have better lives in the United states they think that that children would have better lives than really there is no greater tests in it to American soft power that you have you know essentially all around the world people who want to vote with their feet and come to the the the United states and that's all\nI have children and have better lives than simply an end to the troops are part of this larger\nA Trump Ian and and I guess Republican rhetoric that play into the the idea that some migrants who are coming are coming I'm a you know as sources of great danger when in ... in fact a you know if you look at the pictures of who they are and how they're coming in they are anything but\nAnd I want to do want to point out uh current mentioned that President Trump alluded to the ... a A R mentioned that uh the migrants who are Middle Eastern well for one there's actually no evidence that points the fact that they could be Middle Eastern but perhaps more importantly\nHe was using um Middle Eastern at the lower courts which\nAre over there and we should we should just clarify vice president Mike Pence has said that there it's possible that mixed in with the thousands of migrants from Central America there may be a few dozen who were Middle Eastern and might have you know ... ferry is\nAimed for the country or that exactly right thank you for the clarification there but the the point I was getting too was that the use of the of of of Middle East and that the the um ... is extremely dangerous because it it it ate van tries to create the the impression that being Middle East and\nI'm means you're dangerous so that you're a terrorist and and and that too is it is a dangerous loaded way of looking at a car when was pointing out again a movement that happens very often or you know migrants from from those parts of the world often try to make their way to the United states and the reason why this has become a bigger\nIf we should be careful with the language we use to describe this large group of people a number of you have comments to us about that with the the terminology including the use of the word migrants\nMaria right I Am Honduran I was born and raised in Honduras I came to the U.S to study and now I live and work here this quote unquote caravan is a cry for help cry of desperation from my people who will risk their lives to escape the extreme poverty and violence that I Know Israel\nThey are indeed refugees seeking refuge please don't blame them blamed the corruption that has rotted the Honduran government\nAnd dug into Anthony tweet they are not migrants they are as filings speakers words matter now Michael Merriam Webster is might go to in terms of the news the English language\nMerriam Webster defines a migrant as one who migrate such as a person who moved regularly in order to find work especially in harvesting crops a refugee is one that fleas\nEspecially a person who flees to a foreign country or power to escape danger or persecution what do you make of the words that we're using to describe this\nYou know just as you've been talking about this I ... I suddenly had Woody Guthrie's old song\nAbout about a group of migrants being sent back to Mexico in the Nineteen thirties and their plane crashed\nAnd they were cold deportees it's a beautiful song you you look it up and at many listeners should should strict YouTube after the show and and give it a list and there are many versions of it\nYeah you you know look I and I do think that in this case there there is a distinction you know we have a human wave coming out of sub Saharan Africa and the horn of Africa towards Europe and it's had a destabilizing effect on politics or as well and and I\n\nDeparture NPR comes from this station\nLearn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progress that from fidelity investments taking a personalized approach to helping clients grow preserve and manage their wealth learned more at ... dot com slash well Fidel a brokerage services El Al ...\nAnd from the William T grant foundation at W T grant foundation dot org\nBefore we get back to the round up we would love your help with next week's discussion on voting\nSpecifically early voting lots of Americans are casting ballots ahead of next month's election day record numbers in fact\nDid you vote early\nIf so tell us why and tell us how it went\nEight five five to three six one a one and you can leave us a voice mail there now if you're not voting early we'd like to know why not did something get in the way of you voting maybe you just prefer going on election day for some reason\nTell us how early voting is going where you live and whether you took part in it\nEight five five to three six one a one a or you can use our app won a vox pop to send a radio quality audio file and to keep up to date on future topics you can download won a vox pop V. O. X. P. O. P. in your store and we'll share some of your stories on\nMonday on one day\nNow to our discussion with current emergent of the Washington Post roughly ... of foreign policy magazine and Michael Goldfarb with the first rough draft of history the host and creator of that potash probably let me come to you though I Wonder what you think of the overall message of Tim Cook speech this CEO of apple we heard him refer\nTo the data industrial complex which has been a phrase it's been quoted fairly often in the days since he spoke kind of\nHarkening back to that idea of the military industrial complex to the prison industrial complex what did you make of of cooks remarks\nWhat he didn't stay in that speech was he didn't mention Google he didn't mention Facebook\nAnd that perhaps because I mean while he doesn't want to go that far but but also because apple is a business is quite different from Google and Facebook apple doesn't it's not in the the uh the ad tracking business the way Facebook and Google both are\nBut I think what all of these companies know collectively that whether they like it or not regulation of some for some form is is on its way it's coming and so at some level of the other they have all endorsed uh GDP are which is Europe's data protection bill\nAnd I think they're beginning to imagine that some version of that will at some stage be implemented in the United states and the only question that is is what kind of language will be in that what it within tail\nAnd and and and I think what cook has tried to do in this speech again very strong words in his visit to Europe is to try and come out ahead of it knowing that this is going to happen anyway to try and appear to be one of the uh the tech support or all of a potential data privacy laws in the United\nThe break we should be clear also GDP are as the general data protection regulation it's just a new area law that protects the privacy of data privacy of individuals within the EU or even the export of their personal data outside the e you if you've noticed reading the last few months\nThat a lot of the Web sites you go to have had these pop up saying hey we used cookies on the website and we may be tracked your information quick here to accept\nThat was those websites complying with GDP are that's why they all had to begin putting those pop ups on those sites another story about privacy that caught our attention the British newspaper the telegraph\nPublished an investigation on Tuesday into a wealthy businessman who was accused by multiple employees a racist and sexist mistreatment\nBecause the accused was granted an injunction against the newspaper to prevent it from publishing his name but then this happened at Britain's house of lords\nI feel it's my do you see on the parliamentary privileged to name for the greed of the individual in question given that the media have been subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of his story which is clearly in the public interest\nThat was the voice of lord Hain or Baron the hand of nice in the British house of lords using British parliamentary privilege to name the billionaire at the center of this story Michael Goldfarb what's behind this what makes this\nIs such a big deal it sounds like it's kind of an example a clear example of the very significant differences between free speech laws in the u._k. and in the U.S [noise]\nWell that's certainly part of it just wrote it in in this particular case I'm having a parliamentary privileges is a pretty\nUnique tool you can say things in parliament that you can't say outside and and not so for any libel actions and Peter hand was a working he'd been approached by some of the women who had spoken to the Daily Telegraph\nThere's this guy or for the green is you know a fairly typical contemporary entrepreneur yet he was a night to bite Tony Blair for services to retail is set up\nA series of of um clothing shops over over the decades and made himself very very wealthy indeed and um apparently he was just the kind of ball she would expect it was a bully and he was\nHe sexually harassed people and\nLike Harvey Weinstein when when he settled up there were no disclosure clauses inserted into the settlements and the difference\nThe details you can get because of these nondisclosure agreements but at least you know his name and here in Britain it's something else you know and moving oh go ahead Michael good no no because I could go on about this guy forever and like what [laughter]\nWhat we're doing it on\nI was just gonna say it's an interesting case really because of the way that the British laws are structured to say to have that that this this question of like which is the greater good here right because this is the\nThe the me too movement it's already been a question of can you know the the little guy or the little girl in this instance you know stand up against a big powerful

I guess to see what is\nWhat society kind of values protecting more is it the reputation of the kids in this way where India is can be applied newspapers that were never a party to them or is it getting this out in the public space and said he was like an extra level in the u._k.\nOf determining you know how much of a national or international conversation I guess at this point all of this is going to be in terms of does one wrong done effect you know an entire society and and how to be sorted out\nRight now here in the U.S we are understandably focused on the mid term elections will Brazilians are focused on a presidential election they had to the polls on Sunday to choose between two radically different candidates in this second round of voting\nFernando ... is on the left ... is on the right in ... the lead in most polls many expect him to win the election joining us now from Sao paolo is Sarah ... who is Brazil correspondent for the economist Sara walking don't want to\nThank for having me\nRemind us about ... so now he's been pretty controversial explain to us why\n\nThey protect Mueller legislation that that are more for\nMe at a pastry ... comment and a women and minorities and ... and ... and ... to them when they're very provocative reputation that Goldwater people to compare him to\nCome by in other ways you know it's like a ... a Congress me for a credit so\nUm it it could have ... ... ... bucks a pack them up I think an outsider or your feet and you know like around sixty percent of Brazilians are are kind of hoping a so called up and put the country back on track\nTo is that why she's so popular I mean you know Brazil has had a number of issues [noise] trying to be a cascading issues with corruption over the years is just kind of she's outsider status has a clenched any social misgivings or maybe about him\nWell what kind of I'm I'm a ...
