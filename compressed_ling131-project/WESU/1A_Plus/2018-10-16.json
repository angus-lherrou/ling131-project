A. M. U.\nDot org we know that for quite a few if you're discussing climate change can be difficult\nSome of you been giving us your suggestions for what has worked for you or what might work\nMelissa writes for my Bible friends I remind them that we are called to be good stewards of the earth nothing the environmentalist or suggesting would cause harm\nFrom my fiscally conservative friends I talk about the economics green power is more profitable and this is the future economy more jobs better jobs saving the earth for their grandchildren is way down on the list\nWe also heard from some of you who are dealing with the difficulties of discussing climate change Caitlin left this note in our inbox\nBorough routes or okra Ronald Reagan environmental Iran and I'm very interested in protecting the environment and\nTeaching about climate change [noise]\nI Want to know ways in which I can better explain myself to others are\nJust regular people who might not have the education that I have had that climate change because from where I'm standing at plainly ... what's going on and it just seems like we really need to come together and actually make a change or there's going to be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with his poll I Wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just added to\nA warming and just beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all this\nIt's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy\nSolutions with a policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action we know that we have to ... global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible but when one party in the United states denies factual information over twenty year period that elects a president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters\nMay reflect that in this midterm election\nGeorge tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focused on telling people about the immediate and local clean air health benefits that will go to people in locations taking action to address climate change pollution and reducing fossil fuel burning irrespective of opinions on climate Katie emailed\nMy family has vacation to Mexico beach in Florida for twenty plus years and we have many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much he will consider that just maybe there is a greater thing at play here what is it going to take for this\nShouldn't nurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she then and the laws that her family is\nStruggling with to describe and you know\nThis is the pizza around recognizing how difficult information as like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me\nLike six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it people can get exposed the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues [noise]\nThe the the way that we unpack this I think\nIs through um through relationship and trust an empathy um because as we interact an individual and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger\nUm [noise] I ... all of these pieces that are we all went away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions which John into our party in corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world is and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing worldview and that's why being honest that yeah this is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the ways to start\nSure if I could just doing it a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak to the conversations with folks to feel very fatalistic I mean it's hard not to read the latest report from the un climate change by which we discussed last week on this program\nLike it just feels like an intractable problem and I wonder if maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way would go a long way\nWell when I yeah I got it and I I Want to remind remind us that as we did\nWith the privilege of western lifestyles and we look at the science that we've invested public money into you know remembering that\nWe're living a science fiction and fantasy right now and we can look to human history and see that there are many other cultures around us and typically in the U. S. Native American and indigenous Native American people who have already experienced the kind of cultural eradication that we are looking at down the line\nAnd ... the the consequences from climate change we can look at the stories of human tenacity\nAnd how people struggle and survive\nThrough massive massive staff we know these stories and we can inform ours strengthen our resilience our courage by looking at the stories of for example the water protectors and the people who are standing at the front lines right now paying the earth is precious we only have one planet and we're all going to show up and\nI'm informed that the you know the public's eye of the necessity of staying in this place and and things vigilant charge I Would\nJust go go ahead go ahead ... but oh I Would just add that\nThe fatal Islam is a reasonable reaction if you don't know the full range of solutions\nThat there's a lot of good news here\nTwo years ago we eliminated one of them six main greenhouse gas says it will no longer exist on earth Twenty years from now with the golly agreement to phase out HFCs turns out there three or four other super pollutants like methane and black carbon if we can ...\nChange we need education about the fact that we can take hold of the climate crisis and actually solve it exactly to combat that fake lives in which is a serious problem and I I really do feel empathy for people who are overwhelmed by an apologist to dig into a little further what our HFCs\nHR sees are hydra floor carbon or manmade gas that ironically are used in refrigeration in air conditioners\nAnd they're growing incredibly quickly because we phased out an earlier set of the FCC's chlorofluorocarbons\nTo fix the ozone hole by the way it's worth noting that that happened under Ronald Reagan a Republican it's also noting that the acid rain problem was solved under George W Bush a Republican\nRepublicans have historically taken very responsible positions on environmental problems but they've gone off the rails lately and we need to help them help them back\nThen this is a show for you right here at Seventy eighty eight point why now than middle [noise]\n\nSupport for

Massachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren recently announced that a DNA test has confirmed what she said all along but she is indeed of tribal heritage\nThe test was the clock back to President Trump who mocked her for claiming that heritage and refer to her as Pocahontas critics\nMany issues that may have Native American voters talking head of the midterms if you are Native American what has claiming your heritage meant to you what tribe or are you part of and how does that factor into your life\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a now if you're not Native American then share what your heritage means to you especially if it's something you learned about a little later in life what did you discover and how did it change you\nTell us your story eight five five to three six one a one way or you can leave us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Sarah ... and Paul let's so let's get in a few more of your questions and comments before we move on Noel tweeted I teach clients to think of anxiety kinda like sugar a little gives you energy to get going and too much shuts down and drains you\nNeed to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with the thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take\nLarge policy action to reduce emissions in the United states and globally\nYou can do personally for climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there were a few Republicans who acknowledge like a congressman from South Florida um but\nThere are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not\nStrong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace is there at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation and useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change sorter role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would happen to years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that\nWell I mean that things are happening right now so [laughter] they have it in that um that that those protections are coming through I mean all of that pieces of protection that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentration thing we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's just\nPhenomenal thing I guess the issues not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like [noise]\nInfluenced by the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a collapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities why\nOn people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this was a massive storm but the fundamental things in between weather and climate\nClimate ... we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and the the the climate for our planet ... Ben ... oscillation between glacial an inter glacial state\nAbrupt warming into enter glacial followed by slow cooling into glacial state so that ... thing of glacial enter glacial warming that cold too warm structure that was fundamentally paid by the changing geometric relationship between the earth and the sons there a backup\nAlong the changing geometric relationship between glacial an intellectual they lost me it's so cool it's amazing what it's confusing like bring down to earth from it\nOkay so in the ... million years the planet's climate had been moving between glacial states where there's an eye on top of North American and you're Asian continent sea level is lower\nUm it's a colder climate um and then in ... states so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift\nThis um this piece thing that I'm ... ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate and that heartbeat from cold to warm cold too warm that heartbeat was paid by the ... and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and or killed as it moves around the sun\nSo I only make sure all following you this yeah heartbeat this version heartbeat patrol yeah whole too warm Cold War it's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest the heartbeat as off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it to us\nWe uh we have fundamentally disturbed that pattern I was saying well we're on a super\nHigh cholesterol sugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof and um the climate system can't take that forever that will go out of control that's a perfect that's a perfect image that makes\nPerfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to pull out and then we got to let you go shortly but for folks who questioned the provenance of the science food that scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work through that\nI I I understand that you can distress individual scientists but there's not a conspiracy of\nTens and hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to create a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many cases their understanding the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now an imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed a degree and a half Fahrenheit were on her way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit\nAnd it could spin out of control and that's just the factual information I I I think we were very few people actually deny about ten percent Fifteen Percent of the u._s. public actually\nDenied climate science would I think we have to do is galvanized the Seventy five eighty percent who broadly accepted into action\nSo former climate advisor for the Clinton White house profit story Electra at American University Center for environmental policy and a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute Paul thanks very much for talking to us thank you judge them and Sarah my re PHD research associate at the University of Washington\nThere are good reasons to be concerned about our politics the division the tribal ties that seem to get in the way of finding agreement and compromises we just discussed but we're not alone no matter how broad things maybe come here between now and the midterms\nAt least we're not trying to work out a divorce that's lasted more than forty years and that will probably cost about fifty billion dollars\nSunday nights at seven thirty PM only on W E s U Middletown ... point one of\n\nWorld War three if it ever happens bombs in troops might not fully that big a role in the battlefield might be the computer in your pocket\nFrom W.

security and defense chiefs have warned that a major terror attack is inevitable and the next one may well come on line there have been big cyber attacks in recent years but which one do you think has made the biggest difference\nWas it the Iranians cyberattack against the damn in New York two years ago here's what Preet Bharara the former U.S attorney based in Manhattan said back in twenty sixteen\nWe now live in a devastating attack financial system our infrastructure and our way of life can be launched from anywhere in the ...\nMaybe it was when China hacked the federal government's H R department the office of Personnel Management that attack compromise to private information of Twenty one million government workers and their spouses and close relatives Republican congressman Michel\nCould breach of federal networks in us history in my judgment this was an attack by China against the United states government in quantum fires to espionage and that raises all sorts of issues that we need to do\nAnd of course there's Russia it's clear now that Vladimir ... tried to disrupt an interfere with the twenty sixteen election surely that stands out as our biggest cyber attack before\nLeaving office President Obama stressed the need for action\nAs a consequence [laughter] it is important for us to review all elements of that and make sure that we're preventing are kind of interference through cyber attacks in the future\nThat those were all big but our guest today says we learned the most from an attack involving a movie\nWith a lot and he could take him out for drinks

many many many millions of accounts\nShould we just as soon that we've been picked off at some point I mean sometimes\nI feel so personally foolish for having lived my life online without worry before it became a host of this program I just did not even vulnerable but just foolish like to not be more thoughtful about the fact that sooner or later my personal information is going to get picked off\nAnd one of your ah your earlier guest commented on it which is we don't do enough to educate on it you know my my uh girls in school now and they don't have a standard course in the public school system on basic cyber cyber security and unfortunately you need it right now or it's not a safe space and part of learning how to make it safe is\nEducating people both at the consumer level and one of the things I talk about it in the books even at our most sophisticated institutions let's say MIT\nLearning cyber security unlike how to code was not part of the basic curriculum so even at the highest levels people weren't thinking about this day to day I Hope that there's time for a change in that it doesn't depend on just your behavior ... uh Joshua which is\nYou know when I grew up in New York in the eighties the uh it used to be if you made eye contact with someone or you know if you didn't cross the street when you saw someone than it was your fault if you've got that there's a famous Saturday Night live skit it's like what did you make eye contact and what do you expect to get out of that\nThat's kind of today on the Internet right like if you don't change your\nAlpha new Merrick a thirty character password\nEvery thirty days for the twenty five different accounts you have that it's your fault as a consumer I don't think we're ever going to get out of it if that's our mindset will we need to do is focused ON Technology\nThat makes it easier for consumers to use and also recognize there's maybe some stuff we shouldn't be doing using a protocol that's fundamentally not secure\nI Do think that we are having a slightly more sophisticated conversation these days I mean even the meeting the county west had with President Trump in the oval office there was a shot of him sitting at the resolute desk opening his phone and his password was zero zero zero zero zero which for those people in the home game and\nThese are really bad password to we pick apart what you're referring to as the code war you see that it bears some resemblance to the Cold War\nOf force but this setting a whose values prevail who's norms prevail about the world that we want to live in\nAnd then you need to execute on those values with your tactics so ... do deterrent bring criminal cases make public behavior that you think is unacceptable like\nThe Russian uh now where not touch a that indiscriminately hit companies around the world like Maersk shipping FedEx\nHospitals and took them off line I think we can partner with countries that share our values around the world worked together to collectively impose it costs on a rogue actor like Russia when they do that type of activity this say this is unacceptable it's not going to change overnight though just like the Cold War\nIt's going to take years and years and years of day in day out fighting and this war has already begun and part of what I was telling their stories that\nWe didn't used to tell that we kept secret inside government but now we're trying to make public I think importantly so that consumers so that companies can ... a ... that were already in this conflict and start taking steps to be a part of it\nYou quote your old boss early in the book here's part of what Bob Mueller said in his speech she worked on back in two thousand seven it's a fairly long quote but I Want to read it in its entirety here's part of what Bob Mueller said at the time quote\nThere is an old saying that all roads lead to roam in the days of the Roman empire roads radiate it out from the capital city spending more than fifty two thousand miles\nThe Romans built these roads to access the vast areas they had conquered but in the end these same roads lead to Rome's downfall for they allowed the invaders to march right up to the city's games he goes on to say quote\nThe Internet has opened up thousands of new roads for each of us new ideas and information new sights and sounds new people\nRight down those same roads to attack us in multiple ways unquote\nIs just another Roman moment so we kind of becoming a victim of our openness\nI think it could be if we don't realize the moments are the moments that we're in I remember vividly when a when director Mueller gave that speech we're out in uh in in the Pennsylvania area\nIt was the first major speech on cyber as a national security threat I think about that it is now considered\nBy the director of national intelligence all the major official to be the top threat it was only around ten years ago that we even talked about it's seriously from the director the FBI for the first\nTime I know you have like a a guest on later a number of former Justice Department person Monica bicker from Facebook\nAnd it reminds me of the terrorist threat that we're facing you know our openness began to be exploited by terrorists the same way that terrorist al ... to use the aviation which has done so much good and connected us around the world\nAnd they turned it into a weapon that caused thousands of deaths we started to watch terrorist groups my last two years ... tree division exploit social media\nIn order to get their adherence to kill and it was working inside the United states there's one chilling case\nUm that I talk about the still I think people haven't heard about ... advocates that looks from the perspective of a company like someone's stealing customer information names addresses the type a day in day out thing that you were talking about earlier\nHowever in this case he wasn't doing it to make five hundred bucks although he did ask for five hundred bucks he also through bitcoin on the also on the back and had become friends with one of the most notorious terrorist in the world a British born citizen named ... Hussein he became friends with them only through Twitter only on line and what he did\nAnd I look at it from his safe pole and Rocca us Syria he bombarded back to the United states through social media a list of the stolen customer information and said kill these people by name by address where they live\nThat's the new era of national security that that we're in we're criminal threat merge or blend with terrorists and national security threats and companies the private sector is on the front lines for the first time\nMichelle emailed as a person of a certain age I recall a world functioned before the digital age are total reliance on digital information is making us less safe were trading safety for convenience\nI Wonder John if Michelle has a point there used to be a time when you had to actually go to the bank to Rob it and now you don't\nShell definitely in fact one of the cases we talked about is an Internet a bank heist a where hackers managed to than human operatives to ATM machines all across the world and different countries and they used a hack\nThis simultaneously allow them to withdraw money from me at ... I think Michelle does have a point that you know for twenty five years\nWe moved to almost everything we value from analog space from books and papers to digital space\nAnd connected using a protocol the Internet's protocol that was fundamentally never designed with security in mind huge advantages to that economic convenience however we did so systematically and this was true in government along with the private sector without taking into account\nRisk without taking into account that the bad guys the terrorists that ... the rogue nation states the crux are going to move into that space we're

most recent hack of the social media giant compromise about thirty million users names phone numbers emails and other personal details\nFacebook says last month attackers found a vulnerability in the code and used Facebook's view as feature to steal access tokens these tokens or bits of code that let you log ride in without having type your password\nThere's Facebook with the last ten places you checked into or were tagged at and personal details that you posted like your religion your hometown your birth date where you work yeah a good reason to go check your Facebook account\nNow the company and the FBI or trying to catch these hackers and this year Facebook chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress that his company needs to raise its game\nFacebook is an idealistic and optimistic company for most of our existence we focused on all the good the connector and people can do and if Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love\nFor making their voices heard and for building communities in businesses\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy\nFacebook talks endlessly about its community and at the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda over the summer we spoke to Monica bigger she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on terrorists\nAre two ways that we become aware of content then might violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions of new post every day or two the first thing they become aware is if somebody reports content to ask you can report any piece of content through the fight if you do it come through and it's reviewed by faith\nOr the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking for content that might violate our policies so for instance terror propaganda\nNow we remove the terror propaganda that we've removed from face that's more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flat before\nNow once content had been flagged as potentially violated\nRod reviewing content in dozens of languages a and making a decision if it violates the policy then they'll remove it if it doesn't violate the policy to leave it up\nThat's got to be a hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the a specific area that person is working in all content reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise\nWe have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent of people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire hunting reviewers who speak all different kinds of language is an important to us that we have native language speakers because they really understand the way that language is used\nSo that the big focus in our hiring once you're hired as a content reviewer you're trained in all of our policies but then you were assigned to become a specialist in one so for instance you'll learn all about um our terrorism and harassment and bullying policies but you might ultimately be assigned to work on um identify and self harm threats of self harm\nWhen you catch content that doesn't belong on Facebook and violated the terms what's the difference between say reactive flagging and proactive flying how much of it is the kind of thing to say a reviewer or bought would find as opposed to something that I as a user would flag and then Facebook\nWith it we don't rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on the side that said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag violating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well and a couple of areas where it's harder areas where it's working really well with terror propaganda\nI'm with child sexual exploitation with spam with fake account we now have technical\nI'm In fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery or terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at the time of upload meaning nobody ends up seeing\nNow when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech or harassment a lot of that is very contextual\nFor instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or at our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the worded I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch\nIt was really important for us to give tools to people so that if I ... on Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to contact patterns I was a pattern recognition work\nWhat we do so most of our policies are about content that people are posting but we do have some policies that are focused on actors themselves\nFor instance if you miss represent yourself on Facebook we'll remove your account even if you're not otherwise pilot in our content policy and we also have policies against terror organizations and our members hate organizations\nUm and so forth so if you for instance wanted to create a page to support al ... and on that page you were just going to share photos of puppies and kittens in rainbows we would still remove it because we don't allow those groups or anybody representing those groups to have a presence on the site\nUm if you see a page that is violating our policies in its entirety meaning it's a page that's represent an al ... page that has been created for the purpose of bullying somebody then it's appropriate to report the page to us\nThe reason I mentioned that is because whatever you report that the piece of content that's going to come through to our review teams first and so if somebody has an otherwise okay profile and then they are attacking you based on your religion and you report that this\nUse or if you just tap on a comment directly\nSometimes it'll bring you up a menu that will say reply or lie or copy and then there's other options and in those other options there's an option to report somebody I Wonder how much Facebook is facing the learning curve of a world that is learning to use Facebook know decides designed to be intuitive\nI think it is increasingly intuitive the more you use it\nAnd because you're global you've got people in some parts of the world who are just beginning for the first time to have broadband devices or to be connected to a world where there are more devices in our people house Facebook teaching people to use Facebook\nWe definitely do outreach but you're right at different in different parts of the world people will have different levels of experience and finding these reporting options and even just understanding how this works\nDo we actually do the options that we offer people to report content actually do vary by location and we're always testing ways to get more report to us to make it easier now there's a tension here if you just have one big red button\nAnd people can practice whenever they want them to things happen one is that people might report things and what they really mean it just to hide it and get that constantly from them because they don't like that person and the other thing that happened and we don't have enough information about the public to route it to the correct reviewer right away", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "16"}
