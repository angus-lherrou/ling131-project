Hanukkah or mohawk and I'm frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help native issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nYou a progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focused on that\nYou would progressive she must have known why we both Kerry living 'cause we were going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what you would progress has brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nWell North Dakota has\nA voter identification law that has been stayed by the court until now last week the Supreme Court decided to essentially let it go into effect for the November election so what that means his new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election\nAs you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who's one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us wrapped Kevin Cramer her Republican challenger polls have Kramer ahead\nIn twenty twelve setting the high camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters she had a uh\nSo it her id law could potentially fall heavily upon Native Americans courts heads stayed it because they said that that north Native Americans in North Dakota we're less likely to have the types of ID that were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea and the first place\nAnd what kinds of ID are we talking about like what does the law requires\nThe central issue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have that they have PO box is they have mailing address it and those addresses are no longer sufficient\nSo if you have ID but it carries a mailing address like a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that idea used in the primary is no longer good for the general election\nA lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by their supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been\nUm talked about as a measure to prevent voter fraud and also because the the state has argued that a mailing address\nDoesn't necessarily locate a voter in the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot someone could use a mailing address and and even it'd vertically vote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a vote or die Lucian argument that that inappropriately cast a ballot and the wrong precinct would would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if you're a mailing address is somewhere different than where you actually reside\nWould love to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affect you particularly if you are part of a tribal population there was a ration maybe you live in an area where folks predominantly have fuel boxes as their primary mailing address rather than a physical street residential address what are you seeing and how is this affecting\nAt one a or comment on our Facebook page Jerry what did you hear from people in North Dakota about how this law is affecting them if it's on people's radar as this kind of more of a a smaller as\nI say it is and also you have to put it into the larger contact\nOr you see it as it is a is a big issue where does this ...\nOh I think it's really on people's radar absolutely an issue and I also think there's some context around it when I was reporting from North Dakota from the Standing Rock reservation which is in North and South Dakota but the north Dakota part is affected by this\nUm ... you know really one of the things that I was interested in one of the reasons I went there even before the Supreme Court ruling is because voter turnout there is the lowest in the state\nIt was the lowest in the state before this and that's because there are challenges that people their face and getting to the polls so I I think you have this law now\nBecoming a new complication for this election that has the potential to drive turnout even lower and you have people reacting to that their their\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Subaru featuring the all new three row is spent with feeding for up to eight and a

A. M. U. dot org\nLet's read one more eggs or from the book this is about something that happened to you and your mother or when you were younger not real far from here in Maryland it is on page eighty one would you mind reading from it's about halfway down page that he won the part that begins when we were half a mile from home\nSo almost the end of page eighty three which ends with the word flying\nWhen we were half a mile from home or Maryland police cars stopped us just like when they stopped at the Mississippi you set up in the capital kept both hands on the wheel and looked straight ahead\nYou took out your University of Maryland I D and suck my red black and green African medallion into my public enemy T shirt you told me to set up keep my hands on the dashboard don't say a word\nThe officer knelt down and lifting your window when I saw your face or close to his gun I Want it to snatch it and watch it melt into black grits evidence police started approaching me more often and Mississippi I wanted to super power to melt every gun in the world and the black rid the officer asked why we had in Mississippi license plate\nBecause we are residents of Jackson, Mississippi you say I have a post doctoral appointment at the University of Maryland College park have I done anything wrong officer\nWhen officer told you to speak up and claim your change lanes without signaling you kept your grip on the steering wheel and said I did not change lanes without signaling used to better behind me so I think no change lanes officer tried to laugh and you're faced as he asked me a license and registration\nIs that your main he asked you he needs to show some identification to your hands came up to staring well and you pointed at the officers face move away from my car you said that as much how he is Fifteen Years old he does not have identification may I have your badge number please\nI hated how it sounded when you didn't use contractions golf to ask both of us to step out of the car we will not get out of this car you said louder this time we have done nothing wrong\nMy fist were bald up and I was edging towards the driver's side window you slapped me across my chest with the back of your hand and told me to be quiet and unconscious my fifth right as another officer pulled up the first officer who now laughing walk back to the second officers car\nFlipped it over and told us to have a good night never give them a chance to take a shot you finally said after we walked in the apartment and lock the door they will take it they will take it they will take it I Wonder why you said it three times and why you never told me to shoot back\nMississippi Marilyn it doesn't matter where the where you are they will shoot Joe Black but out of the sky every chance they get if you have a heart attack dodging bullets they had they gone to say you killed just self\nI hear you I told you and try to make you laugh why didn't you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't and they instead of their though\nIf I did not know correct English is more likely that officer might have shot a few said\nOh you wouldn't I told you that fool got mad because you were speaking correct English you looked at me like you were thinking you might actually be right key but in the long run correct English will save a black man more than it will hurt you will correct English they view though\nI Do not need saving you said I'm not the one who was an endangered species I'm not either I told you I Am an endangered species would a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back that cop game in a bubble you laughed and laughed and laughed until you didn't\nWhile I was in my room change and you told me to write about what I learned from the experience with the police I wasn't sure what the right because I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky\nIt seemed like just driving or walking into a house or doing your job or cut it in a grapefruit was all it took to get shot out of the sky\nAnd the biggest problem was police weren't the only people doing the shooting they were just the only people allowed to walk around and threaten us with guns in prison if they didn't like our style of flying I loved our style of fly\nThe last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it\nYeah I mean that's the crux of a lot of ah the relationship our talk about in this book with my mother um I'm also talking about a situation where we went to I had to go to a new school in eighth grade was the first time I've gone to school with white kids\nAnd a few my best friends from a previous school over there and when my best best friends um took out a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way he did every morning when we were at a other school in Jackson and long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told them put the knife away treated a knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers and grandmothers\nAnd in that situation I learned that sometimes in off in a mock communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so ah my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying as a Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what not giving them a chance to look like\nEating a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out an elaborate without checking it out and that got in trouble so I just wasn't sure\nAbout this there's a theory my mom had the you know you conduct them you can dodge them if you just anticipate every move and again anticipation is crucial but what happens to home life when you spend your entire life outside at home anticipating white supremacy and white power doing un that's the question I'm trying to ask him if the action and also in the entire book\nWhat did happen with your home life particularly with with you and your mom is you were trying to grapple with these things that she was telling you or the way of the world and you were trying to understand and how did that affect your relationship with her ...\nShe started to be a a a lot more active and trying to police to me as my body group um and I started to have lots and lots of run ins with cops are starting to get kicked out of school more\nUm and we could talk about those things started we could talk about police we could talk about white people but we we couldn't talk about with things like sexual violence so we couldn't talk about with like domestic abuse she was in an abusive relationship I saw that relationship I reacted to that relationship I tried to fight and protect different relationship\nBut I Would never talk to her about that fighting that protection she saw me and relationships that were like difficult for me where I was being bad to my stove where I was mistreated people emotionally we didn't know how to talk about any of it so while we're doing really good sort of at talking about how we survive outside of the house\nThe particular kinds of violence is happening in my house were completely silent we never knew how to talk about it and it's so you know it took me until I was forty two forty one years old to have the guts to actually write into some of what was happening in our house and try to connect that to what was happening outside of our house\nI Want to talk more about your literary style but I did want to point out one other aspect of the anecdotes you just read\nWhere the officer looked at you and said who is that is that your man there's also this through line about people presuming that black boys are older than they are it was a factor in the shooting of to me or rice the young man who was shot dead in Cleveland, Ohio back in November of twenty fourteen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A
