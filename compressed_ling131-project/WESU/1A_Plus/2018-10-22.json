A. M. U. dot org glad to hear from some of you across the state of Florida about what you're looking for from the next governor\nLarry tweeted I Hope that when he wins mayor Gillum over a member of the poorest counties in my former home of the northwest Florida panhandle\nThey may be the ... parts of Florida but represents a real opportunity for a Democratic Party reaching out to the working class citizens of our state very\nThat is such an important point and I have to tell you having just helped to lead my community through the impact of hurricane Michael er we had Ninety percent of our power and knocked out thousands of treats come down roads that were blocked\nA within a week uh we had Ninety nine and a half percent of people with their power restored roads cleared\nAnd a sense of normalcy return to my community and the first thing we did was dispatch a our utility workers or to the western panhandle just west of us\nAre to begin that recovery effort for our neighbors are the Gulf Coast region will return that we will return stronger than ever but the next governor will help to preside over that restoration\nUh when when we are hit with natural disasters we come together as Floridians ah whether or not that that politically that that is a community that will be for me\nI'm In the no consequence there for liberty and and there were a part of a of our state they is often been forgotten where the forgotten coast will not be forgotten under a governor Gillum not only are we going to see that community restored we're also going to work with them or to help to define an economic future for that region that again makes them the pride of the state\nFlorida before we had one more voice to our conversation let me follow up with you on that a little bit one of the ...\nIt's about the future of these coastal communities you know parts of Florida like Mexico beach and basically the whole Florida coastline all the way around the state or in areas that are very much at risk for rising water levels Gulf levels ocean levels\nAs climate change progressive and it becomes increasingly difficult matter as to whether or not people are allowed to live\nRight next to the shore I mean you saw the satellite although the drone pictures of homes that were built up to the two thousand one building code and homes that weren't the whole world were standing in the home that weren't we're we're we're toothpicks basic that's right that Governor that that's got to be a tough decision kind of considering whether or not the state of Florida at a certain point has\nTo tell people we know you love the ocean we know you love the Gulf but it is not safe to live here you\nKnow it's it's such a fair point uh and and and and and in fact speaking about building codes or we may have to revisit a building codes again and light of the fact that we're seeing stronger in and and more increased storm um particularly up the Gulf where the Gulf waters are so warm\nI but then if then if you tell people where they can't live that affects the property tax base that affects the economy I mean what less\nThan right now we have the insurer a last resort in this state have undercover homes\nI'm Better night than luxurious then yes you know ocean front property but private insurance companies are refusing to write policies there and so that put the entire state at risk for having to ensure a homes that are being built in areas that are increasingly becoming\nUm a a threatened by rising sea levels so so what I Would say is is that we are deserving of a real statewide conversation likely county by county around how it is that we are going to be building more resilient communities that in the face of the level rise in climate change\n... in an on resilient way when we know that they are going to be susceptible to being wiped out\nUh with the increase dorm at an event and with sea level rise I I Can't I Can't tell you that there is a fan of the I I Can't I Can't tell you in this moment wedding back part of this state we would be having to begin this conversation I think it's going to be a state wide conversation and it's one that we're gonna have to lean into with county and local governments\nI Want to reiterate by the way we did invite the Republican candidate for Florida governor on defenses to take part in this discussion or a future discussion we have not yet heard back from his campaign but the invitation stands we would certainly love to have him on the program\nWhich I had one more voice to the discussion now to the questioning now joining us from W ELL are in public radio in Miami is Luis Hernandez who's the host of its daily talk show on dial Luis welcome to want to a\nA Joshua thank you so much I appreciate it and mayor again thank you I appreciate the opportunity I Do want to note that a thirty one of sixty seven counties in Florida have started early voting and the counties are most of the counties here in the VW well around listening area including Palm Beach Florida in Miami Dade county's have begun early voting\nI'm Mr Mayor it looks as though Republicans are going to hold the Florida House and Senate so how do you plan to get any of your ideas through if you're opposing parties in control of the two chambers\nWell one ah Luis good to hear your voice again a I'm a to 'em and well aware and thankful for you remind you at the early voting we actually had some of our supporters who overnight it\nLast night watching the debate and where the first in line to vote down in Miami for early voting but to your question one I Am not joined the conclusion that Republicans will hold the Senate um I think they will likely be in position to to hold the house but I think Democrats will get some gains\nThat being said we will have a divided government\nUm um I Would say this I think we've got to look too aware of the areas\nBe able to bring Democrats and Republicans together to help or get a salvage solution that might lead to a saving money and modernizing hum of them that is in desperate need of update\n'em and I will tell you I'm I'm willing and prepared to work with or what might be a speaker holy ...\nUm he and I spent some time together for two years or making our way through\n'em and Aspen Institute fellowship where we got to know each other pretty well now I don't take that the main than among convince them\nTo believe in everything I Believe or vice versa but I definitely think that we began from a place where we don't think of each other as you know our enemies if you will I Wish that they are to do the bidding to do the job of of of the people of the state and it's my hope to find areas where we can work together maybe on affordable housing\nOr maybe on dealing with health care in some ways can convince them that it makes sense to pull down that six billion dollars for health care which is but the state of Florida one of the most exploding parts of our budget\nUm so I'm I'm not beyond working with the other party I also don't draw the conclusion that you have to be the same party in order to work together you probably recall that there were a number of sessions where governor Rick Scott couldn't get his budget through and he shared the same party\nOr with the speaker of the house and with the with the Senate president so there there there may be some benefit in my opinion to negotiating into them negotiating with me\nAnd trying to ah find solutions I Know Floridians are tired of us getting nothing done they want their government to work for them and they're not interested in our part and then you know squabbles they want to make and that we can produce\nAnd and you mentioned a couple of different things or want to I wanted to approach you on is the criminal justice issue in public about the fact that your family had run ins with the law on both Miami Dade County and when you went to Gainesville uh one of your brothers was arrested on drug trafficking charges you may criminal justice reform\nFor updating the state's criminal justice system yeah I mean so first I mean\nA shape that have shaped it a lot I think if you recall from my opening video when I introduced myself I talked to a bit about\nYou know watching my mother you know two years well up in her face when uh you know the the cop would come by the house and say you know your guns in trouble again right um ... that's a difficult thing for any child to have to be an experience\nAnd I remember deciding at a very early age that I never wanted to see that expression on my mom's face because it's something that I did\nUm and so I Am the first to my seven siblings to graduate from high school and add the fit the seven kids and the first to graduate from college when my brother got home after doing his time um I watched him want to be a better father for his daughter and a better partner or to his girlfriend and then to his wife\nUm and he went and apply for a job to job at the job and got told no after no after no and it really did shake my belief that list and how can we say we want people to pull themselves up by the bootstraps\nYou do you think jazz you're hearing is

Louis Hernandez of double you all are in public radio in Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum Louis I Know our time is short but let me let you get an another question for the mayor\nNo definitely a mayor I did want to ask you about the issue of race because it's been a pervasive throughout this campaign uh but you already know this lord as one of the most diverse populations in the country or the latest census data says that sixteen percent of the population is black twenty five percent\nHispanic or Latino how's your campaign connecting with black and brown voters to get them galvanizing to take part in this midterm election\nYeah I mean I think we're doing 'em all the right things to try to communicate a across frankly all community um I've been in red areas blue areas purple area I was in ... I think Trump one button thirty points Flagler about the same much we've been to the villages\nAre but we are here you know I I Will be at the University of South Florida where I Am today I'm with students um uh just did a roundtable with a Puerto Rican leadership in Orlando a hosted an event\nUm um buddy quest for getting them I'm a a little while ago with the Little Haiti and did a video because I couldn't make it down there a ... a which went really well\nElection we saw a hundred and fifty thousand voter turn out to vote who either one we're voting for the first time or two we had not voted in the previous three elections a hundred and fifty thousand\nOr the last two races for governor Democrats lost by less than Seventy thousand votes\nUm if my plan to double that number in this general election of unlikely voters and many of those voters will be younger voters of color are more women are more poor voters and I think we're going to perform very very well but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor as if the electoral college you don't win one area and lose another when one county and lose another the one who wins and the one who gets one more vote and that one vote may come through from anywhere throughout the length and the breath of distasteful unprepared to go there\nWill go in because we're going to get voted a reason to turn out and vote for something and not just against\nThere are so many things I Would love to ask you mayor Galen so many great policy questions we've gotten from our listeners perhaps we'll have a chance to talk to you again but one more matter of policy I'd like to ask you about before we let you go and that has to do with a gun policy in the state of Florida ... two questions from two of our listeners by email Jim emailed\nMayor Gillum given that at least the house will be in Republican hands what can be done to reduce the impact of Florida's Stand your ground law it seems unlikely you would be able to repeal it\nAnd then Ryan emailed what do you plan to do to better enforce current gun control laws before trying to pass new legislation ...\nYeah well first I'm a I think we have to work hard I'm at the repeal the stand your ground as it is an unnecessary law and the state of Florida we already had castle doctrine which allows for individual to protect themselves and their businesses against intruders um onto their property\nI'm Sorry I I I hate to interrupt I think we should probably be cleared the difference between what you're talking about just by way of contacts\nSelf at home or at worst stand your ground carries it farther and says you have the right to use deadly force and they feel threatened in any where you have a window right to be just anywhere yeah and again that's that's vigilante gives them a that's the wow wow west and the city streets of you're able to make a decision\nA about whether or not you consider somebody to be a threat I'm Out of your own imagination or in the recesses of of of your own mind and I think that that is dangerous\nCastle doctrine already production your home there's already common last self defense which means\nAnd places where you are in public square and you result to having to defend yourself with deadly force there's already case law on the book where you've been able and you've seen cases where people are able to successfully argued the case that it made sense to be able to use deadly force\nBut to not take that to a different dream and to provide under the cover and the color of the law people being able to sniff out innocent life based based off of their perception of threat\nTo me it it is a is a stretch too far\nUm as it relates to what we can do obviously on that I I Want to make the case then I Want to use regular voice of the Floridians to make the case\nOr to outlaw makers around the absence of common sense when it comes to these kinds of laws and help them understand how families like mine and like others who are raising black children I'm In black and brown children feel particularly\nI'm a ... by laws like the take the case of Trayvon Martin in a trace of mark the case of murky muddy locked in\nA and there are many others and quite frankly talk to prosecutors who are staying and they're seeing\nA the criminals on both sides who are using stand your ground as a way to take out there you know they're they're gang enemy because they both have weapons so it has also been extended to giving cover for for legitimate either\nOut of the and the fans to Ryan's point before we let you go with regards to enforcing current gun laws before trying to pass new ones what would you say the ... so I Would say one\nYes we must enforce a current laws but we also got to do things like ensure that if you want to carry the power of God at your weight but you ought to have a background check\nTo do things like a convicted a domestic violence abuses should not get access to weapons where they can and I felt a lot of their loved ones closing the gun show loophole these are extreme these are radical I was too by the n._r._a. in Tallahassee because we refused to repeal an ordinance that our city was simply said you can't shoot guns in city parks\nYou can't do guns in parts for our kids play and our in our family picnic\nAnd that was considered to be too extreme we we've lost the comments tentacle balance here we're not talking about in the front of the second amendment\nWas talking about how do we keep our kids safe in school how do we reduce the level of an ongoing everyday gun violence that pervades our neighborhoods and we got a ... with us from Dayton here and unfortunately they enter re runs roughshod over the state of Florida right now we got to put them back into it\nGillum the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida running for governor as a Democrat mayor Gillum we really appreciate your making

A. M. U. dot org\nSarah there was one more thing I did want to ask you before\nWe had to let you go we heard from a number of listeners about their thoughts on being in unions not every teacher is satisfied with the union that they're in grants that I Can't think of any union that makes all of its members happy but we did hear from John in\nAll ripping the union negotiations for us on a ... salary health insurance\nAll that kind of stuff um I Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent the higher levels user account ability that would ultimately lead to higher salaries more competition within the profession I feel that sometimes wants teachers are cute\nTenure that's negotiated underneath the union contracts\nThat were unable to continue to drive competition in the teaching marketer and ultimately compare ourselves to other business areas where competition drives salary growth\nJohn thanks very much for getting in touch with us Sarah I'm Wondering what you think of John's commented does have a point to unions allow workers to sometimes rest on their laurels\nWell and I'm like to make a couple of comments about that um first off\nI've not always been happy with everything that my union has done but one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union is the numbers\nThe union is not just your union leaders union movements are driven by members and members need to demand\nAnd you know what they want to see the union do also I Would say I think there's some misunderstanding about you know teacher hiring practices and firing practices um it's actually not that difficult to fire a teacher but what unions have done is made it clear that\nYou can't just fire a person for no reason you do have to give them due process you have to observe than you have to evaluate them you can't just say well we don't really like what you said so we're going to let you go or you know and\nPart of the reason that's so important is because\nTeachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay and if we did not have that due process in place you would\nAnd before I let you go Sarah I Know that your goal is to get into the west Virginia House of delegates in and try to work with the other delegates about improving\nPolicies for teachers what about West Virginians do you think that residents of your state are really motivated to see the kinds of changes you're trying to bring about I mean if they were motivated than I Wonder if it would have taken the strike to make things happen in West Virginia\nI think that they are I'm not evaded and I do believe that that is why the strike was says except for all we could not have done what we did without the support at our communities\nAnd I think that our communities realize you know it was portrayed in the media is that the strike was just it out hey are just about health care it's not about that\nNot just about that it's about improving conditions for students for teachers for families and for working people in general and I had seen with my own eyes\nLegislators are repeatedly putting the entrusted outside corporate interests over their own people in this state and that is what I Want to stop\nSarah Duncan a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates also a visual arts teacher Sarah we appreciate Jamaican time forest thanks very much\nThank you which I had a few more voices to the conversation now but first let me read a few of your comments bill in Cleveland email and\nI don't think workers should be forced to join a union but I also don't think that those who choose not to join should receive the benefits of the union's efforts non union members should go it alone and individually negotiate their pay and benefits with their employer you can't have it both ways\nLuke tweeted how we govern unions seems to be the wrong question if working conditions were good or fair equitable enough unions would be a necessary so maybe ask how do we govern employers Scott I think we should be clear with regard to bill from Cleveland ... comment about non union members\nContract is a floor not a feeling it's the basic wages and working conditions workers can negotiate for more if they want but a union contract kind of sets the minimum the basis for all the workers working conditions right\nI Believe that's the case I mean there's a lot of variation from state to state and workplace or to work place when it comes to um union rules and and the sort of um [noise] uh uh differences that you were talking about\nI Know someone that we should put that question to who I think is an expert on drugs now and she's joining us NYC in New York Randi Weingarten is the president of the American federation of teachers which is the second largest teachers' union in the U.S Randy welcome to want to say\nHey Joshua and that Sarah and Sarah is one of these awesome members that I she's running in in a very upscale district that I Hope she makes it one of the three hundred teachers is running\nI Do want to talk to you a little bit more about that in a moment I should also contract a union contracts I should also introduced Vincent for new geo he's a senior fellow at the Mackinac Center for public policy and senior policy adviser at the state policy network and he joins us from Michigan Radio Vincent welcome\n[noise] hey thank you for having me on principle use me Randy before we continue could I just put that question to you in terms of members going it alone just for the sake of clarity a collective bargaining agreement is a floor it's not a ceiling you could negotiate for more but the point of a CPA to stay views or at least the minimum working conditions and wages right\nWell um it's in in some in some industries it's a Florida stealing\nIt depends on what the clause is about ... city um and the beginning clauses of a union contract\nSometimes is for everyone and sometimes it's a floor and sometimes it covers all of the conditions of um of employment including pay okay so it it it it changes\nYou've never been in the union to know that it can be that they're they're mileage may vary Vincent you you have said that the oral arguments in the Janice case that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier led to the teachers strike this spring house oh\nWell that's right but before we get to that let's just go back and to find exactly what right to work isn't exactly what Janice brought to public employees across the country\nAll right to work all Janice means is that a union can get a worker fired for not paying them it doesn't affect collective bargaining in any other way unions workers can still negotiate with employers over wages hours working conditions anything they could before right to work before ...\nThey can negotiate for after it\nExcept for the ability to just say you're ... you must pay us or you're fired\nAnd going back to that contract is a a floor and not feel like uh the vast majority of collective bargaining agreements especially those are the public sector\nHave seniority built in are the only way to get a raise and by logging and other your other job and I um am all the way to go ahead and finish off um so I I I actually agree with Bill um you know workers should have the ability to negotiate individually if they want to the Mackinac center has model legislation it's called the workers choice\nThat allows public employees to fully opt out of union representation represent themselves to negotiate a better contract if they can\nIf union worker workers don't pay unions to negotiate for them how can that not have an impact I mean you have to pay the staff to negotiate for you\nRight Vincent [noise] uh the\nProblem is that they are forced to accept that representation whether they want it or not I don't know I hear\nYou on that I I I hear you on that piece I just want to make sure we're clear on the argument you're making if the staff to negotiate your contract he's paid and there are workers who choose not to pay into that staff how could that not\nOne of them is that human yet you W ...\nOr every Wednesday starting at six thirty pm every Wednesday but

A. M. user station they care about and so they choose to give and so the barometer we have\nOf whether we're doing what people want their willingness to become members to become sustaining members to give to read it in their will to donate their cars to be you know cash now to to support the station\nIt feels like a similar argument with folks in right to work states where they say if unions are doing what they are members want them to do you have to compel them to pay or do they will pay gladly because they'll know what they're getting from the union they can't get on their own it's absolutely essential what's wrong with that argument\nSo Josh what it's frankly the arguments and the point that Janice case has ... has decided\nThat you know everything is completely voluntary the argument used to be this that if you are creating a staff and I'm an entity that is a bargaining contracts and representing all of everyone\nThen it shouldn't just be the people with the loudest voices that get the attention it should be everyone who gets the attention and that just like in terms of taxes to the United states of America or to\n'em or or bar association fees or student loans the or student organization fees\nThat when you have an obligation to serve all that all pay a fair share and that was the argument that actually had a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in the booth case about forty five years ago and six six ... Supreme Court rulings that affirmed it\nWill be the case the Janice overturned exactly so but look Janice that Alito Sam Alito judge of the Supreme Court has wanted this case has asked for this case for years\nThe Mackinac center I Wish they were being more honest about it that the Mackinac center that Donald Trump that others made was that you know the Democratic party used unions as their foot soldiers so let's defund unions that had really nothing to do with other kinds of things and therefore they want us to to find out however that case it's done\nAnd what has happened since is that members have stuck with unions and and and and and Vincent said something else which I think was or Scott which I think I just want to raise which is that the Mackinac center\nActually violated all sorts of school board policy and all sorts of norms and laws by the day after the genocide case sending an email on school email to ... to virtually every single teacher in ten states\nIf we we if we had done that\nPeople would be flapping us around rightfully what we do is we actually organize I'm outside of school and what we've tried to do is basically say to to the states just give us some time so we can introduce people to the union\nOkay let me give a drink and a chance to respond to them then we'll keep moving by the way it is worth knowing that the Mackinac center did file a friend of the court brief in the ... versus Ashby case but go ahead Vin let me give you a chance to respond\nWell thank you and you know there's groups across the country that are communicating with public employees to tell them about their rights mackinaw has their my pay might say dot com website I'm In Ohio to go back to your previous caller that are the workers choose dot org website\nAnd these efforts are needed because unions like Randy are trying to trap public employees into paying them or trying to limit the time that they can exercise their rights under ... I'm In some cases in credibly confusing time periods\nOn some cases only about a week off so that um states like New York\nPitch to a public employees while at the same time forbidding anybody else from talking to that our employees and this is during the work\nThat way clerk clerk what you mean by a captive audience ... what what exactly are you referring to [noise] um well\nRecent legislation passed in several states gives unions the ability to do what they call a orientation sessions with a with new employees so basically think it's time share presentation on steroids where the unique can come and\nSay this is why you have to join put a do check off for a more a membership form in front of them say you have to you know here's why you really shouldn't tied up\nAnd there is no one else saying well wait a minute you know you actually have the right not to so that's why you're seeing all these efforts these educational efforts around the country saying no no no you're right\nAnd by the way if there is a artificial time period to limit\nWhen you can exercise you're right um this is what it is and shares help navigating that often confusing process in that process that may confusing on purpose to keep public employees trapped", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "22"}
