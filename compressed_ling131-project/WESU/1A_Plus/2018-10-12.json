W W dot org before we move on from the weather and climate Louis there was one more thing you want to jump\nYeah I just wanted to uh to mention you know poll Rome or the other guy who won the Nobel Prize in economics this week talking about carbon taxes being the solution to to the crisis at least in part\nOn and you know I think it's important to recognize that sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there\nAnd that is if you commit to attacks uh on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue head on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people to make money investors to to make money off of it because when money at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate\nAn economic argument is often on carbon tax or that it's bad for business\nCalifornia's the fifth largest economy in the world and Jerry Brown just signed an executive order committing the state to carbon neutrality by twenty forty five which I'm sure sounds crazy to people outside of the state but that's actually very close to one of the policy prescription the I the I PCC set forth\nIt's kind of crazy until you do it real and California is very serious about doing it\nIt's a very serious about doing it um you know Paul Romer talks about\nThe problem isn't going to be solved until you build consensus 'em and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political will not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada at the same thing there you have prime minister Justin Trudeau trying to\nImpose a carbon tax across the country and he's running into a real opposition at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment more common\nA good point not my economy I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not questioning the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying\nLarry tweeted it's frustrating to hear criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck\nThis storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand\nI disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you heart in your home and if you want to live in Florida\nThat if he pays the risk of living within ... yards of a rising coastline if you want to live there you just have to absorb that on the other hand I totally hear what he's coming from Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall\nHad to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake the town cannot incorporate it it's it's a tough one\nNobody's really tough and when we're when we're thinking about climate change in the sort of thirty to forty year are taught and I were just talking about the trying to break\n'em there are extras sensual risks that are opposed not just to\nA community is close to the coastline to where we are talking about today but large cities you know like Miami in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about\nSurvive ability about resilience on whether people want to continue living there and there is an element of risk that you take her that also has to give people some agency and what I think is missing from the conversation about climate change is a real honest discussion about long term risk\nAnd what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... one small point just the end if you think that risking getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here\nThe generals like Colin Powell advisers had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they started to migrate when they upset the relationships between countries and that becomes not just their problem in terms of life and death but America's problem in terms of of keeping the world in order\nWill listen for those of you who are in an had been in the path of hurricane Michael we wish your core speedy recovery and we'd love to\nHear from you as you continue to deal with the recovery give us a sense of how you're doing how the recovery is going\nWhat your thoughts Darren how things are going how well FEMA is meeting your needs state officials how well that's going we always love to hear from you feel free to email is\nOne a at W.

A. M. U. dot org Todd's will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nThe Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump is using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing\nSome of them seem determined not to let the Kavanaugh's confirmation go it seems to have had\nOpposite effect or at least so it seems these numbers are little sketchy I Want to put the provides though around what I'm about to say\nUh that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterm we will know in four weeks however it looks like now it's having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging the Republican and a red state\nActually had a chance of either surviving or in the case of Tennessee uh maybe picking up an open seat to now a surge for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon seems to in Senate races have solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously\nIn house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that it had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that a Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fight to at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nA in a lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college\nI Would look to the house most likely house members who may if the numbers hold true control the house after January they will control\nThey will become the peanut factories they will also have to respond to a base that wants to Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this Joshua comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of the FBI background check that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile\nHighly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee\nAbout the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up the church ...\nI'll add to this you know senator Kamala Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee but she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the chance to grill\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on their face to face um how much intervention did the White House do in this does supplemental background check\nWill click also on ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up so she's up for reelection\nYou think that that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd my thing I'll say it she just last night um with trying to take the fight from you know on this go to think too\nThat the way that they're trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California Trump's nomination this is a court that's been a real store and in from by the White House just put forth as three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on them she's very upset about that and Trump\nAre tempted ministry ... really breaking from tradition by not giving the home state senators any say in these pets\nDo you want to see if we can leave time to talk California politics for the round up it's up to ...\nThe swift and Kanye West he publicly just missed swift for endorsing two Democrats in Tennessee and he woke up Kanye West of the White House yesterday ... wore red make America great again hats for the visit\nAnd we're going to have lunch you were going to talk a lot of other ones I I don't want to put you in that but I Do I Love this guy right let me give\nI Love this guy right there\nNo county West was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like Saturday Night live make the president look bad he said the president needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear those Shane Harris ... seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he had noted\nThat he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of\nEach criticized but the fact that he said that he is a bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping them obscenity at the other side of the regular desk I I'm not sure what to do with it\nI I'm not either I mean I I think it was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on other ... arguably more important stories I hesitate to dig through these deep and it's like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of set is that there's this really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it but it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre\nCarnival asks spectacle that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office than in from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of uh\nThe office of the president\nTo see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make it a behavior from a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that's his right but there's also left many people scratching has had about what is he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him or he was just a very strange moment that I Know for\nFor for for me and my colleagues who just tried to move past it as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest in moving past as quickly as we could do that too but I should note the county's old and Mrs Taylor Swift and sort of herself into politics this week\nShe endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media\nThe Senate race in Tennessee is tight and British sin has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram and voter registrations among young people rose by more than sixty thousand\nAfter her post\nShane Harris let me stick with you for a moment because President Trump is facing another difficult situation regarding the disappearance of a journalist named ... Saudi dissident and a resident of the U.S she disappeared inside the Saudi consulate\nIn Turkey you've been doing a fair bit of reporting on this particularly the concern that the Turks have raised that the Saudis basically said hit men to kill ... show you because of his reporting\nThe Turkish government hasn't really provided any independent evidence for this they say they have security video and and and logs of people who signed in and so forth what do we actually know right now if anything about what really happened\nRight well what we know right now is largely coming from the Turks and Turkish security agencies are what we reported last time my colleagues land the Post's late last night was that the Turks have told the Americans that they actually have audio recordings and video from inside the consulate that they say definitively prove that John ... who was\nRemembered inside that facility um the Americans and we understand have not seen the footage or heard it themselves but there's a growing believe within the U.S intelligence community and I think within Congress in the White House or that the Saudis probably did kill them all ... and are not\nAt all being forthcoming about that this is a politically difficult situation for this president in particular because the White House is so close to uh the the regime in Saudi Arabia I'm Jared Kushner the president's son in law and senior advisors actually very personally close to a man named Mohammed been among the crown prince\nYou've made me realize that\n\nWhat happened to Jamal 'cause she'll get turkey says the Saudis sent shipment to kill this outspoken journalists the Saudis denies that\nFrom W.

Saudi Arabia allegedly did to Mr to show you that they basically said hit men after him what do we know for sure about the disappearance at this point\nFor shall we know that he ... to into the come so uh in Istanbul\nAnd he didn't work out that is what we know for sure there are reports that they were to go ... jet that came from Saudi Arabia or with fifty men have they they go into a blackout a van a drug\nTo him now there are reports that collecting that attack each intelligence have proof\nOr that or that they know what happened to him and that he was tortured and dismembered\nAnd I met the most brutal brutal death under the fifty men then flew back to a Saudi Arabia on that gulfstream jets a little later in the day now we know the the planes that were there to play movements at different times that came into his stumble ... and then went back to react\nWho was on them what that designation was within the state capital rates widowed one hundred percent no but you get the things that are the what the Turkish are telling the authorities here\n... you were Thirteen here in the U.S to understand is not a million miles from what I have just sketched out because I think

that you can easily sweep onto the carpet in international affairs and there are some things that are just there are a bit more awkward I miss definitely falls into the latter category\nWhere we I

day all the weapons we told them would be rendered useless and Jared Kushner would be banned from any policy making\nLaw the sharp elbows thrown in that comment I Wonder if you could help it's fact\nChecked that yeah I think um it's it's a really a fascinating point and also that that um clip you played of Donald Trump was really striking because I'm the one hand\nIt seemed so I'm cold Lee transactional in the sense that he was saying you know we have billions of dollars pouring and why am I going to stop that just because they have murdered a dissident journalist in other words I I'm Still a you know I don't care about human rights I mean we usually stand up for I care about money pouring into the United states economy\nAnd that attitude had activated a lot of\nUm people in Washington who are against our alliance with Saudi Arabia for example senators on both sides of the aisle that Chris Murphy and Rand Paul who have an argument for a long time just as the commentator said I'm\nNow we're supporting the war in Yemen that it's unconscionable that is starving civilians and killing civilians killing civilians and you know bought the tax and other things that are just horrendous um\nThe hell out of the country short but since you mentioned Rand Paul\nUs arms sales to Saudi Arabia I'll let you finish your thought but first let's hear from Senator Paul\nI think that the early reports of showing that this is linked to the Saudi Government and nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval so no I think that ah and less and less of a sudden the journalists turns of alive\nI think that we should we should just continue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia [noise] plus I think we need to be voting in the Senate and debating whether or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead so I was gonna say people like Rand Paul are going to push back against arms sales about about our support for the war in Yemen\nUm even a at a law makers invoking the global Magnitsky Act which said that that the u._s. trumping ministries and have to investigate what happened and if they find Saudi officials responsible they need to impose sanctions all that being said I Want it there is a counterpoint to this deal which is that\nOur relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been transactional Trump kind of that the quiet part out loud a little bit in the way he in a way he framed it out yesterday because we have never had a relationship an alliance based and values since World War two it had all been about money and oil think about nine eleven Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia\nThat didn't lead to a permanent rupture in our alliance because we have always seen them as a strategic ally and added the values based ally in Europe and I think that's important to keep in mind that Trump said it and it particularly accentuated way and he feels you know it's very transactional way past presidents have\nBut it's been somewhat reflective of what you at the presidents have said quietly for a long time\nSure sure if I could chip in the ... I mean I think Donald Trump said out loud what other presidents and other prime minister such that it could moments in relationships you have with regimes that are far from perfect I mean I remember when Tony Blair was prime minister\nAnd there was a huge I'm Still that was about to be concluded and the British serious fruit office launched an investigation into Saudi Arabia or had been doing\nHe says that the ... you've got to call this the core off the dos otherwise the deal is in jeopardy\nAnd highly unusually much to flee controversial Leigh\nTony Blair intervened with a ... an independent investigation and said right we're canceling that investigation\nAnd he used his power as prime minister because he felt he had to because Saudi Arabia was to the customer\nToo important an ally and you've seen with Donald Trump you know one of the first place if he went to when he became president was to Saudi Arabia I traveled with him on that trip\nAnd it was they were one hundred percent in with Mohammed bin Salman now whether they're regrets email or not it's an open question however they they are they're on the un Donald Trump is determined the arms deal will go ahead [noise]\nJust before we keep ... oh go ahead and oh I was just\nGonna say if I could just add one thing that struck me as what the president didn't say he didn't mention Iran and he didn't mention the piece done as you recall last month that the UN\nAt the United states is pretty aggressive in calling around the biggest threat to the region and by extension it was seen Saudi Arabia that stopgap against possible Iranian expansion\nAcross the middle east on and of course Saudi Arabia would be key to any sort of he still so I think it's interesting that I'm a month ago we were talking about\nPolicies and going against Iran and so going forward how much will the U.S focus on Iran and stopping an Iranian expansion on shape it's reaction or lack there of 'em to chew what's happened in Saudi Arabia and if it if in fact is the case that they have\nKilled a journalist inside their conflict who is it a resident of the United states\nOf journalists to have been killed there is another journalists being remembered today in Bulgaria at a funeral the body of thirty year old TV host Victoria marine over was found over the weekend near the Dan River in northern Bulgarian town she had been raped and\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Boehner with the bonus certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractor is committed to expertise\nCapital one committed to reimagining banking offerings savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere capital one what's in your wallet capital one an a and from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nBack now to the friday news roundup with John Stewart ... uses and worry free been still time to get in some of your questions and talked about the week top stories as well one at a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nThe story of the next president of Interpol Ming hungry who's reported missing last week by his wife that stories moved Maine was detained by Chinese authorities on corruption charges\nHe resigned in immediate effect this week the arrest as part of a larger official anti corruption campaign by China's president Xi Jinping no great among the ex Interpol president's wife is speaking out she told the Associated Press that she felt threatened\nThan it used to do we have a sense that you know of why this was going on and what it is that makes me so important to the Chinese government of what this means for the larger sense\nHe's been a long time operative of the the Chinese government and there are arguments being made that this is part of an effort to purge non loyalists to the Shia government and so there is no definitive answer but\nI think the message that um many are taking as if somebody who's been in government this long and the police capacity um it could be sweat swept off the streets and his wife sent a knife a ... the day the day he disappears at knowing and China's safe and and at the time of all this there was talk from\nParty officials about the importance of absolute loyalties said there is to just since certainly is that somehow he was less than ... in the eyes of the government I Will say I think I'm One of the more interesting developments as well as his wife and how outspoken she has been she has been\nIt was an interesting development and may have led to more information coming out quicker than Chinese officials wanted to happen and so it was fascinating to watch her sort of use um the public platform in a way we see more often in the west as a way to get information about her husband and defend her husband that's it's something we don't normally see\nWas heading out to Brazil were far right presidential candidate John ... surprised the nation when he shot to the top of the ranks he nearly took the election was forty six percent of the vote just shy of preventing a runoff Brazilians will vote in the run off elections soon on October twenty eighth\nWorry Freidman can you remind us to show your ... is and what makes him and he's policy platform so newsworthy\nYeah he's a fascinating character he's been he's a former army captain has been in a Congress for almost three decades um he's a law and order candidate that his his big thing so he said you know our crime rates are too high we need to empower the police he is very controversial and saying you know the police need to shoot first\nUm and and um shoot to kill 'em and and also to loosen gun laws to address crime rates he's also very controversial in the sense that he said things that are most optimistic\nUm that are anti ... it'd be the um and one other thing that's really important is to Brazil we often forget I'm only became a democracy in Nineteen eighty five or return to democracy Nineteen eighty five for Twenty one years ahead of dictatorship and he had spoken ... um\n[noise] about the time of the dictatorship as a time when there were law and order one other point to know if it he is an armored with Donald Trump a lot of conservatives feel that Donald Trump has the right formula be pro business you know loosen regulations\nAh you know be nationalistic and be about cracking down on crime and he has promised me of really close ally of the United states all of this is I'm very a shocking because Brazil for many ... for decades has been led by a leftist government or there was a little more ambivalent about his relationship with the United\nSo I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to come to your studio this evening and so I think that there is kind of a feeling that you know he is he's got his head down he has said what he said people not exactly where he stands and I think he sees the finish line\nOne story that much of the world has been talking about how to do with a new report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the eyepiece she sees\nThe report says that the world is quickly running out of time to stem catastrophic climate change scientists predict we're on course to go beyond a crucial threshold of the world's average temperature rising one point five degrees Celsius or to point seven degrees Fahrenheit\nIn just over about ten years they have that would leave us dealing with the risks of extreme drought wildfires floods food shortages for hundreds of millions of people we talked about this report on the program this week one comment from a listener stuck along the lines that at least here in America\nIs just not a big enough issue I mean people will vote for a lot of reasons and the state of our climate is not something that lawmakers talk much about or that voters demand to discuss Mitt to use it what is your sense of that or whether or not this report has made an impact around the world enough for people to start demanding action\nI think it's made an impact but the problem is the effects of this already being seen in various ways around the world so where one country can say it's not a big impact another country could see it as an immediate impact and something that needs to be dealt with aggressively and of course the kinds of changes at this report says need to happen or so on\nDrastic that in demand sort of a uniform world agreed upon action and we're not there yet and so I'm ... years teen of variance in response and I think it really reflects the variants have impact that nation's already seen\nAny either as a war correspondent and one of the things I see it come
