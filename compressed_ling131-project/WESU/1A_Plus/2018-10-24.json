A. M. U. dot board Barbara emailed I still talk weekly by phone to you have any friends in Sana'a and thought uh they are living in hell and they ask\nWhy does America hate us so much why does America wants to kill us\nWhat do I say\nSome of before we continue in before we bring in our next voices on the conversation I Wonder if you could just for those people who haven't been following the Yemeni civil war very clearly can you just boil down at the core of it what does this conflict about who are the fighters and what are they fighting for\nSo yeah I'm In conflict and it's actually quite complex conflict\nA it's a it's a conflict that has many layers to it but ultimately what you were hearing the news is that's a it's a Saudi Iranian proxy war you'll so here that he got ... at the who the government and kind of odd that announced itself is actually in fact a a coup government that has drawn by militia\nAnd that the Saudi Government is trying to restore the legitimate Yemeni government ah to power in Yemen now the problem with all of that as this conflict is\nFailing to do all of the things that they're saying is that it's about for example when Saudi Arabia got involved in the conflict with the Arab coalition the aim is to bring back the Yemeni government the government has been\nOn top of that the who the militia in a sense has gained so much more since the war started in the sense that at first they had to share power with\nUh the former president of Yemen where you know in two thousand eleven you haven't had a revolution and I'm the president was removed\nBut he ... himself with the ... and was president for some time\nBut I'm the shared power with him now fast forward three years into the war they had killed them and and now they have their own control of the majority of the north of Yemen\nAnd of course the the scariest thing about this just the hook English I had managed to capture the Yemeni military arsenal that belong to the former government is now all in their hand and so in a sense what the war that is complicate an already complicated political situation\nAnd it devastated the lives of millions of Yemeni\nUh for example Seventy five percent of the Yemeni population is is suffering and in need of immediate aid and depend on foreign aid to kind of survive and this is Seventy percent increase since before the war began um\nAnd I do want to talk more about the the population on the ground but needs help I just want to move before we get to our next wars and also didn't want to be clear there's a sectarian part of the abuse\nThese who the rebels who kind of came after the government your Saudi Arabia involving itself but there is the Muslims sectarian aspect to this also used to be versus Shia conflict as a proxy war right\nSo this is what's interesting and this is what a lot of the people don't realize first of all the Shiite and Yemen are don't practice the same sect of ... that Iran practices or\nThe Shiites in Lebanon are at all to practice they practiced a sect called the DSM and the ideas and it's known as five or ... and it's really different from twelve years\nResembles so many of them are in Indiana and we the Sunnis there are shot values and the divide isn't you know the the Shiites are not a minority like in other places they're forty five percent of the population\nAnd so what's interesting about this you know any Shia conflict is that it's entirely manufactured in a sense that of course there are differences between these those two sacks of course there are situations where they don't agree but they managed to co exist for many years now the ... ... or the who the sect\nOf of you know what's happening in Yemen they're no longer practicing as they did and as it as it seems like they're trying to politicize stay DSM into kind of a state themselves more with the Iranian sect of she has them and the Sunnis and ...\nHas struggled to maintain expect as it is with the influence of well how does them and set up for them coming into the country and so in a sense what you're saying is that the most radical elements of those two\nAre fighting each other and so in a sense you have the presence of a new ... conflict but one thing that I really have to point out to the listeners here is that that's not the only thing going on\nI'm a huge portion of the country in the liberated territory from the control is actually demanding secession and that is something that you don't hear about in the news as much you know in the south and ever since Nineteen Ninety four the people there felt that they were under occupation and the costs the secession\nAre rising day after day as this conflict continues\nI'd want to make sure we get to a voice on the ground in Yemen but I hear what you're saying summer in terms of all of these very complex fault lines of kind of come together to fuel the civil war today before we came on to be here today\nWe were able to get through to Sana'a in Yemen off communication into and out of Yemen is really tough but we did make contact with least grounding she's the UN's resident and humanitarian cordon\nOn precision that we to just a few minutes ago we're going to be welcome to want to thank you very much\nCan you give me a sense just in a in a larger context how many people the un fears are at risk of famine right now\n[noise] in game and we are worried that his steps are not taken right now in order to stop the spread of hunger that we could see as many as fourteen million ... who are facing famine by the end of the year this is why the United nations is rain the alarm bells\nAnd telling everyone that we are facing possibly the biggest famine in living memory if we don't do something to stop it right now\nWhat are some of the other health risks that you're looking at their other than just starvation I'm sure with deprivation of reasonable secure supply of food all kinds of other health problems also come into play right\nThat's exactly right last year the largest cholera outbreak in modern history hit name and there were more than a million people who are suffering either from Colorado or from watery diarrhea there had never been an outbreak of such magnitude in living memory\nNow this year because of the heroic work that's being done by frontline partners in UN agencies and officials here in game and we've been able to contain the spread of how the Democrats have similar levels there is a lot of color in the country but it's not spreading at the rate of course last year\nThat being said when people exist for months and months\nOn supplemental rations when they are eating limited amounts of food what happens over a period of time is that they slowly start and this is absolutely foot we are seeing for millions of people in this country their immune systems are weakening and that makes them\nAnd that there are fourteen million people at the un fears are at risk of famine the population of Illinois where we are right now during this program from Chicago is Thirteen million people just by way of contacts least give me a sense of what\nA mother a father a parent has to do in Yemen right now to try and feed their child continue boils down to what an individual might be dealing with just to try to feed themselves and feed their family would they have to do\nSo sixty percent of all of the people who live in this country are what we call food insecure now out of that out of those Eighteen million people every single morning there are eight and a half million who wake up\nAnd they have absolutely no idea where they are going to get food from that day\nSo what will happen is a family will use absolutely every means at their disposal to secure of what they can they'll go to their relatives and bake\nThey'll go to religious institutions and bake they'll come knocking on the doors of non governmental organizations in the UN\n\nSupport for NPR come from this station and from Subaru featuring

A. M. U. dot org before we continue some al Hamdani let me come back to you for a second I checked in with our audience here at W. B. the in Chicago to kind of ask them if they were tracking with us\nAnd one of the things that I think confuses a lot of people it confuses me too\nIs the nature of this secretary in aspect like several of us and we have a better way of of age ranges here students than seniors and everybody in between have heard of Sunni and Shia Muslims\nBut then that like the the sex within the sect I think that's where a lot of it's kind of get lost can you\nCan you bottom line that for us what difference does it make what these people are with like why why did the sec why does it affect involve matter to this can you just kind of simplified force completely\nGo when it comes to you and I'm like I mentioned the majority of the northern part of it\nCan be called the ... and the chef ... they're called ... now the ... conflict\nA kind of began years ago and then was revived recently\nUm what we see is the political importation of religious sects so what we're seeing it play is political Islam and that's what you're hearing about you know the chefs in a conflict it's not really a religious matter today it's really a political matter of allegiance to what part of the middle east are you going to support\nAnd what we're seeing play out is that\nIran is announcing itself as the um [noise]\nKind of the guardian of ... and Saudi Arabia on the other hand is presenting itself to the world that the guardian of finance them and so as soon as she our it pretty much kind of people fighting for the interests of who's going to take control in the region and\nThat's what this is what's happening in Yemen you know for instance when this war started\nWe know that the u._s. then under the administration of President Obama had struck a deal of um a nuclear deal with Iran\nAnd the sense they sacrificed Yemen by saying here you can fight Iran in Yemen but the U.S is going to kind of find this deal with Iran now that was a short sighted move because I think a lot of people then didn't anticipate that today President Trump would come to power and then today you have and a nuclear deal with Iran I\nAnd at the same time also have this devastating crisis in Yemen and so in a sense\nGoing through I mean I think so let me let me back up and try and repeat back to you what you just said that I've been granted diagram everybody here would be watching verbal abuse paper so we've got to use the Jews sect of Islam swimming Islam and the Islamic this old centuries old fight that has been made\nPolitical you use the phrase political Islam\nClaim itself as the the defender of the Shia Muslim faith and Saudi Arabia has kind of ... anointed itself the defender of the Sunni Muslim faith and that politicized Islam has spread into other conflicts and Yemen these factions in Yemen\nIran and Saudi Arabia are supporting these factions is kind of a battle in this larger war for the soul of political Islam is that kind of it\nSure yeah exactly and so what I'm saying is that historically and traditionally that practice Islam that can't many have package for years are not necessarily aligned with the Saudi an Iranian tax but for political reasons they are now aligning with each other\nGotcha gotcha folks here it'd be easy does that make more sense good we got some up all around okay go and I I appreciate you explain that I think you know part of the complication Jane Ferguson is that this is complicated I mean some wars you can't just boil down to one cause but that also makes it hard\nFor us sworn in Yemen to zero in on them and and really think our teeth in but your reporting has involved some of the people on the ground\nWho are dealing with the result of this larger fight for the soul of political Islam you described the story of an eleven year old girl that you encountered back in June the kind of stuck with you can you give us the basics of what happened to\nHer [noise] sure telling her story is one of the race for the most important reason why journalists need access to this because we have to put\nA face and a name and a picture to the statistics otherwise they're just a test aches and I think that we we deal with with a lot of that of of of difficulty trying to get the public to understand the level of this crisis so I ... I was in ... um\nIn the town of hijacking the capital of the province there was a hospital where like every single hospital that I've seen there that that the children's ward is now a de facto malnutrition wards and we were just filming there with some women and their babies' whenever a young man tall\nDeathly thin rushed in with the with a tiny what looked like just sort of like a bundle of clothes and it was his eleven year old sister name was ...\nAnd for a horrible few moments we really thought may mono might dying in front of us on the hospital bed she was eleven years old and way too\nI think twenty four pounds was was that it was about what we had to what we had asked at the doctor's with that and it was absolutely a\nHorrifying to watch her she you know when when a child gets so weak and so\nAmong bearish they also become so vulnerable to any kinds of infection and so they tend to get a diarrhea anyway and so even even if you do manage to get through to them and uh they get diarrhea they get devastating they hydrated as a result the whole thing just spirals\nUntil the child's body just gives in um we spent some time they're filming with my own end speaking with her family\nAnd her mother eventually came the next day we were able to talk to her and we were piecing together the family story and it is a story that reflects millions of people's stories in Yemen and it is that her father was a schoolteacher and a government school but whenever the uh\nThe government salaries stopped over two years ago\nHe his salary stopped to wants ... full lost that level of income the government was that the the biggest employer by far in the country before the war\nAnd that's not just soldiers and police that's people who work in offices that's teachers any kind of clerical work or any kind of bureaucratic work in Yemen\nWants those salaries stopped people would then go on to trying to live off\nCredit at the local store do have any livestock in the backyard do I have relatives who can help us out after two years\nThose coping strategies run out and they ran out for this family and they simply had no money at once a child starts to go downhill it can spiral out of control like this they were lucky family because they were able to afford to pay a cab to take them to the town\nI'm ... and lots of families are not that lucky and so one of the things that is really important to remember by this crisis as we don't even know how many children are dying for ... or we don't know how many don't make it to the hospitals\nAnd ... and you know this one child came from a middle class family that educated father and that's really terrifying benchmark of how deep and dangerous this problem is\n\nEqual access to education is the law but racial issues can get in the way let's see how one school near Chicago was trying to get things better and what's getting in the way\nFrom W.

Charles the story was followed by Kevin Shaw I mean I felt a little bit with Charles but that's really a cabin who I mean being I'm Sorry being that that followed a Charles the story and they had to establish these kind of relationships um that important now the\nThose times where you have to be able to ask difficult questions but you also have to be able to step back when when it's clear that that you know they don't really want to go there and that happens frequently with her because she was struggling with a lot of things at that time I thought was relevant to include that in the film\nFew more of your comments before we bring in our next two guests Mitch writes we can't move forward if we fail to address the past and continue to ignore the inequalities of today people of color are treated differently in America period and the sentence\nAgility for fun tweeted I've watched every episode of America to me I absolutely love it I'm shocked at how clueless the white teachers are especially that physics teacher\nThe school board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by the new shoveled disclosure we should note we did reach out to the superintendent of the district Steve associate for his thoughts on the theories we did not get a response but an invitation remains open we also reached out to the principle of Oak Park in the river forest high school Nathan rouse\nWe were unable to speak with him for the program we're told\nHe is traveling for work from Philadelphia where he attended an event called the national summit for courageous conversations about race so both those invitations remain open worth noting that neither the principal nor the superintendent participated in the documentary either is that right see that's right\nLet's had two more voices to the conversation to talk more about racial equity in schools nationwide\nAmanda Louis is the director of the Institute for research on race in public policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago her latest book is called\nDespite the best intentions how racial equity thrives in good schools professor Lewis welcome to want to say thanks had any also with us here at W. B. easy as David Stovall a professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago\nHis focus is on the influence of race in urban education community development and housing and he is\nFirst of all what do you think of it so far what is there any anything in particular that struck you the hardest\nThing that struck me the hardest is an episode to win one of the parents of student actually goes on the fourth floor and I think this is the\nEnd the conversation that we do not have about schools\nThat have the illusion of integration I think the losing of integration because it just means that students of color are in the same place with white students when Mr mom talked about what happened to her in the early nineties in on that fourth floor and he's still happening today\nThat to me is the story of us ... professor Lewis what about you\nYou know one of the things that really struck me there are a lot of powerful moments in the series but I think one of the things that also struck me as the silences some of the some of that kill missions and I know a lot of this had to do I'm sure with who was willing to participate in who wasn't\nOne of the things you notice in that district is that the people aren't in the documentary so all the white powerful wealthy families a key leaders and the district a lot of the people who had the most power and the most influence over what that school ends up looking like\nA opt out and I think that's a kind of powerful and symbolic I'm a example of what's actually going on in the district\nBy the way for those of you listening and I forgot to mention we may be discussing some things in the documentary that if you're eager to watch America to me might turn out to be spoilers so deep that in mind in the conversation\nIf you would like to listen to this lady because I don't want to get them tweets do not tweeting me [laughter] 'cause I ruin this film for you I don't want to hear it but if you want to listen to this later on your own after you've had time to watch the documentary you'll find our conversation in its entirety\nAt the one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org\nWe're talking about racial\nEquity professor still vote what does that mean we're just\nDisciplinary procedures is it about truancy is it about people feel being nice to one another like ... how would we know racial equity if we had it\nRight I mean I think this is and thank you for that question but I think the thing around equity and I think the ... to ... point what people are unwilling to talk about equity is really talking about we distribution\nSo when you talk about distribution so now the question becomes who has had the least and now what are those things that they talk about that they meet the other thing around equity is getting people what they need when they need it and I think is ... is the issue of concern\nGive me an example of getting people what they need when they need\nA young person says we have a particular problem with this teacher who is constantly giving us disciplinary referrals\nConstantly grading us in ways that we feel to be dubious now there needs to be so that racial equity team at the schoolhouse whoever that is\nThat person needs to be in the conversation or that racial equity team it can't be the conversation around young people which often happens in school houses that young people are blamed for this not equitable condition professor Lewis ... ... what\nDo you find or the big barriers to advancing toward racial equity is it is it funding is that the people involved is it different for every school in every district what tends to get in the ... well\nI'm going to talk about the parks at the world and there are a lot of them and I think one of the things that um my colleague John Diamond and I found when we were doing the research for our book\nWas that when you really try to understand why change it so hard it really is especially in these kind of community\nAbout the folks who have a lot of resources that have been served well by those districts for a long time not wanting change to happen and we talk about this is a kind of form of opportunity hoarding but at the way China is how how race works today differently than it worked in the past in the past\nJoined me for musical trip through the halls of New York San Francisco London Tokyo envy on FM radio the way it used to be every Sunday night at nine o'clock following that air on WFSU Middletown [noise]\nAnd banking and capital markets expertise along with a legacy of putting clients financial well being first learn more at Raymond James dot com\nFrom constant contact segmentation feature allows small businesses to deliver personalized female campaign to connect with their customers learned more in constant contact dot com\nAnd from the ... e Casey foundation\n\nWe get back to our conversation here in Chicago are worried about what we'll be talking about in Atlanta tomorrow\nPoison it appears to be Russians preferred weapon of choice and we'll find out who Moscow was targeting and why\nWe like to know what questions you want answered so leave us a voicemail eight five five to three six one a one a America's relationship with Russia and what was the Soviet Union has had its fair share of ups and downs but what message do you think Washington should be sending to Moscow now\nEight five five to three six one a one a I'd say five five to three six one two one two will dig deeper into the files of Sergei St Paul and get to some of your questions tomorrow from Atlanta on one day\nBack now to our conversation with professors Amanda Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of the members of our ... how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you for the mall\nOne person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were a bus in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother text club member wrote being Spanish and a woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up it took me years to rent myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nShip after scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was white unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like\nAdvanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and scholarships that the way we engage with race in a larger way ten push too far\nThat we can give people of color an additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make it\nTo me I I mean it's not a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue will not pushing far enough\nRight when we talk about equity we have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity and then how are those opportunities denied in real time currently and because one white student did not get one scholarship does not mean\nBlack and Latino students across the country do not hard not to make Lee denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand the individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve that's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you haven't been able to parse out three actions that that finally\nWell I've I've not on Twitter for personal reasons but um [noise] but you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdote experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it has been a good experience more eye opening experience if for no other reason than there are there\nA poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all of the things that we see an awful lot of in documentary filmmaking including some past work\nAnd I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white parents\nCharles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for any one high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin is does that reflect your experience and off my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general like there's kind of like a\n... there's this blanket we put over white kids it's like you're you know they always going to be warm regardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color there's like okay well we got like\nA whole bunch of sleeping bags but we ain't got one blanket for everybody and only some people get that sleep in ... you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who's also a feature documentary where like\nI wouldn't say like the ... well I I didn't want to compare thing the other students but the school has like\nI guess prominent interest in us because of what we do with our extracurricular is in so it was just already saying that they're like okay well we need to make sure those kids are good you know but for someone who is in in any extra curricular is who doesn't have any type of\nUm non student teacher relationship with any adult in the building they like it's hard to get you know trapped in between the margins they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even consider it to get one and that like I think that's the ...\nTo come from those types of home and have steaks and the school the parents are big funders their siblings went there whatever whatever and then you got the kids who I mean like me luckily I found spoken word but you got kids like me who\nI mean a few of my cousins went to obey but\nOther than that right it was not really so you kind of have to fend for yourself exactly and we're like is this is not the case you know I think it goes showing 'em which episodes that we must have done it was like\nMost of the kids and who's on the news um tutoring sessions are usually white to an all white is oh yeah oh I Know that's part like you know personal accountability but that's also to school like\nYou got to have kids of color in honors classes for them to ... on his tutoring but that's just the one right to you know so\nWell to that point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor loose carry tweeted I'm eager to hear the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past Thirty years [noise]\nKnow it's hard to look at the high school level and understand you can take a snapshot of high school level but when we study districts like a park like Evan stand like Brookline mass like Shaker Heights I mean there's dozens and dozens of these kinds of districts\nThat tracking that kids experience dark in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts do we take it that might be you know an inch apart in terms of their skills coming in\nAnd we track them early and what we know over and over again for research is that that tracking means that kids are in ... get more they get better they get better teaching and so we take kids that might even be a niche apart in terms of skills and we and we make that skills gap larger and larger over time\nAnd so when we look at school like a park and they've said earlier\nThe structures that we have in place around around things like creating these academic tracks um are inevitably\nAnd in our schools and the ... the troubling thing is that race because not only part of how these tracks get credit and if you look at the history of the really deep racist history and tracking and general\nRace also becomes the explanation for why it's okay the fact that you can walk into a school today and twenty Eighteen and see that the most advantage educational faces in school or Ninety percent white and the least advantage educational expect you know places in the same exact school are predominantly black\nShould have us all up in arms that the fact that we think that that's okay it's all about our racial mythology\nI I think we also have to ask questions about what defines being educated and what a good education is and you know I've heard a PE teachers including Ty Williams the black or a future in the series\nLament the fact that as a ... students often just want to be given the information they need to score well on the test that's what they want they're not really that interested in learning but just ... it's a game it's in supporting game\nYou mean in terms of a larger kind of a ... as an editor for vacation like becoming a more well read learned ...\nSome of the some of the most interesting and I think for far reaching in deep teaching was going on at lower levels which is not to excuse the system that amount of talking about but we just to read the fine being educated in such narrow ways it's about ACT scores and GPA's and that you know and that's what we defined as being an educated person\nI I hear you on that Steve but at the same time you know I think about I'm not trying to excuse because sooner no I I hear that I I hear that though I ...
