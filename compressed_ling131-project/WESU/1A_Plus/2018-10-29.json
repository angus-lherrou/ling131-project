I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of bites like down and get us off the only place where this kind of speech proliferate on line it is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment the first amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given them a new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened in Pittsburgh all the more worrisome folks like you\nShort well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true I've seen how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to speak to such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae B. T. Q. people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported embolden from the very top when the president of the United states that the white nationalist see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides to\nIt it's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the left who was in charge we have somebody on the right who's the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist the racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign ad before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein and suggested that they were part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power and the United states which of course trap the taps into\nVery old anti Semitic tropes ...\nYeah but it was a ... I'm Sorry where do you want to get a little deeper into that a lot of folks a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts with that on that I mean the president\nDid address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday she began his speech by talking about the shooting\nWith one unified voice we condemn the historic evil of anti Semitism and every other fan of evil and unfortunately the vote comes in many forms and we come to\nIndianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning he wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news\nThe fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must end unquote\nGotten a number of comments from some of you about the president's potential role and all of this Susan lives in Silver Spring Maryland right outside the sea Susan Rice I look forward to the day when we once again have a president who understands and always considers that his or her statements have far reaching consequences Indira I'd well\nThis was of course incredibly disturbing to have the president once again demonizing the press and calling us enemies of the people\nFM radio the way it used to be every Sunday night at nine o'clock following that air on W E s U Middletown [noise]\n\nStation and from visiting angel professional caregivers assisting adult same bathing dressing Neal and like housework nationwide visiting

hand institutions advisors employers and individual shoes she wrote pride tee Rowe price invest with confidence\nBack\nNot or a conversation with rabbi Jill Jacobs Charlie wars ... let's get some more of your questions and comments constants in Silver Spring Maryland right I Know that sounds weird but I actually feel some hope after the massacre it was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in tears\nIt wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model now that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nAsia W tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially acceptable behavior we can fight back against hate speech with our own words are votes and our money\nBased in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated NPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions\nThere needs to be a consistent strong resistance to the hateful devices speech that his anti American journalists needs to be less accommodating and quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism the president's ignorant rants if not you who make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to screen very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we won't hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks orange for having the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who is both religious and also very much scientific\nI think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower except in on the left\nOf people who have a strong religious is at a closed next to the state of Israel I mean I teach at a a small just ... here in the city and or in the in the suburbs and a lot of us do feel uncomfortable with house at the bill that uh\nYou know they express a strong it here\nLooked to see is that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up in and how you were high school deals with it\nBut I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know what we\nMean there are students who are you know are not particularly strongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leave this school and they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a friendly\nIf they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't think it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence from the left that that's true I think you are seeing and I think our students feel a certain intolerance 'em when they go to college\nUm and it's you know I don't know we we tell we do tell kids probably should need need to shut up\nYou know and I don't say shut up but the the you know you can't argue with that we're\nJust kind of how you're going to have to learn to live with that kind of pick your battles I think that's a hard\nThing yeah to pick their battles I should I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised students to do that and not\nThe not federal everything will David I'm going to be it can be very hard to even let me\nPut that to thank you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs rubber what do you make of Davis common\nThank you David I wanted to respond to you and Stephanie or speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I wanted to say it's not the first time really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course that high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you let it be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism in Alaska and very often it expresses itself as\nAs attacks on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that\nThat criticism of Israel crosses the line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of Israel's governmental policies that we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies but rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out who carry a violent acts and say that they are motivated by hatred of Israel but the targets are actually Jews who are shopping in a grocery store in a jewelry store and a synagogue\nAnd at the same time and the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred\nA race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is that it's being supported by the government it would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who was trying to restore\nWho's ... who was criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U. S. but instead we have somebody at the very top who is encouraging the hatred on the right and riling up his people\nMake it through a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation which has many recalls as we can as well just briefly wrote on our Facebook page\nI Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue she was kicked the news of the week now there is no escape and no sanctuary\nLynn wrote on our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope\nVarious religious leaders offered support strings and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything is going to change we citizens must make it happen last night's fellowship help to bind our wounds and set us on the path for making our town better Indira would you react to that I feel like part of what worked\n[laughter] I hate to see in Pittsburgh favor but one of the things I think helped in this whole process because you described school he'll\nIf it's the kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had stolen crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to lock arms with one another\nThat's right I mean a squirrel hill is a very ... this is one factor is a very educated community\nUm it's right next to CMU Carnegie Mellon university and pet\nAnd a lot of the people who live in squirrel hill are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers accountants dentist it's an educated community a tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall\nIs also um you know politically a liberal community and it voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton and this last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community of Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill ... has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say yes it did help and Pittsburgh's favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming um we were talking about the end of the enemy of the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning I'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta\nJust four months ago an attacker killed five reporters and Annapolis newsroom the capital Gazette so you know I Do\nHateful action because of ... polarized nation that happened then just attack on the one in here just mentioned CNN is reporting that it's a suspicious package that was addressed to CNN was intercepted in a post office in Atlanta the investigation I don't think has at least you'll do it any public information in terms of what was in the package whether it was similar to the ones\nThat were sent last week but that story is just kind of breaking as of this morning let's get to a few more of your calls in comments including one from Pittsburgh where Lee is on the line highly what's on your mind\nOr Joshua how you doing today\nSure what what's on your mind how ... how are your neighbors do and after all this\nUm times very upset it's you know it's it's devastating I have a family um friends and customers in there and that live in a squirrel hill it's um [noise] they were taking a brutal hit\nFifth day from eight to nine thirty PM right here in New York she Middletown eighty eight point\n\nMe too movement has revolutionized how America talks about sexual harassment how much is it changing the laws to protect victims and punish harasser\nFrom W.

California passed laws that expands sexual harassment protections to workers like freelancers\nIt's another example of states taking action while Congress makes promises and remains deadlocked\nToday will discuss these new state laws and what impact they could have workers and employees it's the final part of our special series the state where in where we've been focusing on the bills and initiatives that are trending in state capitals\nJoining us here in Studio to discuss it is Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center\nThe organization administers the time's up legal Defense Fund which assists with sexual harassment cases Emily welcome back to what I thanks for having me joining us from the University of Oregon is Elizabeth tip it and associate professor at Oregon law school she's also a former employment lawyer Elizabeth welcome\nThanks for having me and Suzanne whole team is the program director of the employment labor in retirement program at the national conference of state legislatures in Denver Suzanne thanks for making time for us yes things\nWe'd also love to make time for you particularly if you've had experience with sexual harassment sexual abuse and felt like the law did or did not\nProtect you if the law did not protect you in your state\nWhat went wrong or perhaps\nOne a ... W. A. M. U. dot for Emily Martin before we get into the state laws let's talk about the federal sexual harassment laws who do the cover and who don't\nRecover so when you look at workplace sexual harassment laws um titles seven as the federal law that says you can't discriminate based on sex and that includes harassing people on the basis of sex\nBut title seven only covers you if your employer had at least Fifteen employees so if you work for a very small employer federal law doesn't protect you against sexual harassment\nAnd title southern also only covers employees so that means if you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment laws\nSuzanne hold feeding the number of states including Vermont and New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply to more workers tell us a little bit about more tell us a little bit more about which states are expanding protections and who they're covering\nYeah definitely so we've seen at least twenty states introduced legislation and twenty Eighteen on workplace sexual harassment and the majority of the states are have introduced legislation as it relates to limiting or prohibiting nondisclosure agreements or ending forced arbitration agreement so\nWe've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area including Arizona Maryland New York\nTennessee California as you mentioned Vermont in Washington\nAnd other states are also looking addict standing training requirements\nUm so how many hours must uh employees are employers um require training and so we've seen legislation on that path in um California is just one example of that\nTip it I'd love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be protected by these laws\nWorker once while singing in a band and once while working as a tutor she says she could not report the incidents to a chart and as a contract worker she had no employer to do\nI thought about it and I was like I don't want to put that on my social media and it it can change your reputation I really wish I could ever protect myself in both situation there just I feel like I Would have had a sense of agency and and what it felt in control of my life\nFor us to a tipping how common is this for freelancers in the in a situation\nI Do think it's really important to extend protections for independent contractors and that's because employers have no incentive\nTo provide a remedy an internal thick for contractors if they're not even covered by the laws that at all\nSo even basic protections are like your caller referenced like being able to use the employers hotline being able to use the employers complaints system the employer is not going to be interested in extending those the contractors unless they're covered by the laws\nWere speaking to Elizabeth typically associate professor at the University of Oregon school of law suits and whole team program director for employment labor and retirement at the national conference of state legislatures\nAnd Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center Emily I'd love you to react to a comment that came in from Charlotte\nCharlotte emailed I Am a Florida based graduate student at Boston University\nThis year uh BU required all students all staff in all faculty to complete a sexual assault training course\nI had no idea how many legal terms are associated with such a difficult subject it's complicated without this require training I Would never have known about my rights as a Floridian much less where to look\nEmily this is rather complicated although some states including Delaware Illinois Calif\nThat's true we have seen this year and generally seen a lot of policymaker energy in the states around the issue of workplace harassment which is exciting that they've been new creative\nUm will to bear thinking about how do we really solve the problem and one of the things that lawmakers have focused on is\nRequiring training or expanding training requirements again under federal law there is no requirement per se that employers train employees on sexual harassment a lot of employers do but it's not because I'm federal law make them do it\nNow we don't know as much as we wish we did about what sort of training are really affected what sorts of training really make a difference in changing behavior\nSo one of the things that I Hope comes from the long overdue attention to workplace harassment is some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in a workplace\nYeah I I Do want to put that you were to put also in terms of what you think makes the biggest difference I mean there's a certain types of training or the older new kinds of state laws that you think would be the most effective in reducing harassment well\nWhen you think about me to as a sign of a broken system you want to attack all of the aspects of the system so\nPart of it might be that our laws in general do not really hold employers accountable when there is harassment in the workplace but it's relatively easy especially under federal law for employers to get out of them\nAnd a lot of states have really low caps on damages though if you do your employer the maximum amount of money that you can get from them you know in some states might be fifty thousand dollars that's not much of a deterrent for employers who are trying to decide how much to invest in their system to address harassment\n\nOf insurance so they can prepare for life stepson down coverage options and more information can be found at farmers dot com and from American universe\nGreece mission driven curriculum and hands on approach Morris co God ... can dot edu\nBack now to our conversation about so called me to legislation trends in New state laws the name to strengthen protections against sexual harassment\nWith Emily Martin of the national Women's Law center Suzanne whole scene of the national conference of state legislatures\nAnd University of Oregon law school assistant professor associate professor Elizabeth tip it's we woke up some more of your questions and thoughts as well especially if the laws in your state that deal with sexual harassment sexual abuse works for you or failed you we'd love to hear your story or even just your questions about the way these laws work\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one eighty or email won a a W. A. M. U. dot org Emily Martin I Love to get your reaction to what we heard from California state senator ... sounds like can't go out to California is trying to do quite a bit to improve the way that we prevent and prosecute sexual harassment what do you think\nI agree that California's ban a real leader in his face those with the laws that um we just heard about that were passed last last a session\nAs well as if you love that unfortunately we're vetoed by the governor that would have expanded the statute of limitations for bringing a workplace sexual harassment claim\nYou know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days from the date of the harassment when you have to bring a claim and given that we're talking about\nI'm Talking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that is not enough time often for people to figure out\nWhat they need to do how they want to do it to find their attorney to find out how they can take action so you know we joined the national news lots and are joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organization this week\nTexans and California I think it's really a beacon for other states and thinking about how can they strengthen their laws in meaningful way any states I Believe that you're targeting in particular\nWell I think that one of the things that we have seen this past year and that it's not just progressive states for example Tennessee a past new prohibitions on employers requiring employees to sign non disclosure agreement that the condition of coming to work that would ah\nKeep employees from talking about sexual harassment when it happened and\nSo we're really thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide\nSolution Suzanne ... your thoughts on what we heard from state senator Jackson\nYeah I think that's a great example of a legislators I'm really trying to grapple with how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace and\nAnd I'm introduced a lot of different types of legislation to get out that I think we've seen a lot of creative um pieces of legislation in other states one thing that I did want to mention is Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created a sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states and that\nProvides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment of workplace in private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note that quite a few of you have commented to us today about state laws that are aimed at statute of limitations laws we did an entire hour not too long ago discussing just that very topic\nYou can find that conversation on statute of limitations on line at the one a dot org sets the words are the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure in confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and in a number of states goes laws passed unanimously I Wonder\nInherently illegal they can have a purpose\nIn contracts I work in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information Dennis wrote on our Facebook page\nThere is a place for legitimate nondisclosure agreements however it is a disservice to our communities when they're used to hide illegal behavior I Would be comfortable with laws that allowed anyone to speak with law enforcement in such cases regardless of the existence of this agreement Suzanne\n[noise] yes well that's interesting and I will say that states are not all states in their legislation specify these contracts as nondisclosure agreements and sometimes they just call them contracts um or other types of agreements most of the legislation that we've seen\nUs specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace so it wouldn't necessarily ban nondisclosure in great agreements and hold but just as they relate to this specifically to sexual harassment in the workplace\nProfessor typically ... before we move on to too much for the can you just define that term force what exactly is a non disclosure agreement what exactly do they do well\nThere's actually two types there is the type that you mentioned that people playing at the start of there and play meant that says keep our information confidential and there's another type the peoples buying usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit or they have hired a lawyer\nAnd those are just settle the person's legal claims and those are the ones I think that had become most problematic because in those cases it's clear that some sort of bad conduct to the current or is disputed and in those cases both parties might agree that they're not going to talk about the facts on her line the case\nFor someone who stick with you for a minute I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of the line for confidentiality agreements or helpful or hurtful in terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you have said that they may not be in ...\nThey can be in the best interest of the person who's been sexually harassed where do you see the line\nWell\nFor the contract you sign at the start of your job I think it's helpful to have a law that makes clear that those can't cover sexual harassment or other forms of harassment or discrimination because essentially forces the employer to disclose in the contract\nThat keep our business information confidential but if you experience unlawful conduct you're allowed to talk about that though the contracts in a way educate the employees about their rights [noise]\nIt's a lot more complicated though if you're talking about settling a lawsuit because in that case many times the person is represented by a lawyer and I've heard plaintiff lawyers say that they like these provisions can move the path toward the settlement\nAnd the thing that's kind of hard about that the people who maybe have the most interest and learning us information aren't at the table future effect and potential victims of harassment they don't have a say and whether the victim and the employer decides to keep the information secret\nLet's get to some of your comments and questions Alix tweeted earlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier\nLuckily we have to go through sharp training every year we all like to make fun of it we make fun of it to the point where when I actually had to use it I knew exactly what to do\nStuff on emailed my girlfriend works for a college in upstate New York while in Chicago for a work conference a resident of Illinois sexually assaulted her despite my encouragement she is terrified of coming forward for fear of retribution\nDo laws across state lines especially in Illinois and New York\nComplicate the legalities that would otherwise helped bring perpetrators to justice Emily Martin what would you say the stuff on\nThat's a great question if you're talking about state law protections that go above and beyond federal law yeah\nThere was in and out there but it's important to remember that we're talking about state law to stay in the ways in which state are going above and beyond federal protection there are core federal protection they should be strengthening various lead\nThat their core federal protections again workplace sexual harassment against sexual harassment and schools and so that is the baseline that covers\nEverybody with the important exemptions that we've talked about that no matter you know what the code they live in\nA shootout I'd love to get your take on one of the states that did not pass at least one of its proposed bills on sexual harassment and that was in Louisiana it had to do with settlements of sexual harassment cases Louisiana State House bill five seven eight would have stopped employers\nFrom forcing workers to settle sexual harassment dispute arbitration state representative Raymond cruise voted against the bill among other things the ripped said it would open up litigation for everything\nRight now we're considered one of the most litigious faith in the nation one source I just looked up said we're number six six out of fifty on worst states for litigation matter of fact if you divide the country into five four regions this trial has one hundred eighty six\nCases like that for ten thousand people the next closest section has Fifteen", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "29"}
