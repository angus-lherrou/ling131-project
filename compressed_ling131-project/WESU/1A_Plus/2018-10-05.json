Republican base voters in a way that could prove beneficial especially in some of these key Senate races uh in ... which they're already taking place largely on a favorable to Republicans playing field ... this fall what's unusual about this\nDevice to fight we've had many divisive fights before uh it strikes me that the coming so close to a mid term elections for injecting a volatile note of uncertainty which just weeks to go to the election number one number two uh it is\nA cultural war being ignited arguably ... among Democrats and Republicans while both died I I wrote last week about the two Americas that would listen\nTo uh the very jarring lead different accounts offered by doctor for it and ... and uh would process this hearing and it's completely different way I think we've all watched that playing out over the last week uh each a\nPolitical tried in our increasingly ... divided culture has a whole different facts that a whole different narrative a whole different arguments make its inflaming passions on both sides uh\nI'm very turned off in a midterm election year has sparked up words out over the last week you could argue well that's just that the election getting closer and rice we're not sure how much it has to do with ... but not my guess is that you know for different parts of the country on this works entirely differently a politically\nLet me get one more comment on this and then we will keep going of course we'll keep an eye on at the vote should be happening imminently shows and all that goes but one more comments on this from Gary who wrote on our Facebook page\nSexual assault is side Kavanaugh was not someone I saw as being even killed and being neutral making political statements during his opening yes he has qualifications on paper to be a justice however his temperament should be assessed\nLet's move on to some of the other big stories the big news this week including with immigration policy roughly three hundred thousand

little bit more about that New York times investigation regarding President Trump's finances are Eugene I I think one of the things that he's worth knowing for sure was\nAre there other big questions that are still out there when it comes to the president's tax history we still don't have his tax returns provided by him for example I was\nGonna say that's the biggest question I mean the reality at this ... done over a I Believe Eighteen months what has happened that ah you know that people's publisher perhaps the research and we still do not know are there more questions than answers because many of the answers could be providing if we actually had\nA the tax forms which\nSarah Huckabee Sanders pretty much gave us a reason to believe earlier this week we we perhaps should not expect uh the reality is that this is not an area that Trump I desire to be transparent about and many of his supporters don't demand that he has I think there are people who are have noticed how much wealthier he hasn't gotten since getting in\nUm the White House and and regarding specific uh businesses have had ah some of the um hotels have rented out by international organizations perhaps wedding to curry favor with the administration\nUm and I think there are some people who are concerned about how that could influence a policy foreign policy specifically\nWell it's been four years since the fatal

I ... she is literally leaping out a crutch or go ahead Susan ...\nWell it looks like we have the votes now from all four of the undecided senators going into at least on this cloture motion and interesting they Lisa Murkowski is the only one who voted no so Joe Manchin that Democrat from West Virginia\nHas voted yes Jeff Flake has voted yes Susan Collins has voted yes now students\nNo stance on Kavanaugh because this afternoon at three PM she will announce her final decision so we don't know necessarily what this procedural votes me but I think it's quite significant\nA to B that Joe Manchin yes vote in particular and Lisa Murkowski no vote if the positions were holed up in the final vote on Kavanaugh he would be approved\nLooks like there's still some voting going on maybe from senators who were struggling in and out of the room Steve Clemons once this cloture vote is done with eventually it will be done with what happens then what do we expect between this vote in the next one will you'll have debate on the floor\nOf it goes on they'll bring that debate to a close and they will set a time most likely tomorrow I'm In which they will vote to confirm or not judge Kavanaugh\nAnd that time it it could be any time during the day or is there like a particular window hardly any time of day I mean one of the things about this that it is it runs anytime I think one of the interesting things is you have\nA senator from Montana or a steep Danes whose daughter is being married tomorrow getting married tomorrow and he wants to walk her down the aisle so assured his vote be absolutely necessary they have to wait for him to get back from Montana so it's one of those life\nUh intrusions into the way the system runs but my sense is that Mitch McConnell is obsessed with getting this done moving on and getting people out uh campaigning and\nYou know during this as a success that they've achieved that's why this is so unusual that feels raced pushed\nWhether it's the FBI investigation which many people have been saying has not been an exhaustive did not go into many corners it's because the clock is ticking for Mitch McConnell and I think he wants to shelve this and get this done as soon as possible yeah not one of these votes that you do want to vote you have to do in person there was no app for that\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed live only infusion radio\nAre among the world's highest honors for service to humanity and now we know the winters who's in this year's class of Nobel laureates [noise] from W.

to reimpose sanctions Iran took us to court\nTerry of state Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday that the U.S is ending that treaty\nThis was the decision frankly the thirty nine years overdue in July around brought in Marilyn's case and the international court of justice alleging violations of the treaty of amity\nOr on six to challenge the United states' decision to these participation in the Iran nuclear deal into reimpose the sanctions were lifted as part of that deal rods attempt to interfere with the sovereign rights of the United states to take a waffle actions necessary to protect\nNational security and arrive at the using the ice Jay for political and propaganda purposes\nThat was secretary of state Mike Pompeo speaking on Wednesday Vivian salami some have said that ending this treaty is largely symbolic ... that's\n... yeah it is an unknown and a lot of ways I think um in general it's more just reinforcing the administration says standing efforts to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and um crackdown on Iran and kind of show that they're not messing around and so\nI'm basically this was just one more step in that process but as far as any real uh changes on the ground it really doesn't do much it's really just bonds\nTo um the international court adjust the ruling that ah that essentially said that sanctions that we they re imposing sanctions um we're not fair to Iran\nBreak my respect for just a second what is this treaty of amity are I'm sure that was the question of the state department I just have this vision of some low level staff are going through the basement looking treaty\nOr am I think it's really damage as I could [laughter] result think through what we've heard about\nYou know the the big acronym of Jaycee PO way the Iran nuclear deal but what is this treaty a mammoth well in Nineteen fifty three the U.S help orchestrate\nAnd so two years later it's yeah you brought me back to power shirt treaty of amnesty great and they were indeed good friends from fifty three until the Seventy nine revolution\nThe shah who was deposed in these long road\nAnd the Islamic Revolution of ... Seventy nine so for thirty nine years uh there has been no enmity between us and Iran um this again seems very symbolic I'm just a last little relic that somehow didn't get shredded after the the the revolution and Seventy nine\nIt was the last hurrah of Kermit Roosevelt grandson of Theodore Roosevelt CIA operative who almost singlehandedly staged this coup and then they got everybody we put in power to go sign the treaty port Kermit he's getting no respect in the state department these days\nIs Carmen Roosevelt I'm taking it I I liked that name for a man who had such a place in history Kermit Roosevelt and I know where the American David ... is there any real effect in terms of\nThe sanctions the consequences to the U. S. for refusing to lift them if this treaty of apathy is more than ... we're might there be more tangible\nImpact the so the tangible impact is November when President Trump has said that he will impose the full sanctions on Iran He's given allies warning that this was coming\nAnd those sanctions if he does it as he his pronounced would say to any ... company around the world but particularly European companies\nIf you do business with Iran you're not doing business with the United states and it's an effort to choke off the Iranians\nBy making the big aircraft makers Boeing's ready pulled out the big oil a production equipment makers all get out of Iran and they were doing that what's happening now though is that the ... the Europeans are saying\nCan affect it with the sanctions and a number of us went up and met a with the Iranian foreign minister when it was at the un ah last week and he made an argument to suffer through Saturday evening\nThat she believed that this method was going to come together so we're heading toward a conflict between the U.S and its European allies over on do we have a sense I think\nI feel like the the big issue really gives rounds nuclear program and the argument from the other nations who are still signatories to this this deal the Iran nuclear deal\nIs that it's it's not perfect but it's good and that it has done something to impede Iran's ability to develop\nA nuclear weapon do we have a sense of where we stand in that regard setting the economic stuff aside for a moment to put any closer on that path or we still kind of in a holding pattern me what it was\nLook like well the Europeans as you say they they consistently say that they they don't want to North Korea is I mean this is of course before we became buddy buddy and\nPresident Trump declared that he and Kim Jong un or love\nUh we we didn't want to North Korea and the sense that we didn't want this to very active or potentially rope nuclear states and so I'm a checked Iran was always going to be better than an unchecked Iran and so that was the Europeans argument as to why", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "05"}
