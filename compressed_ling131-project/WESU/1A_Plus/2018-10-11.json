I\nThey start to freedom so we know on this side of freedom a third of all the people killed by strangers killed by police officer we know that we're more people from marijuana than all violent crimes combined we know so much about this guy to free them and we have a lot of work to do that I wanted to talk about like how do we get to the other side of freedom what did it look like what did it feel like how do we get there and what the strategy in the plane\nBecause I Know that when I think about what freedom is at its core it's not only the aspect of oppression but the presence of justice enjoy that we can get rid of all the bad thing and that doesn't mean that the good things automatically come and debate here we have to fight for those\nSo that was where the other side of freedom came from and then the case we're hoping that I think the hope is the fuel for all of this I Hope it a belief that tomorrow can be better than that today that when people say the system is broken and in response when people say oh no it was designed to be like this my take away into it was designed and because people made it up we can make something better and that is the work\nOf hope there are a lot of questions that our listeners wanted to put to you about the work that you're doing about the black lives matter movement and so on I definitely want to ask you about today's political scene but before we dive into\nAll of that I'm just kind of curious to know how you are [laughter] you've been a very busy due to the last four years how are you how is life treating you\nKnow I'm OK it's a ...

I think Morgan's referring to Patrice floors ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nSo when we think about the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that\nYou know for those of us who were industry in for a gift and we are mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protests there was no one to three ten people who caught us all to the street who organized everybody wants a beautiful about the protests that\nAh it was organic they were set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember\nThat we were the street for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend what's unfortunate that there's this narrative that that has come up that is a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized everybody the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true so when I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nIs that I'm awful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who were industry in St Louis who did incredible work who for whom without you wouldn't there would be no protests\nAre so that important to me and then the second part in that I Know that the platform doesn't only exist for me that one of the important things about having a platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president\nPeople who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people have just sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names are in in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of a street together\nBut this narrative that there's like a small set of people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organization to like\nWhat the catalyst for the protesters is not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certainly leaders should become more prominent\nWith the concern about but who profits off the cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast as a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nIs an interesting I think I'm always shy you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um some of the\nThe way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end emily's seep in a portion of all the pre orders they all went to the N. double ACP legal Defense Fund that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to all to do more work than just buying the book right so like that's I think about the book specifically\nBut in general this basic I'm mindful of ... when we started campaign zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Fifteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of reach for funding specifically because of the question that you at\nThe over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is not a lot of money and the grand scheme of non profit than we did it so that\nWe could just raise enough money to do the work that we that was important right so we created the first\nOr continue to support organizing around the country and really disagree project you\nKnow I I Know paid staff I'm not paying salary from the stuff so we try to do it is like\nWith just the bare necessities do that it's not this question of like profit or\nIn with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense I invited Brittany Sam and Clinton to be a part of it they get paid in a part of the broadcast because I think that that makes sense um and it's not like some you know huge moneymaker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have\nTo rely on a nonprofit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well ah\nAnd you know it's like I ... at the way that I could just in the world right now it's like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I don't have you know it's like a [laughter]\nNot only does not and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like it was a really rough um it was rough\nAnd only the only a couple of months ago and the first time and I'm actually lived alone since the protests I've I've since you've been saying in the basement of a like my second parents for the past three years right so you know so that's\nNot us as you know who wants to get married in the in the basement of their right second parents that's not sustainable so so but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like\nThere are these narratives of like oh I made a good billion dollar and it's like well no you like the me on the news you human a pie cast you like to see me out of an event that that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case that I've had high incomes before you know that there was any income and wealth is pretty significant though\nI'm so people have been like really confused by that let's talk a little more ...\nShould be held to a higher standard than those without power but instead they are held to a lower standard and given special treatment and a free pass in our courts and society\nContrast that with another ... who wrote as time goes on society will bring about necessary reform but to denigrate and disregard the entire police force as an institution is ludicrous what do you think\nYeah I think you know I think for ... for two thousand years we let people dressed in called a health care we literally drained people's blood down and we were like ... it's going to drain out all the impurities\nAnd people were like oh ... their blood pressure changes like no they didn't have any blood right like that actually is enough to Lucian but we did it for two thousand years there was one of the most popular medical procedures\nBut it didn't work so if the goal was it the people's lives like actually wasn't a good thing or if the goal was to like pretend that you were doing good then like this is an excellent and I think about policing it's like if the goal is to stop crime or like to do any of that work like it just isn't whether how no matter how you feel about the police that just isn't happening so\nThanks for listening is your support that kept us going in Nineteen

you describe in the book there's a short section in the book\nLike page and a half were you talk frankly about your mom leaving the family when you were a toddler and the fact that you never have asked her why she\nWell I'm a differently than we remembered joy and triumphs when we remember pain we're trying to protect ourselves and cope with trying to order the memories in ways that will allow us to make it through tomorrow and the day after tomorrow unquote talk about how those kinds of\nTraumatic or difficult experiences as a kid kind of helped to shape you as an adult particularly an adult who would gravitate toward active as\nKnow it's interesting uh this is the first time I'm saying this because it just happened to that my mother read the book um and she texted me recently and it was I hate to re read the book we should talk [noise]\nAnd I just have it like having them with right back it so hopefully I write facts to\nEither one of the reasons why I wrote this chapter in the chapters ... I can remember and now with us that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room has what did they mean to be worthy that if she could leave than it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to sort of work within and grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize it that like we're all walking into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nA core part of it uh the the part that you read about like how we remember pain and how member joy is that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty rates\nAre or any other aspect to they ... they they learn the constraints really well so I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew would pass one would not asked for I knew\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside you know a lot of people talk about growing up poor but not that one of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraints like the constraints becomes so great and the way that we've learned how to survive that we can't start magic things beyond it\nPackaging old narrative for new time the laughter always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe it you've never seen a world where every woman at the right to choose like we believe that that's real\nAnd Mike telling no story is actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good story tell her about a future that you've never seen a few aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you entered the world\n[noise] you also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happened to you numerous times that are rather young age\nAnd you connect that with what you called the quiet quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never hidden any part of myself from my self or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love the parts that I had never seen loved\nIn others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons I was an important for me to be out for a break\nUm [noise] I mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very sort of overt way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also a gate to think that the only way\nTo do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and ah you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it was the Rio Grande like out in the quiet and the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room and the gay black man I'm like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collective with social justice or the work that we need to do without talking about my own identity now\nBut it was like sort of it was free in some ways to finally just they and like not have to tiptoe around and not be ashamed to say that this happened and and it was real and it was awful and you know when I told when I when I finally told a couple of years later they realized that he had actually been\nSexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me um\nTo like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives and like that was important [noise] um but I had to like you know I write about in the book and they're like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to\nBe in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were periods and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right so I wanted to give language to that\nHow far do you think that that out is actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my all your career if not all of my career but\nI Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian or gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people\nAre OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things and that changes the conception do you find that there was a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know\nLet's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my that even they have\nTo be yeah you know like\nI think we have to complicate the idea of like what it means to show up and gave the bike and there's not one way right that there is not to waste to be gay they're like that's why the pride parade has been really really long [laughter] they're like yeah so like sometimes it is the way rainbow shoes right and sometimes it it means is that going on\nYeah there definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not gay enough in like\nThat I don't talk about the issues publicly as possible and like you know it's one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life too I live like other people can feel like it's real re so like I Know that you know we're working with the research right now to try and think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggested that\nIt's not that people and people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they are naturally afraid of their results but that\nAre that they actually nervous about showing up at ... ... and in cities that are that function in small towns in a nervous about being somebody they went to high school with being like somebody's cuts and a friend like that they actually are nervous about like private ... really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I have I don't feel like I Need to talk about every ... seconds for people to be like they're actually cared about being gay right\nSo the other thing I'll say that there's some people who I can really homophobic but like me and that's not helpful that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your heat\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bed for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quote\nThere were calls from within the protests community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling the sellout unquote\nI Wonder how you are finding your way\nForward in these new endeavors whether it's politics hosting a podcast so in a way you are part of a media so to speak and reconciling that was kind of the social justice activism work that you're still ... involved in is that challenging to kind of have a foot in both worlds as it were\nYou know it's like a both and the rate that like you know what's interesting is that all those people who who commits to offer for quote protests\nNot to vote in twenty sixteen who said that you're wasting your vote who said that politics to matter and like why would you support I remember I support Hillary in the Washington Post and people literally they were like you're wasting your employees I Can't believe you did that like president doesn't have any bearing this is just for show and it's like\nNobody is saying that now like that is that ... that was a wild statement said in a while to say today so I think that people got a I it's unfortunate that like people getting it took all of the chaos that this president continues to\nWhy should you be the exception June in Monday Night now he's thirty to thirty poor who's your radio program right near Wu says [noise]\n\n\nDo you and sometimes going old

Blacksburg he's the show runner of Netflix bow jak horsemen it just released its entire fifth season for streaming and I've watched just about all of that fifth season a rough it let's talk about these and five\nA right let's get into it [laughter] getting dirty a big amount of season five is spent poking fun at the idea of the arch Moore show runner in film it there's a ... actually something along the lines of television it's a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nAnd yeah I I have to say a when that line came up at the table read it got a much bigger laugh when I was expecting from the crowd of people over there\nI mean is it a little surreal to be a show runner on a press to her about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be unimpressed or talking about it a little bit\nIt's strange and you know one of the things we wanted to talk about one in putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the ah tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so um\nAnd it it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius who you know a touches a show and\nA very collaborative process and we have people making a better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room\nThe cast brings so much the designs by at least they had all the uh directors brings so much to the episodes of the story board animators the editors um it it really it takes a village um\nSo it's odd but yes I Am doing all these interviews now and talking about the show and talking about how I made the show because it's not have a TV show gets made at all and I think anyone who presidents that as how a TV show gets made is trying to sell something\nBut then what exactly does the white board in the writers' room look like when you've got the word play the slapstick the ponds and the ... falls a overlaid on some of the deep dark themes that runs throughout the season and the show also has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes\nFor him it's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers that we can't help but make it funny um but we really\nAre mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions we take it very seriously\nUm you know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and this guy's talking octopus\nOr [laughter] you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here uh but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals I'm so [laughter] this is quite serious ah but the stories themselves can be quite silly you know one way I think of it\nIs is retelling stories about real grounded characters in the crazy cartoon universe\nLots of animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but not shows as deep and as adults as Beau jak uh\nUm oh you mean by influencing yeah or do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show [laughter] no\nI mean the shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them to shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American ... well I\nI think you know the obviously the the giants as The Simpsons and I would be disingenuous for me to claim that that show had had no influence on me\nOr my show or the success of my show you know when one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of The Simpsons and um but also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist\nOutside of the the bubble um\nOr the perceived bubble of animated TV you know I said ah we're going to ... when we start season one you're gonna watch it and at first is going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park but then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening it's going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men\nUm and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the um and to really\nTake things seriously a in a way that people don't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously um but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak any today are credible princes Carolyn that's sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat ah and and then a lot of others to even have a Keith Olbermann in there at some yeah I'm\nSee them as one of the first people we cast [laughter] at the news cast her whale as a newscaster well uh we we had in the script to um you know a a a Keith Olbermann whale type\nUm and he's fantastic we keep bringing it back season after season\nAnd you know one of my ah first memories of making the show and realizing how fun it was going to be\nWas we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had him do all his lines um and then at the end we think we also get you making some whale noises and you know this is Keith Olbermann who I thought of as a very serious man are goofing around going [noise]\nYou know making whale noises I thought this would be a fun show I think well one of your other\nMain characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison Aubrey who is phenomenal\nNow you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned\nOne ramification of that choice casting Allison Aubrey is Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American this\nIn the show now this season that's changed Diane does take a trip to the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her um how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it\nWell um we cast Alison ah in in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the seasonal forecasts are we've been working a with a different actress\nUm who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issues to she couldn't be lead on our show any more\nUm and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and we thought she was amazing and she's going to a a great job ever since um\nBut more and more uh as I was looking around at at the cast and and thinking about you know how how the show was put together and and and the makeup of the cast it started the dawn on me that everyone in our castles whites and our main cast and a lot of the recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this was in ...\nCasting his characters one at a time uh and I realized that oh this is my I Need to start paying better attention to 'em and so you know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices\nOr tried to have more people of color on the show but when it comes to Dianne specifically\nUm you know I think there is a a a real problem in this industry of casting white people in Asian roles and I was not a as aware of that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's something that I Would do differently as casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character and you know as I said in these other interviews\nUm I think it's hurt the show because I think my own self consciousness has prevented us from telling Asian Stories I think because I guess I didn't want people to talk about this it's not like this is the mistake we made\nAnd if I can just you know avoid it or you know glide passed it then you know maybe this won't become an issue where this you know won't become the thing that I end up talking about in every interview and I I think that was a disservice to the character um because I I think it ended up\nYou know we we ended up treating her as just like a white character or as a race didn't matter\nAnd it's it's difficult in our show because in some ways race doesn't matter because there is also talking elephants and you know anti eaters and giraffes walking around so it's hard to say how is an Asian American humans experience that different from a white American humans experience but\nI I think there are differences and I I'm more interested in exploring them now and I feel like\nThe uh avoidance of the issue was holding us back narrative way\nWell instead of avoiding it then you took responsibility for it on your own initiative and and as I said in season five Diane confronts those issues directly for herself makes a trip to Vietnam and narrates an entire episode about the experience for her um\nFrom four to four fifty five PM and with a Web presence and block at reasonably Catholic dot com it's a bomb for the Catholic so pleased to an air\n\nSupport

pretty large with writers producers directors prop masters camera operators makeup artist and many more but the performers might just rely on one crew member more than any other\nThe cue card holder\nAnd why the cue cards handles all the cue hard work in New York a decidedly low tech job some productions refused to do without\nJoining us from NPR in New York is the owner of NYC cue cards while the fairest and he's worked three decades behind the scenes on shows including Saturday Night live while the fairest and welcome to one a\nAh thanks for having me Joshua thanks for it was great to be here how did you get into the cue cards business a while you know I went to uh Syracuse and I wanted to be a writer I majored in writing and moved to New York in a you know my brother was working at the time as a receptionist\nAnd ah they knew that you can't guy so he recommended me even though my printing was terrible [laughter] and uh uh I got the job and I you know I did it just kept my foot in the door and to make writing connections\nAnd uh you know I did I did make some writing connections that I wrote for some cable shows but it was never enough to support myself so I kept on doing the cue cards and I got really good at doing cue cards very quickly\nAnd uh you know cut to twenty eight twenty nine years later I own my own company I've been doing it for that long and running a lot of shows\nSo clearly this was not the kind of writing that you had in mind but what was it about doing the cue cards that you liked\nKnow I I don't know I think one especially on Saturday Night live\nAnd helping the actors and helping the guest stars or through the shows and through this hard show that they you know they'd probably a lot of them are married and lived before there was something very rewarding about that and\nUm I didn't crack under pressure with the changes and all that stress that was involved with that and that was something that they the show noticed and uh you know everyone was a pretty quickly in the ranks\nTell us a bit about your company what shows does your company do cue cards for\nUh the are four main shows that are that are that tape all year our Saturday Night live um\nThe Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon late night with Seth Meyers and then we do Conan on the west coast as well those are are four main shows um and then we will do some reality shows we do a master we do all the Project Runway that shoot\nAnd then we do to show any show that comes to that time that he is ... guards you know work on that as well\nWhat kinds of people do well at this line of work the first thing we look for is neat printing\nNow my penmanship is fairly often um I think that was why when I was under med school track years ago people were like yeah we've seen your handwriting [laughter] so I Wonder exactly what you're looking for in terms of printing I as a cue cards I've seen a role written in all\nYes correct It's you know it's it's a it's a it's block lettering it's all caps um it's it's really about the spacing between ... between the letters and the word in a spacing between the words and the space in between the sentences\nIt's not something like I Can't just bring somebody off the street and say okay start doing your guards it's almost like you know you need I Need to train them for like two or three weeks\nI'm just to get them there's so many different little things you have to learn um two or three weeks of training yeah it it can cause it's it's not it's you can't just say you can't just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just interviews ... these are all the rules you need to learn memorized these new things come up every time there's new like\nThen on a period or ... or ... or a comma in if not that you know how to end it so that it flows to the next car just so many different roles where you can only learn it by by doing it and practicing it\nWe're speaking to Wally ... and the founder of NYC cue cards the exclusive cue card provider in New York\nOkay so let's say you're working for me for you know the late night with Joshua Johnson right and I come out to do my opening monologue I've just hired your company and I said Wylie I'm really excited to be working for you guys let's start building this relationship\nTell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out how to be a good cue card vendor for me\nAll right first thing I ask you how is your eyesight like near sighted or glasses okay so you were a glasses were your glasses on the show where you were contacts where we're not we're either\nI don't really like contacts hourglasses\nOkay so you're wearing a glass of so you can see fine I Want to have to if you didn't wear glasses and you wanna wear contacts I could put your letters bigger so that you can see but that would also make less words and the card and it would make it harder for you to ... to flow to them like if you're taught especially if you're telling jokes\nSo I Would recommend glasses or contacts for you if you know if you want to so you're gonna wear your glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just you know we were we were to have rehearsal is where I Would practice with you if you've never read two cards before that something you'd want to practice\nWhat's the main thing that I Need to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you\nOr look directly at the cue cards don't look away because it'll then we'll look like you're reading the cue cards\n... how do you mean it looked as regularly as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your band leader\nAnd I had cue cards near the bad leader and positioned in a way that you would want to play to those cue cards now if you were looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the car to the bad later the audience would be like oh he's obviously reading something but if you just played\nCameras so yeah so I I we open depending on where you are in position to the camera I'll make the cards the right the lettering the right size so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera\nShow your cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper\nThat's exactly right especially with Saturday Night live and that's what that's my main job but I'm there on Thursdays from Fridays that's all we do all day is block sketches and I'll be out there with one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put\nThe cars and I work with the director of the stage managers wild well kind of can for and I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they need that extra step somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical work week at SNL looked like for someone who's doing your cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously unfilled eleven thirty five PM\nWish it were that a simple [laughter] now we we start on Thursday we start Russell's on Thursday and Thursdays a light day\nSo the music the musical group or a harsh for the first half of the day and then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only print one one set of each sketch because I have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more and it\nIt'll change from Thursday the sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night and most most of the time will be completely written from Thursday and friday\nAnd then friday is the same process except we do about eight or nine sketches same process reprint put that on friday we have to do we have to make copies we call it do being the cards so it makes sense to me that we do that we don't have the we don't have the luxury of waiting until Saturday to dupe the friday sketches because data show day so everything's printed out\nActors having fun they're sitting underneath the bleachers from eleven o'clock to uh sometimes you know twelve or one o'clock in the morning just printing cards so long it's a long day for them\nWhat kind of person would want to take that kind of a job it doesn't sound like a very glamorous way to be near the TV business are you lower you mostly employing people who are looking for a foot in the door or do you have like veteran cue card writers working for ...\nThere is a little bit of both um mostly um\n[noise] people that are trying to get a footnote I encouraged that I I Try to tell them cue cards is not a career I I did make it a career for myself\nBut there's not much room if you want to do at great for your lives that's awesome but you should be looking to do something else I'm encouraging them I'm helping them I'm introduced them to people that want they than in the career that they want to do mostly most of it's entertainment related\nBut yeah you get those long days or friday but that leads to Saturday where ever heard that they may come out from behind the scenes and there are staying with me 'cause I Can't I Can't hold for sketches at one time you know four sets of cars at one time so I Need other people out there and then that's kind of the fun part of it\nHow close up to Showtime stay for Saturday Night live how close are you writing after Showtime\nWe don't stop making changes usually until ... sometimes twelve thirty at night twelve ... night while the show's going on\nSo you could still be writing while you're alive", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "11"}
