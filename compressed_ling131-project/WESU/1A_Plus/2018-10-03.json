A. M.

I I think it says a lot when you say that the minimum wages as lay down by Congress has almost irrelevant to the real economy because seven dollars and twenty five cents\nThat just doesn't go anywhere or in most states in most localities are and yet to have Congress advocating laws that are essentially irrelevant to how people really live\nA is a remarkable and and notable state of affairs necessary Europe proponent of a living wage and I and I read that tweet from one of our listeners she said why have a minimum wage why not indexed it essentially to a real life\nNow what is the difference between a minimum wage and and what's become known as a living wage right well MIT has\nAt the cost of local transportation food housing and other basic needs I looked up on the city I live in the district of Columbia they said uh the living wage there I was Seventeen dollars an hour but that's for a full time work\nAnd I want to point out that a huge additional problem in addition to the low wages in this country is the increase in security if work how many people are working part time at Walmart it's half\nOf their employees are part time workers\nAnd then there's the temporary workers and the subcontracted workers you know Amazon Fifteen dollars an hour is not going to apply to their a contractor says the increased ... precarious enough of work that that's also a big problem it despite are low unemployment we still have so many people working every day for poverty wages\nI'm Paul even though Fifteen dollars an hour is twice the current federal minimum as you mentioned we heard from a lot of listeners who stay in this economic climate or even Fifteen doesn't go very far away from some of them\nWhen all is higher than the minimum wage to try and live better for workers but when there were ... catch up with a dog when we run a minimum wage that's never know\nAnd as a college graduate with a bachelor's degree and student loans I already make Fifteen dollars an hour at a fulltime job and have to supplement with at least one part time job at all times\nI think there needs to be some consideration on regional differences because I can assure you that Fifteen dollars an hour in South Carolina goes much further than Fifteen dollars an hour in California\nI work another job besides my full time job and uh so I Am kind of like ... by unfortunately I have lots of the credit card debt and the result and uh actually like Eighteen dollars an hour to twenty\nThere is there who are living on minimum wage and for many many more this has been a big issue in Congress a workers who work for big companies can't afford health care don't have insurance wind up relying on state or federal public assistance\nTo make up the difference and that suggests that all of us in some way are subsidizing low wages\nYou're you're exactly right and I mean you're ... and as or your callers I mean\n... if you look at cost of living data you see that in all fifty states a single worker will need at least Fifteen dollars an hour to cover the basics in just a couple of years\nAnd in the high cost states that your your your listeners were flogging or workers with children will need even more than Fifteen dollars an hour we have a report on our Web site by my uh pinto PIN Tio on this with the with the numbers for all fifty states and uh\nIt really highlights how Fifteen is really a basic national floor and we need to even go up from there\nLike a you know you know in New York New Jersey did this week we're airport workers are getting a raise to Nineteen dollars an hour\nIn hotel workers are are striking around the country in the higher costs that he's demanding twenty five dollars an hour or so you know your workers or your your listeners are right about about about what you know as a practical matter if you do the math what would it ... individuals need to to to get by especially in the higher cost regions\nAnd as a result you know a lot of ... of of companies big and small are relying on our taxpayer funded safety net for support you know more than a hundred and fifty billion dollars a year of safety net programs go to a workers in low paying jobs and you know these are good programs and we should have them but we need\nYou know major employers to do their part to pay a decent wage of at least Fifteen dollars an hour and then to supplement that with the with the work supports in order to help bring bring workers up to a a basic level now let's hear some of the other side of the Seth writes to us on Facebook when I worked for Walmart we were\nTold us if we even had to have an open schedule we would get even less I'm skeptical of individual companies that are raising wages and we received also a lot of calls from people who were concerned that raising the federal minimum wage to say Fifteen dollars an hour could wind up backfiring on workers\nI'm all for making you know Fifteen dollars an hour that job on that now I work at ... in the mall but I find that a\nLot of people are a lot of employers if they're raising the hourly wage or just cutting down hours which in the end it either arrows stem from the previous uh wage or in some cases you make what\nI Am opposed to raising it to Fifteen dollars an hour simply because I don't think businesses will take that last they will raise the price is the standard of living raise and Fifteen dollars won't to anyone any good the poor will stay for\nThanks for listening and it's your support that kept them going in Nineteen thirty nine\nStay tuned for more than

understand I I Want to talk\nAbout a fight going on in Washington DC where we happened to be in a one eight studios WAMC you enter the world [laughter] unfortunately increasingly so but there has been a very important wage fight going on on the local level not in Washington is the world\nAmong wage for shift workers a bar backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily\nAnd there was a big fight a lot of pushback it looks like grassroots resistance and then we found out that a lot of the money for the pushback was indeed coming from organizing interests for restaurant owners of the American restaurant association local chapters and others\nUm voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars\nAnd now the city council here in the district of Columbia has decided that voters were wrong and they are in the process of voting\nThis very day to overturn the will of local D.C voters on this issue or what does this fight here in D.C say about the state of wages it specially for chick workers people who might get paid by their employer I don't know five bucks an hour because they make up the rest in in ones and hopefully five ...\nThe way I see it this week the living wage movement to three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen\nAnd they took one big step back with the DC Council voting to repeal um the the will of the voters to eliminate and in a gradual way this sub minimum wage for tipped workers\nUm said really the minimum wage for tipped workers is two dollars and Thirteen cents it's been stuck there for a couple of decades here in DC it's three dollars and eighty nine cents\nTechnically if you don't make enough tips to bring that ah wage up to the the um the local minimum your employer is supposed to make up the difference\nThat pretty much never happen I used to work in the restaurant industry and I've talked to a lot of restaurant workers that pretty much never happened and so we have a workforce of restaurant server primarily women many women of color or at jobs where people face ramping sexual harassment they're vulnerable\nA A N E L a wage that doesn't amount to anything so\nPeople in the district um voted to get rid of this two tier system um the industry launched an incredible campaign against that they put posters up everywhere in the steady thanks save our tips to try to make people think that this had something to do with banning tip\nIt did not it was clearly be beyond a local issue this with the national showdown between the restaurant industry and people who are trying to get a fair wage for this vulnerable sectors of the workforce\nMichael Saltsman and what did you see at play here I think we're familiar with workers versus management in a fight like this are the DC Council voting to overturn the will of the voters is is remarkable but what about the economics of it\nActually so I I think in this case you had a situation where the interests of workers and management were actually very clearly aligned I mean there was a sixteen hour hearing\nBefore the council voted on this bill to repeal the initiative initiative Seventy seven I'm I was at the hearing I testified at two thirty in the morning it went until three twenty in the morning and the number of employees who showed up to say this is going to be harmful to us you need to repeal this far outnumbered those were there to support it\nAnd I just want to take a step back to I mean it was mentioned earlier that a living wage and indeed the is is is Seventeen dollars an hour I mean tipped employees and the the\nUh according to the bureau of Labor Statistics are on with their tips about Eighteen Nineteen dollars an hour so you have people who are already doing quite well and what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came together and said okay we're we want to go to a Fifteen dollar minimum wage in regardless of what you think on the merits of that\nWe're also going to raise the tips may win among wage in that case up to about five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employee who said\nWe want to keep the tip credit we want our tips to count as income\nThere was one group of New York based group called rock that didn't like that and so they they came in and they had a lot of money that come into ...\nBut you had a massive grassroots outpouring from employees hundreds of whom showed up for instance to an event with council chairman Phil Mendelson to say we don't want this and I think it's part of a bigger movement of employees\nNow you say you say grass roots and I'm I'm sure that you're right but grass roots are astro turf we see so much grass roots in the area of wages in minimum wage is only to find out that the grassroots workers who are fighting against increases in wages are are backed by business interests\nSo actually I I think it's I think that that talking point I think that's been used by proponents is is is a little bit um demeaning to the workers who who came forward um because of the the testimony they gave you know one forty five in the morning or the people who got up or at Franklin hall and said you know what this is going to be harmful to me that can be harmful to my industry\nDon't try and save me I'm not asking for it I mean I think that the that the notion I think that these people are just doing that\nUm because they're sort of put up to it or somehow that they're not real employees um I I think it's kind of insulting to what they're trying to do and still Mendelson that chairman Phil Mendelson the chair of the DC Council made an interesting point um when he got us to talk about this which is that he said\nI have heard from countless employees to tell me this is not good for them I have heard from almost nobody who wants who wants to keep it and he said people can come to me privately they can email me this is not an issue of their owners being intimidated\nHe said that the grassroots on this in support of it was silent he called them the silent grassroots and I think that's that's indicative of where the passion was on that\nLet's pull back from the district the district of Columbia the local D.C back out to the nation at large and so many of you won a listeners\nHad been reaching out to us Nina posts on Facebook I'm In a precarious position if my wages go up I won't be eligible for Medicaid so it's a wash or worst for me we talked about free riders and how many workers who get minimum wages wind up on public assistance and Randy in Tulsa emails\nTop floors to those businesses will be hurt it's just another blow against main street\nNotes or I Want to talk to you about income inequality and we're in minimum wage fits into this we hear so much about the growing wealth gap and massive income inequality in this country we talk about the shrinking of the middle class but at the low end of the pay scale can increases in minimum wage actually provide\nAny real equity or is it just a drop in the bucket in a world where the top one percent on fifty percent\nMeaningful that in some ways it as a drop in the bucket you know a couple of years ago with my colleagues calculated that three men the three wealthiest men in America including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have combined wealth that his graders and the combined wealth of the bottom half of the country\nAnd today that's an understatement because Japanese POWs wealth has increased so much but nevertheless to dramatize is just how it's dreamed the wealth gap is and I think there's a lot of interest in\n'em adding to the fight for Fifteen effort to look not just that the low end of the wage scale but also the top end what can we do to prevent the it's really up being a level of income and wealth concentration at the top that are so damaging to our economy our democracy\nNot to mention just a moral outrage and in a country that that is so wealthy\nAnd so I'm really excited about a new tool we have for doing this this year for the first time in history publicly held companies have to report the gap between the c._e._o. and their work or pay\nThe numbers coming out are staggering at Walmart it's a thousand to one at at McDonald's at three thousand to one and we can build on that information to incentivize companies to to narrow the gap and just one quick example Portland, Oregon introduced the world's first tax penalty\nThat into homeless services and it'll hit companies like Wells Fargo and and Wal Mart that do business in the city of Portland I think ideas like that are going to start to spread like wildfire now that we have this information about gaps within specific company\nAnd an interesting set of proposals at a time when populism is strong in our political culture both on the left and on the ride and workers voices and income inequality becoming a much more important part of the conversation you certainly see a lot of pushback from corporate America I think Bernie would be down Alexandria or Ocasio Cortez in New York would\nWhy should you be the exception of June and

U. dot org and we had been hearing from so many of you want to listeners primarily women\nBut not exclusively Petra emailed to say I am so tired of people equating my anger with the insanity\nFriends laugh at my posted insinuate that I've lost it and you know what I have\nI have lost my inability to be quiet in the face of gross injustice and Joan emailed us I'm sixty five and I was in college we the first feminist resurgence is the world the usa ready for women's anger that's like asking African Americans when will the world be ready for their anger the ants\nEnding and peg in Traverse City emailed this on a conservative woman that is angry that someone can be assumed guilty based on unproven allegations I'm angry at the assumption that all American women are anti cabinet pro choice liberal and progressive I'm a proud American woman who's also conservative pro life pro Cavanaugh\nI Am an American woman to\nNow Rebecca Traister you started to paint a picture of the history of women who've gotten angry and made their mark their anger is not always shown in the same form as somebody yelling in the face of a senator like Jeff Flake on live TV but anger nonetheless and Brittany Cooper you've written a book\nAbout finding your power in rage uh tell me a little bit about that theme in how the story fits into the moment\n[noise] a shore so part of what happens is that women are told 'em as many of your listeners say that to be angry it's to be irrational\nUm and I had a student when I was a graduate instructor confront me um and said to me that she loved to listen to me lecture because my lectures were filled with what she called the most eloquent rage ever and it was a wakeup call for me as someone who had run away from the angry black woman stereotype my whole life\nBecause I didn't want to be discredited as a black woman moving through predominantly white institutions\nAnd so my student who was a young black woman thaw and be a kind\nOf authenticity and she helped me to realize that my anger wasn't keeping me from doing my job or showing up offering\nQuality lectures are material or material but then it was actually helping me to do a better job and so in that moment I made a connection that I've been encouraging other women to make which is to acknowledge that we have the right to outrage and to reject ideas that say that when we're angry about legitimate injustices\nThat this in some way makes us irrational or makes our claim illegitimate and wind\nThey're just getting power and we start to use that energy and power to build the kind of world we want to see a and more women need to give themselves permission to do that\nI've given myself permission to do that I'm at in this moment I Am on the front lines of thanks for women outrage have the potential if we own it and if we don't apologize or\nTo change this very scary our trajectory of this historical moment we have a lot to be afraid about or we have a lot to be angry about opposite that anger is the catalyst for being able to do something about the things we see\nNow let's move from the Senate committee hearing room or in the hallways around the Senate um and even the books that are esteemed authors have bring onto the tennis court and the U.S open for another moment that American shared within the last couple of weeks\nSerena Williams in her match against Naomi Osaka at the U. S. open here's a cut I'll bring it back there to refresh my memory of anger on the court to Reno Williams infamous exchange with umpire Carlos Ramos\n[noise]\n... shared this moment along with the rest of America us arena is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who founded that anger a weaponized against her\n[noise] Ah yes I ... I think that what we saw in their response was everything that Brittany and Rebecca and I have been talking about it was interesting because\nThere's so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not facing the same policing or penalties mean she she was a defined that was levied against her is the highest ever for verbal abuse\nThere were sponsors of the people that really just wanted to see her in isolation acting on\nIt and this exchange with this man but then there were people who really looked at that exchange within the much broader context of\nThe power dynamics in the moment in the history in the context and the legacy of discrimination within the sport that she's faith\nAnd so I think that one thing that has been unexplored in the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine in understanding women as\nLeaders or at people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict\nUm what she was really doing was um starting her right to defend herself and to have dignity in the moment not be accused the way that she was accused\nAnd with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so a generation of role models\nWho have benefited from title nine in the lessons of title nine which we tend to think of it is\nUm athletic but it is really about leadership and the ability to act together um in teams to manage conflict to make the new wants to sanction between being assertive and being aggression and be aggressive and being angry\nI think we're seeing the ... of of that now in our political live\nWere some pushback though to Serena Williams behavior on the court and the reaction to it even from within the tennis world a Brittany Cooper\nI don't know if you saw Martina Navratilova as response to this arena Williams episode a couple of days later but she wrote an op ed after the U.S open and she said marching speaking now said yes women are treated differently yes there are double standards but Serino was wrong her encore behavior wasn't appropriate\nRena should not emulated right I'm Martina Navratilova was wrong or she did this thing that women are conditioned to do which is rather than use it as a moment of solidarity\nShe tried police arenas conduct I'm as a lifelong tennis fan I'm I Am limited but Martina Navratilova reminded me but up until this moment most white women in tennis have not been allies of the Williams sisters\nUm do when I watch tennis with my friends who are African American tennis fan we often talk about watching these matches on you because of the micro aggressions that come from white women who are often knocking at the Williams sisters in having things to say but let me also add\nThat one of the things that was most infuriating about watching the way in which Ramos treated Serena\nWas that there was a broader context to her anger not only did he accused her of cheating but this also came out on the heels of reports that members of the u._s. TA had been showing up to her house\nUnannounced and testing her over and over again on grounds that maybe she was doping even though she has come up clean on every drug tested even those statistics show that they were testing her double the amount that they were testing any other players on the women's side and so she had been subjected to repeated indignities\nAnd then as the best tennis player of her generation and perhaps ever see them has a referee\nWho accuses her cheating and she's one more grand slams that any woman other than Margaret Court and any woman in the open era and that is indicative of the kinds of fury that we're talking about the way that women are disrespected daily have\nTheir contributions and their qualifications undermined and then when they finally explode the response is your behavior with inappropriate and what I Want to challenge folks to think about it not\nFrom four to four fifty five PM and with a Web presence and block at reasonably Catholic dot com

America\nWhere I'm Talking with Rebecca Traister for New York magazine and the cut author of good in mad Brittany Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage\nAnd also ... director of the women's media center speech project and author of the new book rage becomes her now I read an email from Karen at the end of the last segment that said she was hurt disappointed and angry wounded about the treatment\nOf Hillary Clinton in the twenties sixteen campaign and I want to go there because Hillary Clinton is one prominent famous\nWoman well known for navigating the shoals at how women are supposed to express themselves in public now Hillary Clinton has a history of being\nVery careful and very deliberate mindful of appearing angry or emotional she's been at it for thirty five years in America and in fact it was news in the two thousand ... campaign I remember this when she shed a tear in New Hampshire one tier and it was at the top of CNN for like a new cycle and a half\nSo now a lot of people are saying that the twenty sixteen presidential campaign I'm Hillary Clinton in fact was was tone police listen\nI regret deeply\nHow angry\nTone of the campaign became [noise]\n\nYour fault says one audience member wind\n... only does this moment has clearly struck a chord Rebecca Traister who's whacking here in the studio with me but how does it strike you [laughter] know she was all she was very very careful in her choice of words there to even as she was commenting\nOn it I mean I think it was um it was ridiculous that this woman was called an authentic while being held to the standard\nOf care full control in her voice and her facial of parents and her body\nAnd her motive expression I mean the two candidates um that were her primary\nOpponents both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders could act in unhinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they could pound podium\nYou know they could turn red and the faith and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was the gender card nobody wrote about that at the gender card right there were all these conversations about\nI'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender\nUm and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign\nRecord right so right about that and I'm In fact the thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political pressed for their particular skill in channeling the anger of their supporters this was their gift they were able to give voice to this frustration\nAnd we were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion and yet\nEvery time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said you're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ... a a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough said mile is if it was like some cat color\nOf of not having that tool to wield she also has done remarkable writing and talking herself\nIn instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in her own memoir of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that second debate where Donald Trump came up behind her and kind of loomed behind her\nAnd how men and seeing an aggressive his body language was and how during\nThe debate a presidential debate she was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but that she was thinking no no no\nThat's gonna redound negatively to me that's gonna make me look bad it's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story told us about\nHow much energy women ... bend\nModulating can deterring strategizing thinking tactically about how to use their voice how to suppress their voice how to channel their anger how to swallow their anger what to do in order to be rhetorically effective\nAnd and I think that that's something that that all three of us are writing about and thinking about the amount of time and energy women spend doing this kind of maneuvering around the rules around are angry expression\nNow I Want to I Want to talk a little bit in the last ... section of the show that we have about where some of this anger\nGoes because this is a moment in America and let's be realistic moments have a way of feeding they just do and and so I'm interested in where this goes when\nMaybe the cameras and all of the writers who aren't Rebecca Traister and Britain Cooper are not as interested anymore you know in a couple of years I think that might happen and I want to know where this goes now we've been hearing from so many wanting listeners I Want to play you another mash\nUp of some of the women's voices who've been reached\nBubble over and I get really angry out loud it it really doesn't do much good I find that if I express a strong opinion or even just a bit of discomfort with something I'm perceived as being angry are overreacting women yelling even in this day and age it's not very acceptable men don't seem to have that same problem and I'm\nStarting to feel like maybe it's not just a personal issue I'm dealing with what they're going to be nice and and uh and keep our mouth shut however I Am so angry so angry right now maybe women all over the place you're dealing with it I'm turning my anger into action given\nHelp but feel like I'm not alone but still pretty discouraging I think that's what we're gonna have to do we have to take that anger hold onto it and that's how we're going to take back this country\nWe're hearing from listeners women who it feels like there's a theme or transferring\nSome of their personal rage I'm sure a lot of it's in in personal life not just political life or cultural life but into action taking action in the streets taking action maybe at the ballot box we got\nThis tweet from Tracy in Jacksonville I'm One of the thousands of women using their frustration to run for office I'm running for the Florida House district Fifteen I Am focused on\nMy determination to be a voice for all and focus on issues important to Jacksonville families Tracey as one candidate who says that this moment of anger is very important for her motivation a Brittany Cooper I Want to talk about where\nThis goes in terms of maybe the mid term that might be the most immediate effect I'm I\nNone of us knows exactly how that vote is going to turn out but it seems like any\nPollster or political analyst worth anything is looking down and what they call the cross tabs and noticing a that women are mad women are going to vote and women are going to form a title even twenty Eighteen one way or the other\nAbsolutely and that is as it should be um I ...\nAnd were slave state or the ... Presley campaign they're all of these progressive campaigns that are being run and here's the thing\nWe've been seeing that since twenty six team we had a wave of a progressive as sort of radically progressive black mayors in the deep south and so one of the things that I Want to challenge folks to do as we think in this moment is to actually look at what people of color are doing not just women\nBut particularly black women in these elections the ways that we have the channeling our anger\nOn for decades and decades and that started with the way that we voted for Hillary Clinton and the most immediate political moment\nUm but to your earlier point about whether or not\nOur anger can be sustained um I think that I think that this can be sustained I think that we have to remember that the women's movement in this country do it goes through ebbs and flows has really been a solid political project a sense a depending on how you count eight seed thirty one or Eighteen forty eight\nSo we're we're two hundred years in a almost here and so I think you know I'm I think that there is a real opportunity for us to make some change here and I think the as women see that um our power and our ability to frame issues in ways that include the most American and take care of the most marginalized Americans\nUm I I'm I'm excited about a blue wave", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Middletown", "day": "03"}
