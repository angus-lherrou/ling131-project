U. dot org\nJust so misconceptions [noise] but maybe the first place to start is why where\nAre we know it feels like this has been America's one big story for weeks now or are we going to drop and what's your sense of just kind of where we are right\n[noise] well I think that Kavanaugh nomination\nAnd now confirmation will have some a lasting effect and I think as we get further away from it it's sort of easier to see with clarity at the first is that\nA judicial confirmations are getting more polarized I'm John Roberts with confirmed Seventy eight to twenty two Alito fifty eight to forty two\nGorsuch fifty four to forty five and now Kavanaugh fifty to forty eight so these votes are becoming narrower and there are occurring more along partisan lines and I think that will continue particularly as the prospect of a Republican president\nA potentially replacing a justice who was ... up put on the court by a Democratic president comes up the next justice to go is likely to be a liberal they they are older\nUm and the second is sort of the opening of a places previously considered not open to scrutiny the high school and college years of\nNot just a judicial nominees but perhaps cabinet secretaries and political candidates\nI'm to scrutiny at Kavanaugh was one of the first or maybe the first to have his high school years are open to public scrutiny and a something that almost the real just confirmation I think that's a trend likely to continue today we thought CNN reporter under fire for tweets\nPM as we go down the rabbit hole of an eccentric musical taste together only on W E s U Middletown Katie point one half\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from bona with the bonus certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractor committed to expertise in customer service contract to locate her hand more information or at bono dot com [noise]\nAnd from that last scene collaborations software company powering teams around the world committed to providing the tools and practices to help teams plan track\nThis is one hey I'm Joshua Johnson we're discussing Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court and what it means for the country and for you\nWith Mona chair and syndicated columnist and senior fellow at the ethics and public policy center\n... senior contributor at the federalist and Eliana Johnson White House reporter for Politico we'd love to hear from you too comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a\nEmail one a at W.

C.\nW. am used Patrick Madden was there on Saturday as hundreds of people protesting on the Capitol Steps about a hundred sixty four people got arrested [noise]\nKind of reflects what we heard from ... in North Florida who tweeted we'd better vote\nLike our lives depended on it in November and not let anything go to the Supreme Court if we can possibly help it\nSharon emailed I was behind judge Kavanaugh from the beginning of his confirmation for his stellar record and I am overjoyed that he's now an associate justice I Am one of the many many pro life women that the mainstream media speaks to always minimize both our numbers and our positions as women\nJohn rode on our Facebook page you catch soft sell this anymore with unwavering support for Duncan Hunter junior Kavanaugh and Trump Republicans are OK with philandering and sexual assault\nThe only reason was Ford was not believed was because she was testifying against the Republican nominee the right didn't even listen to her and the FBI quote unquote investigation was a total sham and John ... investigation in quotation marks on a chair and I did want to ask you about that in terms of who was believed in\nA reasonable doubt watching court or you know upon originally set that aside for for just a moment just the visceral way in which some people seem to be more believed than others what did you make of\nThat [noise] so this episode like so much and are\nHighly highly polarized society um is two completely different world views so when Democrats um both partisan Democrats any way I look at what happened with Kavanaugh they see a Republican Party that is massage in us that doesn't believe women that diminishes charges\nA sexual assault doesn't take them seriously\nAnd um they have some things in their in their quiver they can point to the Roy Moore episode and a and to the president himself and so forth so that their view um the the Republican view is\nThat the allegation a of Christine Blasey Ford was even though it was held until the very last moment and they're they're very angry about the the processes um I Know this was saying\nBut they also point to the fact\nThat this accusation the Blasey Ford won was taken seriously was listening to but then it was roped in\nBy many Democrats on the committee with two other allegations that were so absurd that they should not have even pass the laugh test I'm the one by Julie sweat neck which she immediately walked back\nYou know that that there was some sort of rape gang going on in a in in ... says the Maryland in the Nineteen eighties and to the students that she has a college student was attending a lot of high school parties and saw Kavanaugh spiking the drinks are girls with ... and then attacking them well of course she she walked all of that back but\nUh and of course the Ramirez story too was quite thin so thin that the New York times looked into it and we refuse to publish it [noise] so um [noise] so she'll be the problem\nDelegations in with lazy Ford's more um believable accusation it had the paradoxical effect of of um making sleazy Ford's case all the um weaker because it was seen to be part of this political hit\nAnd um and I think of an ... a may have a lot to answer for from his Democratic colleagues\nWill the president did also make some political hay with Christine Blasey Ford's case for her story as well let me here's part of what you said at a rally on Wednesday in Mississippi in an act of what he said was to help defend Brett Kavanaugh and his unfair treatment here's a bit of the president\nKind of characterizing washing cars are generous word what professor Ford said too\nI did he get home I don't remember how did you get or don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many don't want to [noise]\nWhat\nWas it and I don't know\n[noise] there's there's one I don't know what I mean that's the only thing [noise]\n\nAnd a man a man lives shattered\nPart of what the president said his rally last Wednesday in Mississippi it's worth noting that the president is incorrect in his assertion that all the professor Ford remembered was having one beer indeed she said that you're into her hippocampus clearly a psychology professor was the fact that she was laughed at\nShe also remembered that it was upstairs I mean she remembered many things the president did not cover himself with glory in that moment where he was mocking current diminishing her of course a that was that was disgusting on the other hand um there has been a tremendous amount of behavior on the left during this\nA people are from the public square um uh you know accusing someone of um absurd\nCharges and not taking into account his whole life you know uh if judge Kavanaugh where the monster that are the some of the Democrats had been portraying you would think that somebody would have picked up on it at some point in his adult life\nWell and that's kind of what I'm Wondering in a way I hear you on that morning early on I also kind of noticed that\nOne aspect of the debate around Brett Kavanaugh that seemed to not get a whole lot of mentioned in the final analysis didn't get a lot of mentioned from Susan Collins of Maine when she gave that like fifty minutes exploitation on the floor of the Senate which was actually rather fast moving toward hearing if you've ever heard it\nIs just how Brett Kavanaugh handled the accusation I mean if someone accused me of something that awful but I knew I did not do\nI think I Would hope that I'd be able to say listen this is an awful thing that happened it sounds like a tragedy I Wish I could give you the closure you're looking for but I'm not the person who did it like something about temperament in this whole discussion kind of fell by the wayside\nYeah I Do think that once the additional allegations came out in cabin up in his testimony had to answer not just for a\nBloody Ford's allegation but also for the other two allegation and and he was upset\nAngry in tears enraged are outraged\nOn Democrats sort of their their arguments a became one not about necessarily guilt or innocence but one about temperament and did he have the appropriate temperament sit on the bench and it ah their argument necessarily\nTo detach and then when he got angry they thought that wasn't good enough\nI'm from a from a report ... perspective on that the temperament question was an interesting one to me it's sort of seemed to me from afar that looking at the jet there's ... says on the bench we know all of their politics are based on the president to a point that it's based on the way they ruled\nSo ah the temperament question was\nInteresting I'm not sure how relevant today is because we know all the politics of all of the justices\nNot really sure how cabinets temperament plays into\nIt with regards to temperament and civility Sam wrote on our Facebook page there's a difference between the Thomas and Kavanaugh hearings referring to Clarence Thomas back in Ninety One\nThomas required sixty votes to confirm Kavanaugh only fifty fifty plus one there's no need for civility for the majority anymore because there's no need to have at least some support from\nBoth sides you know what do you make a simple comments\nFive Monday through friday at five or five you too can be an educated\nUs\nSupport for NPR comes from

your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with you know step in early on a Johnson and motive sharing you know let me let you jump in and responsibility on his comment before we keep going\nOn I mentioned that that Republicans I suffer in the mid term and that was a political sacrifice\nWorth making I I actually think that the opposite I mean I'm not in that political prognostications business I think after twenty sixteen and that's a dangerous doesn't it uh but I don't think they'll suffer at all in fact I'm especially among Republican women there's been a big jumping enthusiast and there's a twelve point\nUp words swaying among Republican women and that's because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women\nOn for a lot of women out there that they're hearing about fairness\nIt was about fairness for their husbands their fathers their sons on that a lot of blame moms who are are really scared about the standard that Mona mentioned right the idea that a single accusation\nWithout any kind of corroborating evidence is enough to destroy a man's life I think there are a lot of women who see a problem with that standard as well and they are also energized they come out to the\nFish is no doubt very very visceral for quite a lot of you including Gene Gene emailed urging contacted us in road we're more concerned with the men who were falsely accused two to five percent of the time than the women who are raped Ninety five Ninety eight\nYour issues than your panel was talking about our justice system is broken the women on your panel or making my blood boil ... are we losing sight of something larger here [noise]\nUh well the um the problem of rape has always been with us as long as there's been human civilization\nAnd I'm Sorry I'm On I I hate to interrupt you but I just want to clarify something from the comment the comics who wrote that one and for women in America deal with rape Senator Dianne Feinstein into shearing said that according to federal statistics it's one in three the one in three women will deal with sexual violence a yet or not race that that's way overstated sexual violence sexual\nSo and that's a very very broad description drunk lose even just being funneled over your clothes against your will so right hope it'd be careful with a number yeah okay so yeah the number is is is a is not not right but look at the problem of of male sexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization\nAll civilized society seek to a cope with it\nUh and it's also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute because in most cases there are only two people it happens in privacy there are no witnesses um it's very hard to show proof if there was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera\nSo it is you know when people say well we're not being believed it's because it's it's very hard to prove and also you have to recognize that the consequences\nOf finding of guilt at finding someone guilty of rape I mean ... years and years and years in prison\nAnd so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it is but I don't see any way around you know keeping in mind our standards of justice in fair play and see any way around\nThe difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusations\nI feel like well this is one of those moments early on as there were a lot of women including several who've come\nProgram have essentially said I don't want to hear it we've been waiting for all of human history for our society to deal with the fact that men can treat women like pieces of meat and get away with it with impunity that day is over yesterday so fix fish or we will structured out until you do\nI hear your Mona but it got emotional visceral part of politics that we ought to I I don't think that the political will is there especially among women who have been assaulted to say okay I'll take a breath and wait another term for this to get better\n[noise] well I think there are two challenges the first is that we have a justice system based on a presumption of innocence and the cabin are confirmation presented another challenge which is that he was not being tried in the court of law and the question raised and it was should he a\nBenefit from the presumption of innocence and we had a lot of senators saying no he should have the presumption of guilt and he should have to clear his name and that seemed not to go over a well there was a political backlash on the right to that and so I think that\nThere certainly is energy on the left but it isn't that ah with equal forced from energy on the right with people who feel that that's\nGreatly unfair but the cabinet confirmation and saying that a ... a presumption of guilt when an accusation is leveled\nWas sort of net with an equal and opposite energy from the right and emailers and callers can say that that makes their blood boil but covering this as a reporter that is simply a sort of what we saw\nI Do want to move on and talk about the impact on the Supreme Court by should note that this has left some of you just regardless of your politics feeling very cynical about the process over all I mean this was very high political theater in ...\nCalling from Cleveland, Ohio I'm very disappointed\nJak and our congressman and I'm very disappointed with the United states at this time an African American woman I really felt that it was all up the joke that they what they hind doors and said okay let's get the country a good show they already know what\nThey were going to do it's not a government or the people\nOn Oh yes it is only up to kill our group of people\nForest appreciate your calling and sharing your thoughts with us and we get to a few more comments as we continue Tina in Grand Rapids Michigan emailed\nI'm so sick and tired of people talking about Kavanaugh's reputation in life being ruined that it's absolutely ridiculous usually wealthy privileged white man whose life is nowhere near ruined obviously now he's been confirmed and will be on the Supreme Court\nHer life is the one that has been ruined if anyone's life has been ruined the me too movement has not been weaponized for political gain and I'm Upset that your guest just said that on the air so angry right now this is real for women\nIrwin in Arkansas emailed so we'll Kevin uh really take the court to the far right I've been hearing conflicting views from the right word some say he will do so and others say Kavanaugh will actually be moderate ... gets to something that senator Collins of Maine Susan Collins of Maine\nTalked about in her long exploitation explaining why she was going to vote\nFor Brett Kavanaugh and some of his background particularly as it relates to dealing with presidents on the Supreme Court she mentioned roe versus Wade very specifically what what's your read on whether or not Brett Kavanaugh will drag the court kind of as Irwin suggested to the far right\nOn because these are placing Anthony Kennedy I think there will be a shift the right on the court um I think it will be much\nTurned precedent overturn I think it's much more likely that we see some narrowing of the precedent on abortion allowing states I'm a little bit more leeway to regulate abortion and the second and third trimester as I think that's more likely outcome on those issues\nUm I I Do think that Susan Collins overstated a Kavanaugh's moderate credentials a little bit and her her speech um because he was at the judge on the appellate court he was following Supreme Court\nA precedent his job as a judge was try to guess how the Supreme Court would rule on a particular issue given the process of that now that he is setting that precedent he's played a role in what he thinks that precedent should be\nPM [noise] W.

A. M. U. dot org\nKatie you're on the ground in Michigan working on redistricting reform I Want to hear what you're up to in just a moment but first I Want to get a little more explanation of this larger issue and so ... and let me start with you\nIf you would just explain what we mean when we talk about redistricting and and what point redistricting becomes gerrymandering right\nThis is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after the descending you'll senses\nOf the census really starts the whole process or the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives the states the official number of uh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives do get\nThere's a really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method which I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years but that that's how so every state all fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know there are four hundred and thirty five\nSo that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the hunting can heal method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well but then that does the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth\nAh and that's how we figure out that um say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose his seat on the margins depending on uh the population shift and the relative populations of each state so this happens every ten years and then\nEvery ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways of some legislatures have challenged uh the the various end\nPower to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various quirks here and there\nAre and uh the legislatures will then draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty or the the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and then the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows\nPretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there\nAnd when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that distorted the pejorative term for when a party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate a in a crazy ways in ways that\nWhere the the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power um and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through its own\nHiccups with political gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we are going to see thrown around a lot of in this next redistricting\nYeah North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David your in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leading we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David of what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing the district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform it\nI think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing state of Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sundays similar number of members of Congress both parties\nTo Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and twenty\nRed to blue in any of those competitive states in this entire decade and that's the Conor Lamb state and the special election in two thousand Seventeen so when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no swing in any district in any of these competitive swing states\nYou also see this as well at the state legislative level so you have all of these states that are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which that Democrats may often when\nMore votes state wide for it chamber and yet here for example Republicans have a super majority\nIn in both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override\nThe actions of a democratic governor here at mix politics more extreme it in the late ... members\nFrom voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom bill that you know wildly unpopular and yet the other politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead and\nEnact that kind of legislation I'm ... and it also discourages competition in a lot of the states in North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine percent of all statewide seats went without a major party\nCompetitor so voters had no choice animal half of their district here because folks took a look at those races and said I Can't win or raise enough money to actually make it worth the investment of time\nGoing to get to some of your comments as well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of your fans of the show no one of our audience as hot as Todd of topics including with Michael wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power\nVoters heavily approved with support from both parties and the issue on the ballot to fairly redrawn districts after twenty twenty and Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered they rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an active for this twenty Eighteen election ain't that a load of crap\nThat's all the same in North Carolina Laura by the way we did a program a while back in February ... actually about gerrymandering where we put a quiz online we have some gerrymandered districts and we wanted to see if you could tell the difference between the map of gerrymandered district\nAnd an ink blot on a Rorschach test you can find that quiz if you search the words gerrymandering G. E. R. R. Y. M. A. N. D. E. R. I. N. G. it was a program that aired this February you'll find that on our website the one a dot org\nKatie let me come to you talk about voters not politicians I understand that this was a redistricting initiative ... started after you were trying to find some way\nTo be politically active but not overtly hyper partisan and this is something that galvanized people around you right\nYeah um I accidentally started a political movement with a Facebook post it was after that twenty sixteen election uh before\nI'm headed to a Thanksgiving dinner and I had heard my friends and family is really a being drawn to both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders I'm with the messages about draining the swamp and the political resolution and\nI realize that you know there's a lot of frustration against the current them and place which makes a lot of sense I remember learning about\nGerrymandering and it does make it to that our voices aren't heard or that popular a proposal aren't being passed that the local level and we're lucky and Michigan where we have that that it's been about initiative process which means if we can write constitutional language as the people of Michigan and\n\nSupport for NPR

vote and the author of the upcoming book the rising and read Wilson national correspondent for the hill a couple of you wrote us to respond\nPennsylvania congressional maps are effective this election cycle the rights the state Supreme Court had to intervene to get us fair districts somewhere so badly gerrymandered districts formed pictures look at the old seventh congressional district\nThankfully the new districts are enforced for twenty Eighteen in some of them say that the seventh congressional district in Pennsylvania looks like goofy and Donald Duck facing one another's seriously at Google it speaking of which Maurice tweeted gerrymandering has transcended the political realm and infiltrated the fashion world\nHe said just a link to a website called gerrymander jewelry dot com\nThis is they say gerrymandered jewelry has all these pictures sticks in fact of voting districts the north Carolina's sixth district Texas is thirty fifth district's Louisiana fixed Florida fourth Michigan fourteenth and Ohio's first district and they're telling them as jewelry a\nHundred and Ninety five dollars each but the proceeds benefit of political action group is trying to get more Democratic governors secretaries of state and attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states we got a lot of comments to read about\nThe role of Republicans in gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current map it's gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to stem their losses\nIt's fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantage but what what what do we know\nThe Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and the ... the Democrats came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates back in twenty Seventeen the way originally elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered\nCongressional district lines in Virginia a but but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which is sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives\nBut that those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the there's no party is blameless in this uh gerrymandering started we get the word\nFrom a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts I'm back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal at members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those do exist today\nOr to win all the districts around it\nOr the a newspaper ... in in Boston\nTook a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he was a gerrymander some ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the beginning of the republic\nUm you could argue that some of this happened back in in a female and democracy back in you know\nFive hundred BC uh but when we talked about today yeah both parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south\nThat were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters\nAre and now even today we see some challenges to district lines drawn by Democrats especially in the state of Maryland\nUh there's one district to out in western Maryland they used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the lines and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes both parties do this Republicans have done it a more publicly lately and so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about\nA fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the winds aren't fair and therefore are probably the ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish the facts\nIf you will we do get comments from folks on both sides of the all complaining about how both sides of the aisle tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the G O P is going nuts in Colorado over ballot initiatives to redistricting by a nonpartisan commission\nSlowed the tweeted I Wish this was such a hot topic back when Democrats in my state had districts in the shape of a pencil\nJoanne wrote on our Facebook page\nRedistricting reform has been an issue for several years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court with a majority appointed by Republican governors that approved by the Republican legislators nothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislative branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership than killed by Republican chairman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and face so publicly\n... he I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political but not partisan can you give me a sense of some of the conversations you've had\nWith folks are that you've been witness to a folks kind of talking across the aisle about this does this feel practically to you on the ground like a unifying issue\nYeah my experience has been that um I mean in Michigan that we have had Democrats and Republicans control the line drawn process that maybe that helps but\nWe have volunteers or a Democrat Republican independent and I think that what we're seeing is that no matter which party is in charge in Michigan they're really common sense things\nThat we all looked to government ... at least help provide basic things like clean water or roads that aren't falling apart um those things aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know we are also a Detroit is pretty gerrymandered they try and pack\nA lot of these races are happening in the primaries and we don't really have competitive elections at the statewide level of Michigan we're a lot of people talking about even if they're the official that it there I'm representative at the party they leg they're much more extreme than what they would like to see\nAnd so I think that in Michigan in particular people have just had enough we feel like our government's doing a lot of overreach and want to help restore some transparency in the system especially for consistently ranked one of the least transparent states when it comes to transparency in government\nUm and that's the biggest thing we heard while you're doing those town hall with a lot of people saying you know I don't know why these lines are being drawn than eight years later some email ... coming out a talking directly about how the lines were drawn to guarantee one party an advantage or another\nAnd people are tired of it they want to be looked at as having our politicians accountable to us than not special interests um what's\nBeen really cool to is that you see a lot of families who have joined voters not politicians to volunteer together even for my family it did work I'm happy that Thanksgiving dinner or not but I'm we yeah yeah I've got five hundred signatures and its canvassing every day we got thirty days till the election so\nIt's been really exciting I mean you see a lot of people who are like you know there's nothing that we agree on but I really like\nWorking on this issue because the basic concepts of fairness and an impartial system and it just ended up put the people first I think that there's some of our core democratic values that when you think about America", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Middletown", "day": "08"}
