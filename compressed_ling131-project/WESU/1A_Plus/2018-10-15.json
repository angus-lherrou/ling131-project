A. M. U. dot org let's talk a little bit about your record it hug be Sean Clark wrote on our website the one eight dot org what can one said holy on Castro actually did while at HUD how'd they eat distinguish himself\nNow thanks for the question we had the most groundbreaking progress when it came to fair housing during my tenure and hug you know for years decades um\nHad different democratic administrations have been trying to get done something called the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule essentially this was part of the Nineteen sixty eight fair housing act um that said the secretary of HUD had the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing\nThe problem was that that had never been put into a rule on so in twenty Fifteen we actually came out with this rule which put teeth into the fair housing act by requiring cities that got\nA hug money basically taxpayer money to get more serious about ensuring they had equal housing opportunity\nIn their community and I'm very proud of it ah unfortunately that's one of the things that's been rolled back um through a secretary Carson and the Trump Administration a second thing that we do that I was just fantastic for the folks who are able to benefit from it was something called connect home um\nThe vast majority of people living in public housing don't have access to the Internet at home and we know that you're having Internet access at home today is not a luxury anymore it's a necessity\nA a a public private partnership with Internet service providers housing authorities nonprofits to expand to extend broadband access to families living in public housing\nDean tweeted as past secretary of HUD what do you feel is the best way forward for affordable housing and how is how you doing on this now\nWell I Wish I could say have more confidence in the direction of HUD right now um I think what you have over there is a whole bunch of\n'em a career employees that are dedicated to the mission that are trying to do the right thing but a political leadership that is not dedicated to the mission that wants to blame people for being poor you know secretary bankcard yeah which I completely disagree with I think they've taken into the wrong direction\nI'm the best thing that can be done is is number one to invest the resources\nTo create more housing that as a four to ... to the middle class and then of course to low income individuals ah and\nUp and down the line from the ... the federal level state level and local level to do that and then also to work with the private sector in important ways for instance at the local level to figure out a zoning codes and planning codes to make affordable housing more develop a bubble\nYou spent some time in Iowa you were in Des Moines last week supporting Democrats there who are running for office and we know that President Trump's trade policies toward China are really hitting some farmers in Iowa pretty hard last month I was agriculture secretary might nags spoke to CNBC about what impact that that's having at home\nIt as we head into the twenty eighth taint harvest season for corn and soybean out here in Iowa that as a ... of the trade conflict really couldn't come at a worse time so it is impacting our markets and that impacting our farmers so ah are farmers to understand that there are issues that need to be resolved particularly what China\nAre but there is no doubt that the ...\nIn Iowa speaking to CNBC\nI Wonder if you've been hearing what you've been hearing rather from farmers and pork producers and others in agriculture as you're making trips to Iowa and and elsewhere are are some of them okay what's the current state of relations the U.S China they understand what President Trump is trying to do and agree do they tend to be more posed what are you hearing\nHere a lot of concern a lot of worry and ah folks are also wondering what's the plan here uh you know I think a lot of folks are can believe that we can improve our trade relationship with China\nBut they think the president has gone about it are completely the wrong way in this go it alone style very radically starting a trade war that is going to hurt Iowa farmers they're also disappointed in their representatives are folks like Steve King right now that they felt feel have sat idly by a while the president has done this\nOr David Young is another good example out there and so I heard a disappointment\nWith the leadership of of uh some of those Republican congressional representatives and also tremendous concern because President Trump is so erratic when it comes to China\nNow my neck has spoken positively about the newly renegotiated NAFTA agreements between Mexico and Canada what about the trade deals that the president has been making in his time thus far particularly if to become president and twenty twenty and have to enter office with these deals as a starting point\nWe should always begin I'm from the premise that we want to ensure that our trade deals are good for American workers\nAh we also want to ensure of course that American companies who are engaged in trade are are treated fairly and uh that we don't get taken advantage of and so I don't I don't think folks disagree with that I think what folks disagree with is how erratic\nThe three the signing of NAFTA and we know that there are states that have benefited more than others from NAFTA\nOne of the challenges for this president and the next president is to strike trade deals that can benefit as much of the United states as possible we've seen uh some of the benefits of of trade deals in San Antonio we've had additional investment\nUh from auto manufacturing a to a number of on to other industries certainly along the border of Texas logistics warehousing I'm so Texas probably has been the biggest beneficiary of that\nWe always need to look at our trade deals from my perspective the American worker and how they can benefit\nSo what do you say to workers though who understand where President Trump is coming from who say\nYou know I I appreciate the value of trade but I see what's happened in my town how many factories have closed how many jobs have been lost I see immigration increasing in the U.S [noise] it just feels as an American like the rest of the world is siphoning off the\nBest of trade and leaving people like me to kind of scoop up the drags and hopefully cobble life together what do you say that those folks in terms of the future of trade here [noise] uh what I say is that number one I'm you know we need to make\nThe investments so that folks can be successful in the twenty first century global economy um we have to be smart because I Do think we can improve the trade deals these relationships at the same time uh we're far past the point where the United states is just going to close its doors and not be part of a global trade relationship\nUm so the question becomes how do we ensure that you and your family are well positioned to thrive in this twenty first century global economy\nMe one example of one of those investments you would start working on day one no I I Would\nCommunities understanding the assets of each of those communities um your water the skills that we can invest in in folks who live in those communities what are the industries that may not be located there now that we can actively along with the private sector work on getting their\n... and then how does that relate to to each of these trade deals and the thing is that uh what's missing from the Trump Administration is any kind of\nA thoughtful\nPlan on these things in fact even with this latest a rebuke of NAFTA it seemed like they were rushing right through the finish line and just cobbled together whatever they could get at the end or it none of these things seem to have a plan behind\nA significant part of your story is obviously an immigrant story so I Want to ask you about immigration policy particularly because of the significant enthusiasm that Trump supporters have for his stance on immigration even if not on all of his policies you right in the book\nAbout the difficulties you and other Latino families experienced kind of struggling families you worked with poor Americans homeless Americans while you were HUD secretary give me a sense of what\n\n\nSupport

I don't want to hurt jobs\nTell everybody what's at stake here you know they\nSaid well there's a lot of ... there's a lot at stake and\nMaybe especially so because this man was a reporter\nIs something you'll be surprised me say that there's something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're going to have this nice we're going to get to the bottom of it and then we'll be severe punishment\nPresident Trump speaking to Leslie stall in an interview that aired last night on sixty minutes Sarah what do you make of that\n[noise] um well I think it's definitely an indication that President Trump is trying to appear to be taking this more seriously\nUh initially I think uh he and others were hoping they could sweep this under the rug with a lot of ifs than I'm Still here here the if then language a in a President Trump's remarks but there's also\nA promise of a severe punishment um which is interesting and important\nI think the other piece of this that is distressing and interesting is that while every single American administration has sold weapons to a tyrannical abusive governments are like Saudi Arabia\nUm there was also a little bit of embarrassment about it it was something that a weapon\n... I think President Trump is the first president that is just clearly make at least saying I'm that well this is about dollars and it doesn't really matter what the other side does we're never going to sacrifice her dollars for it I'm ... and I think it's it's\nMaybe it's a good thing to expose the harsh reality of of what us arms sales are really all about 'em but I think it will also make people very very uncomfortable\nTo recognize that it's a value free transaction that that the U.S government the purports to stand for certain values actually doesn't care about them if it means a enriching blockades in the ... of this world\nYou're let's clarify what some of the luxury\nThough of it being about defense if you will and not dollars during the Cold War period and that is gone so it is more um ... dollars I'm under not just Trump\nYou know I I Do want to ask you about those dollars themselves we got one listener who wrote on our website the one who dot org please discuss this one hundred ten billion dollars how much is really contracted and over how many years how much is just letters intent carrying we've been hearing about the hundred and ten billion dollar deal do we know what the substance of that really is\nWill that is what the president announced when he visited Saudi Arabia in June of twenty Seventeen even then and I'm not the leading expert on this by any means but even then\nMany people said some of that is already sold some of that is still not contracted so this is a kind of mystical aspirational promise number as opposed to the checks in the mail\nIn ... in essence most of that is still on the calm this is not um [noise] money that the Saudis have paid um it is true that every time Trump says ... you know have got to pay their way I mean we\nWe are not unlike we are with NATO allies were not funding Saudi Arabia's a defense or we they do pay by buying American arms so\nI'm Trump is uh his desire to sell them more ah and get jobs is perhaps understandable if you're an American president\nW.

of it just political theater I mean how's this going to end\nWell a ... page is a he was sort of Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump he uh he was the loud and and bombastic candidates in

in foreign uh now he is refusing to follow the will of the voters um Medicaid expansion will happen in Maine at some point Paula pages turn out this year\nOr the Democratic candidate is leading and in

representative Ryan Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island and I'm In my thirtieth year as a state representative\nSo earlier this year representative Kennedy had this sinus infection a mild infection his doctor prescribed an antibiotic Kennedy went to a pharmacist that he'd known for a long time and the pharmacist told him that he paid the retail price of the ... paid the retail price of the drug and didn't pay with his insurance he would pay less\nWhen I went to my local pharmacist he told me I I Can't tell you that\nThere might be another option for you that other option would have been not to use my co pay because the cost of the of the pills was so low it would have been cheaper for me to pay those out of pocket\nRepresentative Kennedy learned that the pharmacy had a contract with a company called a pharmacy benefit management company it handled its drug insurance plan that ... that prohibited the pharmacist from discussing this with customers\nKennedy and for their democratic state lawmakers decided to introduce legislation that would ban the so called gag clauses and the bill had not passed\nWe wanted to make sure that\nRhode Island does have that opportunity to speak one on one with the air with the pharmacist in and learn what their their pricing options are because of that is consistently one of the big complaint so we hear from our constituents on a on a regular basis as how expensive drug costs have become\nSo Scott Greenberg or we heard from representative Kennedy about what's going on in Rhode Island how common are laws like the one that he's pushing ... how many states have passed laws like this will be these gag\nOr clauses are are pretty common and ah last year there were ah\nJust recently President Trump signed a bill outlawing these um gag clauses this was kind of low hanging fruit though of a\nOf a drug the drug price issue a I don't think anyone like these gag clauses but ah\nYeah that that will the let federal legislation and the state bills won't change the fact that many many people struggled to pay for the prescriptions they need and um it's a very complicated issue and there are many states are taking other other steps to try to rein in prices\nSince you mentioned the president he signed two bills last week as you noted that were designed to lift these guy clauses on prescription drug prices here is part of what the president said\nIt's the no the lowest price act of two thousand Eighteen and the patient right to know drug prices that and uh\nObviously based in the name you can tell that this gives people knowledge as to prices have different locations where to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact to a\nSchool the law of supply and demand pretty simple but we didn't have that they didn't want to have that a lot of people didn't want to have that but now we have it and it's going to really drive prices\nScott back up to the the bills that various states have signed on this California signed a few bills into law in this a few weeks ago governor Jerry Brown signed them and these are considered among the strongest of these laws in the country what do they do\nWell I think the what a lot of states are doing in California or as is often the case with this kind of progressive legislation is and that is in the lead on this on California is trying to reduce drug prices through transparency in other words they are\nAre requiring um uh the drug companies to be public about a price in Christie's increases beyond a certain point and the idea\nIs that uh if these are made public that they'll sort of be shamed into into reverse in some of these increases it's still too early to say though whether this is going to have the desired effect\nMore state um Connecticut Maine New Hampshire Oregon and Vermont all passed a drug pricing laws that are similar\nTo California so we'll see whether transparency has enough to\nReduce prices and then in addition to that um some states have tried to go even even further than that Massachusetts passed a bill that would've allowed a its Medicaid program to excludes some drugs from the a formula or the the um [noise]\nUh the group of drugs that are available to Medicaid recipients and the idea was that this would give them some leverage when negotiating with a drug companies over prices if they were able to exclude some FDA approved drugs and and as of right now Medicaid state Medicaid program south include all\nFDA approved drugs and their formula Larry the idea was that if they were able to exclude drugs that would give them leverage in negotiating on prices but uh the federal government shutdown that that effort by Massachusetts\nI Want to make or understand the argument for Massachusetts what they were trying to do any damage to the federal government shut that down semesters does not do this now are now for an hour an hour now but the ... it sounds like you're saying the argument is you know find Massachusetts and you know Julius the drug company I could say hey Julie this medication that we know is FDA approved is still too expensive\nAnd we're not going to just pay blanket leave for a medication we think it's too expensive so you have to keep negotiating or we're not going to we're not going to honor that part of the\nThat's right I mean interestingly enough in this uh uh the federal government though it rejected a mass at the Massachusetts effort\nA President Trump has proposed\nThat there'd be a pilot program where five states would be able to um to do this what Massachusetts wants to do and in addition to change the way that a Medicaid works with regard to drug prices and allow these five pilots states to negotiate directly with drug makers rather than um

employee unions have been in the spotlight this year with teachers' strikes this spring and the Supreme Court decision this summer that affects collective bargaining\nHow is the labor movement doing in your state perhaps there are laws where you live that prevent people from organizing for better wages or working conditions or benefits tell us what's going on where you are leaving the voicemail eight five five\nTo three six one a one day we also know there are thousands of hotel workers on strike across the country\nHave you benefited from union membership or perhaps do you think that unions have too much power in your state\nTell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a or you can leave us a radio quality audio files through our app won a vox pop our series the state we're in continues next Monday on one day\nBack now to our conversation with read Wilson Julie Rovner and Scott Greenberg are still time to get in a few more of your questions and thoughts about state health care policy where you live one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nJulie let's get to that question from month in law who tweeted isn't part of the reason Medicaid expansion didn't get as good support\nIs that it wasn't available as quote unquote GAP insurance\nProblem and the lower income people of those have a particular\nLarge problem if you have many thousands of dollars in deductibles that you have to pay before your insurance kicks and there are a couple of small demonstration programs where Medicaid has been able to ah basically fill in with employer insurance but generally Medicaid as sort of an all or nothing proposition you're either on Medicaid or you're off\nThe way they Affordable Care act was created with those people up two hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get 'em medicated people between a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty and two hundred and fifty percent of poverty get special discounts they don't have those big deductible so it it and then over two hundred and fifty percent of poverty then you're sort of on your own\nI'm In Arkansas I might point out though another we've been talking about a lot of different program that they instituted was to help people who often who were right at that margin we're constantly shifting back and forth between medicate and private plans and basically what they would do it the state was allowed to basically buy them into the private plans that they wouldn't have to keep changing\nWhere two weeks sidebar for just a second let me to the point of this series is to talk about what states we're doing on big issues healthcare is a very big one it's one of the very first things that Donald Trump said he was going to act on when he became president repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act AK Obamacare\nThere are some people who feel like health care should be a national matter that every human being in the United states of America should have equally good plan was simple set of healthcare costs and there are other Americans we believe it should be left up to the states that every state has different kinds of needs and different issues and their needs to be for security\nAre we any closer to one side of this argument winning or is the state federal split just kind of baked into the nature of this country like where is this where is this going\nActually it's where it's going it's back to where it was before the Affordable CARE Act what we're finding from all these sort of small incremental changes that the Trump Administration has done is that the the Affordable Care act within ...\nIt's a matter of regulation of health care they always have the federal government has always been sort of the the junior partner to the gate um but it had gotten so touched a patchwork that it made huge differences which state you live to and what kind of healthcare you were able to get to the Affordable CARE Act with trying to say\nThere's a floor beneath which people won't fall that is slowly being chipped away and we're going sort of every month looking more and more like we did in two thousand nine before the Affordable CARE Act passed Scott do you get the sense of this means that the effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is kind of succeeding than it is taking us back to where we were beforehand well\nJulie said it is in some states but in states that want to go in a different direction again California Massachusetts states like that\nThey are re instituting some of the uh parts of the Affordable CARE Act that the Trump Administration has and the Republican Congress have tried to undercut so for example a on the individual mandate the requirement that you have insurance um\nSo called association health plans which are these cheaper plans that do not a ... offer all of the benefits that were mandated under the AC a some states are saying well whatever they are joined the federal level um insurance is regulated or at the state level and if you're going to sell insurance and our state you are going to abide by these rules\nI'll tell you one issue read that states and many people have been hoping the federal government will act on it states kind of moved on anyway MS dealing with medical marijuana it's on the ballot in some states again this year about twenty two states have already legalized pot for medical use some of legalized for recreational use\nVoters in Utah will choose whether to join the states are not the end the political battlegrounds seems to have shifted and I want to read if you see it this way for more traditionally liberal states into more conservative areas overtime\nAnd it's not just the medical or that has gone that way but also legalization of recreational marijuana the two states where a legalization is going to be on about this here as in Michigan in North Dakota\nMissouri which is nice and confusing for the voters out there to try to figure out\nWhich is which are and then that Utah is as you say on the ballot Oklahoma already approved it this year so yeah we're we're not talking about the liberal coastal elites that are legalizing marijuana ah we're talking about a red America that is now dealing with this debate or it came up and you know in Florida last year and\nLast year two years ago but this is this is now a debate that I think it shows the shift in the political conversation around marijuana those sorts of people who approve of a marijuana legalization tend to be a older white males funny enough\nAnd then the millennial generation that the younger the basically the younger you are the more in favor of\nA legalization you happen to be um the older white males the theory is that's the that's the sort of libertarian streak or they don't want the government regulating something that they don't think the government has a hand in regulating and the real swing voters or perhaps not surprisingly come down to suburban women\nAre in talking to the people who run campaigns for and against marijuana legalization or basically the battleground is mothers who are worried that their kids are going to be exposed to marijuana\nSo you get the proponents are talking about the law enforcement to ability and and the fact that not that this will not expand the market into younger people who will have that have access to recreational marijuana and then you've got the opponents who say exactly the opposite that legalization will in fact\nUh begin to rope in a bunch of kids why are there three items in Missouri so they're all on the ballot from different ah proponents different sides of it with two of them are from a actual citizen groups that that puts them on about those are amendment to an amendment three and then there's a proposition which if crime is wrong I think the proposition\nGoes on the ballot from the state legislatures that's going to be some kind of\nCompromise or a piece that's propositions see 'em and they are all sort of competing with each other\nThe states that have legalized Colorado Washington Oregon a California Nevada Alaska or Massachusetts and Maine\nAre the people who are setting up a ... who get to write these laws also essentially get to determine\nWho's in the market um and who owns a very lucrative space one of the biggest opponents of recreational legalization in a bunch of early states where the people who ran medical marijuana shops because they already have the monopoly right why dilute the monopoly with other people\nI should know by the way we did a program this year about state laws on marijuana and the business of pie you can find that on line at the one a dot org\nScott a couple of things to add to what to read said on this very interesting issue um at one is that it's sort of intersects with what we talked about earlier the opioid crisis because there are many people\nAre supporters of medical marijuana who argue that this is a viable alternative to uh to opioids for people who have chronic pain and then also I think we've written about this um it's interesting that social justice provisions are finding their way into\nMarijuana bills or this idea that a a minority communities or had been the most impacted by the war on drugs and therefore uh as we move towards legalization that makes sense to include in these bills provisions that a\n... on the one hand would allow people to uh to expunged they're a criminal records for small amounts of marijuana but also\nSome of these bills are calling for investment in these communities that we're most impacted and and also as I read said it's a big business a step up for for people who were members of these communities so they can get into this very lucrative business", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "15"}
