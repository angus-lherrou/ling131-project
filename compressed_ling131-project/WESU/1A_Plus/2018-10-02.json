guest let me get to some of your stories in comments one member of the one a text club who calls herself simply scared wrote\nI'm twenty eight and afraid of the dark it's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr Ford's testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it the thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us who are silently coping\nBy the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you're more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids at a time when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the word ... the number one letter a dot org [noise]\nWhat's that another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board\nThen it's emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote I never felt compelled to share my story before because of this so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worst unquote an unremarkable what made you think of what you've been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\nYou know for years are my friends and I have been\nAnd colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trip abroad of of ours sexual assault of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know\nAs a journalist too I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring Dr Ford's testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain that they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to to stay silent\nAbout my own experience can you share with others to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think um we both had and been interested in learning other and\nWe drink a lot I was Twenty years old at the time um and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nUm you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to 'em and was very painful and I\nAsked him to stop and and he eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly I'm you know I think ... frankly is probably too drunk to got to know what was going on is what what I thought at the time and you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nLast week professor Conan the Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor forward what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh of having done to her as a teenager here is part of what professor fortune\nIndelible in the hippocampus is the laughter a lot of free laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun\nAt my expense\nProfessor can you explain for us from a neurological perspective what is the certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the hippocampus foods and what it does\n[noise] um they hit the campus is a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise] doctor forward in her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's gonna die or that he's going to kill her and the human\nBecause fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away you when people who can encode that ... that fear that lion and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on\nThe brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the Muzak or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that I'm even just hearing her talk about it really makes my heart clutch you know it's really emotional\nUm but for get other details like uh the house you were in or the neighborhood or the street um those aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is a brain operate\nThe kind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way you described it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie you know you walk in drawing and how you forget all the decor was that thing that leaked out at you the kind of forced your adrenalin to rise that wouldn't codes that I Would have great example yes\nNo more you said that a moment oatmeal Lauren Lauren Taylor these moments been code so intensely are there are ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or did you just kind of have to deal with\nThose things kind of trigger those images that are super vivid how do you work through the or ten there are many many ways to work through those I'm\nTalking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or us a community support group or an ... a an informal group of friends can be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful um what we do in our empowerment self defense classes\nPhysical power a talk therapy can accomplished a certain amount but um as professor Conan will tell you\nThat trauma also lives in the cells of your body and um you need to have some kind of so magic\nUm release of that and so mad at basically means DOMA is bodies so um we we do role plays of practicing standing up for yourself or asking for what you want and we also do hitting\nAnd um that can be that can really move the trauma through an out your body you're not only reclaiming your power but your author releasing whatever you've been through\nLead to a few more of your stories Jennifer emailed my story involves a sexual predator who happened to be my boss ultimately I was raped on a business trip to get away I had to move to another state and begin my career again the cascade of consequences for each woman like me goes on for decades\nShe emailed I'm Seventy two I told my

Marvin Gaye and Harvard University's terrorist and Conan we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one more that came into\nMy name is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year that I was able to acknowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth which she weighs thirty six years and it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why\nIt doesn't matter that we were victims when we are raped we feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves\nLet alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rate that left obvious marks it's easy to pretend it never happened and emotionally it feels like the right thing to do\nBecause you're so scared and so hurt and so is Shay\nThanks very much for sharing your story with a smart gate I'd love to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment that comes after\nSo I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my fault or it was one of the things that many that that I dealt with but I have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nUm you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before\nI was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown and social research or you know that he's shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame needs secrecy to survive\nI'm an oath huge part of the reason that I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore or that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame\nAnd so in telling my story you know I I was I feel huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that I'm into the public arena where I Believe that belongs 'em and no longer hold on to that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend or family member but\nHearing from them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it's knowing how many of the people I Love and care about and know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around\nAnd that uh I guess for me that's where who I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experiences as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching\nInjustice and that that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from\nLauren I just wanted to um\nThat speak to what this what lives shared about her experience there are very\nHonorable powerful reasons not to tell I Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone who feels unable to tell or who make that choice not to tell\n'em that it can be internal reasons like live shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job um but they are all very real at at the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\nWe have more control over our own experiences and how we shape them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\nSarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college were sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and he gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend\nOn top of me still inside me I never thought of him that way never consented and barely had the strength to get him off of me when I tried to tell people what happened I was called a whore\nLucky because my rapist was apparently attractive to others and I was called a complainer\nAnd people wonder why survivors don't come forward\nPat emailed when I was Thirteen Years old a podiatrist began molesting me he was thirty one he told my mom he had some work I could do for him if you check patients in nursing homes he took me to pornographic movie theater\nAlmost two years [noise] more let me speak with you for just a moment I Would love to get your reaction to a clip from White House advisor Kellyanne Conway who spoke to this weekend about her own experiences with being assaulted listen\nI feel very empathetic frankly for ... an actual assault sexual harassment\nAnd rate that [noise]\nI ... I don't expect and judge Kavanaugh or Jake Tapper or Jeff Flake or anybody can be held responsible for that accountable for their own kind that\nThat was Kellyanne Conway speaking to Jake Tapper on CNN learn what do you make it become\nWell first of all\nI'm Glad she came out as a survivor um you could feel the emotion in her voice with it's a sign of Kellyanne Conway we none of us have ever seen before um but she seems to put the blame entirely on herself being responsible for your own conduct when we know that\nThe\nAggressor is the only person responsible for the harassment abuse or assault you can for where anything you want you can get his drunk as you want if there is not a rapist there you will not be raped I'm I'm Sorry that that she's\nCarrying that and it's a really common thing that a lot of people carry\nCarlos wrote on our Facebook page I Am a fifty year old male survivor of sexual assault\nBy a man who was my mother's boyfriend at the time to this day and it's difficult for me to trust any man aside from my brothers because of his I rarely hug anyone and I'm extremely protective of my daughters professor Conan would you react to that I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of how\nThis might be playing out differently from male survivors of trauma versus women who have been trust\nMen are also victims of sexual abuse and assaults um and that the effects on them I'm of developing anxiety phobia pie TST are similar to that that women experience after being assaulted\nAnd I think for men who are victims of sexual assault if it's possible there's more stigma there's even more stigma in terms of being able to come out\nUm and um be hurt 'em so I so in terms of how this is playing out I Wonder how men are feeling in term of do they feel can they identify with Dr Ford or would they feel like their experiences are being neglected um I think if more men um\nTo listen to the drive but five Monday through friday at five or five and ... to be educated but [noise]\n\n\nThey said there are no dumb questions Neil DeGrasse Tyson says that's true and he's answering your questions about first space and war [noise]\nFrom W.

at the rose Center for earth and space in New York He's also the co author of the new book accessory to war the unspoken alliance between astrophysics and the military coauthored was obvious Lange a research associate at hate him and he joins us now from New York Neil DeGrasse Tyson welcome to weigh\nYour thanks for having me and even pronounce my co authors and incorrectly she's obviously going fantastic very good credit to our producer Amanda Williams forgetting outs are right we like getting the facts on this program and we'd like to get you some of the facts of I'm really facts yeah if you care about facts [laughter] seems on cornered the market for you'll stick with it\nAnd we don't go for you know and if you'd like to get some of the facts about space and science for astrophysics and its relationship to the military now as it gets\nStart with the book this alliance between astrophysics and the military and give us a sense of what that is in a nutshell and why it is as the title of your book suggest so unspoken\nYeah so so we already are familiar with the role that other scientists have played in warfare especially engineering you know somebody had to invent the catapult when that was first showed up on the battlefield what an asymmetric weapon that would have been a symmetric in the military sense where\nYour opponent has something that you don't have and you're in deep trouble because of that difference\nAnd so that they call that an asymmetric advantage so engineers definitely and if you look at the new book of of Leonardo da Vinci where yeah he did art but he also was a master mind that sort of military machines that could lay waste to your army\nSo and we know him as one of the greatest combinations of a scientist engineer and an artist but moving forward you think of the physicist as the person who builds the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know the camera is you know would make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they were you know flood the field with mustard gas at the biologist might weaponized anthrax for example the astrophysicist ... ... you may know such association\nBecause we just humbly sit at mountaintops and wait for photons to arrive from across the galaxy\nAnd then we carefully take the detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw\nSo that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics in the military it just never shows up\nBut in fact astrophysicist and then the earlier days are stronger MERS had been fundamental to the growth of empires and the Gemini of nations in particular\nIn my professional ancestors no new the night sky\nAnd to to know the night sky and on any level is to give you better advantage for navigating earth's surface\nBecause this guy what's different depending on where you are on earth and things rise at different times and sat in different places\nAnd so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where we're the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established and there's no end of examples where this kind of information was exploited for the game of the nation who had control over it\nI should know we didn't have a conversation on this program for those of you who are more interested in this connection between science and the military\nAbout the origins of chemical weapons during World War one a good bit of that heritage traces right back here to American University which is the institution that owns WAMC which produces one egg you can find that conversation on line at the one eight dot org\nNew President Trump announced the creation of a space for the summer sticks to branch of the military to focus on the militarization of space of I guess it will be a fifth tranche since the coast guard is technically part of the ... which is also the topic of your book\nGive us a sense of topic within their who is a topic of the book give us a sense of what this space force would need to do have accomplish of bullied to be in the best interest of the American people and humanity\nSo first of all just to to the space of course there's not a new concept and it it surely been around even before I remembered mentioning it in two thousand and one in a commission I served on\nA authorized by the White House to study the future of the u._s. aerospace industry which at the time was had fallen they've fallen on hard times I lost a half a million jobs that his consolidation in the industry there's competition from Europe\nYou know jets so there was a concern that well what happens if we lose this industry the what impact would that have on our security on our transportation on our commerce\nYou order something from Amazon it's on your steps the next morning some airplane delivered it they're right or at least to the nearest airport [laughter]\nThat doorstep delivery by a airborne craft is still to come but\nWe would call them drones I guess but so so you you ... when you\nLook at this problem you say All right uh what are you going to do about it and I said well\nMight we separate the concerns of the air with the concerns of space because these are the same companies aerospace companies that that became a word right\nAnd if you separated out in the military you would then sort of tidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm at the time on this commission there was a four star air force general\nAnd the air force then and now controls space activities that the military it's called the U.S air force space command and they said we think we got this we don't really need a space where it's separate from what's already happening so I wasn't going to second guess the general but I was intrigued by that confidence that he had\nFast forward to today on the Trump announcement at as well as the pants follow on announcement\nI it if you just listened to it it sounded very very slow to macho look how big my biceps is as I speak\nThat was very we don't want to just be there we want to we don't wanna just leave we want to dominate you know there's a lot of this kind of language and that's the book many people typically sort of peace next out there who say oh my gosh what will just mean\nDo you think of that ad thing though I mean if the U.S has supremacy Gemini over space our aims you know as a weapon\nIf that exactly the same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear\nThe future of what could happen if you quote militarized space and so I was really represent rhetoric not reality reality is a space for us what would that mean you would just take all the space activities that are already happening under the air force\nAnd slide them out under one umbrella one sort of coherent umbrella\nAnd if you're going to do that uh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense right why don't you you know put that in your portfolio while you're at it\nThat could be quite devastating to any place on earth where a bad asteroid strikes and then the limit it could render us all extinct\nAs one did sixty five million years ago with the dinosaurs and Seventy percent of all species of life on earth at the time and that asteroid was only six miles across an earth is huge relative to that it's a matter of the energetic and what it does to the climate and the atmosphere\nAnd the long term survivor ability right of of of the by odor that requires the sunlight to feed it so so space horse\nWould might include I by the way I Would also throw in your clean up the debris it's up there while you're half the space debris problem but so so here's the distinction I Want to make which ... which I don't I haven't seen the press or the public recognize\nSpace it's very hard and not particularly strategic\nTo make space and act the repository of weaponry\nHolding aside the fact that that would violate a treaty to which we are signature and today more than a hundred countries have signed from Nineteen sixty seven that it's a peaceful use of outer space treaty has a much longer name that I always forget right but those are those are the that those are the essence words from the title and it's very beautiful treat it you feel like holding hands and singing\n[noise] here I mean he has few Middletown, Connecticut\n\nSupport for NPR chemist from this

for women in this political moment how angry are you right now\nTomorrow's conversation deals with a long history of anger expressed by women in America and what it's meant for the country what's your story have there been times when you chose not to get mad or maybe you grew up being told never to lose your cool\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one at a now if you have like rip or if you feel more empowered to let folks know exactly how you feel what differences that made\nTell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a can also use or app won a vox pop to send us a radio quality audio file will talk about women and this and other moments of anger tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Neil DeGrasse Tyson lots of good questions to get through let's see how many of these we can get through in the time that we have left\nEli wrote on our Facebook page that she's a big fan of yours Eli writes I have a job interview at Goddard today the God of space flight center do you have any suggestions on how I can slam dunk this thing it's my dream to be able to work at NASA\n[laughter] [noise] I think in this kind of in the world of of exploring the frontier or not only a strong resume matters but are inter personally enthusiasm ... I think really matters they want to know that you\nView that all that your whole body mind and soul is ready to be given onto this grand adventure that we're all part taking in in the exploration of space so I think if you convey that uh I don't know if it's a slam dunk but at least it's a um\nIt's a shot from inside the paint [laughter] want to stay in basketball analogy\nJay tweeted which do you think will happen first transplanting a human brain into a machine chassis I a robot body transplanting a human consciousness into a computer\nAh so first the human mind is really messed up we have a lot of evolutionary baggage that prevents us from making rational decisions as also we do some very beautiful things are art and music and the sort of thing to put a human brain into a robotic\nChassis um when you could program the robotic chassis to have almost anything you really care about I don't see that as as as a thing that people will do and the other option was what to put put a ... a consciousness I Love you I think that'll happen either\nYeah well we don't really know what consciousness is\nAn evidence of that is how many books are still written on it the evidence that usually you don't know what it is for example if you look on the shelf of of books on gravity there's like three books we got grabbing [laughter]\nWe're not still writing books on it so long as if the law you obey gravity [laughter] so um but it it sort of uploading all of your electro chemical impulses into some machine to mimic that\nTo mirror that maybe that comes along with consciousness we don't know but I see that happening long before we would take a brain and stick it in a in a machine by the way speaking of transplanting brain what I really want\nIs if we can't if we can't cure Alzheimer's and we can't cure a oh last at least find a way to transplant the brain of an Alzheimer's patient into the body of\nPerson out of that because one you you lose the body other you lose your your mind\nIs that this sounds very altered carbon you've been watching a lot of Netflix\nAmazon [laughter] very Frankenstein to ... I just don't if you had goals if you can't otherwise I I bet we'll find cures for both of those before we learn how to transplant of brain but I think about that all the time\nCertainly helps them certainly helps out on wants to know do you believe in aliens\nThat's not a matter of belief is there's there's no evidence for life off the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you you go to the ocean and you stick a class in and your scoop out some water and they analyze the water really carefully and say [noise]\nThey're no whales in the ocean [laughter]\nNow you haven't looked so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy and our search for life\nAre intelligent life uh for example uh um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard or or Mars and perhaps other places but anyone who studied the problem is\nIn no way doubt that strong likelihood that there's life elsewhere in the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with it\n[noise] Amy asked on our Facebook page will the human race cease to exist in the next thousand years based on the current environmental trends not considering a possible impact from an asteroid or other cosmic influence\nWe're pretty sure that nothing extinction level is headed our way that would take us out in the next thousand years and we know that because the more dangerous an asteroid is the bigger it is typically and the bigger it is the easier it is to detect\nSo so uh I I think we're good about that it's possible that a comic could come from out of nowhere because comments very long period comments they sort of show up you know you don't have history for them and one could come in and take us out or it would be\nAnd so I'm all for building protecting having insurance plan that\nYou put a little bit of money in for a to protect you against a devastating thing that it would be very rare so but uh otherwise we could easily go a thousand years if we become wise shepherds of our power\nAnd over nature and heed the warnings are scientists\nI Wonder how what what the over under is on that I tend to be\nFairly hopeful younger people seem to have a very different grasp of the value of the earth that this is the one home we have than many of their parents and and for bears and I kind of you know today's generation gives me hope for dealing with some of the problems that climate faces but what about you\nYeah I'm hopeful I'm realistically hopeful so but I'm I'm I'm ... I'm I'm cynically hopeful so here's how this word cynically hope yes so here so people don't act even when they're warned until it gets really bad and then they act\nSo all these this topic movies that show like look at Blade Runner right the woman ever get to that point this so this ... you know because we reach it or or or the toilet green no because you reach a point where people say no this is to this is\nThis I cannot tolerate any further on an eight people I don't want to eight people yeah so rare that a grid is too hot [laughter] [noise] right right do you\nSo you so we have restoring forces in the world that prevent swing too low in in this regard and these this topic story telling 'em it involves a trend that never stops and goes to rock bottom and I've ... I've seen people bounce back\nIt's society's bounce back ... people in power bounce back so how long you're going to deny\nAnd then you put the funds back in and so that's why I think we'll be okay\nJared submitted questions through our app won a vox pop you think that human beings are physically incapable of understanding the\nFundamental nature of the universe if not what the timeline to solving say something like\nDark matter the question Jared Neal\nIs so I think about that all the time I lose sleep on whether I mean it's slightly rephrase the question I lose sleep over whether the human mind is smart enough\nTo actually understand the universe as it is\nAnd I worry that we may not be smart enough to even who what question to ask and this disturbs me because we know who defines humans as intelligent way do we do yeah who's to say that that is sufficient intelligence to figure out how the universe works\nSo so uh now dark matter dark energy ... the advantage to being modern human is that we can we can stand on the shoulders of those who came before us you don't have to invent calculus to solve the next problem somebody else did\nSo in a way we're assembling wrong by wrong a ladder of knowledge that looks over every next wall that we have confronted\nAnd so we were so maybe the sum of all the intelligence of all humans", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "02"}
