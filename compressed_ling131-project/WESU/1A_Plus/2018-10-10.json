Michael\nBut we can't say that the American\nDirectly related to global warming but we can say is that the ... the ... the increasing as a result of global warming because we're all my atmosphere I had no energy can hold more water ... ...\n... says that they thought that the statement that whether it's ... or extreme rainfall all heat waves are increasing with three little bits of warming\nAnd don't feel like there is a unified voice out they're letting families no what concrete steps they can take to make a difference for our family this has led to ever present feelings of helplessness anxiety and guilt about the choices we make every day Sarah we will be talking about some concrete options and just a moment but let me get to a few more\nThoughts that have come in the far Joel emailed\nYou should stop framing this as what will politicians do politicians reflect the people that voted for them half the voters in the U.S read Donald Trump's tweet that global warming was a Chinese hope and voted for him anyway that just goes to show how important the issue as to the people in this country\nQuote unquote I Wonder if you could respond to Joel's email I mean the president has committed to taking us out of the Paris Agreement he kind of questions the provenance of the agreement by saying well who wrote it up let me see who wrote it now believe it does Joel have a point\n[noise] uh well in in terms of um ... policies being the policies that address climate change um the u._s. really isn't a\nA distinctive place right now I think I'm Around the rest of the world we do see an expression of will by leaders\nTo um enact policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions I think\nThat there's a lot of questions on how strong less policies actually are um you know the analysis shows that they're they're not strong enough to limit warming even to that that initial two degrees but they you in the U. S.\nUm what we see is President Trump not only you know essentially questioning that the basic established of of\nClimate change but but also moving to undo existing climate policies I'm President Trump had already moved forward with policies to undo regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants um undo\nIf they have to promote the use of coal burning coal is one of the leading contributors to greenhouse gas emissions a President Trump wants to promote the use of calling us and abroad um\nOne of the findings of this report is that in order to um limit greenhouse limit climate change to um\nYou know to to to the sort of least destructive um level of warming\nUm the use of coal will have to uh basically go down to zero\nI'm by by twenty fifty ... basically no more on just about no more coal and and and and it you know that that it that is an extremely disruptive policy recommendation um there's no question that there are industries and people who will be harmed\nWho who will have their livelihoods disrupted by policies um they go in that direction\nAnd in that let me just once I started to shore call but I I Wonder in terms of the politics behind this and I hear you on I I totally hear you on how disruptive offices don't like cold so\nInterwoven in the network of America's energy grits kind of hard to just yank it all out I Wonder though in terms of the voices on the world stage who\nWe we know that there are voices who were saying well coal it'd be really hard to pull out to get the sense that there's any one in the world stage saying tough our planet is only home you light pole tough we got to get rid of it deal with the phone ya or California so Jerry Brown the governor of California for sure\nAnd many of the ... on on the president of France has thought to kind of a step in and um\nHe he's trying to carve out a place for himself as as a as a leader on climate change it's it's not difficult for France to take that position because France um doesn't really use call 'em so\n[noise] in China it's very interesting because um China is the world's largest\nUm greenhouse gas polluter and is a massive user of coal at the same time we're off the the Chinese government has moved forward with I'm actually in acting um prices on carbon ah they're they're they're an acting a cap and trade system that would force\nUm carbon polluters called polluters to essentially pay attack or the um in in order to pollute which is designed to drive the market away from from greenhouse gases an idea that was invented in the United states but it's\nI'm considered sort of politically toxic here in China they can implement it by ... they don't have to deal with that Congress voting against at Iraq and then the United states\nI Do want to talk more about that idea of carbon taxes we continue in just a moment but let me get to a few more comments Brian emailed\nWe have no leaders anymore with the skills or courage to do what's right regardless of the political cost we will keep polluting as long as the price of fossil fuels is low would be interested to hear from some of you listening who you trust who you think some of the leaders are politically in this country around the world\nWho you believe arson here and there are pushed to do something significant about climate change their anybody that you think is for real and saying that we're going to make this happen or maybe if you were active with\nA politician or a government leader or a government agency that's doing something tangible that you feel people should know more about we love to hear from you what gives you hope\nThat climate change is something that is actively being worked on where you are email is one a at W.

times in University of Arizona professor dying of liver men we got a number of messages from you in terms of how you are trying to make an impact with the fight against climate change\nHere is a little mash up of two of the messages we got this is Amy from Chesapeake and Jeff in Michigan listen\nI'm getting a thought to slash ... thoughts last feeling of powerlessness um that I Can't do it enough to stop the path of destruction that we're on\nOur pessimism comes because I Believe that what's happening with the world\nShare about the environment it feels like we're kind of on the inevitable path um two thousand forty will be here before we know it and we will rip the consequences\nThanks Geoff an Emmy for sharing your thoughts with us ah speaking of the corporate path there are some corporations who are taking a position in the fight against climate change including with regards to the carbon tax Melissa tweeted\nChina uses more than twice as much coal as the U.S hard to believe some carbon tax is going to make much of a difference considering their population let's talk more about carbon taxes with one more of our guests joining us from London\nTed holstead is the chairman and CEO of the climate leadership council Ted welcome\nWant to a [noise] good to be with you ... what is the climate leadership council\nIt is a group a that is co founded by a white actually the brought us climate coalition in us history to back a national solution as pushing for a carbon tax where all the money is related to the American people in the form of ... of ... of a dividend\nWho were some of the back of the council where does the funding come from\nSo um the council is a does not accept corporate contributions but our founding members include four of the ah oil major is the largest car manufacturer in the United states the largest utility but also the largest\nA solar company in the United states\nA very broad coalition it also includes two leading environmental groups and opinion leaders from across the political spectrum ranging from\nBen Bernanke key to Janet Yellen to Larry Summers and of course our plan is named after former secretaries of state James Baker and George Schultz the\nBaker Schultz carbon defense plan but Joshua let me clarify we have there is a separate spin off organization that has a lobbying organization and that now has corporate funding including from it\nUh it is a separate organization that has the advocacy arm of the climate leadership council so the council develops this groundbreaking breaking plan were all sides wind and Americans for carbon dividends which was co chaired by\nFormer Republican Senate majority leader Trent Lott and uh uh sooner bro that group lobbies for this plan and it now has money from oil natural gas solar wind and nuclear power interests\nColder in Fort let's take a step back before we get into the plan that the climate leadership council was advocating more specifically defined this term carbon tax for what exactly is a carbon tax shores though um\n[noise] the idea of a carbon tax is um ... each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere um you can put a price on how much economic harm it causes\nI'm and I'm In ... and ... and important to note on that as the the economist who came up with with that idea his name is William North house he's a professor at Yale I'm was just awarded the Nobel Prize for this idea on Monday\nOr the same day that the IPC came out with this report which heavily sites I'm professor north houses work\nUm so he came up with the idea of every ton of carbon um traps heat in the atmosphere and you can put a price on how much each kind of carbon hurt\nA the global economy um and and there's a range for how much that costs that it it can range from um fifty dollars a time to a hundred dollars a time when I'm you know there there's there's debate about about how much\nUm actual harm it can cost but once you sort of place that price on carbon um than you are can essentially um\nThose upon polluters of carbon dioxide no no\nNo a carbon but it's going to be really clear in terms of who the taxes paid on I mean if I Am a car Baker do I pay the what we're talking with pollution from automobiles does the carmaker\nPay a carbon tax for producing the vehicle that belching out carbon dioxide or does the oil company pay the carbon tax for finding the gas alone that term lightly\nMost likely you pay at a as a car driver I'm looking\nAnd and and and you you would so um we don't have carbon taxes in the U. S. um so in some ways this this is sort of um\nYou know and intellectual debate although other countries are are working are sort of further along on this but the idea is\nUm if this would affect how you drive it would probably um be taxed based on how much carbon monoxide would be a produced by burning 'em by burning gasoline show it would most likely be added to the cost of the gasoline that you put in your car so if you're going to put in\nAnd it mounted gasoline in your car that would produce a certain amount of carbon dioxide when you burn it that would raise that tax would raise the price of your Kathleen and the idea is then you would be motivated\nTo buy a car that use less gasoline essentially that that's how it would drive the market so consumers would want to buy electric cars would want to buy efficient cars not because not out of some sort of\nA moral sensibility but because actually a ... a price on carbon would make it cheaper to use an electric car it's a it's a powerful market signal\nTo hosted the yesterday Exxon Mobil committed money to lobbying Congress for a price on carbon give us a sense of what the plant involved and why it's getting support now [noise] so um the bigger shields carbon defense plant is based on four pillars of the first\nContrary all of the money would go directly back to the American people in the form of a carbon dividend which means that the vast majority of American families including the most vulnerable would win economically from this plan\nAnd a third pillar is that we would trade a high price on carbon in a growing price on carbon for some of the carbon regulation simply because a carbon tax is a more cost effective way to solve climate change\nWho I just wanna make sure I understand so the plan if the plan went into effect there would be a tax on the carbon that I Am it with my car or my motorcycle or whatever and then that the revolution that tax would come back to me as a taxpayer in the form of a of a dividend is that what you called\nYes so a family of four would get approximately two thousand dollars per year\nIn dividends and here's how the system would work the more you pollute the more you pay the less you pollute the more you win so Seventy percent of American families would come out economically ahead and that's what's so transformative about the dividend concept which is that we can have\nThe most effective climate lever which is a carbon tax in a manner that is popular populist and equitable for the American people\nHow much of that money would be spent on environmental programs are planting forests or doing research on cleaner energy with all of it just come back to us as taxpayers\nA hundred percent would go back to the American people and that is what makes the plan\nA popular and politically viable because in cap on Capitol Hill you'll never get the two sides to agree on how to spend the revenue Republicans will say well let's spend on deficit reduction are lowering the corporate income tax Democrats will say well let's spend it on a renewable energy innovation or\nAnd what polling shows is that it's overwhelmingly popular most interesting there's three to one support among Republican voters and Trump supporters for this plan for the one support among millennials which of course or soon to be the largest voting cohort\nWeekday morning to stand on eighty eight point one double UPS you\n\nNeed is a classic love story one that Hollywood has told for decades\nWere audience is saying now that this star has been born for the fourth time\nFrom W.

you think of the movie\nHey well of course I loved it but I loved it for entertainment value but my big pieces that moment when he brought her onstage ... that was not her comfort zone knowing what she'd been told that she wasn't going to be good enough\nThat no one would care that now that find her interesting or attractive and she just went out and she killed it and they loved it and for that has second a seat that she realized they were wrong and everything they said to her that was a pretty important moment if you're someone who's been afraid to put yourself\nFor you in a way like was there something personal that that made you flash back to work out for a lay\nAbsolutely yeah I think you know I Do a lot of things where I have to go out in front of crowd or in front of people and you often hear you know you need to be dinner or project lower or beat this or that are younger\nAnd at that moment with kind of all of this it was kind of all of us will have that moment that we can personalize it whether it's your interview or what have you and I think that was an important or with\nHeather what'd you think about that whole storyline with her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her nose\nYeah [noise] yes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she's like this is my name is all me to take me as I Am and she worked at it\nYou know got tend to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and I thought it it kind of an ill\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's that Ali billboard and he says we should have just made the old billboard your nose\nI think the thing about the comments about our nose is also a guy guys\nBarbra Streisand [laughter] one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a exist and and thrive in Hollywood\nFar as coming on the music industry it absolutely is a powerful comment on the music industry as the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think that where this thing is placed in time where this movie is placed in time it's interesting to think about that because\nAlmost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's really no ...\nRecord by both having less power than they used to so it's almost like the old fashion and it's fear of the music industry but only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really tackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also chime in but by the way for those who have not seen star is born will not be seeing stars more which is kind of want to being on the conversation she\nTells Bradley Cooper character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are you saying well but your nose you know just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go\nInto homes I Wonder how you view that commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie I felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art\nI also thought about pink\nWho's very much and invention of pop music but who also have this kind of rye cynical filed style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in their found in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways is very linear at the very linear idea of they're the one\nI'm rose to fame there is one path you just simply a band or D than as opposed to there is no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have six staff you know a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like that he would go or movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming\nWith out kind of going through that traditional path so I agree with Anna about that but I think that\nFame ladder and I think you kinda have to construct it that way and what you're saying about Lady Gaga you know I'm the caller was talking about kind of being\nA alley the character talking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist's like Lady Gaga who has been so able\nTo make such an indelible mark on the industry and on popular culture I mean the funny thing about the movie it's way more important to culture than he is um if you're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see\nHer big personality taking advice from you know Bradley Cooper who's had a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd and that way\nYeah except for the voice in rocketing guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diversion but you're right I mean he is much more of like typical leading man actor I Wonder also John in terms of\nThe story line you know one of the big parts of the storyline is the love story and Bradley spend a lot of time sitting up that first time meeting here's a piece of that moment from star is born when they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga character Ali used just improvising elope saw\nHim on this thing\nTo me [noise]\n... [noise]\nAnd with the host Rachel Martin about his work and said this about working with Lady Gaga\nAnd then we went to the piano and sang and it was just kind of wonderful thing I couldn't believe it\nSo that was the beginning of the journey and the first time we've staying together I mean everything's alive we said we sing everything live in the movie wow you there's nothing we're not live thinking\nAnd I turned to Lady Gaga who's sitting next to me and she was looking at me like I was Jackson, Maine when any when you're in a scene in the actors fully believing that you're the character you can't not believe it yourself but she really gave me that confidence\nBradley Cooper speaking to Rachel Martin on NPR's MORNING EDITION John horn what did you make of the collaboration between Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga particularly how it came out in the way the love story played out\nThis is my big problem with the film and I think for a lot of people it's not an issue it was for me when her character an alley first meets jak he is a stumbling blackout drunk\nAnd I think it looks as if he's just spend a weekend at a bar do cabin or oh Kavanaugh KCUR and I don't find that interesting or attractive if she had met him sober and he fell into alcoholism and stayed with him it would be more interesting he's he's increasingly mean he has petty\nAnd I think as his alcoholism ... becomes words he continues to treat her worst and yes he's Bradley Cooper and yet he's is incredibly talented musician but I never really bought fully what alleys saw in him\nA matinee from eleven AM to one

listening in Indianapolis he Jean what did you think of a star is born\nEnergy and can you hear me yes I have a five stars which why five stars [noise] um\nActually I just loved everything about this I've actually seen the other versions and this one seem particularly well updated to today um I thought it was the the irony of her being discovered\nBecause he was a drunk and looking for a drink and their life being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was the continuing thing and one one thing I don't think other people have mentioned is the part that her agent\nI guess he was her agent uh the guy who made her over\nThe manager down agent played yeah what what is your main character I didn't like him and I I guess I wasn't supposed to but I'm\nThe minute he had that conversation with jacks and um and and basically getting ready to accuse ... are accusing him of being a problem in that whole relationship\nI just I just knew that that was going to be the start of of something really bad happening\nYeah yeah I I I hear Eugene a hundred percent of ... and I I think I heard your charming and as well\nNo that was male ... yeah I think I think one of the tricks and it's been a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of this story one of the tricks with the manager and I think they do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is\nBeginning um but then they are ultimately headed toward the pre determined tragic ending in which um he died of suicide and so\nI think the manager I think the conversation with the manager unfortunately seems like a forced elements that\nIt doesn't feel organic to this story it feels like it comes into just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed at because when he had been through these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate and a lot of different ways for sure but you know did the movie really do a good job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough\nTo drive this enormous decision that that he makes that I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film was\nI agree with you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell and there was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour make it happen or or we're done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example she goes on states to her with her and he can't keep up or he keeps we're getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened as someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right so that would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way from like\n... exactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire Spence of his relationship with her I think that's part of the the narrative issue with the ending\nBut go ahead and go ahead well of course\nCourse the the ways in which a Hollywood and the fame\nA theme throughout\nOf the versions of stars born in there and in fact all the bridges of the SARS going to have that manager character in a different embodiment\nUm that character in this film I absolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions he almost with a sympathetic enabler\nUm of of the male lead and who then was like hey you know\nWe're trying to keep them afloat but he's going to mess you up\nEsther Esther was the first name of alley or in the stars foreign versions so the story of Hollywood destroying people um requires that a a stand in for the machine be part of the part of the cast you know has to be there um\nI also just want to say before we end gotta get this out there that um\nThis is also the story of how\nA woman's arise leads to a man's fall [laughter] and that's been eternal problem with the stars bar and you know um it's a melodrama it's it's a melodrama traditionally aimed at women we feel very sympathetic\nA ... toward the lead female character but there is this underlying sense have to say it that\nEven as Jackson, Maine is saved temporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically from his young protege ultimately he is destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushed to the periphery\nFeminist reading problematic\nFound well but you're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a feeling male ego is the wrong story\nTo be moved crying deeply engaged that didn't happen for stars\nI deeply appreciative guys nuanced shyness in her early portrayal which made main characters advising her work well I'd like to have the Sam Eliot brother character better developed possibly a moment perhaps a moment could have been written in the car rides the bar possibly dropping him off from the performance\nHis scenes seemed a little too detached from Maine overall I Love the big venue concert treatments\nThat kind of gets to a comment from Argo in ... North Carolina who tweeted three stars a star is born was a story\nThe performance is especially the musical ones were fantastic and the cinematography was incredible I expect a lot of nominations to come for deep ie the director of photography cinematographer Matthew ... production designer Karen Murphy costumer Aaron been out score original saw\nAn ad attacking John horns spoke with the cinematographer ... about shooting live performances which are not really straightforward spaces to navigate\nHere is a part of that conversation from Cape he sees the frame\nThis film was very difficult to sort of um navigate the stage performances because we had three different modes basically we had the Coachella mode which is I'm borrowing stages or that were already set up with the lady that was already existing\nAnd putting in our own crowds and then there was the I'm running guns sort of we have ten minutes to shoot in between two sets with a real audience apologizing in thanking the audience for I'm sort of I'm shooting a movie in between\nTwo bands and then we had the third which is the Greek theater where ... in which shallow was performed where we um we actually in more of a movie fashion was able to create the Greek theater as upset and put a certain amount of crowded and so that was my most controlled um scenario but the lighting of it had to have a consistency my my\nIn a might as well be um [noise] well I don't know Jack White and I had to make sure that the the audience maybe subconsciously feel that this is his lady [noise] this is his road show and it's also in the film in the sort of visual movement of it all representation of rock and roll\nThat was Mathew seek the cinematographer on a star is born speaking to John horn on Cape he sees the frame John can you talk a little bit more about the making of this film particularly back to Kathleen question who wrote on Facebook how you can tell if a film is a well directed this kind of a film\nThe way that Matthew described it presents all kinds of additional challenges to make it a well directed film shooting and so many different kinds of locations\nYeah I think the ultimate question about what is it is not a well directed film it's do you believe it do you believe you're watching Bradley Cooper or do you believe you're watching Jackson, Maine if you think you're watching the actor you're not in a well directed movie if you are with the character", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Middletown", "day": "10"}
