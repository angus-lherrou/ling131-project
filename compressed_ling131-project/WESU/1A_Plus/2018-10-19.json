A. M. U. dot org let me get to a few of your comments including some of your commenting about this Elizabeth Warren story Martin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes him look bad and I was very happy that Warren release this DNA result\nHe showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares at hearing this story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to end these comment this idea of beating the president and kind of showing him for what he really is\nI mean that was tried over and over again in the twenty sixteen election and it didn't end up working I think when you engage with Trump in some of the arguments that split fires up his base and that's what's been had six deaths in the past that's what could help Republicans on sort of see it in the mid term\nAnd it's a dangerous strategy for Democrats in twenty twenty I think taking the high road still seems to be the best tactic but we'll see how things play out\nThe air go ahead for like a it's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to you know add to what Alexandra saying look this is what happened to two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio J uh you know Jeb Bush all of them tried to take a Trump on\nVery dangerous or for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and that's that's meant in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own a party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff Josh we'll\nLook at the way in which um you know a parochial entity like the New Hampshire Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up to the elections I founded telling that the guest said they brought up\nA typically these would be people you know on presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been you know stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Ozzie and Alec Baldwin and they we haven't yet seen I mean typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWe've ... the people who've drawn the most attention of the people who have cast themselves as Trump antagonist and\nUh the coffers of the local Democratic Party would tell you that that's been good for them so you know the mid term to appear loser favor but sort of an all against all on the question of Trump\nAnother politician who at one point was an antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again and this week he democratic he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke\nPeople are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight in a work came out swinging in the debate he even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at what point at one point Franco or don't is what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that debate\nUm you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races it's ... it's been the most fascinating\nThis was always going to be a long shot a for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know tried not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know he but he's been dropping in the polls and he's\nHe's had to take a new tack using this language of lions had um attacking them about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas um it's been a major shift in tone for work\nBut it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with just yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat of the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants a you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for Beto O'Rourke some some hope is like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like a that seems like another ballgame\nYeah Alexander I was going to ask you whether or not or what you read was on whether this could work I mean ... I Wonder if that debate give us any more insight into whether\nIt rather progressive Democrat like a war has a chance in a state like Texas shoes you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans does this give us a sense of whether he moved the needle\nI mean broadly it we have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in the mid term typically you know not that many voters watch them some time to undecided voters do but unless there's a major gas\nThey typically don't move the needle that significantly in right now I think the polling average shows that Ted Cruz's up by about seven points which on election day of Texas that's the way it typically does it enough I also think an undercover aspect of this race is the fact that Texas straight ticket voting you can go and market box for Republicans\nA Democrat that hadn't been pulling in the thirties and seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even as that are over arc had been able to keep them to think of it\nI just wanna make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra in Texas you can just mark a box of the top of the mouth and says Republican and it automatically cows that vote dress counting for all the Republicans on the ticket and yet you can basically do for every Republican\nAll at once and it is it the last election that they'll be doing straight ticket voting after that it won't be anything\nWill fundraising reports from the third quarter of the year we're due this week to the federal election commission they were doing Monday and the result\nLook pretty good for Democrats and house races at least just in terms of the dollars and cents of Democrats are dominating fundraising in house seat races the challengers the Democratic challengers outraged Ninety two Republican incumbents more than six the Democratic candidates raised more than a million dollars that corner\nIn the Senate Democrats are also out raising Republicans Beto O'Rourke raised thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter Ted Cruz raised just over ten million dollars\nAccording to an analysis by five thirty eight the Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in house races\nAlso glad to hear from some of you about the president on the campaign trail including in Texas Karen tweeted Trump is coming to Houston next Monday to rally for Ted Cruz Monday is also the first day for early voting in Texas\nLet's shift gears and had to Florida where the after effects of hurricane Michael continue to be felt and seen\nThe weather channel reports the death toll at at least thirty five people with fatalities spread from Florida all the way up to Virginia now those death toll figures are bad enough but Franco what's our sense of how the recovery effort is going particularly the effort to\nTown and Mexico beach has not reported given any numbers\nUm of how many people are are missing 'em but there is talk of that it could likely be in the hundreds I mean this\nWas a massive storm I'm Talking about one of the biggest storms out of the top three or perhaps by some accounts that you know had made landfall that would make it bigger than Katrina\nThis has been a huge effort many people still do not thousands still don't have a phone service um and people are expecting asked foam is sewn services restored and more roads are clear it and you're able to get more to people that they're expecting the death toll to continue to rise\nWhen Alexander the other big issue is when people can actually start\nTo rebuild I mean it's it's fascinating and terrifying horrifying at the same time to look at some of the early drained camera pictures that from where hurricane Michael came ashore from where it made landfall\nYou can almost tell which homes were built up the latest building codes and which homes were not because the homes that were up to codes were there and the homes that weren't were gone and I wonder what points the the ... the rebuilding effort is right now is there any ... is there any expectation on when people could start to rebuild\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from progressive insurance offering a way to buy home insurance with their home quote explorer tool\nCustom quotes and rates are available online learn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive\nNow that's progressive and from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed of financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement more at alliance for lifetime income dot org\n\nBack now to the friday news roundup with Josh Rogers Alexandra Jaffe and Frank or don't is still a little bit more time to get in your questions and thoughts about this week's top stories from across the country one a at W. A. M. U. dot org Josh Rogers let's talk New Hampshire for a little while there are two congressional races underway\nOr the Democrat Chris Pappas would become the state's first openly gay member of Congress his Republican opponent Eddie Edwards would be the first black house member from New Hampshire tell us a bit more about the first congressional district as I understand that it's it's a swing district that Donald Trump carried in twenty sixteen\nRight of reading and a party to party from two thousand eight or the GOP winning and midterm years Democrats winning in presidential years is now held by Carol Shea Porter fairly liberal Democrat who's\nRetiring I'm In ... where do you have people who are running really within the mainstream of their parties are pappas has been serving in various\nElective offices for a long time he's in his late thirties he says family owns a very popular restaurant in Manchester often to stop for presidential candidates\nHe um he comes from Manchester which is a town that where the even the Democrats have historically been a little bit more conservative than in other parts of the state particularly on fiscal matters\nUm Eddie Edwards is somebody who has a background in law enforcement he was in the navy he at one time led the states uh enforcement division of its liquor commission in New Hampshire we have those big highway liquor stores liquor is controlled by the state uh I was a fairly big job he a random enforcement division and he's been a police chief\nUm you know they were pretty much keeping to well within the norms of their party Eddie Edwards has you know embrace Donald Trump he every Giuliani up here campaigning with them\nUm and he's in some ways trying to cast Chris Pappas as you know part of some sort of resistance movement and saying we've obviously the nationally uh you know Chris Pappas as you know hardly a radical guy or you know family I'm Ron restaurant ah worked I worked for Joe Lieberman when he ran for president um\nAnd ah this race though is one where\nGovernment governor Christian new new faces Democrat Molly Kelly she was one of the Fifteen women running for governor across the country which is an unprecedented number the latest fundraising numbers that came out this week showed that Kelly the Democrat has raised the new new the incumbent Republican\nThree to one uh ... brand of New York came to conquered on yesterday to help campaign for Kelly\nThey met with employees of the Granite State candy shop and they discussed paid family leave I'm interested in where this issue sits in terms of all the issues New Hampshire voters are considering but here as part of what happened with ... with listen\nIt's going to help families the happier and healthier it's going to help people to be more productive at work and so\nIt's a win win everywhere I go in this day I hear about the need for paid family medical leave and how important it is for people to be able to have the choices in their life\nTo be able to work hard where they're working but then to be able to spend time with the people they love the most when they're needed them out or\nThat was Molly Kelly you heard at the end senator ... brand was at the beginning tell us a bit more about Mali Kelly is is this paid family leave issue a big one for her based on her political background her personal background will\nIt's been a huge issue for her whether it is for voters is an interesting test me she's been running pretty much exclusively on this issue um it's a challenge of somebody covering this how many stories one can write about paid family leave my understanding as Democrats\nHave polling that suggests that Governor Sununu is vulnerable on this issue\nHe was on the record supporting a paid family leave bill that didn't make it through the legislature in part because he came out against it at the last minute or for fear that a payroll deduction imagine to an income tax which you know it was a real kind of fighting words here in New Hampshire where there's no income tax\nThe way through college and that you know Christian new new son of a governor brother of a U.S senator uh you know doesn't understand the the stresses and strains that many working people face and you know it does get at New Hampshire has kind of a bifurcated economy\nUh you know boom times for people the upper income we have budget surpluses and tax collections are up but you know the wage growth for people at the lower end of the scale\nHas not been great and this is an issue that for Democrats they feel that it kind of hits a lot of boxes and may help mobilize women which are you know he constituent anywhere for particularly here in New Hampshire how close is this governor's race well\nI'm you know Sunni should win or we know we have to your terms here no governor has been tossed after one term\nUh since two thousand four and prior to that it had been a century so it's pretty rare that a governor doesn't get a second term apps and being a disaster or a really tanking economy we don't have either of those\nEr here polling indicates a new news appalled by about ten and you know you mentioned the fundraising numbers and Molly has outrageous Christian in three to one and the most recent reporting period he does enter the final stretch to this race with a cash advantage although for an incumbent\nWith a nationally known name he's a pretty bad fundraiser he he will freely admit he doesn't like to do it so\nYou know he's only got he's got four hundred thousand she's got two hundred thousand no interest groups will will add to that in terms of advertising but\nThis is a race that Democrats feel they have a chance to win if if a blue wave a venture weights and they think that Molly Kelly a bite in her background by the end up being a woman is somebody who perhaps his best engineered to kind of ride away speaking\nOf nationally known names Frank or don't is I Wonder what your senses of senator jeweler brand making this trip to help Mali Kelly is their speculation about her future\nIt's the big question I mean obviously a there's so many names being kicked around uh right now or that you know it I think time will tell but there there's no question that killed around is one of the people that that people are talking about and certainly are watching very closely in every move a that she makes\n'em is being picked apart um you know analyzed a and looking for how it could mean and how it could uh what impact it could have on twenty twenty\nLove to discuss with business and the economy this week including the U.S deficit we don't hear much about it these days but it's back in the news because the Treasury Department revealed this week but the deficit has grown\nLast year it was about six hundred sixty six billion dollars not a significant number there at all six hundred and sixty six billion this week the Treasury Department revealed that the deficit has grown to seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars gets sticks to your high end projection state is on track by the end of this decade\nTo hit a trillion dollars the deficit a trillion dollars\nNo Alexandra some experts are pointing to the Trump Administration for being responsible for this particularly the tax bill\nPart of the sales pitch for the tax bill for the tax cuts is it like cutting taxes business what kind of unleash more productivity the economy would boom like never before and the resulting largest with more than make up for whatever we lost in tax revenue how's that working out so far\n... well we haven't seen that yet certainly an advantage Republicans are arguing that that's going to take 'em you know about a decade to even out though at this rate although the economy is booming there's there's no way that it can make up for where our deficit is at at this point\nOn it was sort of an open secret in Washington that the real plan that Republicans were kicking around was welfare reform\nUm to to cut down on the deficit and that conversation has started again on Capitol Hill I'm that obviously won't move forward until after the midterms but they're\nKind of care that kind of thing and and tell going forward you know it's interesting they care or to the Republican silence on this issue when they were previously the party of deficit but it's also an opportunity for them politically to push another priority of the Republican Party which again is welfare reform\nYeah I'm Glad you mentioned that because Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell blamed the rising deficit on public assistance programs in an interview with Bloomberg News on Tuesday what's going on with that\nBut it's very disturbing and it's it's ruined by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid that Seventy percent of what we spend every year the subject we were just discussing the funding of the government is about thirty percent of what was

President Trump's thing yesterday when he finally acknowledge that yes it appears that man was murdered that he said this story has captured the world's imagination unfortunately and I thought unfortunately what's unfortunate about it it is the job of the media to demand accountability to speak truth\nAnd our values as America and as we've always been a global leader we try to put ourselves forward as the leader of the free world\nPart of that is about moral values and when we have a very close ally who by the way our military hardware is used in that Saudi campaign in Yemen that has killed so many thousands of civilians and children\nAnd is now leading to a huge famine in Yemen\nHow can we say that weren't uninvolved party um you know this is someone who was a resident of our soil and working for one of our companies\nAnd it's absolutely not true when you have an ally who was alleged to have done something like that we have certain forms of leverage that include arms sales and include potential sanctions right and many\nWe've talked about this on this program before the U.S in Saudi Arabia have had a long relationship\nBut we've never tried to exert strong moral or ethical pressure on Saudi Arabia I mean it's a very transactional relationship and so just because one is uninvolved doesn't mean that one is an entangled but I kind of takes so nice point like the U.S\nDoesn't really want to have to spank Saudi Arabia over its actions because there is a tremendous military and economic entanglements so I'm not really sure what the us has the power to do or if it has the moral authority to do it\nWell this is the limit ... the the apple pie that point Josh represents absolutely critical you know ... someone who's been actually a very good on this as Senator Marco Rubio who made the point in among paraphrasing here\nThat all the money in the world and all the military contracts in the world would not be enough to buy back our credibility on human rights if we don't stand up against something as fundamental as murdering journalist for their opinions that's an international norm there's a lot of other norms that were broken here but that's like a critical one\nI mean the show is called one eye for the first amendment with that is in our DNA to stand up for a free press around the world and if we don't stand up strongly against that it'll be a very very damaging precedent and as a Senator Rubio said will never be able to buy our credibility back on these issues\nSenator Lindsey Graham made a very similar point he was so angry and he said I've been a huge ally as NPs and Saudi Arabia but I'd never going there again as long as he is in power he's outraged by it so this is a bipartisan issue\nThan have it is worth noting that the Washington Post this week it published\nWhat is believed to be ... final column it's called what the Arab world needs most is free expression it was published in English and Arabic and he writes about the systemic the systematic dismantling of the free press in much of the Arab world here's one brief quote from that column quote these actions no longer\nPilots as a result Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate unquote Hayes what do you think is he right\nI think he is definitely right so\nUh this has been you know one of the longstanding problems with U.S foreign policy in the region\nIs that oftentimes strategic interest have taken of the friends he compared to human rights issues under the Obama administration you had a lot of great words about how he he actually did stand up to Saudi Arabia in word but if not indeed we never halted arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nOr despite the ongoing campaign in Yemen we'd never a threatened to sanction them over a they're a you over their funding of hottest in other extremist in Syria\nWe never have really taken very strong action against Saudi Arabia or any any country or any country in the region for their actions except for Iran who has been fundamentally aligned against the Gulf\n... a Gulf states so I I I completely agree with the sentiment in his column if we haven't been willing to take action\nBefore it it I Hope that we have the fortitude to actually the people in ... that members of Congress actually have the fortitude to actually pass some sort of legislation that or does something if the Trump Administration does not but it seems unlikely given the history of the issue\nSo basically the people who killed ... may get away with is that he may never really know who killed\nHim there may never be any real prosecution because of just the cold hard fact that that the relationship between the U.S and the Saudis is a business relationship\nYou you've totally see that when you look at the president's comments that it might have been wrote killers who took out to show ... and ...\nThat meant the death of his show gee but does not blame Mohammed bin Salman\nA coach or dress recognized coming out of that because there's there's a point here that's important to make I think the reason compare went over to to Saudi Arabia was to say that look\nUm you have to get out in front of this this is that you cannot sleep to some of the rug I'm absolutely convinced we are going to get to the bottom of this because there's just so much evidence that the Turks now have\nThey have the photograph these Fifteen individuals who flew in twelve of which are part of\nThe ... the crown prince of security detail or intelligence services I think we're going to get to the bottom of this now I also think there's going to be a fall guy but it's somewhere just below the crown prince there already are stories that maybe they're going to offer up there and tell his intelligence chief\nGeneral Ahmed Asiri as the scapegoat so I I think we will know who did this and I you know I think probably the crown prince will try to you know offer up a a senior scapegoat but I'm I'm pretty convince we're going to figure out what happened here\nWhat we will keep an eye on this story we're glad to get some more of your comments on this for now let's move on to some of the other big stories that make news this weekend may have flown under your radar because of all the attention about ... G rightly given of course\nBut there's also an update from Afghanistan where the war continues to rage Seventeen years after it began with no clear end in sight\nYesterday the Taliban killed at leading police chief in Kandahar\nThe commander of us and NATO troops in Afghanistan General Austin Scott Miller escaped unharmed today the Afghan government announced it's delaying elections in that province they were supposed to take place tomorrow those elections will carry on as planned in the rest of Afghanistan despite widespread violence the Taliban have already killed at least\nTen candidates and scores of voters in the ... give us some sense of how the Taliban's efforts might affect the outcome of this election\nTo have a bad or every Wednesday starting at six thirty pm every Wednesday mixed live only fusion radio\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from ... am committed to changing lives through math by building Mathis\nThat's amazing um dot com slash NPR from logged me in makers of go to meeting a collaboration meeting platform that comes equipped with features to help people stay focused to get work done and learn more it goes to meeting dot com and from the listeners to support this NPR station\nOr back now to the friday news roundup with James kid field of the center for the study of the presidency in Congress in the ... of the Boston Globe and the Pulitzer center and have brown of buzzfeed do still a little more time to get in some of your questions and thoughts\nAbout this week's top stories from around the world one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nThis week some Americans were probably green with envy and our neighbors to the north\nRight out gotten I've gotten I got out\nThey were celebrating in Montreal this week because on Wednesday Canada legalize recreational marijuana nationwide it's only the second country in the world to do so or why was the first in twenty Thirteen\nAndrew tweeted Canada legalizing we'd was like California legalizing we'd both for like a long relationship where you've been dating forever but just now made it official\nHays how big a deal is this then do you think this is the start of a Global Trends something that has just kind of been understood for a long time and just hasn't been made official yet\nYou know that's a great question because I'm not really sure I mean I think that\nWhen you look at the way that the criminalizing drugs has gone in places like Portugal than at or do you compare that to\nThings like the way and off the drugs and crime still is very hard on marijuana and claims that it you know marijuana is that evil so it's really tough to tell where the global feeling is on we legalization\nIf um you weren't you bring it up they add a meeting\nThe majority of people in favor it even in a place like the USO Canada I don't know it really depends on how it goes in terms of the government controlling the access to marijuana which it it is doing now compared to you know being a private business or that private but illegal business among many small dealers\nOr it depends on how it affects the global drug trade it and whether\nUh there's going to be any sort of shift and you know that I'm sure that can is going to be putting unlike the U.S a lot of funding into studying the effects of this new policy whether causes surgeon traffic accidents where the cost of certain tops realization or medical affects so it can be really interesting ten years down the line to see what has happened in Canada\nYeah the CBC out of Ottawa has a story about how police there are increasing some of their a surveillance efforts for intoxicated drivers to make sure the more drivers aren't driving stone it is of course worth noting\nThat in this country marijuana is considered the most illegal level of illegal drugs they schedule one narcotic it's right up there\nWith heroin LSD ecstasy ... and ... the drugs that are deemed to have new currently accepted medical use\nAnd the high potential for abuse\nThere was a conference call this week with Todd oh and who was an official with US Customs and border patrol here's how he answered one question from a report\nIs it possible to be not lead into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our our ground be found in the midst of all in the United states so yes that's possible\nThat's Todd oh one of US Customs and border patrol Indira give us a sense of what this might mean for the relationship between the U.S and Canada along the border\nWell it's one more complication when you know border issues have been one of the primary issues of the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing this NAFTA to point out which is\nHelped spur of the rise of organized crime if you've never seen the Ken burns documentary what are you waiting for go see it this feels very much like something that was just kind of a matter of time like yeah they legalize it was going to happen sooner or later\nThat's my sense too yeah that is the trend is pretty clear in this country and and then candidate Dan has had medical marijuana since two thousand and one it's very popular so too does not out on a whim a by endorsing the so I I think it's a it's kind of inevitable\nYeah not one of the loudest most aggressive social movements with regards to the legalization of cannabis a much more impactful movement that has reverberated around the world is the me too movement and we should talk about that before our time is up this week M.
