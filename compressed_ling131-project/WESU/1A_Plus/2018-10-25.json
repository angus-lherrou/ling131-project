A. M. U. dot org\nBack to that comment with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have paid in taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two\nI mean it it it comes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pays some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS put push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they've submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various toxic stories that weren't\nEmpire the value that at a little over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had in the various kind of larger Trump family organization when they sold the business ... business is off over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more\nThan devaluation can you give it to sent Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worth factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of ... writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seemed\nRidiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a valuations of you know five ten million\nBut on the same hand when they had a charitable donation um where they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go higher they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nOf course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the IRS then that compromise is the amount of tax and the IRS may or may not be able to us that's on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond\nTo a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several if you've been asking\nWhether this is kind of unique to the Trump Bryce wrote on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common there's sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich after the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone rich is engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer [laughter]\nThose are those are very good question I there are some of these some of the things\nAfter being pushed by a trust in a state attorneys I'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them this grand jury attained annuity trust which is the formal name for the mechanisms through which Donald Trump in his siblings took\nOwnership of their fathers empire in the nineties there's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on to family winery through one of these trust\n'em so there there are quite common\nThen there are other aspects of of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose of an pad invoices so Donald Trump in his siblings could start\nTaking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face\nUm and so those kind of things aren't\nA gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we're talking about here and even in the cases where\nThey use a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people to Trump's really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a truck in the state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers\nBefore we get into more of the details I like to get to one more comment that was sent in a through voice mail from one of our listeners who is struggling with the idea that the trumps actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nIs Jeff from saint Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people have received benefits and her father I see this is a story the second part is taxes avoided\nThat is a legal method of reducing your tax bill through existing a statute taxes evaded now that would be interesting\nAll ... otherwise Jeff thanks for sharing your thoughts with us Susanna what would you say to dress\nUp at the top I mean these are standard deductions one one of the um one of the things that we wrote about the Russian you mentioned\nUm with the company that was set up it's interesting 'cause it's true that the rich due to a lot of things to avoid taxes the trumps crossed the line into illegality and one of the companies that we wrote about um this company called all county building supply\nIt was set up in Nineteen Ninety to its sole purpose was to defraud the ... before the IRS to avoid taxes what it was it was a fairly simple mechanism and explain it and and I think reader or your listeners can kind of come to their ... to a conclusion on it\nFor a Trump in in the early Nineteen nineties was getting old he had a ton of buildings he had a lot of cash 'em and the Trump siblings were looking at a situation if Fred Trump died where they would have to pay at the time it would have been a fifty five percent of its state tax on all the cash that his buildings were sitting on and we're

now to our conversation with Suzanne Craig ... view of the New York times still times to get in a few more of your questions and comments won a at W. A. M. U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this\nIsn't it their job to catch the French trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how do they reflect on that\nIt is their job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout the story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS does um you know ... large um they're under staffed and and often a lot of stuff\nDoes get through 'em and I think that that sort of became apparent to us as we were sort of looking at the totality of the\nPush back and you know from talking to the tax experts that we did um you understand when when the IRS does see something um there's back and forth I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the Trump but with the people were where were problems are found and eventually they come to his settlement\nAnd we we saw that additional toxins certain things was paid when they saw valuations\nThat they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled in in in things move on in the case of all county um we found no evidence that the Iraq um I all county as the company where they had they were putting the voices in order to drain\nUm fried Trump's empire and in in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the trumps we're doing there so it sort of a ... a mix of they caught some stuff and and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nThat you report has come out Russ have we heard anything more from the IRS they planned to look into any of\nThese allegations or is it is it too late are are there statute of limitations that are involved there are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges\nThose have since told there is if there's a fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities\nWho say based on ah the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supply and maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay\nUm it's a good question the estate tax but they were looking at what have been fifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings I'm would have had to pay some tax that would have been a business tax\nUm and it would have been substantially less and it's interesting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he had incurred throughout his um his life that he may be potentially would've been able to shelter the income and not paid tax on it because in America when you have\nYou know lost his you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them pay but it would have been substantially less than the fifty five percent state tax that they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of this the kinds of stands out is is how Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips\nOne of Donald Trump's failed casinos ... can you explain that to us\nSure that was uh in in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in his darkest moment he was facing a payment on a bond basically a money he owns owed to lenders um and he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos\nHis father is a lawyer showed up\nWith checks totaling three and a half million dollars bought some gambling chips took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and I never cash them so that was a venture determined to be an illegal loan Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make a payment get over that hump\nWonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if even if officials in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's ran down to\nWhat what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the Trump might have faced at the time if they had been caught and prosecuted\nOr a big one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area with all county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are that they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs onto\nThe tenants and I'm In doing so you know they inflated they they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it\nThat potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not\nSo there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um they're they're facing potential not only back taxes but penalty as an interest on the money that's out so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities 'em and other authorities could be looking at um where the\nCould they have ended up in in federal prison for this\n...\nFederal or state prison it depends on who choose to prosecute it ... the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing all county they were filing false documents or with a state agency um and there would be lower level charges that would float to that\nAnd yet those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our lives there is some if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought\nAnd freedom and Jay tweeted so you're prove that Donald Trump six that didn't start with a loan from his father as he stated where exactly is the discrepancy none\nTo them\nThey're interesting comments I had one\nInto a billion dollar empire he's now in the White House and he ran a campaign based on being sort of a self made\nBillionaire um there's no evidence necessarily that he is a billionaire but what we showed is that he inherited hundreds of millions of dollars over his lifetime from his father um and some of that was done through tax fraud\nPeople may or may not care about that but I think it's an important\nUm narrative of of somebody now in the White House about how he got his fortune in where the money came from it doesn't necessarily um stay he didn't get revenue or money from other areas um you know there's been stories that some of it has come from Russia but what we showed is that\nSaturday morning at seven ...

U. dot org marked before we get into the details\nWhy do you think that this got much international attention [noise] well\nIt's an outrageous fact isn't it or to use that kind of substance on the on the streets of a foreign city in order to tackle the school I think he is something that a lot of people find extraordinary\nAnd you know in in the sense is that that was an extraordinary provocative thing but some people\nI think to have trouble believing the British Government narrative annual its details I have to say though you know as time has gone on on particular things we've seen in the last month now off\nWith the identification of two suspects and then Russian journalist and acts but working to find out the real identity to those people who came to the u._k. on teaching him and then to link them to the ministry intelligence service the jail you you know it'll do seem to be pointing pretty clearly in that direction\nLet's talk more about the G argue what exactly is it and what does it do\nWell or the Russian initials stand for main intelligence directorate and it's the it's a direct threats all\nThe Russian general stuff the ...\nOr the ... the ... thing some plans for the Russian ministry and this is the same in quite a lot of countries that historically or the general stuff will have its own intelligence department and that's been the case in changing one or two that bureaucratic details but more or less since the Russians civil war in the early twentieth century\nThat the a Soviet then Russian general stuff has had this organization\nAnd ate him price is a whole a sway the capabilities and the idea of a bad kid reconnaissance so intelligence as practiced by the geo use a very broad concept\nAnd that can be two guys creeping forward on their bellies in eastern Ukraine trying to see if they can spot Ukrainian full phase and ... ... soldiers on the battlefield and it can be a gun\nDirect cover of being a scientific and technical ... tree at the embassy and it can also embrace things like cyber warfare and spy satellites so it's an organization that has many thousands of people working for it it also has special operations forces\nOr I I and a very broad capabilities\nHow'd it still gets crippled joined the G argue\nWell joining the GI you particularly ah back in the Soviet period or when he got involved or he was invited in Nineteen Seventy nine\nIt was a pretty mysterious thing you weren't supposed to really know about it you couldn't supply it was them who approach you and he'd been involved he was in the ... and he was a in a reconnaissance unit that did some pretty daring things like they went into China or on the cover and\nYou know and there are other missions as well but uh described in my book\nAnd I think this protein to the attention of the G all you as being the kind of the guy who who had the right stuff and they invited him you can cause an exam and he goes through that said later that year he started at the what's called them in that predicament academy which is effectively that spies school to Moscow\nWet you spent four years are doing everything from you know the real a spy novel tried cross stuff of age and meet some counts as ...\nOr ... means of communications from my ... it's a secret writing to\nYou know encrypted email all that stuff\nOr through to intelligence analysis and the rest of it so it's a very sorry grounding that they get ... and having done all that he got ... or not they fold to move into\nA on his first job working on the diplomatic cover not swap are generally speaking a lot of the G all you people who were deployed strategic intelligence gathering that's what they do they ask you must have been into now let's say a maybe what can fire a flaw\nYour introduction expelled from the U.S a following the toll free incidents where gee all you people working in in Russian organizations in Washington and New York\nDescribed Sergei Skripal and his day what did he look like how did he come across\nWell he's pretty he's a well built guy I mean he's he's a man who uh was a Russian Army a boxing championship level a book so he was in the apple forces where they they put quite a premium on you know physical strength\nOr rural coverage you know throwing itself out airplane at Nineteen to an ... kind of stuff\nOr ... and so you know he's a tough guy he he's broad um of course our these mid sixties or he doesn't have quite the same physical condition you get back when he was working with a jail you but he's still a fairly um striking physical presence he's got a very dry sense of humor\nI'm a dead pan and it tends to make light of the sort of negative things in life so when we were talking\nAbout his experience is under interrogation into the fall to the prison than most go well then in the labor camp he was sent to you know he would struggle off of it off and say well I got a fixed amount of Iran for that to happen and you know this made me more comfortable and\nI you know he was thinking I think he would have said well\nYou know I had a terrible time already suffered you know because he and his in his military career and doing the things he's done in the jail you read over keeping and very demonic situations\nAnd I think and much with that kind of mindset really to sort of make light of obstacles in life and trauma prevail\nHow did you come to meet him [noise]\nWell I mean I was I was working on an idea but I wanted to write a book about um post Cold War spying and obviously that's the say the big enough focus

for a week or two but he also has made a recovery of salts\nAnd then of course you get to UT a script pile and ... and\nUh she was discharged from hospital a several weeks before he was once again I think one can infer from that but to how to have less at the stage\nAnd uh so I suppose you could say the most seriously affected postman who survived will still gets repel himself\nUm when I interviewed the medical stuff their hospital you you had a ... year of uh don't just even joked\nThey were saying well uh we think that will be some side effects bought it very hard to predict what they all say I think one would still say that ... cells in the presence of combat lessons ... my understanding that there are some long term effects but of course\nYou know if people are not a keen to discover the specifics that advice because it's an issue of ... medical confidentiality and ah because I think there are still call it on nuns\nRegard to Yulia ... daughter Anna emailed\nIt's often assumed in the media that his daughter was an accidental casualty however her fiance was a gi argue employee whose mother was also a high level G R U operative\nWhen she tried to reach her fiance from the hospital he and his mother disappear also interesting and it goes on to write also interesting that the two alleged hit men flew on the same flight as the daughter to London considering the scruples wife and son died earlier\nAn operation ordered by some unhappy G R U operatives or a higher level order Mark I'm\nWell I I'll just pick holes in one little bits of out of a description that the the two people to to suspect or did not flying on the same plane as you'd ask repel they arrived the previous day at a different London apple got wake\nA she arrived then on the science data ... shut Heathrow\nA on a plane for mostly but anyway um\nLet's just talk that ah that's just a detail um look there is definitely something ... about a half a rival in the u._k. and the timing of the attack\n'em and right from the outset people I was speaking to were involved in in trying to work out what has happened investigation or believed that the timing was critical\nNow we know even more so that the suspects are named as ... had being in the u._k. on exactly the same period the last few days of February\n... and the first couple of days in March during the previous year twenty six team or a bigger problem twenty Seventeen and that another man\nWho's been ... to ... or identified by Russian newspapers probably a pseudonym so gay few ... had been in the u._k. at the same time as ... or in twenty Seventeen and at the same time late February early March twenty sixteen\nNow this raises questions about or were they targeting script Powell for some time whether they using the fact that she lived in Russia and therefore they could pack a email account and that's been alleged by the u._k. government that they were hacking it from twenty Thirteen um woods and indeed him ... fun [noise]\nHe's birthday on the first of march [noise] so that's the ... uh by a light switch Seventeen I'm fortunate they tragically Sasha by the way had died\nBut it's still supposed that she had come in twenty Eighteen to be with her dad at that time because it would be a difficult time because it was a time they were all normally together as a family\nSo that the that it's always been um a a a line of inquiry for the investigators that the\nTiming of the attack was critically linked to you this arrival that a hacking her data emails and stuff which said show outcome that you are from the ... would help them to locate so make sure he was not a business trip or in some other way absent\nAnd uh that this would be a good time to do it now and I also mentioned a boyfriend that I'm Yulia had bought a is a bit of a cab yet he is still buy them to have have connections with a one of the Russian intelligence agency thought\nHe was not on the scene for example back in twenty six dating when it's believed that they um they got a using the names of traveled to the guy\nHe was not on the scene back in ... when we know according to the u._k. government\nThat her email account was hacked or he hadn't been on the things are much more than a year so\nYou know we don't know and no fan of he's not here to defend himself against any allegations that he had played some politician days um that we know that after the attack um [noise]\nUh well nearly among solved there was a court hearing to do with medical procedures that to happen and it was ... that he had not been in touch with the
