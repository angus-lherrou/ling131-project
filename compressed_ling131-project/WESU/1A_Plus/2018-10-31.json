Jennifer let me start with you you've been paying very close attention to President Trump's rhetoric\nFrom an academic standpoint since twenty Fifteen during the campaign when after the ... anniversary what have you noticed about his use of language particularly the most salient ways that you you may be different from previous presidents\nYeah so Trump is very consistent with the way that he uses language he has used the same sex rhetorical strategies throughout his campaign and his presidency\nUm and and largely those are the strategies that President typically use for war rhetoric\nAnd so what I mean by that is you have lots of examples at the beginning of what we think of as a ... threat threats of force we usually use those threats of force when we're trying to intimidate opponent um when we're trying to shut down debate and discussion\nSo he does that repeatedly which are examples we're regret it showing he also uses ad hominem attacks this was attacking the person and set of their argument so we're used to these attacks and sometimes they're funny but they position people as objects of derision\nSo corrupt Hillary or low energy Jeb or lion Ted um those aren't affirming ways of describing your opponents and they certainly aren't legitimizing they are in fact the legitimizing um opposition\nWhy should you be the exception Monday Night now he's thirty to thirty poor radio program right near a W says [noise]\n\n\nAnd from that is amazing am committed to changing lives through math by building math achievement problem solving and critical thinking skills for thousands of students every day in nine hundred franchise location matinees EM dot com slash NPR\nAnd from the F P certified financial planner professionals committed to providing holistic financial planning from taxes and investment to retirement an estate planning in the client's best interest let's make a plan dot org\nIs one a I'm Joshua Johnson we're discussing the role of political ...\nThere is any responsibility at all for these acts were discussing it with Jennifer ... an American political rhetoric expert from Texas a and M. university highly by wreck of the Southern Poverty Law Center and Nick Gillespie of reason magazine\nWe'd love to hear from you particularly if you have noticed tangible impact of President Trump's rhetoric in your life whether you believe that the president bears responsibility does not their responsibility we love your help thinking out loud about this question so comment on our Facebook page\nTweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org and they get to a few more of your comments Laura is in Goshen, Indiana\nLaura emailed Trump as a vanguard of our worst angels is effectively sounding the horn to release previously restrained prejudices latent in some Americans\nHate is now fair game and high volume what they call the end the political correctness is the end of civility and democracy missing McCain and Obama now you don't know what you've got till it's gone and it's gone\nHeidi by Rick I Wonder if you could respond to that comment I Wonder if what Laura is saying in a way takes a little of the pressure off of President Trump in so far as he didn't create these views he happened to have tapped into them but you can tap into something that wasn't already there\nI think that's a completely fair position I mean you know in the United states has had a long problem with white supremacy and racism and legally oppressed you know parts of its own population for centuries\nSo that that it's legitimate to say that this kind of hate has been there\nI Will say that the work we do at the Southern Poverty Law Center found a great escalation and the number of hate groups for example on line hate rhetoric particular lean during the years that Obama was an office as an African American he very much a set off white supremacist you were unhappy with it\nRadicalized people you know it's allowed to be shared in a way that wasn't the case in prior arid so we have a lot more of it around and that's certainly something Trump has tapped into it how do you see it\nUh there's no question that there is a hyper polarization in American politics and I think it's important to also recognize that something is going on internationally when you look at Europe ah there is a larger\nGot a breakdown of a post World war two consensus um you know in general throughout the ... the developed world and certainly in Western Europe and North America\nA Trump did not create that he isn't happening it and he's exploiting it to his political uh aims\nWe need a a tremendous reset I think in American political discourse and this is not a I'm not even talking about the\nRhetoric of hate per se um of polarization of opposition at this point according to Gallup about twenty six percent of people in America identify as Republican about twenty seven twenty eight percent identified as Democrats these are historic lows\nAs was noted before there is a historically low level of trust and confidence in the government and other major institutions\nWe need to come up with a a political rhetoric of public rhetoric actually that is I'm not a you know that is not based on demonization polarization and again you know Trump Trump bears a certain\nCore responsibility as president of the United states because he is not simply a politician he is also on some level I he should be leading the discussion in a way that is more productive than he is but he's also not the only one are you doing this um [noise]\nAnd um the other thing to think about though is what is the distinction between rhetoric and action um and you know when we we live in a ... a society that is filled with a lot of a fantasy violence whether we're talking about games whether we're talking about rhetoric et cetera but in general crimes are going\nStarting point of any conversation about this but I Do think we need to reset and that it needs to be a it needs to move away from polarization but this is much much bigger than Donald Trump I Wonder though Nick\nHow much power we give the words that are set especially in the political sphere I mean anyone who thinks that and I I Know you're not saying that words have zero power but I think ... who who minimize the power of words needs to go back and read the declaration of independence mhm those words weapons for sure and they led to a war\nAh you know yeah I I you know I I agree completely with that and and I realized that I you know or maybe it's\nA slippery position where I'm saying you know simultaneously that words matter in rhetoric matters but also that we need you know what what are we going to do about that I guess is it is another way of coming to this question of\nTrump's rhetoric is ridiculous or it has hate filled is garbage I mean it is and it you know it's but now uh we we can go on and on that doesn't get us any closer to figuring out how do how do we have a better conversation about politics about places where we need to\nReach a consensus and and then it knocked policies that actually work for the benefit of of people\nI Do want to talk a little bit more going forward a little later in the conversation about what next steps might look like next so we'll we'll we'll circle back to that Jennifer mochi a number of people\nHave commented on the role of the press of various media outlets that I Will try hard not to use the term ... media\nBecause there are so many different kinds of media out there will try to be a specific as we can and and thanks to those of you who have commented who has been specific who've mentioned specific networks for specific people that is extremely helpful to keep that up\nLet me get to a few of your comments about various media outlets in various press outlets\nCheryl tweeted the largest responsibility belongs to the twenty four seven media and those who absorb commentary an opinion as if it were factual news that President much like Andrew Jackson\n... asks why does he get so much airtime\nAnd Jim Wright's why hasn't anyone address the years of conditioning the public has received from talking heads such as Rush Limbaugh Glenn Beck Alex Jones et cetera\nThe of permeated our society and finally elected veer leader which only embolden them Jennifer before you react to that we of comments I should note that going back in recent years\nHas tried to walk back some of his rhetoric and has as publicly apologized in his words for for taking some of the rhetoric too far but I Do wonder Jennifer what your senses of how much of an oval various media outlets playing this\nIs a great question and I think that um there's a little bit of a historical big picture that um maybe would inform my answer here I'm In part of that is the reciprocal role that used to exist between the president and the press um it used to be the case that\nThere was a mutually beneficial relationship between the presidency and the press a largely because they needed each other the press needed the president for information and the president needed depressed because the president needed to disseminate that information and get their message out\nAnd that relationship has fractured and that's largely due to um cable news and social media and the fact that we all now have this platform to disseminate and circulate information including the president\nUm and so information circulates in a very different way than it did twenty thirty fifty years ago which is really fractured this relationship between the press and the president and Trump has been able to take advantage of that\nAre in a way that that previous presidents had tried to do but Trump has really done much better or worse job depending on your perspective um and so a Trump is completely mastered the news cycle and the ...\nSuch a you know on Twitter he has followers and many of them are bought a but most of Americans aren't on Twitter but we the hits tweet everywhere right\nAnd because those messages are amplified and that is Trump using the bully pulpit the good puppet of the presidency and also taking advantage of all of these other social media opportunities and and and so in this case a lot of times the press is Ben guilty as amplifying us messages and then they shouldn't have\nHighly America wonder how much you put the blame on various media outlets versus the president I feel like at this point we're kind of used to the drum beat of opinionated commentators on television and radio it's almost a trope in our culture I mean\nThe new Spiderman game on the police station has J Jonah dream is and the guy used to be the publisher of the daily bugle where Peter Parker worked as an AM talk show host whose whole job is to criticize Spiderman and it comes up in the storyline like we're so used to this\nRight here in the leadership in Middletown points [noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from

I Wonder how you view this in terms of\nThe the way that the president denounces violence at least in a statement and then make comments that are vitriolic thereafter how do you see this\nYeah it's a great question and and I'd also like to address the question of responsibility and if we have a moment that after answer and to Trump will say the thing that somebody has written for him to say he will read from the teleprompter when he is forced to do that\nAnd that that is in his natural inclination and so I have tracked in fact the way that Trump uses denial and any situation\nPain I'm a group of white nationalist at the Daily Stormer decided that they would avenge um what they thought was a bad a article that was written by Julie coffee in GQ um and so they sent her um hate messages and death threats and you know did all kinds of terrible things to her\nUm and when they asked Trump about it he said he didn't know anything about it so his first strategy was to deny any knowledge and then they said well and you know just on CNN they said well but you know do you have a message about this now you you clearly know about it I'm telling you about it\nAnd then he denies association with the people write a he says I don't know I don't know those people and he says what fans of mine you know are they are these fans who've done this\nUm and then he does a third thing which is to wonder what um the journalist Julie off he had done to deserve this hatred you know did she write this terrible article that is full of you know lie about me\nUm and then two I'm accused at other people of doing the same kinds of things right through an appeal to hypocrisy\nUm and if you look at when Trump is responding to these situations where people are trying to hold him accountable for his violent rhetoric\nUm he follows that same pattern he denies knowledge of it he denies association of it and maybe praises the people who've done it he wonders what the person did to deserve it and then he finally uses to quote ... which is an appeal to piracy to say oh everybody else does is it's not just me\nUm and that is classic for Trump he cannot be held accountable [noise]\nThis is why I call him a demagogue a demagogue is an an accountable leader and that's a historic definition deriving from ancient Athens [noise]\nUm and and we're talking about whether Trump is responsible and we can say that he's responsible but I'm telling you Trump does not accept responsibility he won't take that responsibility I'm an admitted that he in fact has\nI'm just kind of wondering what your take is on it to refer to President Trump\nAs a demagogue I mean she is the duly elected president of the United states of America she won the electoral college and when you call him a demagogue\nYou call all the people who were elected him supporters enablers of a demagogue another time when something like this happens that's got to make it harder to have the kind of debate we need to have about ... about refining the civil discourse\nSure it's an accurate term so um if you look it up in the Oxford English dictionary and the lady you'll see that the first definition of a demagogue is positive for neutral it says that it's a leader of the people which is the etymology of the word\nWho defend the rights of the people against the other parts of the state the second definition of demagogue is a leader who uses polarizing propaganda for their own personal gain\nDonald Trump is a demagogue in both senses of the word\nFor his fans for his followers and has voters the ones who won't leave him who will defend him at all costs they defend him because they see him as a heroic demagogue they see him as defending their rights against the other parts of the state that they believe are corrupt\nEveryone else who sees him as a demagogue in the bad sense of the word to use him as using polarizing propaganda for his own game\nWith the use of the word is is the use of the word accurate though it may be is it helpful\nI think so\n[laughter] it's an analytic point we can't understand what Donald Trump is doing if we can't understand what he's doing an unaccountable leader is a danger in any political community but it's actually in a democracy\nPolitical scientists and historians who are concerned about the health of the American democracy people who are charting democratic erosion and how democracies die\nWanting to uh\nYou know kill people or change the constitution to all of these things all of these authoritarian tendencies and which are a grounded in his language frankly I'm as as evidence of democratic erosion\nHeidi I Wonder if you could respond to one of the concerns that I think are a number of people on the political right have raised which is this idea that the rhetoric is too hot all the way around that the political discourse\nAs just heated up in both directions many on the right has pointed to the left saying that they use similar rhetoric to the rhetoric that President Trump has been using but they don't get cold out for quite as much here is a sample of some of what they're referring to\nGet his time for us as Democrats to be as tough as they are to be dedicated to the army is emitted as they are Michele always says you don't when they go low we go low we can [noise]\nThat you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate\nThat's when civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to\nRecognize and respect its strength\nThat of course was former secretary of state and democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton preceded by democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters and first was former attorney general\nWell there's no question that there was ... as well on the left\nBut I think it's a little ridiculous to try to say sort of like Donald Trump did after Charlottesville but there's some sort of equivalent here the real nastiness is coming from the right and it's coming on the basis of attacks on immigrants\nMuslims

U. dot org\n... let me come back to you let's talk about the nineties a little bit there are two particular nineties references that I Love you to react to one of them\nIs one that has been getting a lot of attention lately because it's celebrated the twenty fifth anniversary this year here's Bette Midler caffeine a Jimmy and Sarah Jessica Parker in Nineteen Ninety three in hocus pocus\nFind all the rules the potion and so I don't know if I don't I just we\nJust how come\nOh good for my three Ninety three I was Thirteen I saw this in the movie theaters I was like I don't know why ... movie but I'm going to love this movie for the rest of my life so that's hocus pocus then there's also the movie but craft from Nineteen Ninety six years Robin Tony and Rachel True in the craft\nOf my sisters and I asked for they've been with the [noise]\nNot hate those who gave me\nA specially racist people simply bonds scoreless\nConstitutionally like two very different kinds of depictions from the nineties but but we are there any common bonds to\nI think there are certain similarities um I think both of those movies are sort of grappling with the kind of wizard of Oz Margaret Hamilton idea but which that we talked about earlier right the idea of the ... the ... threatening woman who is ... the status quo\nAnd he'll get it the way it sort of deal with that it makes the which is fun and bumbling and they're not totally threatening to cut their cell about what they're doing um that in the end of course the the modern caves are Victoria and the witches are sent away and\nAre defeated and you don't have to worry about them ever again the craft kind of one to embrace the idea of the wicked witch a little bit more it sort of the joy of that movie is watching the grill gain access to the power in the sort of spiraled out of control and go feral and that kind of really satisfying way\nBut at the end of the movie they have to be returned resort to the status quo right because it would be to a threatening at that point in time if they got to just have all of this on channel of power so that starts to their power which is officially gender that but the movie consistently referred to in the mail and sometimes they call him daddy\nThe source of their power put restrictions on them\nAnd the only the rich who\nOf response those restrictions appropriately that I get to keep her\nSort of got off to an island in straight jacket in order for the Senate voted to restore it still labelled at the movies are about the idea of wanting to bring the wicked witch that at the end of the ... century and wanting to get access to that however but not quite able to do that with wholeheartedly\nGlad to hear from some of your about your favorite references to which is in music and movies TV and books market tweeted Sylvia ... Taliban and the which the B. A. L. I. B. A. and the Taliban and the which\nIs essential reading on how early capitalism and massaging the witch hunts were tied together and the current season of American horror story is all about which is trying to save the world\nMolly tweeted how about the episode of broad city called which is when Abby and a lot of learned to embrace wishing is as a powerful part of womanhood and perhaps actual magic\nChristian so let's talk a little bit about American horror story particularly the third season of the anthology series American horror story covered in which takes place in New Orleans here is Jessica Lange as Fiona good from the third season\nShare high temp down your entire company with about as much as I made a mix of raw raw and Marie Artim\nThank God\nWhich reminds me drink [noise]\nLange us feel good in American horror story coven now Kristin feeling good is not very good in theory she ... people's life forces to remain eternal young\nBut she's always got equipped she's one step ahead of our enemies she dresses fabulously and it seems like even when which is our evil in pop culture they still kind of are portrayed as envy\nThe ... of the ... that we see\nAnd um yeah we we are afraid of her um but we love her you know were drawn to these things that we fear and I think that that's what makes which is so appealing particularly someone like the on and we want to see her be wicked and\nThen we want to see her be punished for it unfortunately that's what most people want to say and so that's kind of what plays out within that serious without too many spoilers although it was many years ago though probably seen it [laughter] I Wonder how you see\nThat the crust and I mean you know when when we look at the the way that different struggles for\nEquality or for social ascendancy are depicted you know sometimes it's the it's a very ... it it feels like a similar cycle you know you have these these characters that are very noble and then eventually we get to these characters that are renegades you know we have\nThis Sidney ... is the first wave and then you've got blacks whites Haitian movies you got shaft it's the second wave you have these characters who are are very admirable and noble and then you have cattle characters who are like you know screw it I'm chicken butts in taking names\nYeah I mean I just think that the complicated nature of actual human beings so in that way they're sort of a human is Asian that's happening when we see these multifaceted witches\nSondra excuse me a busy black woman tweeted so thankful for your guests alternative perspective on be which that's the one which I never liked because of her husband's demands that she not use her powers\nUh oh yeah Pam gross when I Wonder if you could could help me with this ah the use of the word which I don't know if you've encountered this but I've encountered a lot of men who have used the W. word\nBecause they knew they weren't allowed to use the B word this word is very charged for a lot of men I mean even that stole my Frank Sinatra witchcraft where he says\nGrapple with absolutely and we stayed in politics all the time you can Google pretty much any female politician and no matter what side of the aisle they're on you will find them photoshopped eBay which\nI'm so this really is still a negative epithet that a lot of people use to put women in their place to shame them um to shut them up especially women who are in the public eye who have opinions and who they are to speak their mind\nYeah I I Wonder kind of costs where we do\nWith that mix connotation a Noel wrote on our Facebook page\nI don't see the concept of which is a positive feminist forcing mainstream American society if a woman says she identifies as a witch in any sense of the word she's only embrace without identification and picking culture the word which still has negative connotations like witch hunt\nSo I don't see it as a way for feminists to assert themselves and be hurt a strong powerful voices in society\nAnd Kathleen wrote on our Facebook page here's what I learned as a young girl from the wizard of Oz well behaved sweet witches are always beautiful graceful and kind which is to strive for power are ugly mean and bitter not exactly a feminist message Constance\nYeah I mean I think that the listeners aren't round the either those messages there I mean one of the lines in the wizard of Oz rate is a door and he says which is our old and ugly and Linda's said no on me that which it they're old and ugly good way to get it for\nTheir general there's

what gets our heart's racing [noise] the rest of it's done by the south [noise] especially the music [noise]\nJohn Carpenter is a master of horror movies end of the soundtracks that bring them to life his latest project as a return to the film that launched his career\nHalloween John Carpenter directed and scored the original back in Nineteen Seventy eight and he is the composer on the twenty eight teams sequel which is in theaters now John Carpenter welcome to want to thank you for having me you've been away from the Halloween movie franchise for some time now what made you decide to come back\nOn his producer Hollywood producer Jason Blum a convinced me to come back I knew that one was a a a sequel was going to be made as I Know a Malik the cod he's the the son of the man who put up the money for the original Halloween so I knew there was a sequel coming\nAdjacent bomb or talk to me and they said you know where it's going to be made with or without us so why don't we meaning he he and I\nUh get aboard and try to help it be good so nobody had put it to me that way before so I thought that's a great great thing\nJason Blum spend doing some pretty interesting things with horror movies lately what what do you make of where the genre stance today\nThat's in good shape\nBut it's always in good shape horror has been was cinema since the very beginning and I have a feeling\nA will be with us until doomsday just because everybody's scared if something were all born afraid\nWe all understand fear and so it's really fun to go to a horror movie with your girlfriend or your significant other and cuddle and scream and so forth\nWhat was it like for you not being in the directors chair for the twenty eighth team version of Halloween you were involved in the film but what about watching someone else direct this movie\nIt was a relief because I don't have to suffer the stress and anxiety\nOh oh come on now well it could it could be worse I guess you could be a slaughterhouse type measures that\nYou're right ah it's not the worst now\nUh when when things were a it's great to be a director when they don't work it's it's really garbage\nWhat do you think movie fans least understand about what it takes to direct a movie especially a horror movie\nWell what are they at least understand let me think a\nA directors are responsible for all the central elements of a movie if it's supposed to be funny they're responsible for the humor of it if it's an adventure and so forth and so on so director of a horror movie think of it this way horror and comedy or a lot like has its timing\nIt's all about timing\nAnd it's all about when things happen and how they unfold and it's more complex than than people assume but um people just think that horror as a lot of Gore and obvious violence and it's not\nYeah see I I I hear you on that it's an interesting analogy between horror and comedy I'm not big on Gore I Do not personally do well around blood and Gore at all but a good suspenseful movie like I can I can hang with that 'cause that's that's a satisfying experience what what do you think\nIt takes to make that kind of timing in a horror movie\nWork what is it\nWhat does it take to make a horror movie work these are secrets that only the Brotherhood knows I Can't oh come on you can tell me something well look to make it really simple uh there are no rules for any horror film\nThe horror horror movies come out of the story and horror is every action think of it that way not a genre necessarily go to a reaction to things\nAnd that if the story is is unfolding then you use the story telling to uh\nIf you get the audience in suspense and you can scare them\nSo maybe the key is having a story it's got enough of the right elements to make me feel that suspense so that they're there can be that pay off so that there can be the scare is that it\nThat is correct you got it what about the music you contributed music to this film and and the music to the original in Nineteen Seventy eight what does it take to make that kind of music work for a scary movie\nWhat does it take it takes a certain amount of talent and ability to play musical instruments and a feeling for him\nThat's what it takes now were you always musically inclined when you put the original movie Halloween together Nineteen Nineteen Seventy eight or was it somebody to kind of came together unexpectedly\nNo I I grew up in a musical household my father was a music professor he was a [noise] a virtuoso violin player and he had taught the college\nLevel music courses at the university where I grew up I grew up with music in the house all the time classical music listening to it\nHe decided when I was about eight years old and I should learn to play the violin it was only one problem with that and I had no talent other than that it was a great idea\nBut I moved on from the violin and piano and tar and other things I picked a lotta stuff up\nWere there any particular influences that you draw on when you made the music for the original Halloween or that you've drawn on over the years\nYes I'm all classical a\nMovie composers and classical ... ah musicians and rock and roll I'd get influenced everywhere\nWhat about the timing I did this theme to the original Halloween is not in a plain old for for the time it's in five four time it's an odd kind of time's signature was what drew you to that\nMy father taught me five four time uh when I'm\nUnusual just straightforwardly unusual timing side\nAdaptor that time's signature during the piano and we'll\nWe're speaking to John ... the director of dozens of horror classics including probably some of your favorites Halloween to thing Christine prince of darkness escape from New York\nAlso a
