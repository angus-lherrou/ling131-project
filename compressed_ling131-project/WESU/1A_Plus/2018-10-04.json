released to the public and there are no plans at this point according to the Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley for any of this to be made public a just quite clearly a\nFair amount of interest among Democrats to make this public and certainly I think among the Trump a chunk of the American public to to learn what's in there of what we do know is that publicly at least\nA six people

you and Palestine ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center he's also with us here in Studio Paolo thanks to you for being here pleasure to be a well Brian you're the one in Sao paulo so let me give you on her ... year to start\nA let's start with the nitty gritty who is ... and our most Americans might not be familiar with him\nAnd ... so now is a retired army captain who has been in Congress for nearly three decades\nNow I'm ... despite having sat in Congress ...\nFirst so much time he he shows ... open loading for uh for the legislative body I mean he has said over the years numerous times that the Congress is dysfunctional and it should be closed um he's also advocated torture of his political or of leftists and\nAnd other political opponents 'em and you know that message for a long time was was regarded as marginalized here I mean he was not a popular figure\nBut in the last couple of years because of this historic economic crisis that you mentioned Todd those messages um are resonating a lot more with people\nWhen they did in the past and now here we are with this presidential election coming up on Sunday\nAnd he has a ten point lead and all over his nearest rival it looks like there will be a runoff vote which would be on October twenty eighth and that one is that went to a close call right now between him and and the guy who's likely to face with this Fernando had died\nBut it's it's just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty ten to twenty Fifteen and this seemed like just sexist\nIn Nineteen eighty five\nBut being here this week and talking to people I mean I there's a lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our even if it does mean a return to you know the more authoritarian ways of the past year\nSome people [laughter] both wrote a brine we're going to work on your sky blind a little bit of will will get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to a Monica what about Fernando had died in in contrast he's not as\nFiery ... of course ... has been described by some as Trump being or maybe more akin to ... in the Philippines likes to waive guns around the the drug dealers should be shot or threatens to summer summarily execute them what about his opponent for for of Fernando ... what do we know about him\nSo what we know about him um is that he's not a an organic member of the Workers Party the P. T. um he's someone who sort of an outsider when you look at the composition of the beach the far left though\nHe's not he's a moderate um but the leadership of the Workers Party of the PTA currently it very radicalized so it's very different\nFrom the time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty oh three I'm twenty ten when the party really did take the tortoise center left than so the party itself now is very much hard left um the candidate though isn't it\nUm that think that the the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that\nThere is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so a lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist both done our oh I'm In the anti P. T. vote so\nThese elections are very strange because they have become elections about not who nuts\nTalk about corruption and we're going to talk about graft we are going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to\nThe idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking billions of dollars in bribes which has been a major problem we're going to talk all about that Apollo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do\nCome out to the polls what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think there are more weary than uh the ties in terms of going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally the eighty percent of the voters show up\nOr we may have less of a proportion this time\nOr one important feature here is how many voters will spoil their their vote will leave it blank were cancelled oval because that is important\nWhoever gets the fifty percent of the valid votes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday\nOr with Bush will not when they more like the according to the late the schools is that we go to a runoff\nBut the mood people are angry people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political collapsed in Brazil or regardless if they are the last from the left from their rights are from the center people feel absolutely the fed up with politics with politicians\nAnd that there is no alternative because there is not going to be a military coup in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics\nNow Brian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean\nIn guns around as I mentioned he he likes to fantasize about his opponents or for drug dealers receives\nBeing shot that there's been some actual violence in this campaign last month ... was actually stabbed at a campaign rally or what happened there and what's happened since how has it affected his standing among voters in Brazil\nIn a way I mean it was adding all of us were paying to see a political violence at that level and I was personally awful for for both so narrow he he almost\nDied by his own account and and those are the doctors that treated him politically I think it's fair to say that it was helpful um because the plan by\nThe more centrist candidates in this race was to spend these last couple of weeks attacking both so narrow as much as possible and on TV ads and elsewhere and and because of this attack against him and because of the resulting\nPublic sympathy\nThey really had to tone down or in some cases eliminate totally their attacks it's also allowed both in our out to stay fairly quiet and not articulate his plans what he would do if he gets elected as much as he otherwise would have had to I mean he he there is a huge probably the biggest presidents\nRights here on W.

T. they go back to the impeachment of earth that as one major argument for why you know think that the Workers Party has been let's say unfairly treated in the way that the that that things have gone down\n[noise] Matt writes to us or on email I had a Brazilian friend years back who called his home country\nThe greatest country that never was meaning that Brazil has had such riches in terms of natural resources but it is not had the government or the leadership to make it a competitor with the United states up Paulo Matt makes a good point Brazil was celebrated\nAs the rising star not only of Latin America but of emerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned it at the top are now horrible recession horrible corruption what happened in Brazil where was to Brazil that that hosted the Olympics in was and was on the way up\nWell I think Brazil believe too much in the magic that it's a country protests and to be great and forgot to do the necessary things you do in order to build that country or one of the major betrayal is precisely the workers bar too far to the was led\nBy a man born into poverty a that to build this very successful ... own initially ethics in politics\nThere is this sense after Brazil a ... a basic ... riding a woman\nOver two was reduced and that is what led to this impression that Brazil was unstoppable well a\nThan reality hits a ruler made a very bad choice when his successor a and a a lot of a shot to came\nAnd the magic would disappear or what we have today is a consequence and this is what I think what that she'll be positive and all of this we cannot blame others for our problems this crisis was produced in Brazil by Brazilians\nAre and another thing that this whole thing should be positive\nIs the fact that the states in Brazil he's basically broke\nAnd we have run off the money ah all that dream now has to be has ended and the nightmare has to be confronted from a ... reality ... basis where the government has run out of money we have to adjust the economy the measure are necessary to do that are very\nOff an unpopular and\nNone of the candidates have explain exactly why the holiday planned to come from the\n... now Bryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Bryan that you recently wrote where you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in two sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion which too many BS privileges for the elite\nNot enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that tourists conclusion\nIf you look around right now at the field of candidates there's there's one thing that all Brazilians agree on which is that they find the candidates running for president to be an inspiring um the vast majority of people here as we've said during the program I feel like they're voting against somebody rather than voting\nDuring that era when things were going really well which you've mentioned tied the degree of cynicism the degree of disbelief that people have in our system of government is just amazing and you know it's part of a global trend I mean we've seen this happen in places like turkey in Hungary and elsewhere around the world\nBut this democratic recession as some people have called it really is especially strong here and that makes sense because Brazil is taking a bigger beating um in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its politicians because of this\nCorruption scandal than virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the\nPew Research center and twenty Seventeen that found that just eight percent of Brazilians say representative democracy is a very good form of government that was the lowest of thirty eight countries the ... that you surveyed\n... and it just shows you the climate here right now and the reason why many people fear that both denaro if elected would basically have carte blanche to take a you know hard right turn it could involve the curtail north of civil civil liberties and and and other things\nI I and my time I'm this week\nUm I've had meetings with people from civil society and the press and others who you know these are serious people not prone to panic or anything like that who are talking openly about the possibility of exile and this just blew me away I mean it it's a Brazil that I've read about in history books you know going back to previous periods of military\nRule Nineteen sixty four was the last two I thought that that was real Brazil that had been firmly relegated to the history books and you know maybe\nMaybe maybe they are maybe it is getting a little\nBit melodramatic in some quarters but but they're real fears and and and people are scared right now well Brian you mentioned a statistic that was disturbing only eight percent to ...\nHis emails us why are we so concerned about the right versus the left in Brazil both in our is another ... he's an air to wanna ... all these dictator dictator wannabes who were being resurrected in Europe and Asia and now in Latin America all of them are loads for their corruption their narcissism\nAnd a total lack of democracy\nAnd Paolo in the United states it's been said more than once\nThat a ... is a Brazilian version of Brazilian analog of president Donald Trump they're both right wing they're both populists

Clinton in the run up to the presidential elections in Nineteen Ninety two or the deceased late Christopher Hitchens went to Oxford with Bill Clinton said the idea that Bill Clinton didn't inhale at

you're smart you know the budget that we're in for\nYou have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of the woman you are dead men walking\nOf the Republican Party he would quipped to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough to survive as a Republican Party of the future meaning Republicans had your broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics flash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it anymore\nStunning what does this transformation that Lindsey Graham hulk vacation in the Trump beer at shady you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean I think it\nMe that the divide is deepening and you know did tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to that you saw in the two thousand election and I say that we've lived with a sense\nThey're only going deeper and the moment you talked about there in twenty twelve after the twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally look to the Mitt Romney's last a brac Obama included what you know what Lindsey Graham did it demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just that he won the general election to lead to a huge part of it but the fact that he was able\nTo sweep through the Republican Party like other primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham didn't run for president in twenty sixteen one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that less than their of going head to head against Trump of dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe that we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand ... than granted more than just name calling and upright\nLindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator for one more term or is he is he converted what she thinks I mean look there's there there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know but I'll give you a couple of them that that that that jumped out at me one is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his in during popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons\nTo Republican officeholders if you're taking a major major risk\nIf you are seen as separating yourself from this president your neck primary especially if you're Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being\nA being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there is also the theory that hey part of this is Lindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you're if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises uh if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you're a golf with him\nMaybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons is too is is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump than twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing Donald Trump win the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think ... Lindsey Graham and just brought more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically\nKennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacture them fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if when he closed his eyes at night whether he's changed his mind about that or not James sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good\nExpress their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and in Steve you're not him because that does not sound surprising to you yeah what what he's describing his ticket splitting yeah at the end political science they the voters who go and they\nA Democrat for president Republican for Congress that they split up the ballot\nJust election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket\nHas been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at the single digits right now and in that that is just the rise of polarization his rival is All right let's get back in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve corner you so much of what your book is about\nUh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are I'm led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have\nA when he was a young rabble rousing congressman\nWho was willing to defy the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house to the end times bigger from Massachusetts the legendary Tip O'Neill\nMy partner's maker as you pointed out to us again yesterday are in charge of this house\nIf you are saying to me the euro postmaster isn't capable of delivering from one member to another the male and the system you run\nThen I think you may want to appoint a commission to look into the post office\nNow maybe a veiled insult there that might take a little bit of parsing but give it back story and why Newt Gingrich was slinging an insult at a well respected and legendary Tip O'Neill yeah that that in hindsight now you look back Thirty years and you play you may say well what was the big deal to deal with Democrats had run the Congress at that point for Thirty years\nThey were seen as the permanent majority I mean Republicans weren't just the minority party they were buried deep they weren't even close you didn't go into an election saying maybe the Republicans will get it maybe they won't it was like maybe they'll get to a hundred Seventy feet for this you know that that was how deep in the minority they were in here was Gingrich um who was in his third term\nSunday nights at seven thirty PM only I'm W E s U Middletown gated point one FM\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Rhodes Scholar\nA beef scholar dot org slash

top Republican on the Senate Judiciary committee says the FBI has turned up nothing to corroborate allegations that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was involved in sexual assault in high school and another instance of sexual misconduct in college\nThere is nothing in it that we didn't already know said Senator Chuck Grassley adding\nThere's also no contemporaneous evidence\nThis investigation found no hint of misconduct and the same is true of the six prior FBI background investigations conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service that was Chuck Grassley chairman of the Judiciary Committee I was quoting their\nRanking member on the Senate Judiciary committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California disagrees she says it looks to be the product of an incomplete investigation\nThat was limited perhaps by the White House Dianne Feinstein ranking member expect much more on this throughout the day on your NPR station\nI Want to turn back to Steve ... in just a moment but before we do a quick appeal for some help with the program in the works for next week here on one day we spend a lotta time yesterday talking with women about how society views angry women and there's a broad range of opinion but most of the women were hearing from our progressive and liberals\nIf you're a conservative woman tell us how your seeing this moment what have you got to say how do you want to be heard in the fight over Brett Kavanaugh and in the fight over me to the discussions over me to in this country do you think your views are being represented\nWho describe themselves as broadly conservative what do you want the country to hear about you tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a that's eight five five to three six one two one two will make sure to get your stories on the air part of the national conversation in the days ahead here on one day\nWhile we're talking for the most part about what politician said and did in the Nineteen Ninety so how do they define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington it's polarized we've been asking listeners for memorable moments from politics in the nineties and and here's one\nAnd the president is right\nIn many ways we are a shining city on it\nBut the hard truth is but not everyone is sharing in this city's splendor and glory\nThere is this fair Mr President\nAnd the faces that you don't stay\nIn the places that you don't visit\nAnd your shining city\nAnd believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from ... the early nineties I take you back towards any whole [noise]\nSoon to be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety two on the Arsenio Hall show remember him are sending a hall before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because the president appeared on our city hall but he seemed to offer an alternative to ... even ... you\nHere was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nIt was also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second but in third place in the presidential race at that point versus what Ross Perot a second place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton it so they were his team he remembered that Bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Jennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of\nSlick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer Li try this scheme is way out of\nA out of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around\nInterviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers in the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall which was very hard at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd it was Ninety two it wasn't just starts anew Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot\nWho was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began in February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King Larry King and and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was on and February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent\nIn just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about\nIn first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nClinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show\n'em in George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show that night well we won't be doing anything like that\nAnd Arsenio Hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that went went after it was beneath the President's Day yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not\nThat's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign that Bush wasn't do in our studio by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message um\nPoliticians now managed media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality Brock Obama had a winning personality an affable nice guy and used it\nTo great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon just even cold there there isn't a show that Iraq Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than than maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public have\nChanged just radically changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or send your home and I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier\nAnd the rise of Gingrich net moment with O'Neill what that moment came from was Gingrich looking for a way around what at the time were the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich third term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to\nFind and develop a relationship with a new audience draw a line from that and how Gingrich was able to build his career his rise in the house around that fast forward to Donald Trump or did Donald Trump do\nIt television obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter\nDonald Trump identified through Twitter away to go around not just the news media but the entertainment media is well it's it's so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties with CSPAN and Trump was doing with Twitter and and I think there's a real common thread there well\nLet's go back then in the way way back machine one more time\nTo Nineteen Ninety nine Donald Trump who was people forget was involved with politics even at the time he flirted mentally and even in reality with presidential run long before he was ever successful he went on meet the press\nBack in Nineteen Ninety nine and had some thoughts about somebody that we've already talked about Pat Buchanan the insurgent right wing politician in the Republican Party\nFor his had little love ... I guess he's an anti Semite he doesn't like the black sea doesn't like the gays I I I it's just incredible that\nAnybody can embrace this guy and maybe I'll get four or five percent of the vote and it'll be a really staunch right wacko vote I'm not even sure if it's right it's just a lack of and I just can't imagine that anybody can take him seriously\nDonald Trump sounded than about ... you can and how John McCain sounded about Donald Trump", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Middletown", "day": "04"}
