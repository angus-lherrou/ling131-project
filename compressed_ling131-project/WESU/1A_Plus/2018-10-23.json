I. N. F.\nThe intermediate range nuclear forces treaty\nIt's meant to prevent the u._s. or Russia from developing certain types of nuclear missiles but President Trump says the deal is passed its expiration date\nWhere are the ones that have said in the agreement and we bonded have agreements with Russia is not going to germinate they were going to pull out\nWhat has the INS treaty meant for national security and what would it mean for the U.S to end it\nCan aid Ullman was President Reagan's arms control director when this treaty was signed he's also a former U.S ambassador to the United nations\nAnd the author of Reagan at Reykjavik forty eight hours that ended the Cold War will come back to want to thank you good pronunciation there ... ... ... you make yeah now spell it I don't know what on paper right here I'll put it down and then just say I know how to spell Reykjavik I also know that some of you will have questions about the INS treaty\nNot one of those treaties you hear a lot about will get the basics\nFrom a master eight I'm In but we will be discussing this just for the first part of the program so we welcome your questions and thoughts about this right away email us one a at W.

I. S. T. O. X. dot com\nJohnson we're speaking to ... former U.S ambassador to the un and the author of Reagan at ... let's get to a few more of your questions about this treaty before we move on to speaking with General Stanley McChrystal quite a few people ask questions\nLike what Catherine asked on our website the one eight dot org Catherine rights is this an actual treaty if it is wouldn't that be Congress this territory not Trump's\nAnd Andrew tweeted is two thirds of the Senate required to withdraw from the treaty\nThose are good questions uh and uh it's unclear in the constitution what Congress's role would be in getting out of a treaty yet this is the treaty yes it was ratified\nOr by the Senate a and a Nineteen eighty seven actually in Nineteen eighty eight who signed by Gorbachev and Reagan and the White House with Trump presidents in Nineteen eighty seven a but\nIt has been established over the years that to get out of the treaty or is the president's discretion in Congress has no role in that\nCan you put this into a little bit more context for us I mean I I think it's hard at least for me as someone who only sees nuclear proliferation from the outside\nTo know where in my mind to hold all these different potential threats there's the threat from Russia there is a threat from North Korea there's a potential of a threat from China who knows what all terror organizations might be trying to ... closer to a nuclear weapon\nIn the scheme of things where should we put this treaty in in our minds like in the hierarchy of the various nuclear threats that the world faces where where does it it it's\nJust pretty high I'll tell you why because it's restrained by the United states and Russia against the whole class of nuclear weapons okay to me the highest in your uh pantheon of nuclear ah treaties and nuclear threats ah\nSpread of nuclear weapons okay we don't want the nuclear weapons just spread and are buying large that's been pretty successful Joshua uh the fact is in Nineteen sixty three President Kennedy gave a speech in which he said by Nineteen Seventy there would be twenty five nuclear weapon states\nBy Nineteen Seventy okay today they're about six seven\nAnd so we've done a lot better than people expected and that gets back to Parkinson's a to me the best law that the success of a policy is measured Best Buy those disasters that do not into\nAnd the ... the liberation of nuclear weapons was a disaster that did not into it so that was pretty successful\nIt also seems like just the fact that a treaty could be reached between parties was was a victory I mean you know and they're a little tense right now\nRight it was and certainly the\nWeekend in record back in October eleventh and twelfth and Nineteen eighty six that document in my book and thank you for mentioning it\nAh that will be turned into a movie felonies June\nA is an exciting rollercoaster of up and down and emotions up as caught up and down views are in what's thought to be a haunted house in Iceland that produced the treaty that we're talking about today it was a real taffy tug\nOf for the whole weekend we spent from eight o'clock at night\n'til six thirty the next morning going over the details and faster and I could report to the president\nThe next morning on the attack Tobar twelfth Nineteen eighty six we have accomplished more last night in one night than we have in seven years of constant negotiations with the Russians it was just a whale of a weekend\nWe move on and we'll be speaking to stay in General Stanley McChrystal at a moment about his new book on leadership and I wonder if\nHere is President Reagan at that meeting in Nineteen eighty seven\nThe importance of this treaty transcends numbers we have listened to the wisdom of in an old Russian maxim and I'm sure you're familiar with it too\nMuch Mr general secretary though my pronunciation may give you difficulty the maximum is Joao vi no pro vi trust but verify [noise]\nAs much as they say is you end up all\nThe pattern every meeting [noise]\nFrom the meeting a Nineteen eighty seven between Ronald Reagan and Rick how Gorbachev give us a sense of the leadership styles of Reagan and Gorbachev that allow this treaty to come to fruition\nWell when you think of Ronald Reagan or you think of a man who is extremely decent\nAnd a conservative Republican incompetent he was just a very competent person\nOr when you think of ... a Gorbachev he was a communist uh but overall a decent person who wanted to do something at that time they were both very different from the president we have now Joshua or in the sense that um\nYou know when I was in government uh mothers and fathers wanted their kids to grow up like Ronald Reagan maybe not the policies maybe they didn't agree with the policies\nBut the decency of demand the humble and is the man the genuine niceness of him and today even if you're agreeing with Trump's policies which I don't but even if you do I don't think any mother father wants their kid to grow up to be like a Donald Trump or\nThis is probably sorry are probably some who said he and openly quality and the president or they're hard to\nSay though their world disguised Joshua and or the decency the kindness of Reagan who really loved it\nOf wonderful immigrants coming to our country and his whole address was about immigration how wonderful it was\nHe was a fanatic about a free trade or not having ... at any time and he was very intense it's drying reduce government spending and reduce especially the deficit all those things were\nClassic conservative classic\nRepublican and um none of them are being followed by this so called Republican\nI'm Donald Trump but anyway the style of Reagan was a child that made somebody like me very proud to serve him and very proud to be there with him on that weekend in record back in Ninety six\n... author of Reagan had Reykjavik forty eight hours that ended the Cold War also the arms control director for President Reagan and former U.S ambassador to the UN ambassador ... thanks for talking to us okay now learn how to spell recommend are extra wide I'll work on it I think very much very good bye [noise]\nTwo Confederate General Robert e and the Reverend Dr Martin Luther king junior have in common\nAccording to retired General Stanley McChrystal they are both leaders worth studying

A. M. U. dot org General McChrystal I Want to follow up on something I heard in that montage I ... I recall some people using the word leader\nAnd some using the word hero and I wonder if we need to distinguish between that dock at a tweeted if a quote unquote leader fails to leave but makes people do what they have to do by using threats intimidation or fear are they still called leaders shouldn't they be called anything else but leaders\nI get the sense General McChrystal from reading your book that those people could still be leaders we just might not think of them as being very heroic in their leadership\nI think that's right I mean we broaden the term leader to be people in roles and people who get people to do things even though that may be bad things so we don't say leaders are good or bad we stayed or effective or not because\nYou can have some pretty negative people ugly objectives who effectively lead people in that direction think Adolf Hitler if we really step back and say because some of the names and the ideas and the montage there were tremendous\nWe think back when we want from our leaders what should we want from our leaders\nThe day I retired from the military I had never met President Bush forty one and yet he called me on the phone just to tell me he thought it would be a difficult day and then a short conversation he just reached out to somebody in an incredibly thoughtful way he made me feel better\nI think we want our leaders to make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better\nSometimes that's not the leader who rubbed your belly and tells you you know it's everybody else's fault and you can get you deserve more sometimes it's a leader who's a little tough on you that\nWorks you physically really harder makes you go in harm's way but at the end of it you sit back and you go you know\nI'm Better or for that yeah I'm a bit better than I Would otherwise be they ask much sometimes they demand a lot but typically they give alongside to us and and if we\nWe frame leaders in that way and look in the mirror and say are we demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask winter many questions about our society today\nIn the book there are three minutes that you're trying to tear down in terms of the way that we think about leaders let's go through them one at a time one is called the formulaic mess which is basically this idea that leadership can be boiled down to a formula you argue that it's much more can textual right\nAbsolutely you can have this list of traits or behaviors\nAnd the leader can use them and on Monday they can work and on Tuesday go to the same organization but the context it's changed the followers are in a different place and it doesn't work at all so in reality a leaders got to be constantly adapting themselves to meet the needs of the team and the situation\nThe second one is the attribution myth you write that we attribute too much to leaders and we give them we use the kind of tunnel vision as you describe but what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty ten and I thought I was writing the play of my life and that would be easy 'cause I was there and how would therefore be the star\nBut when we did all the interviews the background to get the other parts of the stories in many cases I had made a decision and there'd been announced coming either for thought I should get credit or blame for that but I found out all the other people who had done things I didn't even know about and the other factors that have played upon that\nWhat I concluded with the leaders still part of it I mean I was still a key part of it but I wasn't the dominant part and so we find today\nAre the all the other things in this situation or putting shadows I think we make a mistake if we assume that the leader of caused the great thing to happen or as ultimately responsible for the failure there just a part of it\nAlthough I Would say that based on one of the leaders you profile in the book Walt Disney there are some leaders who want it that way Disney did not credit his other animators initially in the Philly symphonies and the short films that led up to Snow White and the seven dwarves so he kind of you kind of wanted it that way\nWhich is very common I mean if you think about it every body a little bit like the the spotlight likes to be on the pedestal so it's a natural thing and Walt Disney after the success of Snow White for what she did an extraordinary job of pushing his team to create at a masterpiece\nHe wanted the basket and that and it was a natural problem but it caused a huge problems just four years later in a bitter strike in Nineteen forty one\nWhich we can to General Stanley McChrystal from NPR in New York the co author of leaders myth and reality that third myth you call the results myth which says that leadership is the process of driving people toward an outcome why is that a myth don't results matter\nWill results matter and we claim that that's how we collect or choose to follow leaders whether they get a good bottom line or whether they win battles or win elections but in reality\nThe data doesn't support that we tend to follow leaders even though many er serial failures or their outcomes are often much less than they want them to be or have said that they are\nIt's really on the followers to understand this because leaders tend to feel some place in us and emotional requirement for us they give a vision for the future we're much less analytical and demanding of actual results than we think we are\nEmailed a good leader is no\nUh John Maxwell describes in the five levels the leadership basically the fifth level to the top two levels are about replicating yourself in other people but I Wonder where you see that a lot of the leaders that you profiled weren't necessarily looking to replicate themselves and others it it it\nIs something you don't see often it up Martin Luther king Junior's puppies success story there when he was murdered in Nineteen sixty eight the movement went on headed suddenly stopped in his last than I think it would have said something\nOn the other hand if you look at Margaret Thatcher she was a very successful female politician and Britain in a tough time for a female politician she became the most famous prime minister since Winston Churchill she was extraordinarily

from that oh so that uh acquaintance\nShip with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he is threatened to run and now in times past then\nIts support Romney 'cause you know I decided not the right time for me to run for president\nSo there's something a little ... about the word threatened not he loved the idea or he hinted at a rally\nThreatens yeah that's they go back and look at some of the cage when he was running in two thousand for the reform party it was a threatening to run that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know if you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president but sort of like that sort of a threat but uh\nYou know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to cost them on something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person has a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature of the other

ideas that he felt that we are very smart people on the other side and that always understanding the other side's ideas made a person sharper and and by the way if I got to the other side and it we can my argument\nThat I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument is that you know what I'm looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going\nA lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like\nFrom well when there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press is the communications director where you tried\nTo convince the president said to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you said that it pushed back is normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the ...\nIf you have in it he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for hand full that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda\nNo no no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know\nLike if you if you if you've read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in the air was to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so\nHaving the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power you know that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department and my ... plan is the online somewhere somebody lead did so it it's out there was a ... page plan\nThat basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press and servicing all parts of the press who didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything I only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call on CNN had been called on for several weeks\nAnd I want to send a message to those people that hey we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room we're open for business\nOn and you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I built my own business and you know came from scratch so I went in the square out at the I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it well I think what ended up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted to previous and ban and out of there I made a very big gaffe when he put Kelly in the job\nHe was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president and even if I accepted a subordinate role which I Would have been happy to do 'cause I'm a team player I don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm On you\nYou don't have to answer the question I'm staying rhetorical\nHaving you know your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points for him to even be on that list but it's not going to like me any more than he likes to preserve it all your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press\nHe could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean I get the sense that the president just\nDidn't agree with it [noise] um no actually\n... you know there's a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on I'm sitting in the oval office with um the ten am meeting where I've been announced as the ... over a Tim in Iowa alone in the office\nI'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press corps he looks at me and says hey I have a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's gone so poorly in the first six months\nI listen to what you declared war on the media and you can't declare war on the media for ... going to lose that war\nSecondarily any a president that made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up\nEverybody gets in a defensive posture I said well we're way better served if we dial that down or any other thing is the president is a TV star a people may not like me saying that about him\nBut for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I liked seeing him in areas where he'd outside of that style box of conservatism let him parity with allegedly fall let him\nHave a real conversation with a crust Cuomo or somebody like that I mean he doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had him in position to do that then the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also a lot of people don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in the way of uh\nTelling these like ... and him telling these\nStories that are on average ... may be a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is that oh okay that's right 'cause I'm On saying inaccurately and and clearly in consistently over the top ... list and I just left a morning show where these guys like like they\nThey really want them all day and night and so and they're calling them a rank liar and I get it I mean he does state things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energized and I understand that and I understand if you're a military leader like somebody like John Kelly\nThat would probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want all that stuff to be dial down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to\nSo so but but we had to do that as you got to tell him straight yesterday man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta stayed straight but what he'll say back to you as well as energizing my base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote\nOr and and this is always going to be a battle as long as Donald J Trump is to present the United states is going to be a battle between\nPolicy and personality and the people that like his policy are going to take his personality and the people that don't like his policies are going to really focus on his personality and by the way there are some people were the personality is actually outweighing the policy where they're like okay look I Can't take the personality even though the policies are good ...\nTo a few more comments I Know we've only got you for a few more minutes but let me get to some more\nFrom our
