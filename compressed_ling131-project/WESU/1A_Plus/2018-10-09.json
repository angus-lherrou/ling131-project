McDonald an officer Van Dyke wore a particularly officer Van Dyke and what his record with like within the police department before all of this happened\nThe climate Donald was a Seventeen year old um he had he had a difficult life before before the shooting he um\nHe was in foster care here in Chicago a foster care system he was sort of in and out of juvenile jail but his friends describe him as a fun loving guy who was who was you know always sort of cracking jokes um and you know even though he was in the foster care system he he was mostly placed with family he grew up with his grandmother\nSaturday morning at seven I W E\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from bona with the bonus certified craftsman program a network of hardwood flooring contractor committed to expertise some customer service contractor locate her aunt more information or bono dot com [noise]\nAnd from it less than a collaborations software company powering teams around the world committed to providing the tools and practice says to help teams plan track build and work better together more at at Lausanne dot com\n\nNorth Carolina and the geo piece states super majority pushed a bill through last year to not release any body camera footage the public except for family members involved to view if I could make one law to increase mixed trust with the public this would be the one\nBe showing wrote on our Facebook page maybe the real issue here is that the criminal justice system in general and law enforcement in particular are being deployed to manage the effects of social and economic problems that they are ill equipped to resolve\nAnd death rode on our Facebook page as a white person who works in an office that staffs mostly black people\nHearing stories of police shootings scares me that one day I might lose a loved co worker just because of their skin color when I found out they found this men guilty I was elated it's time for bad cops to stop being protected killers\nJust go now I Know I had to cut you short before we pause my wonder if we do pick up with that comment and finding officer Van Dyke guilty it seems rare that officers are convicted after shooting someone under questionable circumstances what's the legal reason behind that\nWell there is a decision from the United States Supreme court that really is the\nKey to all of this and that is the decision that the court made many years ago Graham case that basically said that when you are determining whether or not an officers engaged in the use of excessive force it must basically\nTake the in the faith that the steps\nOf the state of the officer so it's a very subject that standard what\nWould a reasonable officer have done it in that situation so it is not in that ... that look is what is the officer feeling what is the officer seeing what is the officer experiencing so that's what the jurors are required to do it as a result you find very few judgments\nAnd prosecutors before they decide to to charge the officer have to look at the standard and say what would an officer reasonable officer in that situation has done so it is the Supreme Court that has set this world for all law enforcement agencies in the country\nAnd they were over Eighteen thousand separate police departments throughout the United states they all have different rules but they are all under the umbrella of whatever the Supreme Court said right of that is the rule that is out there now\nYou were by the way referring to the cases Graham versus Connor it's a case from a Nineteen eighty nine and some of you actually commented with regard to what's going on and officers mines like Peter Peter emailed\nIt seemed like today with the mentality of police officers that their life is paramount beyond all else including their safety I feel like whenever they are threatened with any sort of possible harm they use deadly force and it is somehow justified\nThis was a career in which they signed up for similar to the military were they know they're going to be put in harm's way to protect and serve the are paid for this\nLet's add one more voice to our conversation before we get to some more of your comments joining us now on the line is Shannon Spalding the Chicago police officer who was also a whistle blower within the department who worked undercover with the FBI Shannon welcome to the program\n[noise] thank you Joshua\nNo I understand you had been working as an FBI informants within the department and as a result of what happened that caused some of your fellow officers not to be too fond with you what what happened that caused such a stern did it have to do with with corruption inside the Chicago police department\n[noise] absolutely dash ... I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI and um I had discovered that some of my co op\n... operation brass tacks against some of my fellow officers who I used the term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer but they did have badges and ultimately that\nLed these officers one of them being a bus to go to federal prison and that made me very unpopular among the rank and file within to Chicago police department because\nBefore I came forward with operation brass tacks the code of silence was unheard of you didn't talk about it it didn't exist\nOr they tried to label man it's crazy for believing that this was actually going on within the ... the department so it made me very unpopular and lead to a lot of police retaliation\nI Wonder why that is from your\nPerspective I mean I Can't imagine I've never been a law enforcement officer have law enforcement in my family but I've never taken an oath so I Can't I'm speaking as an outsider\nBut I Would think you know if I knew that there were reporters who worked for my station who were lying in stories and they got caught I Would be grateful to see them go because of drugs all of us now why do you think it's not a similar mentality in law enforcement\nScale honestly a lot of police officers dead approach man they still talk to me and you are correct\nOn us police officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with corrupt officers however the code of silence is so strong within the Chicago police department and I feel that does go across departments nationwide that\nOfficers actually fear\nBreaking the code of silence is that there's this common misconception that it's a blue officers blue shirt common St officers going against other officers went actually I learned that the retaliation came from the top down\nBosses were actually\nInstructing the officers who were working with me not to back me up or they would be the next Shannon Spalding so out of\nFear of becoming me out of fear of retaliation themselves or putting their lives in danger losing their job what could happen to them they complied because they it it's easier and easier than going through everything that I had to go through and even though officers didn't\nWant to they thought they had to I had officers come up to me and say you know I Believe in what you're doing but I Can't be seen talking to you because I'll be next\nWe'll let me let me play a clip from the president of Chicago's fraternal order of police Kevin ground this what do you have to say after the conviction of officer Jason Van Dyke this clip comes from WB easiest podcast on the corner McDonald's case called sixteen shots here is Kevin ...\nWhat I Do I Do believe when some of the politicians over the last several years of use this case one foods and I want to remind everybody ran for millions of dollars every every every year and they use this case\nReally took ... which is unfortunate because I'm going to tell you this and\nThe men and women of the Chicago police department or some of the finest police officers in this country\nTake seriously\nWhat they do and they try and provide the best protection against\nFor ... the president of Chicago's fraternal order of police\nShouldn't I'd love to get your thoughts on what Kevin Graham said I mean it doesn't minimize the one with Donald takes at least for me but I Do kind of see what he's getting on in terms of getting a bad rap I mean if you want to see a positive portrayal of Chicago police you gotta watch NBC

O.\nBack now to our conversation with new Franklin chin and Spalding Patrick Smith and judge will doors Cordell let's get some more of your comments before we start kind of looking for to where the effort to improve policing in America might be going\nHe sailor tweeted the reasonable officer standard is a very easy standard to apply it's not that hard we do need to eliminate the criminal justice college major and higher police with degrees in psychology or sociology too many cops have no business carrying a badge and the gun\nHowever Galvin had these questions Galvin writes the question is what is reasonable does disobeying a police officer shouting orders constitute the right to use deadly force does a drug dealer running away from the police deserved to be shot\nWhile they may be criminals or the actions from the police equivalent to the criminals actions\nTo Cornell maybe you should respond to ... how do we start out you know minor sense what reasonable mess\nSaid well this is in the eye of the beholder it really has no one definition\nAnd what jurors are required to do is put themselves in the shoes of the officer and what was the officers that ... thing and oftentimes incidents happen and you know just a matter of a few seconds so it's there really is not one\nDefinition of it that but I Do want us to\nGet to something you said Joshua about looking ahead I Believe it's time to we imagine policing in America\nPolicing in America today is is quasi militaristic and police departments officers are seen as an occupying force especially in communities of color and in low income community that's not how policing started in this country policing started with individuals who lived in\nProvide a service and help the individuals in the community and it has dramatically changed we have police departments\nArmed to the teeth with tanks and all kinds of of the equipment that uh or commonly used in the military and I think it's time to to change this whole thing we need to start thinking outside the box why do we need police officers to basically a\nPatrol and and take care of traffic issues\nWhy can't that come from within the humidity why can't individuals' community members somehow ... ties to deal with with those kinds of things that the minor kinds of things that are happening in the community\nMuslim and I just go do and I'm not disagree with your just by way of doing some places where the lower level of sworn more informed off or worse when officer does deal with things like parking enforcement in traffic enforcement things that are less likely to require deadly force\nSure but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as this you know kind of a militaristic force and and they they do have a command structure and\n... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole\nImage we have of police being occupiers and look at a different model entirely I'm not opposed to criminal to criminal justice reform but look what happened we we get body cameras\nAnd what what happens while we have officers symbol\nOh don't turn their cameras on or we have places like Chicago where it takes more than a year and a court order ticket footage out on that for example in liquid shooting so that that the whole lack of transparency policing for example has very little sunshine\nThere's very little sunshine and policing\nGet that information and state I think that dovetails\nWith a comment that one of our listeners left for us Reggie who lives in Maryland left this in our inbox\nI talked to police both black and white and uh they seem to have this militaristic approach to the community I have had experiences where you know we just simply\nAnd I would rather have conflict with a with community rather than actually serve it I really think that they should you know take away the guns for the first couple of months but at least to buy cheap it's added a community without guns make them stand up comedian to force me to have a dialogue with community I think it'd be a lot better\nUh was certainly a community\nWhere did you thanks for calling in and sharing your thoughts with us Neal Franklin I Love you to respond to that but if I could first\nIf we could contrast what Reggie said with another set of comments that we've gotten from some of our listeners like what's scholar Rhodes Scholar writes\nPolice put their lives on the line every day protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the cases put forward by activists as examples of police brutality involve people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law I'll convict him but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the time\nNeal what would you say to folks who said that police work is inherently difficult inherently dangerous potentially deadly and then we as a public also have a role to play in easing the tension that officers feel about just being able to get home at night\nSo I Believe it was Reggie that left a message yes um you know that was such a brilliant comment because forcing the dialogue seat when you develop a relationship with those people you are serving the citizens who are serving and you get their support your job doesn't\nUm how it used to be having relationships walking up and down the street talking with citizens talking with the neighbors when something happens they support you when you have those relationships but when you have this occupying force\nWere you know none of the people are very few of the people the ones that you do know there's conflict on the under ... on the other end of that relationship\nThat's a problem this goes to community control policing that I mentioned before\nWhere the community steps the philosophy where the community sets the budget for\nThose in uniform river community decide to the the leader is going to be whether you call them achieve for commissioner or whatever where the community decides what's important where the community decides you know what we can handle these issues that the ground level\nWe just want you to pay attention to people hurting other people and this is how we want you to do that\nBut policing is very political it's political through the unions it's political through the mayors and governors and we'll never get to that place until the community decides they come together and say we want control over our police departments and this is how we want to do it\nHaving that oversight at the beginning means that you don't need police review boards at the end when something goes horribly wrong\nIs speaking of which we got some ideas from some of you about what could be done with regards to policing and review boards were part of it including on a larger scale\nJamie asked shouldn't there be a national group or board who could provide oversight over individual police department they could be an objective trusted advisory boards who's judgments both sides would trust and accept and to whom and aggrieved local citizens group could appeal\nPaolo tweeted police forces with their training transformed them from people's defenders into it\nThe enjoy this kind of music then this is

from time to time she told the New York times she doesn't agree with the president on anything but it's on everything but says there was a right and wrong way to address that will pick up the phone call them or meet with him in person\nShe will also be remembered in part for striking back at White House adviser Larry Kudlow who suggested she might have been confused regarding Russian sanctions she told Fox News with all due respect I don't get or if you don't get confused\nShe and the president met today at the White House she lavish praise on him and his family he was part of what ambassador Haley said\nCan't say enough good things about Jared non guy staring at that age\nThat no one understands I mean could read even after the all the way you can um what I'd done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so finally we done and I think it's a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the thing\nThat I Wish more people knew about the word that our country

believe it's become a pretty soon\nDividing line yeah cause everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural debate where we find other people's opinions and

be this one person I Do to keep my head down and get to not make waves I Need to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there\nAnd the minute that we started talking about emphasizing and being vulnerable and being urban and compassionate and knew that opens the door for me to say something about how I voted or you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love\nThat it's going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like\nIt's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of less\nI think you're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I've never seen anything meaningful or significant come from mouth shut had down\nIn my career\nThat's just not how we make contributions and so what we have to do is learn how to\nListen talk here each other and rumble and we use the term rumble 'cause it really feels like a rumble rumble with the vulnerability of seeing other people as people and being seen as a person and it's a muscle is a foundational skills that\nI don't think spending what ... what do we spend about ... about a half of our adult lives at work I don't think spending half of our adult lives in armor\nIs something that most of us are willing to do I think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high and we're not solving problems I\nThe address the problems from reading your book and be told the research that fueled the book a lot of what you describe points to that kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a scar yeah stars tough because the wind is tender right and so if there wasn't something tenders there'd be nothing to protect\nNo that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really\nIt was actually voided my hypothesis going in so where did you drop off yeah yeah it just it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at Jesse what I'm going to find but not in this case so\nWe asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders there it's a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred and fifty sea level global leaders three years building a daring leader assessments that people can see where they are and these were NBA and NBA students at Wharton\nKellogg Rice University and then tons of data evaluation data so I thought when when when\nIt was clear that the future of leadership is about courage we need braver leaders and more courageous cultures I thought the barrier was going to be fear but then we went and talked to several dairy leaders and said so you're not afraid very often and they were like\nI'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long\nAnd I was like so that blew my hypothesis of fear being the greatest barrier to dairy leadership the greatest barrier to daring leadership is armor\nIt's not the fear it's how we still protect when we're in the fear is the perfectionism that pleasing the defensiveness the anger\nThat having to be the nowhere and get everything right instead of being the learner um so really\nYou know and it's interesting what you said about scars intend to replace it not only does armor keep other people from seen us and sharing ourselves\nAnd metastasized so\nWe need to create were cultures where armor is not rewarded or needed\nWe asked some of you to call in and tell us about your workplaces here's what two of our listeners left in our inbox first let's hear from Adam\nMy name is Adam and I'm calling from Nashville, Tennessee I'm a paramedic and firefighters and as

lead with regards to arm or Monday sold emailed can you address the differences between armor and establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah I mean boundaries are actually a big part of this box because down trees are incredibly important um we defined it very simply as what's OK and what's not OK and so armor is not about\nProfessional management of south it's not about four going boundaries armor is about defense and it is I Am going to put the protection of my ego\nBefore doing right by this business and the work that we're doing together I meant to protect feeling good about myself\nOver moving our work forward to the difference between so\nIf you're on a more it's on a deeper level now it's\nOn a day but I mean the one of the greatest examples that armor armored leadership versus daring leadership has one form of armor we see a lot and folks is they need to be right that it's that I've got to be the ... and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being the learner and getting it right\nWe got a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into workplaces and hope emailed can you speak about the ways in which racial power structures and broader society that manifest themselves in the workplace\nDisproportionately impact the contributions of people of color in their work and the extent to which they progress in their careers before you answer here's one example professor ...\nAs a woman of color an immigrant and an academic I've learned that showing vulnerabilities and even my own resilience can and will be used against me by those in power would love to hear professor brown talk about overcoming that this trust\nWell here's what are the biggest findings I think is that\nOne of the greatest casualties of trauma\nIs the is the last of vulnerability and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic incident I mean racism homophobia poverty white supremacy I mean privilege\nThose are those are everyday traumas and it is real that ... that you know the armor that you need to survive those things Israel which is why if leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off and be seen\nThan we can't I mean gender is another you know I I think the kind of\nAnita Hill criticisms that happen after the Ford testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nOpposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of ...\nThe U.S um and I think that is a that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talk about\nCore values and I don't think any of us has worked at a company\nThat doesn't have some kind of mission statement or vision clarification or posters everywhere it's going to guess we're supposed to be and then\nIt really worth nothing more than the paper on which is printed I work at some companies wind been to some companies were their values statement was like Fifteen bullet points la I'm like well what what we're\nUsed to just that we should limit our core values to yeah just to and there's a long list in the book I'm trying to find it 'cause it's all on the list and I really struggled barrel down for my two why only two\nWell here's the big\nIf you don't offer racialized values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating then you just really do have a cat poster\nI mean it really is [laughter] it's just really a poster so like I'm a recording of my head but little tell yeah [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old that I Know it [laughter] you know and so what\nDo you know operation allies values into behaviors\nFewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with had actually done that have taken the time to say you know what are some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in and so the two is\nReally kind of backing into the data the men and women\nWho had the capacity to be the most courageous could identify their values\nThey had two to three values and you know I ...\nWe also the dignity diversity independence self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYeah so there's probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list at our super important to me but when it comes down to it my two Corvette my core values for me or faith encourage and I know that the core values because it's the place where every other thing on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we have an we have a companion work buckets free downloadable it's on my Web site where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operational lives an end to behaviors\nUm it has changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them\nAnd then we have our company values and that's actually how we assessed you every quarter\nWhich one of the values that you were to do it\nLike for example one of our values is take good care taking care of each other ourselves in the community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talked to people\nI mean you either do it or you don't and so I think it goes back to something we haven't talked about yet that as a real core finding which his courage is one hundred percent teachable\nEach of the skill sets are behavioral and can be taught it learning how to rumble with on her ability living into your values which we're talking about right now it's braving trust understand how to talk about trust and breaking it down so we can talk about the anatomy of trust and learning how to rise how to get back up on your feet after a fall or a setback\nYou need to clear the trial use I mean I I Would be fast foods and know what you look me right now for my core values are because\nOr based on who I Am the work I Do like I guess one sure catcher I sure OK face no\nThere's not one of my records but it's incompetent what am I to call was but no I didn't tell us what you see like I don't know maybe I should maybe I shouldn't and we're talking about ... I Know but I'm the host I don't have to do any I'm just I'm In charge here here we got ... no not OK okay fine I'll tell you what the\nFreedom and growth those are my two values\nAnd give me an example out of behavior that supports freedom\nUm well\nFor me being out more one thing yeah ports freedom I'm being a better", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "09"}
