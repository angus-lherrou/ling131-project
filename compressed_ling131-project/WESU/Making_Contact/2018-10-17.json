younger with the average age being four years old additionally there's new specific treatment for the disorder and long term outcomes are unknown [noise]\nWell that does it for our headlines today\nAfter the break we'll go to Florida to discuss the impacts the hurricane Michael with Tonya the looney of junk just will also dig into the climate change denialism a Florida governor Rick Scott Lynn argues correspondent I ruined ... will give us a report on the recent controversy appearance of the founder of a hate group\nAnd then of course Hurricane Katrina [noise] um and you know so we can actually remember those um and now and a lot of just two years we've had at least four major massive storms and and more that I Know I'm missing\nAbsolutely the number of intensity definitely we've seen it that\nWe know that warm water fuel or the you know the warming nutrition waters we know the level rise a contributor to storm surge in tribute to the level right that we know all of these things are happening right in front of our eyes we're not talking about some future climate change quite you're you're living at right now\nNow what impact has there been seeing on the discourse in Florida a of the laws that Rick Scott passed in the last several years I mentioned to be a ban on the term climate change global warming and old state documents on Web sites and then also the\nWhat had been called a sort of anti science along\nIt really is a big picture that you have to look at because we have had a governor who had cut funding for the department of environmental protection refused to talk about her knowledge climate change uh gotten better experts in the field a really tried to treat the agency much in the way that the Trump Administration and the EPA\nAnd what that has done is really um\nSomething that has gained more traction that people are talking about though because the environmental consequences are right in our faces right now we're talking about stores but we've also had the massive red tide and algae bloom of fit chill scene in different parts of the state some of that now drifting to the north west as well\nMajor major impact on the light on coastal communities on on fishermen and in that industry tourism real estate\nAnd I think that people are really starting to see\nThat these things are tangible they're there in our state we cannot ignore them\nI'm so glad you brought up the issue of the toxic algae or we'd been covering that on our program ah several months ago that issue of course it hasn't gone away\nUm and so when you have these kinds of phenomenon um are you seeing ordinary people in Florida it's up you know even if they even if they previously believed tricks God believe Donald Trump excel at a steam beer mind changed\nWhen they're personally impacted because unfortunately\nThat's often what's required in order for people to actually change their minds about issues when they become personally affected by it sounds\nAbsolutely and it's not unlike the hurricane situation will be fined or something because\nThe state government here in Florida will tell us that a red tide and an algae blooms are naturally occurring while yes and no they can happen in New Jersey Shore but the intensity the severity the frequency of what we have seen this year absolutely not not is not simply naturally occurring\nMe are contributing to that we have the run off the pollution a fertilizer Newark that uh are feeding these plumes that we call them algae blooms which doesn't sound so bad algae blooms are actually a form of bacteria and bacteria and the red tide pretty talk and so we're talking about real threat\nThe case to don't these sorts of\nClimate change phenomenal impact\nPoor people disproportionately what is the an impact on poor folks there was a a really great um peace and Associated Press showing the impact on war Floridians from hurricane Michael\nMany of whom don't have the means to evacuate when the call is put in to evacuate they may have nowhere to go there's a story of one woman who\nHad insurance that might actually cover the damage that her house a stain but doesn't have a cell phone to call the insurance company I was heartbroken when I read that story of poor people are always impact the disproportionate to even though they had the least hand in creating a problem right\nThat is absolutely true and these are heartbreaking story and we're thinking about very basic like ... ... you mentioned communication around looking at water scarcity access to power\nThe communities are hit hardest at when we need to not only a remedy the problem but also to access to resources they need more merit and nurse dire situation\nWhat is needed now in Florida in the short term and at the long term what would you like to see governor Rick Scott state legislators I'm doing it of course the um we very soon may have a new governor in Florida\nThey absolutely need to promote renewable energy and the ... from fossil fuels the sunshine state we need to be doing everything in our our to be moving to a clean energy economy and away from dirty ... the ones that are doing nothing but good meeting climate change and sea level\nRise you somebody got sunshine [laughter] how did that Iraq sunshine now we\nAnd it's really inexcusable especially we have much maligned for community ... all over mostly surrounded by water or we need to be taking your you know we need to be on that kept you energy\nIt feels as though when governor Rick Scott announced ahead of the um hurricane that people need to evacuate and you know he was very strong language as he should of it was very important for the governor of the state to call people to evacuate\nBut it almost seemed to me to be a symbol of what he is essentially\nRelegating the state's residents to do on the long term basis because if you do nothing about climate change Florida will disappear underwater market\nRight anywhere in the pattern of doing nothing and the reactor I Do nothing and react to a crisis and that doesn't make any sense for the citizens of Florida when we can't constantly be only in reaction we need to be energy the situation now\nSo you have at the state level some obvious solutions and certainly Florida could take the example of California couldn't at which has\nUm pushed harder than really any other state to transition to renewable energy sources not even you know\nCalifornia could do even better but at least my relative standards of doing better now at Florida could follow that path but what about on the federal level are states especially left to fend for themselves for as long as we have\nUm president and members of Congress to don't try hard enough or don't care enough\nThere's definitely an increased pressure right now on a step up and do everything they can't because the federal government\nHas been a dereliction of duty the Trump Administration you know we you know with the roll back in terms of protect you all are wanting to drop in the climate agreement all of these uh can't that that are only TV [noise]\nOn the shoulders state and local governments that are doing what they can but the power to advance protections for their citizens but we need state and federal cooperation really battled\nAre you I'm going back to the issue of the state level um politics are you a old I'm hopeful that um the candidates running for the governor's race some Andrew Gillum on the Democratic side or Ron DeSantis on the Republican side are are going to be any level of improvement\nOver over Rick Scott\nAlthough we climate I should say\nI think what we need is or the Florida electric demand that they do better\nOr whoever is elected you need to make it clear that the priority for the people of Florida for the economy the ecology and the health and ... that it's been up and he has ... to really maintain light here uh it's so critical\nIt's up to the floor to me that a priority\nAnd given that we're really just a few weeks from the election or the now would be the ideal time for those candidates to make the the him and important mid term issue as people are reeling from the damage\nYou promised to do something about climate change 'em you might actually get much more traction and we and many more votes right I mean\nYou know this is people's lives and livelihoods and homes some people that have had their homes for generations\nAnd we we seem like eight years of doing nothing look like\nAnd I don't think anybody might ... the so I think that ought to be enough to be done is we've seen like cutting her department environmental protection looks like we've seen what taking resources random like nine climate change me being that we tried it it's terrific\nMe needs to be better if we can do better\nOr it's just just dot O.
