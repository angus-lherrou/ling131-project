McCaskill McCaskill's race in Missouri is supposed to be\nA very close and outside spending is way hum exceeding candidate spending there are a meal out of West or you've got Rosen versus Heller\nI'm In the Senate in Nevada got Don always raised in Indiana and you've got a really tight race I'm In Tennessee uh Marsha Blackburn that's an open seat or Marsha Blackburn versus feel I Believe it's pronounced resident\nUm but so these are um you know this money largely goes to TV ride it goes to um\nA coordinated with the campaign and and have some sort of official distance from the campaign but are really you know echoing the same exact kind of things that the campaign to seize so you'll see that on on TV you know an ass as you know ... you know they'll have some sort of\nUm you know a ... not not the um\nThe word I'm obscure or innocuous Lee innocuous Lee named group citizens for acts and they'll be you know harsh attack ad against Joe Donnelly or or a harsh attack\nThe spending you identified on the odd but basically they can hide behind a name that tells you nothing\nIs easy right citizens for a tax you know citizens for for apples and a mother and her you know some very innocuous and then on the funding gets passed through you know many do can pass through many different entities to preserve the amity and minutes\nUm if it if a ...\nAll kind of a sham and that we were pretty much agree with that and um the uh a lot of the outside spending too is being done by entities that are very close to the um\nTo the house GOP to that to the house down to the set of them\nTo the house Republicans you know these are are there not be official party committee right they're not that\nThat do triple C or that that the FCC but their um you know pacts that have been created to sort of mirror the official campaign and often they're staffed by people who have connections to you know to Senator Schumer or um or have\nConnections to um you know to a Senator McConnell there are are in with that you know there's no official legal connection between the two but it's kind of the same crowd so that that um\nUnlimited donations unlimited expenses as you know we really fight objection\nTo Alan for those people those voters who are living in the areas where the districts where these highly competitive races are taking place where the\nHuge amount of money pouring in there basically being bombarded by add 'em on television by mailers by all of the sort of a standard things that you get when you have money pouring in um presumably\nIt's coming so thick and fast at no time to vet the claim that might be ... being made\n... that must be incredibly ... to vote\nExactly and this is you know we should remind people this is your this is what the Supreme Court did this is your Supreme Court\nThat rule you know that that took it upon themselves to [laughter] yeah they didn't have that they they decided that political advertising and you know by by millions hundreds of millions ours is the same thing as as your speech in my speech\nSo that's that's what a what Justice Kennedy gave us we're the we're we're we're living in\nOne more gift from Justice Kennedy [noise]\nUm so do you have any sense that the the money is actually having an impact right so when you've got giant amounts of money being thrown out of range from one side\nIt's going to be met by nearly the same amount of money being thrown at it from the other side and it's probably going to come down to you know very very close races\nBut do you have any sense of the money is actually having a big impact one way or another\nRight I mean obviously we're not going to know until uh until Tuesday a November six I'm and I'm you know how how can we not have an impact certainly uh\nA shape your perceptions of are raised in a candidate but I Would you know however points out that we've seen you know better or working in Texas just raise an incredible amount of money from individuals I'm Around the country who are really inspired by his candidacy and I'm\nA you know and I'm really appreciate a candidate who's raising money from ordinary people that's not an official endorsement but the year there's a there's um um you know a lot of appeal to many Americans in that argument\nSo um how does this election as far as you can tell compared to previous elections the the political stakes are so high given the Trump presidency given\nThat he has had the backing of his party which has had a majority in Congress for the past couple of years and also now you know it occupies the White House this one party had control of the three branches of government and that could all change well two out of the peak of change\nUh this November ... incredibly high how does this election compared to earlier elections in terms of outside political spending I Would just end up Boyd trend in money\nYeah I think you are seeing an upward trend in money um you know this is going to be\nThe uh record for mid term spending in in for outside spending in mid term a way it's not going to a very exceeded um outside spending in any election that would have been the last election in twenty sixteen cause a presidential election is always going to be\nA larger election in terms of spending but I'm I'm I mean I you know I probably should be a little more careful there I mean I I you know I Will be shocking see a mid term spending ...\nThe huge amount of interest in this election um and you know we'll see what happens in the um the prospects for the the Democrats in the house you know I'm I think Democrats are are really don't care about it I think that they're not they're not\nUh if you're on to great about the Senate right now I'm and I'm\n... I'm you know you've seen a lot of people are really everyone seems to be energized by politics these days and you know\nParticularly in California you have a races in in a long time conservative districts in Southern California that are still seem like they're on the verge of of potentially flipping so I'm so there's a there are um you know things for a progressive to be excited about\nAnd I'm kind of chicken for the hatch but it is and I think that uh you know people are are feeling okay by\nHow how does this change the way in which an individual who wants to run for Congress wants to run for the go about doing so because if money is feeding the money that the candidate spending in some cases feeding the money\nThat the political party is spending didn't come to shift the dynamics of how one approach is running for office that you would actually be fundraising not from ordinary people not from ... not from the people who actually voting for you\nBut you would be fundraising from these political action committee\nOr you know pacts and groups or the Mike Bloomberg who wrote [noise] yeah I Would say that that's very concerning uh ... and um but I Would say that that we have that trend but we also have a a parallel trend of of\nThe you know the better or some of the world and through that are doing\nEvery candidate is going to have that guy is kind of magnetism and charisma so if if uh if if they um if if the challenge ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Making Contact", "city": "Middletown", "day": "31"}
