visited the impacted area twice and put his vice president in charge of recovery effort\nAnd that does that for our headlines today spurred by grassroots activists California has just passed a slew of progressive built from police accountability to net neutrality that were just signed into law by governor Jerry Brown after the music break we'll speak with Brian Lubitz of Calif fix dot com to survey the new laws and what they ...\nAnd three women for boys six or more members for failing to comply face a fine and even if this is [noise]\nThat instead of saying I'm you know we we we we accept that Gen that our boys are terribly male dominated we want more women on the board that they would actually in this moment in time\nFight the requirement or you know this country's run the world that have quotas for representation of women of certain ethnic minorities\nBut usually those are sort of an on government to our bodies um do you know if this is something that has any analogy or any counterpart elsewhere in in the country or the world\nI'm I've never you know I've I've looked at and I've not seen any similar legislation elsewhere or I Know there are some requirements in some European countries um for a female representation\n'em on different boards I don't know if it's ... you know for corporate boards of directors um I think what what is important to sort of how it's going to be enforced um so that's when the you know in terms of when the weather's constitutional when that will come and plays do you know when the state would actually bring actions against companies\nOr to enforce the measure um you know I think generally and then the other question is I think you know generally uh corporations\nYou know there's no reason for them to oppose having women on the board I I think the problem and the risk that we face is having one or two women being on many many boards so rather than expanding access and expanding opportunity for women were going to have a some\nSort of repeat that you know there's a few people who were\nAre on many many many many boards um which is a problem on corporate boards is in general um that there's so much you know it's not out of\nThe same handful of women basically in name only or maybe not to um on on the on the board of lots of different corporations just so that they can say hey we've got a woman\nOne or two boards is you know you you're you're fine you know when you when you get to you know ten Fifteen boards where you know how how much can these people were actually serve the purpose of a director\nA ... a member of the board um and then you know whether it's becoming tokenism so you want to have real representation and that's that's something is very hard to police\nSpeaking of police let's talk about police accountability like that take away [laughter] um so the two major built into bull around police accountability and transparency which grassroots activist groups like black lives matter and others\nAnd he had been pushing for a long time this was an extremely significant I'm In a sort of advantage of all tell us about these bills what they now means for California\n[noise] [noise] right so I'm the first one is uh it'd be seven forty eight which I'm requires the release of body came footage or I Know there's some exceptions for a safety and and the personnel records of the officers\nUm but this is you know for a long time departments were primarily responsible for when the footage would be released\nUm and as we've seen from you know many cases throughout not just in California but throughout the country that that body can put it would be held back a for you know days weeks months\nOr if it it is released it all so you know this requires a lot more transparency 'em and would the default would be for the release of the footage\nI'm such a big step forward\nSo ... D It is it's one of the bills or laws that would be challenged in court are police unions challenging the I mean we have cities like Oakland in Los Angeles police shootings are epidemic hit you know people die at the hands of police\nWe'll be standard when these ... challenge\nWell you know I mean I think the the questions will tend to be in the margins so it's which when that I'm footage is being released you know I think generally officers prefer transparency but you know when when you situations\nI'm aware when they actually felt their lives were in danger and ... and that's when they pulled their weapons\nUm you know when it's done correctly when it's done reasonably I think most police officers prefer the release of that footage\nI'm you know and then there's if you ask you know sort of officers on the street most them generally don't oppose the transparency um you know the risk is a sort of more generally um you know when the questions\nOf specific instance has come out when there's um\nYou know when there's a shooting when there's actually a death um and then you have to deal with um you know when it's evidence\nUm yeah I I think that will be you get to specific instances I don't know if the the legislation generally we will be challenged but I think sort of when it's controversial to be released that's when we'll see\nThe um the more uh effort being put into challenges\nAnd I went to quote Peter be bringing home and the director of policing practices for the ACLU of California He's that unfortunately over the years we'd if people have been stripped of the power over the whole law enforcement accountable for their use and abuse of these powers\nAre old too often were left in the dark even as we gain a greater awareness of systemic problems with the least thing that remain rooted in oppression and racism be able to lead sponsor of these measures we'll see if they have an impact on police violence in the coming months and years\nLet's talk about a net neutrality the the big one\nBy the Federal Communications commission under the leadership of Republican appointee a jeep high who has said that he favors net neutrality but then went ahead and killed it\n... and despite incredible my of public opposition what does it mean for one state for California to uphold net neutrality we part that Jeff Sessions at the Justice Department is already basically going just to California over\n[noise] well um you know many of the Internet companies who are based in California\nWere strongly in favor of neutrality so um you know obviously the big providers are Comcast Eighteen tea or would prefer to be able to you know have whatever the way they can\nUm and you know rising as student the past um which mentally led to the what is known as every classification I'm\nFrom common carrier into common carrier status from information service\nUm so when they were classified as a as a common carrier that enabled um the FCC to fully regulate so what they have done now last year was too deep classify that as a common carrier and make it make it the Internet service back\nAs an information service which the FCC claims they cannot regulate a under the current sep legislation or the federal legislation so interestingly the the constitutional question that Jeff Sessions is alleging is that California doesn't have the right to regulate Internet\nUm which is interesting considering that\n... or ... pies that you know and now says is that the federal legislation doesn't give them power to do it so it's it's a question of sort of um who has the authority under the supremacy clause of the constitution 'em and you know uh\nCharlie rules um that that the FCC propagated under Tom Wheeler\nSo I'm assuming a ... as far as you can tell what we'll be the goddess of a net neutrality wild being litigated while the government to California because the uh federal roll back have gone into effect hadn't\nYeah so um it's interesting question because most of the uh ISPs Internet service providers don't actually do too many things which violate that you're totally right now yeah tonight [laughter] the right to do that in the future right and so the question is a ... and the other part of it that is that that your child he would never\nTotally applied to mobile data um and I think it's more and more people would use mobile data is there a primary means of uh of connected to the Internet um it really changed in on the scope of uh how people are going to be impacted by ... so\nWell that journalists you and I know that we do most of my research on our computers through life [laughter]\nRight and so this will so this would actually impact the the mobile carriers\nSo um you know where this goes beyond the federal regional federal rules um it blocks so called zero rating which means to totally uh so if you have your cellphone data and you get free net flicks um\nFree net flicks data this would stop that with the exception being that if you if the mobile carrier is going to allow free video in general", "show_name": "Making Contact", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "03"}
