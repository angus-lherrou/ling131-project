{"month": "10", "state": "CT", "station": "WESU", "content": "And the pursuit of a trade and commerce\n... when when you talk about uh the department of life being put for many years and has complained about the the exemption that leads to\nA lot of non native was coming on to the reservation to state taxes you would seem it would seem to me just the news of reserve from way over here in the east coast that that's what's at stake there is that is is it not because\nOr is it because the state is not a you know gathering taxes of course had pets obvious but is there are more of an underlying current tub attitude toward needed people are being successful economically\nYeah I think there's a whole lot more to what's going on there [noise] you know through um [noise] some of my ...\nI guess you could say personal experiences throughout um my my history as well as you know some delve into the realm of private business and and and what not when you get into the [noise] the understanding that um you know in theory\nAre not being imposed a ... of\nThat essentially um for instance would say that the Washington state excise taxes thirty two point five cents and in theory you know you have a a non native who ... who are potentially would live outside the boundaries of our lands\nWho's gonna you know expressed that the Akron nation license retailers are\nHave substantial benefit when it comes to not having to impose an additional thirty two point five cents of excise tax but you know the thing that becomes very\nI guess you can say the real question at hand is if if we have such a um incentives in such a ... and I ended vantage when it comes to the\nThe inability to essentially paid the excise tax the question that we have a Jack Ma nation is when you have a license ... business suit selling fuel say for instance at three dollars a gallon\nAnd then we drive down the road say about a quarter of a mile quarter of a mile and you have a another non native establishment that as a corporate uh backing\nUm the question we have is why can they sell their fuel at the same price as us if supposedly we had such a name economic advantage when it comes to not paying the um the excise tax and question\nAnd when you look into that question a little more in depth to come to understand that um there are many things I guess you can say that are contributing\nTo not only I guess you can say the the a political advocacy that come from constituents were either business owners and are those who are purchasing and buying fuel outside reservation boundaries but also it becomes the corporate interests with regard to those who maintained a corporate market share\nA specific to um fuel in general and that um\nYou know everybody has a has an ability to a wrist\nIssue of race excise taxes both that the retail level as well as the distributor level and when you get into the refinery level and you come to understand that as you follow the the money out of hand and you come to understand\nWho has the established ... corporate market share and who essentially as reaping the benefits from the various\nDistributions of either tax and our revenue that comes into play\n'em you come I guess my personal opinion would be that this is more about maintaining the corporate market share and it's in the best interest of the corporations that that be maintained and it's also in the best interests of various states entities in jurisdictions I receive portions of that market share it through the imposition of tax\nAnd so but at the end of the day if it's really about fairness and um the expression of feel pricing you know ah that seems to be lost and some type of representation throughout all the transactions and things that happen on to be a retail level or which if once again to a simple question\nIf you ask them a nation has such a a substantial advantage by\nI'm not essentially adhering to the state taxation system why is it that the corporate entities who are also selling she'll within our reservation boundaries can either match and our beat our pricing and the fuel\nAll you know I think there's a lot more attention to what's going on here but at the end of the day and it's unfortunate\nKnow Steve you've been listening to to chairman Gowdy and what he's been staying in all are underneath them hearing that the priest in the ... or the doctrine of Christian discovery has played here\nI'm either diminishing of sovereignty or just totally not recognizing what's going on and you ask them as well as other\nNative nations trying are really trying to plan coherent see with what is so called Christian discovery hut the doctrine of discovery but also when it comes to you know typically the treaty tribes treaty right to travel you know like chairman Gowdy said\nPoor they have a few cards are playing here what do you see is that big right here right now in the ... and you know that ... ...\nWell that the the interesting a thing that I see is the\nThe chain of arguments the line of argumentation or if you take an argument all the way back to its origin and and you look at it and the way that it was initially put forward let's say by chief justice John Marshall on behalf of a unanimous Supreme Court\nIn the Johnson versus Macintosh ruling\nAnd you you look at the fact that he's making a distinction a categorical distinction between Christian people which he put on ... and distinguishing that\nFrom native tour Hasan's now you have two different categories and the word he then is a word of Christian origin\nAnd when you put all the pieces together which which is a very time consuming task what you find is the argument behind this a position on the part of the state Washington\nOr in this particular case\nThat is um built upon other assumptions so in other words the assumption built in to the Johnson ruling\nIs the sentence their rights many of the rights of the native nations to complete sovereignty as independent nations were necessarily diminished meaning ended\nBy the original fundamental principle that discovery gave title to those who made it meaning made the discovery\nNow the discovery by home by Christian people as he mentions in the in the ruling a and and discovery of what lands lands of habit of\nOn our and their representatives locate some geographical region of non Christian lands lands inhabited by non Christians it's automatically assume from the viewpoint of the crush of world that the Christian monarchs have a right of domination in relation to those non Christian lands\nAnd that's in keeping with the Vatican documents of the fifteenth century\nSo you have to trace all of those various pieces and put them into the mix\nAnd set the contacts in the framework with all this kind of information to understand what's actually going on in terms of the how they set this framework up so that it's basically native nations attempting to play chess with no queen\nTry try winning a game of chess with when you have no quaint and your opponent does you'll never going to win so that's that's the the way in which the\nThe game has been rigged through these assumptions that are built into the the idea system uh called federal end in law and policy\nWe're speaking when it goes even nukem author of a ... and a promise learned German current chairman of the nation duty Gowdy and uh the end of this month October thirtieth could use that term and go to use a\nYou will be in deep eat bullying and looking at what is the ... which is seeking to overturn a Washington Supreme Court ruling ... he doesn't have to pay the state's\nThree point six million ... tax bill\nBecause you know it is that your right to travel under that Eighteen fifty five federal treaty and when Steve is paying that relationship between United and that combination\nIs is really you know based upon as you get it I was getting you're trying to you know not be confused so much is the fact that\nThe founding of the nation upon that poll idea that you have to be still he didn't say how much of this um result or solution will will come out in favor of the nation I think a lot of native nations across the country or it will be watching what happens October thirtieth don't you think\nYeah I Would think so I um\nYou know I think that uh [noise] to the degree that they should be watching I'm not too sure the awareness is quite there amongst the native nations and I think that um you know this uh the ability the ability to essentially insert um",
