{"month": "10", "state": "CT", "station": "WESU", "content": "And I had no idea that there was a completely alternative narrative and the narrative included spirituality emanating from the earth or a living being sacred mountains and I I just to kind of made my head spin because I I felt the truth of it but I had no\nCultural guidance or language from my own upbringing to really you know except my own experiences by the springs and the and the and the creeks and New Jersey and so um I was really curious about the importance and the meaning of sacred places to indigenous people and\nThis was you know when filmmaking was pretty expensive people couldn't make phones on their iPhones [noise]\nYou know the the process of of native people becoming doctors and lawyers and engineers and and philosophers and writers and filmmakers was was sort of just starting to take off at that point in the seventies and eighties\nAnd so when I suggested to some of my Native American friends and I had some pretty great friends back then from from making films about environmental issues I suggested a film about why sacred places were so important to indigenous cultures and\nI suggested that somebody's a Native Americans should make the film and my friends said no you you should do this [laughter] it'll take you a long time that you should do it [noise]\nSo I kind of learned along the way to be a try to be a good ally and I'm just use my own I guess now they call it privilege back then we you know the concept of entitlement and privilege was hadn't been named particularly well and I guess what I was doing\nThat story and an important message and as I went on I just came to feel that this spiritual dimension of nature that indigenous people see so clearly feel responsible to communicate with\nRevere do ceremonies to interact with that that's exactly what our culture is missing and it's why we have climate change and that's why we have an endangered species and polluted water and we've just completely disconnected ourselves from nature and\nSo it sounds a little bit romantic to sort of say that\nIndigenous people have this traditional ecological knowledge and spiritual knowledge that is really valuable but it's true so I just feel like I've just spent a lot of years trying to\nBring that to the forefront put it on public television and then let students and audiences just respond to it and that's that's pretty much the story of where the the journey has taken me\nFrom the ... a global climate action summit with your whole whole alone people Corina gold and up to the diamond people in northwest to do even places all die in Mongolia area out there in China and Russia and all those places to\nDo every everywhere I can imagine that you have been you know you see the backbone of indigenous peoples what is that common thread in\nYou know we're going to the romanticized version of native people because I think we have to get through that even our own people have to get through the noble Indian and even the Savage part of it but still there is a backbone that that really to mix all the indigenous peoples and ... and uh so what do you what do you think about that\n[noise] well [noise] my early work in the United states are led me to do when I'm when two up near Mount Shasta and and this was before the Internet it was before really global communication had become free\nGood mountains around the world that hold the earth and balance and\nThey're they are at Mount Shasta holding to the ceremonies you know trying to avoid boarding schools and FBI repression of ceremonies and one of the questions they asked was okay there's twenty sacred mountains around the world are people doing their jobs around each of those mountains to take care\nOf them the way we're doing our job here so part of my\nMission I guess on the standing on sacred ground series which it did take me luckily I was very fortunate to be able to go to places like the outcry in Siberia and pop or New Guinea and Australia\nAnd the al ... is a good example because what I what I found there was yes there are people who are taking care of sacred mountains and have been\nFor millennia because of the power of these places and the lessons that come to spiritual leaders from these places and so I'd say one of the really common threads that I found was even though each of these cultures is completely unique different language different traditions [noise]\nIs a sense of responsibility to do a cultural care taking and guardianship of these places that are revered and that our life giving and that people have observed have power and that was kind of what I was going to see if\nWe could find it if we can film it if we could link these stories to show that common thread and\nThat that's how I Would describe it along with that comes I think the values of\nHumility and respect or that's not to say that there aren't wars and you know you know conflicts and and uh you know competition and all the human kind of you know traits that were so familiar with here\nW E s U middle town there's a there's a kind\nHave shifted the way our culture I think is seeing things because instead of this kind of ... ... us them conflict\nThe Elders and the women leaders the youth and women leaders at Standing Rock change the narrative to you know we're going to oppose this craziness with prayer with ceremony we're gonna we're not going to just fight we're going to have a balanced\nWay of expressing the way we think things should be and\nI I think that's really a common thread around the world is this the sense of reverence and I'm kind of a like a more in balance with feminine values I guess as a way to put it [noise]\nBut uh we certainly found that as unique as different cultures are around the world some of them completely male dominated like in Ethiopia\nThat still this sense of reverence and the sense of of\nOf wanting to listen to the earth and maintain a communicative relationship with the earth as a and trees and streams and salmon and everything as something with a spirit\nUm you know ... ... you know the religious scholars call it ... but when you look at it it's the most common sort of spiritual or religious view in the world more people have been Anna mystic through including my ancestors in Europe than any other way of being\nA having a spiritual life and so um that's still true around the world in spite of Christianity and sort of monotheism kinda hammer that comes down on people's heads when they continue to believe that way so\nI I guess we found 'em that that spiritual connection to nature alive and well around the world even though it's threatened and attacked regularly it's very vital\nIt is it is we're speaking with Toby McLeod founder of the bigger lens project way back in Nineteen eighty four and a great description about how you doing\nThat you waited and how much has come out of that either good or bad you know privilege has come out of that\nThe institution that educational institution and Dutch people who are with the current government the current administration in the United states than you know one one one little phrase that I could take from your\nYour Facebook site is about David kestler we talked about the you know the background and analyzing the Bears Ears and the land grab that happened there\nThat it is really part of the what I Would say the destruction of the Trump show it daily Trump show and we all get into it because I think we're still emotionally attached to what makes democracy work as opposed to what is not making it work where you know a native people uh has not\nReally democracy has not worked for native people in my view\nBecause it continues to take that very land away from our study finance our connection or unity with Europe to to really understand how the earth works and communicate with that so when I was watching some of your films here sticker land film projects or various films I ...\nI was familiar\nWith the local\nAh I guess resistance of each of those native people mild mannered or pass stuff that we call him from the western mindset is that there was a fierce underneath that we're seeing is that that you know it's like\nAlmost to the death you defend Mother Earth this is how it is and you talked earlier about uh I'm\nStanding Rock you know changing the narrative ... and I think that that is the key here the narrative has changed but it's not ... not either native are humans but it's the narrative being changed my Mother Earth would you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WINGS", "city": "Middletown", "day": "03"}
