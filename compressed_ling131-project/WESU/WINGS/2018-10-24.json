{"month": "10", "state": "CT", "station": "WESU", "content": "Yeah that was a quote from a film reviewer in Canada and uh I think it has had a big impact on people I mean there's this connection with what's happening locally in Hudson Bay in terms of reversing the hydra logical cycle so you know reversing rivers flowing from spring into winter\nUm and that has a big effect on ice and Hudson Bay but it's a problem all over the world there's I mean we're we're changing the water cycle that such a large scale and you know\nEspecially in the north Atlantic all that water from Hudson Bay goes into the Labrador Current which that cold salty water sinking that's what drives the gulfstream that Europe that's what drives global climate so we have to think about how these things affect the big scale as well and how and connects all of us together\nAnd are we really think that\nConnections that were making here in New York I'm raising awareness about this issue working with different groups to kind of come up with I mean there's been a lot of green washing that you know hydro dams or the ultimate renewable energy resource and you know there's ways that smaller dams and one of the river can work and there's ways that we think even the existing dams that are in their\nUm can manage their water better and it was actually an obligation that was put in when the new a river river ... project kinda got attitude is complex that there needs to be an assessment of the cumulative impacts on the marine ecosystem in Hudson Bay and that hasn't gone ahead and like you said then you would have been raising these concerns for over Twenty years on they still haven't been addressed so\nUm we're hoping that we can use an imam momentum of the film to really connect with people on the the cultural story and the environmental story and the natural history and help people understand what's on the go so we can actually move forward with this and you know\nStart to implement some basic water management policy has a lot of\nUm the dams in the United states now Rick require some of the\nSo if New York's importing electricity from Canada I mean in our opinion should have the same standards as it has for the state so the environmental problem isn't being exported um so we're pushing forward and hoping that the man to him [noise]\nUm I've ever and kind of coming together on this ... um will help\nMake these things happens I open access to the hydra logical day that's all we can assess cumulative impacts and uh some basic water management policy so we've been doing in any campaign as well to try and raise funding to really do you have some promotion to connect to people in New York with rather electricity comes from until\nYou try and get you to Joe Joe he can you give us the website ... of the the fundraising side but of of where we can get information about people who are the feather what does that website\nYeah it's just people of a feather dot com people or the other of of other ... of a feather yet like birds of a feather except people of a feather okay\nPeople ... and uh that that's where you would go and I I Want to talk about I'm going to play the film do though the excuse me the people who are the trailer after we speak here but um I I think that we need to pay attention to things that contain you\nKnow messages about water how we are really take for granted that water is going to always going to be accessible to us but we don't understand how we as a human species or abusing this and I think this is one of those those documentaries they'll bring it to light how and what we can do every time we switch on a light\nAnd uh I like to thank you for being here this morning Joel he\nYeah I really appreciate the opportunity to share this story I mean I really feel like Hudson Bay if you look at the shape of it and you look at how the water circulates\nIt's really the heartbeat of our hydro logical cycle into her on this community is right in the heart of Hudson Bay and so I think we really need to listen to this message so thank you very much for letting me share that and maybe you could I could put you in touch with folks are coming down November\nOn the fourteenth one\nAnd three and fifty at the quad cinema which is on thirty four west Thirteen yeah between six and Fifth Avenue in New York City that's where you need to go see this to really get in touch with all those things that you know that you can't bring a poster to basically you just have to agree your heart and open up but thank you Joe he secular\nReally appreciate it yes and no we're going to go to this trailer people with a feather trailer that you can listen to that way we know and it's a double BP can't eat five point eighty nine point five FM and I like to thank you for listening to this\nIs people with a feather trailer and ah it the website is people would feather people of the feather dot org gives the website so here we go we're going to listen to that\n\n\nFor a long haul [noise] people ... to ...\nWhen the main power starts doing three hundred times for natural freshwater [noise]\nWe'll be talking to us freshwater habitat went from bounce back from a critical [noise]\n\n\n\n\nPeople the feather dot org ... goes tourists here at the host approached voices indigenous radio before we go out I Know we have a few minutes and I want to really\nExpress and and uh my feelings and my thought what's going on with water um we don't think about as far as I Know\nI see people taking it for granted and expected because they pay for it if there's no water you can't pay for any water in the water that's coming to you now is being sterilized it's\nBeing put into another form words actually being killed in your tap water and it tastes good and it's being added with vitamins at all these things so it it comes down to profit making venture\nNow how were you when you hear a place that there are places you can drink alive water lied water\nWater and you can actually take the alive water out from the mountains and you can see in a microscope the differences between what water really is and it's supposed to be his live water and there's dead water the dead water is to sterilize water that you probably get in your bottled water that you go out and buy\nAnd uh but I Want to talk about the crisis feared as us water supplies dry up and this is\nAs of today are there are many things happening here the ... job in Georgia\nIs threatening or the water supplies for millions and and Florida doesn't have nearly enough water for it's expected population boom the great lakes are shrinking upstate New York Steve reservoirs have dropped to record lows and in the west Sierra Nevada snowpack is melting faster each year\nAnd across America the pictures critically clear that the nation's fresh water supplies can no longer which it's thirst\nAnd or the government projects at at least thirty six states will face water shortages within five years because of the combination of rising temperatures drop population growth urban sprawl the waste and accessed\nSo it is a crisis and we don't if we don't do something ... do some decent water planning it could be a very big crisis more than we can ever hold\nWithin our capacity to stem the shortage of water and\nWe are all at at odds here we all at risk of finding out and trying to figure out what to do\nWhen we we can't turn on the water anymore\nBut I just want to leave you with that these thoughts the thoughts of how we basically are trying to leave Mother Earth out of the whole process of all this technology of all this machinery industrialization and all this profit making politics\nAnd all of these things coming from an indigenous person's mind and his heart
