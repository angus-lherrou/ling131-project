{"month": "10", "state": "CT", "station": "WESU", "content": "To be a hundred or two hundred years ago but it was coming to where now we have to address that but why didn't um we were able to dress or within our communities I think\nOf that would be a good question to to know is that how do we how do we know what's happening domestic violence because it comes in many forms to the nuts\n[noise] oh yeah of course you know there's a physical abuse um which is what most people tend to think of when we talk about domestic violence as you know somebody that's been hurt physically has a black guy broken bones that type of thing um\nBut yeah there are many other forms of course there's the motion August that goes on where somebody just as really um ... constantly building\nBelittling yell and degrading you there as financial abuse where are all control of the money is vested in one partner and the other partner has to you know basically bag for\nUm access to financial resource\nTechnology um abuse where somebody is tracking all of your movements on you know social media or your cell phones or where you visited on the um\nUm you know the Internet and so there are many different forms of domestic violence um\nAnd why you know it continues to be a a problem in our community has than I'm really it's related to the long history of tribes being\nUnable to prosecute offenders of these crimes right and that real you know really result in a loss of faith in our system that was intended to protect\nUm women and children um and you know it leads to under reporting and I mean it it really is a vicious cycle I think of um the lack of a response and access to justice\nYou you and do you talk to about these statistics earlier and I remember back into those seven to those ... we did a program called ah to me I mean just just [noise] I'm native women and how\nSeverely impact we are by the non native like I think it was eighty six percent of or violent crimes against women were committed by non native ...\nMen and fourteen percent were obviously on the reservation or own within our community need to ... but I often about to do to to to because they change I'm Wondering if you\nKnow things are you mentioned thirty percent news services that that's including under reporting or no reporting it all and uh you know what reported is it really actually I was there any progress or process on once the tree\nWhen you're talking about what happens in in the criminal justice system and when somebody does report one other things to remember of course in this was disgusted in the maze of injustice is that you know there may be as many as three different criminal justice\nSystems involved in reporting a crime you know in Indian country and that may be the tribal system that may be the state's system of you know the communities that surround the reservation or it may be the federal system\nAnd you know each jurisdiction has you know incredible discretion\nUm for which crimes they're going to prosecute and so it's so important for those women who do contact\nUm the police and want to see a prosecution that they have\nSupport right and so you support that we certainly can give here at strong hearts but it's also important for them to have people in their community and we were talking about uh you know this lack of services where they're not able to access that\nIt's because tribes are not funded at the levels that they need to be\nUm you know so that when somebody reports they have somebody in a rural community that they can go to and talk with\nAnd who can help guide them through that system which can be so confusing it's confusing for prosecutors right you know they have to determine who who was the victim who was the perpetrator where did it happen what exactly happened and those are all considerations when we're talking about who has jurisdiction\nI'm so having somebody at the local level who understands that system you know this the overlapping of those three systems is really critical and it's something\nWould really advocate for you learned\nBecause it seems to state and federal usually have to have their day a workshop about cultures and uh and it seems that\nIt it you know in my experience is that those two just day to end the fed are often injecting their way of how to take care of the cultural problem do you find there is a difference between\nA how that's needed up between people when you started to the based on how tribes are not funded buddies culture really needed to be funded when it comes to correcting list of sexual abuse because you know what's needed needs a strong are doing is is there any need for\nThat money to be injected into our culture are we looking at not being sovereign in solving own problem or do we really need that much help\n[noise] you know I think\nYeah when I when we talk about funding um you know\nIt's critical to help establish services that can help somebody heal\nRight and um you know what I found about funding primarily you know we're talking about our law enforcement you know many tribes don't have their own law enforcement departments sell its yes that's needed to be able to respond to\nCrimes of violence many tribes are you know um don't have\nA full fully operational court system and those funds are needed\nRight to establish those systems so that they can respond um I think that what I have found in my experience um [noise] is that tribes do respond differently than say the state court or the um federal court system which are more about\nOf all I'm but how do we how we do that in our travel court systems probably looks very different from what they're doing and the state and federal court you know we tend to look at things that are much more holistic manner um\nThese crimes are committed by somebody um that that the victim loves ...\nRight and I'm In those cases where they are native perpetrators\nThey're not leaving our community we don't want to shun them and ban them and kick them out of our communities they are our brothers in our our uncles in her father's and and and so we are related and we want what's best for them as well\nFirst of all there has to be that accountability but then we can look to having services that really help\nUm people identify where they're being abusive and and how to correct those and how to move towards more healthy relationships and we can do that with\nUm I I think a lot of traditional services\nSuch so good to hear that thank you for that in the you know one put in a kind of been there the ultimate dream that you can turn to talk about these things in the mainstream public especially among many so why do women especially ... million or why do people stay in abusive relationships\n[noise] while you're there so many reasons um you know the experience of intimate partner violence is really such a unique experience for each each um woman that experiences that I'm\nCertainly there is love you know they are yeah this is somebody who regardless of how they're treating them there you know the relationship was\nBased in love and and that's very difficult to overcome\nOr lack of you know access to services um so that the reasons women stay are you know just as many as there are stars in the sky write 'em and free to him and it's very different um and I think what we need to remember is\nTo focus on the actions of the perpetrator and not the actions of a vet them there's you know an incredible amount of victim blaming that happens not just in Indian country I think across the country you know why do you say why didn't you leave", "show_name": "WINGS", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "17"}
