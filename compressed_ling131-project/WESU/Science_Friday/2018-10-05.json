dung beetles why not they they interact a lot of nature\nThe small worm like Paris I like to hitch a ride on their insect partners as they fly from one done Patty to another sounds like a pretty sweet deal to the ... right\nBut perhaps not so much for the dung beetle CD nematodes actually ride on the Beatles channel tunnel where they can be passed on to their offspring or mates\nLike an STD now dung beetles put up with a lot of done but what do they stand to gain from this relationship\nMy next guest says that Vicki and it sounds there might be a very good reason for letting those parasites climb aboard jak decreased that to Christina done right it gives us ... research scientist in the department of biology at Indiana University in Bloomington buckets\nInteract [noise] gladly um well when the dung beetle is ready to reproduce they a tunnel underneath a dunk Patty and they create these developmental chambers out of dying that we call the brood ball and in each of those ... balls they place a single egg\nAnd from being an egg to an adult beat all of that that developing beat all depends on his developmental chamber for its nutrients that for a shelter and protection\nAnd uh none of toads right along on these beetles they're they're small worms\nAnd um they end up in the developmental chambers along with the developing beetles and um we didn't know before whether that was a good thing or a bad thing um but we did know that um that disassociated existed and so this was something that we wanted to investigate more\nTo understand the consequences of that interaction for comic tell me what did you learn\nWell um [laughter] we looked at all in all different parts of the um ... and we found them on various parts but we're particularly interested in is really high concentration of nematodes that found on the genitalia um it's a good place for them it took to hide but also it's a really\nCompelling a venue for getting to the next generation because it's involved and reproduction\nAnd so what we found was not only are are these nematodes passed between males and females but they're also passed off to the offspring and the offspring that develop alongside these nematodes actually a grow faster and larger than their counterparts um that don't have these ...\nAnd so there's actually a fitness benefit to having um [noise] I wouldn't even call it a parasite because under any conditions that we tested we didn't find that that the number two it was actually bad for the developing beetle I'm In the the conditions under which we tested that we always found that with a good thing to have it along so it's more of a mutual is really\nNo and that was um nematodes are are almost infamous for being Paris by their parasites of human of cattle plant\nA matinee from eleven AM to win the um [noise] [noise] yes [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow and the past few years the field of exoplanet discovery has really taken off instruments like Kepler and the Newark test had been racking up the planet count but this week astronomers writing in the journal science advances\nBrought the whole thing to a new level describing the possible discovery not have an exoplanet\nBut at the moon orbiting an exoplanet to be specific\nKepler is sixteen dashed twenty five dash be and in some four thousand light years away has to do that well joining me now to talk about the research is Alex ... cheese and and it's half graduate research fellow in the department of astronomy right here in New York at Columbia University welcome to science friday\nThank you very much for having me first what what moon is just wherever they give us a little thumbnail description sure yeah so it's\nA a moon as far as we can tell if we're not quite claiming it as a discovery yet there's still some lingering uncertainty but as far as we can tell it's there are a large moon about the size of Neptune actually which is sort of strange um orbiting this plant called Kepler sixteen twenty five be and it's about eight thousand light years away as far as we can to\nSo so what is the relationship with the size of them went to the size of the plants\nSo the size of the planet is to buy the same size as Jupiter it's a little more massive as far as we can tell a and then the moon is to say about the size and the mass of net\nPlay them that I'm pretty unusual well known that big a well it's certainly unexpected right where if you\nThe moon's in our solar system ah we've got a lot of them are they're all ... significantly smaller than the earth so uh when we spotted this we said uh you know this is what it looks like\nTo say how common are how rare something like this might be because ah this is potentially the first so we don't have any sort of population statistics on these things ah but ah you know you could argue that because it is the largest you know because it is so large a it's sort of the lowest hanging fruit so maybe it's not entirely surprising that the first one we see is so large\nYou know because we think of our ... and we think of another body hitting earth and knocking out a piece of writing that looked like that in this case uh yeah\nIt's hard you know there's there's basically three mechanisms that we think we get the moon's from an impact their scenario like how we got earth's moon ah moons coalescing out of a disk of material swirling around the planet in the early days of the planetary system like the way we get the moons of Jupiter and Saturn Uranus\nAnd then finally a capture scenario like a Neptune largest moon Tritan as far as we can tell that was captured from the ...\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads or\nBut yeah yeah we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you do how do you detect a moon I Know that theory but that detecting the exoplanet is it well you tell us how\nYeah there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful way so far\nIs using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the door from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness of the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the star like\nIf there's a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks on some of the light as well in addition to that uh we try to see the gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of courses pulling on the moon but\nThe two lines of evidence that we see for this like some of them not just the depth this transit of the moon but also a something ... folks are pulling on the planet that uh that uh we're attributing to them\nHey that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right well what did they say out\nLoud so it's an extraordinary claim and as the famous thing goes extra dollar claim is a one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence [laughter] so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job or trying to\nRule out other possible explanations for this signal a good question naturally comes out is there something weird going on with the telescope is this maybe something happening on the surface of the star\nCould there be another planet in the system and that's that's pulling on this planet and making in wobble around a those are all plausible explanation or what we've done our best to rule out those alternative explanations and uh as far as we can tell you know the numbers are saying the moon's there but because it is such a an incredible claim\nOr maybe incredible it's not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system are needed to really confirm it\nReally it was so unusual I Am I reading from my notes you that you were able to get viewing time on the Hubble for this that you write very hard to get so you must have other people might want to know about\nVery sure yeah yeah you know so we had a a observed three transits of the planet and the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits it with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event or we observe this system for about forty hours altogether\nSo you'd have to stitched together multiple dataset for multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be a very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh obviously we made a a convincing enough case that uh that they give us the time\nThey're they're talking about the wants to ... is gone and I'm I'm I don't know why it could be but that's not for me [laughter] um it can be used up uh the Webb telescope is that right ... a better for you guys were looking an extra point\nIt's going to be like why yeah it's pretty spectacular instrument it's a very very large mirror a and a sitting aware as Hubble orbit the earth\nOr when we perform this observation you know you can imagine how people staring at this target\nBut then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single urban ... takes Ninety six minutes or so to go round so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out a James to jade okay I won't have that problem and like I said the mere is going to be really spectacular so\nUh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long yeah\nUh that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly one of the time so we're going to have to have a very good case you know there are downsides officer now there isn't\nA matter of obsolete is the wrong word but they're all everything is always obsolete by the time he gets built whether it's a highway or something else I think the law well we should have made it twice as big we've spent whatever I Am\nYeah you know so there's other telescopes coming down the pike ... their people bidding right now to well the we talked about a W first and then there's a\nA telescope called blue voir than a new one Lou ... yeah that's a that's a I I don't know who's working on it but it's it's a ultraviolet and read an optical that's L. U. V. I. O. R. and I think so\nOn ... but you know her boys over twenty five years old now and it still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it ...\nIt is All right so this is a strange jar planet situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planet situation\nThat's a great question and one of the things that I I'm always saying to people is you know they always come with the question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd uh you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems we are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much still open how common are we is is the things going on here\nHappened in a billion hundred billion mother places are across the Milky Way or it's this very uncommon chain of events that that led to us here\nAnd that of course speaks directly to uh the question about the origin of life for example ah so it's particularly since this a moon is raising new questions about how you get something like this\nIt's opening up the new questions about the dynamic will histories of these uh a planetary systems and and the speaks directly to that\n... and the more exoplanet you discover where thousands of them yeah there about four thousand confirmed plants I think at this point the more questions you're going to open ready to get answers ...\nWell yeah that that's a good enough number and did that and now we're now really filling in some nice statistics but there have been surprises along the way we found these things called hot Jupiter is you know plant it's about the size of Jupiter but very very close to their star nobody really expected to see these things at all and even twenty some years after their first discovery\nOr the terrorists are still debating how you how you make\nW. W. W. W. E. S. U. at ... dot org platoon it on FM eighty eight point one [noise] W. he issued a bit of\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking with author Deborah Blum about how food safety protections came to be the topic of her new book the poison squad one camera single minded groups\nFive I'm let's turn out the clock back to that time period ... or you have an entire chapter on catcher\n[laughter] what was so and after that ... while you're devoted well I read it I Know why or why devote the tell our listeners an entire chapter I catch up [noise]\nSo this is a catch up it's just an amazing story at this point for a couple of reasons one is we have this very twenty first idea scrawny first century idea of catch up which is you know kind of a sick tomato based conned about but\nIn the nineteenth again it tended to be a kind of thing and now the\nA sauce with a lot of vegetable waste and that people would put pumpkin ... people would put tomatoes that they might be riding they would die them sometimes what's called our guys and then because the whole mess of it\nTended to kind of be rotten anyway they dumped preserve it as an ad like sodium ... which is actually still with us today and so this ... this kind of battle ground or food safety just as meat did was Upton Sinclair\nAnd in this case I really love the story because\nIt makes a point that you know not every business is evil and a Henry J lines of ah the Heinz\nFood manufacturing company took it upon himself to get preservatives that are his ... his products the reinvented catch up so the catch up we know today was really created by Heinz and he did it so there was a lot of tomato and said\nThat kept the bacterial count down and then he really went to war a mean this was a battle between business and advocates and and ... business friendly government and high\nKids are some of the people who work with them to meet with Roosevelt and say you have got to regulate food safety the things that we make are not being trusted because consumers are afraid of food there were afraid of meat they're afraid of preservatives I Want you to do something and catch up kinda catches all of that\nBut you know there were major combat over the preservatives and catcher and that was pretty fascinating\nBut let's talk about a ... Harvey Washington where I only a little bit more than ... the focus of your book in the ... squad um he actually started where people were volunteering to eat stuff for him to test out food safety ever tell us about that what the point though I did yeah so it was amazing [noise]\nIt's just crazy and you I mean when you read this experiment first thing is I guess you could never do this today right you would never get it passed all of our control\nBut what happened was he had been working really since we're about Twenty years trying to get food safety trying to get labels you know\nAt completely not able to move this forward politically and he finally said okay well let's just have some better evidence then I'm going to skip those you know a less important other species and I'm not going to do any animal safety testing and all I'm just going to dump these things than to human beings and\nThat's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment in which he persuaded young government employees are mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerous Lee and the deal was\nThey wouldn't eat three free meals a day seven days a week and it would be beautifully cooked by a professional chef and all kinds of wonderful ingredients but half of this group at any given time had to be adding capsules\nOf the compound that he was testing at various doses from very low\nHe looked at bore acts which is a cleaning product he looked at Dallas ... said which is a fever ridges or a you know a medicine\nAnd he kept ... rotating these through these tests and what he was he hadn't expected the young men to get as sick as they did but they almost immediately started having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems\nAnd because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers [noise]\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad this was front page news all across the country you're food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public outrage which then was amplified by the Sinclair but\nWow that's so ... did he have some experience in his own life that motivated hams wanted you know create the poison the water gets to the bottom of the food safety [noise]\nKnow that's a great question I think he was kind of a holy roller cameras spray he his dad had been a preacher a farmer but also night ten or a preacher or the conductor on the underground railroad during the civil war\nAnd he had interviewed his kids are with this kind of sense of higher calling and and why only really I mean what was interesting about him was that\nHe took on this issue of food safety which the USDA had never really been interested in from the very beginning and then he just starts appealing at a party spilling the layers of it apart\nAnd the more he realizes how at risk people are the more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying\nWe'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people well what about children what a ...\nGovernment [noise] hang on travel golf [laughter] they can take a drink of water that are [laughter] there you go um [noise] he\nHas this very early sense of the role of the government when we say in the constitution and promote the general welfare this is kinda how I said\nHe really means promote the general welfare and your everyday life that part of what we do is what we stand up for this that have done that I think he became perceived as an Africa as much as a scientist and that's probably right\nBut he wanted to use this position to make a difference and he actually dead that's the thing that one of the things I Love about this story it's a story of a single person who drives the conversation right for thirty something years but changes\nThe conversation on our way we think about food safety so did he actually we're in where their laws created because of his crusade where the Congress actually put teeth and the FDA and things like that can be angry\nI Am so after you know he's like battling away die made by eventually in Nineteen oh six to laws passed then one was the meat inspection act and that was a direct result of Upton Sinclair as the jungle and the ... of the horrors\nAnd then about a week later the food and drug active Nineteen oh six passed a somewhat carried by that tunnel tidal wave of fury that brought us the meat inspection act\nAnd that was an and I we've forgotten the but that was the first great consumer protection law ever passed by the federal government and so it was the moment in which we'll all agree as a society\nThat the government's job is and part to protect the average citizen from harm and to stand\nThe immediately weekend by business interactions which it was to the point that he he ended up extremely frustrated I don't think he ever fully gave himself credit for what he accomplished\nBut and eventually that law led to a law in the Nineteen thirties that created the modern FDA so a lot of people still call him the father of the FDA even though he died before it was created\nYou know you have to do that you disagree with some of his of his tactics [noise]\nYou know he was as I say kind of a holy roller yeah and he became very rigid I I think some of that was that he was under attack constant attack both in government and out of it for Thirty years and he kind of off the five to some extent in a perpetual defensive position\nBut also he he just\nHe couldn't bend on even the little details so he would like spend his political capital this is my personal opinion\nI'm sure it appreciate it [laughter]\nAs a second guess their mind reserve later [laughter] you would like to ask about you've made of vinegar and it's a fake vinegar and you should not be allowed to even put", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Middletown", "day": "05"}
