[noise]\nHello it's an honor to be here [noise]\nHow did you get into this stuff music and combined with electronic\nOkay easy story there and my mother is from a family of musicians and my father was an electronic engineer and I came out like this uh [noise] she was\nBorn with a soldering iron and keyboard and the other hand um let's talk about music and technology specifically piano roles which inspired your latest project and you brought this machine here tonight the echo load Ian right that's what I'm calling it you know and we're going to hear from it a little bit later but first let's put it that\nWell this is a ... role if you don't know what a ... piece of like ... paper and it has holes on it and a tracker bar\nReads the holes and it's all pneumatic there are little hoses and each one of these dot is a note on the piano and eventually all that air pressure makes a bell a move and the hammer will hit the appropriate key\nBetter than you talking about let's go show it\n[noise] I'm\nGoing to come over here with you [noise]\nI thought that an old town over all music that we really can't hear or listen to without the interface I thought to make a digital interface for so this will read the panel and it will play out of that synthesizer how that's synthesizer\n[noise] every Saturday Night from him as well they um\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the typical ... plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\n\nThink about bees and aunts and spiders tiny as they are they're all vital parts of our ecosystem whether it's food or pollinators are predators and they have another thing in common complex social behavior think about the term hive mind right\nThis idea that all the individuals in a group are working together to keep each other alive in this crazy world but how well does that actually work out what factors make a colony more or less successful and can individual behavior still pills the hand of fate for the whole group\nOr the hives indeed the legion my next guest looked at these questions Alice Waters is an associate professor at UC Riverside studying the wives of bumble bee and know what the woman is an associate professor at UCLA\nLooking at these social behavior of bees and and even spider [noise]\n\n... what did you know I if you ask everybody you they'll tell you that honeybees get all the attention right now but you've gravitated to bumble bee why was\nMy actually did my PHD in a honeybee lab\nAnd but I went ... and worked on ... that I started a PHD in two thousand steak which is the year that the honeybee genome sequence and when it was the ... we suddenly had this tool kit and we can use to answer all kinds of really cool molecular\nBumblebees have a very different like circle right out of the colonies gets stored\nFor honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social um there's never a point in their lives in the life of a hobby queen\nWhere she's living on her own but bumble bee or different um they have an annually social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerge in the colony and queens will leave the nest on their own in the spring I these queens have to grow wintering thought\nAnd start their own now so they're spending most of their life living on their own and so even though there's social insects and yes you'll notice from the get go that it looks a lot different than a honeybee now it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bomb will be the actually share a common origin of reality that we think that\nThe ancestor to both of these the group they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that ancestor was social but since that time you know a lot can happen and a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way the ... the way that they live\nThere to protect roaming the meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we turned to confuse the two kinds of bees was having equals lifestyles all the time we really well to be to be\nRight well I consider honeybees is they ... and swings my lab actually studies and um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focused and the ants and so some of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forge and how different individuals and economy contribute to forging pay roughly ... home\nYour broker man with ... Jarvis\nHarvest friends from I'm here in California for extra pressure on the sidewalk ... slightly larger than what you are a little bit longer there but yeah and they push the than the ones you see on the sidewalk\nNice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between the sites so a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they for it and how quickly they called her friends to foods to another thing I brought here as a cast and asked me to flip it over I was on its head\nToward Heinz was like that that sort of cast of a an an Smith yes you is that like pouring plaster Paris it's exactly fast their players from Home Depot\nHow far does that go down and just the whole life I Know that's just the top part about six or eight inches long works from just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nYes you can forces and think um which is the type of metal like water and so it slows down much deeper around and it won't break like the plaster much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to so and then my mentor I study to see these there's a lot of ... so that determines how deep they can go\nOn for so much focus on queen bumblebees wonder about the drunk a difference in whether a colonies to\nDo too much completely different depending on this one or the other day the loud enough to millions of\nImages taken with a macro lens and the small individuals or their babies that hatched from their ... um and so they take care of all these babies together with their standing on is basically a little nest that they built and then they build another Web that and what we call the capture Web and so that can go basically on on a whole a case of tree\nUm and that's where they'll capture the food and still usually large things get caught in the ... and so you'll see a bunch of spiders all come out from the retreat and\nUm each individual take a different piece of the insect that they're capturing and starts injecting venom and then they'll all come in just that\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow coming to you from the typical arts plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\n\nDid you sleep last night yeah me neither something about being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard but I Am not the only one I can see from the audience that district's about sleep in the United\nAnd you've probably heard by now that it's a bad idea to consistently lose disease chronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole ... what do you need to our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits are schedules could there be jeans at work\nMy next guest says the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep in how well we recover from last week and he's found one of these genes in a surprising place\nNowhere near the brain welcome back to tame appalling associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles [noise]\n\nIs that right you need to get seven hours of sleep a night that's what the usual requirement is\nYes for um the majority of long term studies that have looked have found that if you get the significantly less or significantly more than seven to eight point five hours a night then that doesn't work out well for you in time in a lot of trouble\n'cause I get like sick if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that about\nWell how can I add in all honesty I'm going to fix our crowd myself why do we need to sleep in the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually what\nWe do know is bad if you don't sleep adequately\nBad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first star where we can sort of short term so many ... after you leave here and ready to go hang out to a party or you just maybe up with the kids\nThey make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do those tend to be um cognitive effects there are more longer term effects if you continue daily on a regular basis\nNot getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at a higher risk for infectious diseases\nAnd it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease stroke and diabetes\nI mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping\nAnd interestingly enough I think our genes are pretty much involved in everything we do uh what what does it what\nAbout sleep what our genes control would it be the hour that than the number of hours of the quality what what one of the gene\n... that's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about James is you're not just talking about how genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment\nSo I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works I'm from a kind of line of research that has shown that genes play an important role and timing sleep\nI'm there a time of day you prefer to leave the time of day you prefer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day recently most of the night on what we're trying to understand our\nWhat genes are responsible for the door the properties of sleep the things about sleep that\nPreserves your memory and your ability to focus and the things about sleep that improve your health\nThe genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on\nNow what fascinated me about reading about your research also with that\nThey're well they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressed in the brain that are expressed in the body\nThe gene that I focused on in my most recent but it'd be all wanted to express and the majority of tissues in which\nWe have um analyze so the mall one is what's known as a clot team\nYou have clocks in every cell in your body very real clocks in order for something to be characterized as the clock there has to be an input mechanism to that it has to be an ... and the timing mechanism like gears I talked to my students about gives on the clock most of them don't know the clock is er [noise] so I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phone\nAt the time I have is an output mechanism that allows you to tell the time\nThe majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulates sleep\nOn for a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we've looked primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain and most of the things that drivers sleep or in the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks in the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to leap regulatory areas and the brain and tell your brain how to sleep more importantly how to recover from sleep loss\nAnd when do you mean how to recover so the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes too low a turn the heat on your terms that's how the hit on the ... goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep process these works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day\nIf you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more if you get too much sleep it will go and the other direction the clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning to go to one temperature\nIn the evening it's best to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep on for a long\nTo recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes that are like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing also play a role in your ability to recover from you know so when you say the clock\nIs that the district Katie in rhythm we've\nBeen talking about on this circadian clock that regulates your daily rhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down it might um synchronize o'clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock will still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism and it would isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours\nQuestion over here yeah I had a question about napping as I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an ... [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you're speaking of in the Gulf\nSo napping as it is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way\nThey win by ... an hour and I do have one of the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap and miles of the afternoon no one can complain you can write at all I mean I Know what I'm doing research [laughter] but you're saying napping is important it is very important\nIf you're not getting daily sufficiently and most of us to have children or have jobs or live in a busy environment may not beginning um sufficient sleep so if you're not then getting an afternoon nap\nAn hour's usually what's about recommended but I think from a half hour to an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping that goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much too much of that suggest that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting\nEspecially those of us that get sleepy or the afternoons\nSometimes between one to three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now oh gosh I have to be pretty animated when I'm teaching but you can't blame them either exactly right that's why I don't try to understand but that's just like let me go to the questions on his side yeah\nHi my question is about the adolescent brain and sleep out ever since I was in high school we were talking about shifting the start time for high schoolers to be later in the day\nBecause [noise] yeah [laughter] and and as a parent I definitely want that to happen because getting my kids\nUp in the morning before noon is a challenge how does your study affect\nOur decision making and farming our society in that arena\nSo the quickest way to answer a question is that my study doesn't affect that at all [noise]", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "19"}
