our great pleasure to have your banking you can make calls in a variety of ways so what technique to the Mayan women that were they're using to make salt\n[noise] well I like people around the world of course everybody needs dietary salt in ancient civilizations and other farming cultures as as well but uh the might have\nCollected salt from salt flats off the north coast of the Yucatan but in in other areas like the coast of police where it rains a lot and you you they don't have the solar ... of operation possibilities\nThey were boiling brine in pots over fires and they we found at in southern beliefs are below the sea floor we found wouldn't buildings which indicate they were doing this a salt production indoors on a massive scale\nWhat what was this surprising in expected\nSet up yes it was I was really doing a regional survey looking towards sites\nAre after having worked at elsewhere on the coast and I was looking in shallow areas because in the water because I knew but we did that applied syllable ride\nAnd we found sites that or about a meter below the sea floor and we excavated them and they had pottery that identified as salt making pottery that's been published a book on\nOn the fine salt white gold of the ancient Maya but in two thousand and four we made a major discovery and that was that below the sea floor its main growth Pete and the Pete\nWhich is resulting from the feel of a rise a it preserved within posts and that we've mapped over four thousand we actually met four thousand um\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow in May of Nineteen fifty

earth analyzing their communication structures of their societies\nAnd the brainy ways that they navigate their world as my next guest the neatest down assistant professor of biology at California Lutheran university here in Thousand Oaks welcome to science friday I think it's great to be here you know I remember a squirrel monkey that squirrel monkey from my childhood\nAs one of the first animals I wanted to say wow what got you fascinated with study\nThough I'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and uh I knew that I wanted to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research\nAnd I started reading about squirrel monkey and became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in\nSo off I went to um Amazon in Brazil for twelve months\nAnd I thought it would just be one you know one project one season but the more time I spent there the more I\nBecame fascinated with all kinds of questions about them and I couldn't find a lot of answers in the ...\nHow many years there are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging [noise] um but yeah that's how it all started\nWow so how many do you study how many years the group a number of your study\nYes so um the groups are very large ah there but my groups have thirty to fifty animal [noise] so I monitor two or three groups regularly\nAnd I do do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of it\nSome don't score one of the challenges of working with school monkeys is that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they move quite fast they're pretty active\nSo it's not that easy to individually identify them a particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality or yeah they do stand out\nOkay give me a typical day in the life\nOf a squirrel monkey [noise] okay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping tree and uh they spend a lot of time active uh all day they they're nonstop\nOr they eat a fruit and they eat mostly insects and so they spend a lot of time forging in the morning for insects but really that goes on all day when it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to Iraq but rats for a group of ... monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we follow them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven\nFor their practice or twelve hours I hear that\nUh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshoppers sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom and out what the head up and then they bite off the head\nKind of like an ice cream cone and then they slurp the inside and then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes and they seem very happy while they're doing it\nWow [laughter]\nAnd I understand they're not afraid to attack a while I'll watch [noise] right why why haven't they do that yeah\nSo I've only seen adults do it but I actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a walk or a particular species and um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are not that Hank pretty low\nAnd won the adult lost desert than that the adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that left abandoned the net [noise]\nWow for their pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient and patient [laughter] I was watching for not leaving so right yeah I've done this myself [laughter] problem we have a clip I I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's of of of of the other one of the spider monkey let's let's hear that clip\n[noise] our\nScore a monkey actually spider monkey everybody does that ever is that right yeah okay tell us what we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact called but these are made by animals that are not very\nNot not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys and there you can you recognize their own\nUm I can recognize yes um the the the fender and the receiver so um but when there is you know ten of them in a tree kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\nWe have another clip that sounds a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm [noise]\n\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there was an adult male at least and they're making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies of jungles or you know that that that the child that we hear is that right is it usually does is those squirrel monkey so we're listening to\nIt might it might be words actually because we're monkeys down a lot like birds when you're in the forest right um that's what my students usually notices that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of square monkeys and put a bird and\nHow hard was it how much time has it taken you to know the difference in the study that sounds very me\nSo it's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys um you just get used to it um it it probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or [noise]\nEverything about square monkey then so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkey\nHow long have you been doing that for a little longer\nHe's started with with uh a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing for about Twenty years [noise]\nVery monkey whisper yeah well if you call him a yes sometimes be busy like she loves it [laughter] is there anything that we can learn about the human language for evolution of our language from from studying them for ...\nSo um it's interesting that you bring that up because I'm so there's a a hypothesis that was proposed about Twenty years ago called the vocal grooming hypothesis\nAnd um the idea here is that you can try to understand the evolution of human language so the idea that humans started living in social groups that we're increasingly large and so manual grooming sort of the kind of we've seen bad ...\nBecame less less feasible really and so the idea that humans would have invented an alternative form of grooming vocal grooming so it would be a way to maintain contact in social bond with their their friends\nUm and that would leave the hands also free for other task um and the idea that that eventually would have evolved into human language now or monkeys for living in groups so fruits so large they're actually\nPretty a social they don't groom ... we expect primates all to do that but they don't actually groom each other they to live in social groups that are large um they don't groom and they talk all the time they're constantly chattering there it's nonstop town when they're forging when they're traveling\n\n\nIs science friday I'm Ira Flatow you know every year salmon and go on the most important journey of their lives [noise] after living years in the wild wild oceans they must win back to the coast to one very particular river amounts\nLittle freshwater spring where they were born how did he do this well like in\nAny good trip you need a map and not just a compass is just telling you where north is you also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to is it straight north isn't more northeast he than south well you know a few years ago researchers concluded\nThat what if they had long to suspected that typically salmon can detect\nThe magnetic field lines of beer beer map is they're magnetic\nAnd what about their Olympic dwelling cousins and when you let fish living quiet landlocked lines you know lived their whole lives with dozens of generations landlocked what happens to that map\nHere to explain Moore's Michelle's gambling a faculty research assistant Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me\nYou know I just I just said about the salmon living pressed of lives right they travel all that way how many miles do their journeys tech\nThat is pretty impressive and their journey can be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds\n... and and they usually hedging these are these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back there that's correct and they don't just have to navigate upstream they have to find the right stream to go how does he do this they they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS some store in\nThe side than have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reach streams are they generally with use their sense of smell\nBut in terms of the oceanic journeys in wages they use something more broad scale and in this term we think they're using magnetic nap and they make information [laughter]\nIt was rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants of individuals that were transferred from a landlocked lake in Maine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery\nSo these fish have never had access to the Pacific ocean and have never sat than outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of hatchery\n... and ... and yet you found that they still have the Jew magnetic maps in them that they would have needed that they knocked ... that's correct and and how were they able to retain these and why\nThat's an interesting question a so Salman when they use magnetic information they can use different aspects of the magnetic field especially for math\nAnd so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different components one is the strength of the magnetic field or also known as my dad field intensity\nAnd so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator another aspect of the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth\nAnd so they're steeper toward the polls and shallower at the equator and both of these components predict are favorably\nAre predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nSo super convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel form a type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their body that can do that\nUnclear but one of the leading hypotheses is that a salmon and other species\nHave tiny chains of magnet tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic property and so these chains of mango tight are associated with nerve cells and the thought is that these chains can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields\nAnd so changes in both the field strengths and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials\nSo these made ... structures are thought to be found in the nose and also the latter alliance all along the sides of the body of a fish\nBut the men need a receptor itself a is still elusive\nAnd worry one important to you why why does it matter that they can still detect these fields\nWell it's a rather interesting question do we wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of species that could go to the ocean retain a map sense\nJust to a point of curiosity and we also wanted to know um if the Atlantic salmon also possess disability it's another group of individuals that\nDoes ethnic maps and a lot of diverse amount of no amount of species but we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic environments one can they even detect a magnetic field\nBut to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how did they actually respond\nMhm and so how did you go about testing research\nSo\nEggs from the individuals at the lake in Oregon were transported to the organ hatchery Research Center where they were rewritten subsequently tested and so we tested these individuals\nAnd when you attach copper wires to on an electrical power supply\nAnd crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct of that\nElectricity is a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils is that allows us to alter the direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\n... so what you're doing I Know for my basic physics you know in grade school them if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnum pi the metal in a certain direction\nSo that sounds to me basically what you're doing to the Fisher you magnify them studying beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\nIf there were present them with magnetic field essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains of tight right that somehow connect within ourselves\nRight and and so having a fish respond to this\nSo we evaluate the movement fish movement by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials\nSo what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos of our fish and so we take photos and we assess the position of the fishes head relative to magnetic north\nThat's terrific and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nYeah so what do ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these fish again\nSo we have a whole number of experiments that we have talked about over the years but one of the experiments would be to actually look at nine magnetic resolution of this map so having the theory that points moving them closer and closer together and to see how fine or course scale responses actually are\nSo uh could could you save endangered salmon man by knowing more about them\nI mean it always helps to know more information about uh the the that you're trying to conserve them knowing how they're making movement decisions would certainly be helpful and probably a tool in Santa conservation but certainly not the only thing\nThat we can live with them yeah well good luck to you and your future experiments All right thank you very much Michelle Scanlon is or faculty research has just been department of fisheries and wildlife in Oregon State University in Corvallis
