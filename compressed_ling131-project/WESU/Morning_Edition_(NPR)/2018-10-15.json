the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six\nCenturies so at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr if if the point where it's it's more than ... percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ten years you're you're probably global sales had been out pacing\nYour domestic sales while and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the soldiers are still are but yes I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a nap to on the agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know you have distilleries are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nAh we don't like any options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase tests are taxes no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people that have converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky\nObviously this is a state that voted for president for that has voted for Republicans a law that asked um would you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand or know winters are a trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why you know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nUh it come up as an issue yet you made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us\nAnd the past few months he set up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what probably means in decades or he will note for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes uh and and he told us he understood exactly that this would this district mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thinks that I took the federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four Congress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States\nUnlike Harley Davidson which announced they could move some production overseas we can't do that with birth and you've got to make it here in American if he wants to like you better make they can check beginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this has been\nA yeah I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking and from a price standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking\nBefore you know we might lose people for our

Bush Iraq Obama and even Donald Trump\nThey have all agreed to keep this issue off the table in secret letters issued earlier there administrator ... to the Israelis stating that they will not bring up the subject\nNow I Would argue and the evidence suggests that there is no reason or benefit to the United states to be dishonest about this proliferation in the middle east and to continue to pretend\nAnd even banned federal agents the employees under penalty of prosecution from even talking about is the main benefits goes to the ministry nation if the administration and its party\nThat's backing it wants to continue to have access to vast amounts of coordinated pro Israel campaign contributions than they can't go against the lobby and Israel on this most sacred of issues\nThat up to fifty percent of any parties campaign contributions\nAre from what are assumed to be pro Israel Jewish donors and they absolutely do not want either party to alienate such a key constituency to their party their election prospects\nAnd all of the hopes for a successful administration and that is why\nAccording to recent research reports and according to our last lawsuit they have issued a series of letters early in their administrator ... promising that this entire issue will be off the table there are many downsides for American policy obviously\nThere are few countries in the world and in particular in the middle East that view the United states as a true champion\nOf nuclear nonproliferation because\nThere's this giant asterisk blow the U.S demands that there'd be no further entries into the nuclear weapons holding club\nAnd that asterisk is Israel the United states and Israel have shielded the continued deployment of an Israeli try ad involving aircraft mostly supplied by the U.S missiles mostly developed by Israel\nAnd submarines mostly provided by the Germans onto which the Israelis have allegedly mounted their nuclear\nFirst and second strike capabilities so the United states really doesn't have any credibility in this arena it's particularly galling and and may even lead to\nA or have led to some of the laughter involving Donald Trump's presentation at the un the United states is simply not a champion of non ...\nOh of know how and nuclear weapons development technologies to Israel a number of lawsuits that we filed actually you'll good reports that no journalists of ever pursued one of them detailed the fact that Israel's nuclear production facilities\nAre almost a mirror image of the United states nuclear weapons production laboratories\nThat the

put her file a complaint but then some of the University of Pennsylvania students in the bar who witnessed this er refused to testify or the case goes nowhere even though the end of the pie in New Jersey is willing to take it on\nThe case goes nowhere like that that experience Dr King had before he gets the Montgomery\nRight he's thinking about segregation in broad terms and he's thinking about it in the Nineteen fifties right it's not that he discovers that like you're saying and in Chicago and sixty six\nAnd ruin porn as a professional radical embarrassing breathing on or maybe you should be [noise] she was described often by whites movement to show for resume resumes\nAs someone in middle age you just got hired him back down on the book [noise]\nMhm [noise] I mean I think a few things right of Rosa Parks has a huge political history even before Nineteen fifty five and then it continues for decades more\nAnd they basically like I had to be well Dr Rosa Parks basically is run out of town right her and her family after the boycott successful and they still can't find work she loses her job during the cat her husband loses his job they're getting that threat credible death threats\nSo eight months after the cat and Rosa Parks leaves and moved to Detroit where her brother and cousins are not living and she will describe Detroit as the northern promised land that lessons and social keep fighting kind of the racism of her new home town per decade for the next forty years tell her death but that's not a Rosa Parks\nDecember first Nineteen fifty five and it helps to galvanize the movement and this year long bus boycott but we have to remember we're in the middle of the Cold War we have to remember that Rosa Parks long history with the N double ACP at this point is politically dangerous by June of Nineteen fifty six the\nN. double ACP an Alabama will be outlawed in Alabama as a kind of foreign organization so part of why we start to see\nMovement leaders kidding\nThe black press even parks herself somewhat during\nThe boycott begin to talk about her as a kind of good Christian seamstress there talking less about although everyone knows right ah like she has this long political history we see\nMaybe not everyone but many people know that they begin to talk about that left\nOf the dangerous political climate of the Cold War and how her long history of activism before this can be misused white people in Montgomery from the beginning from the first day\nAre all sorts of rumors about parks they say she's the communist plant she's an N. double ACP plant she's Mexican and she doesn't even live in Montgomery I mean all of these crazy rumors but at least what these rumors are about you\nIs that she is an outside agitator\nAnd from what I can figure out they don't quite realize how much of a history that she had with the N. double ACP the Montgomery Advertiser which is the main newspaper Montgomery is very anti the boycott\nVery pro status quo and they don't seem to really figure out that she has this more than a decade of work with the N. double ACP so even though all these rumors are flying they are in some sense back rounding that long political history to keep the movements sick\nAnd the tour of Dr King\nDue to my or ... years old who refused to condemn the urban rebellions that were wrecking the United states every over these then how do you convince them that\nTime the violin when the United states was the greatest ... very real violence in the world today\nRight I mean I think the first thing is the movements king is a part of right are deeply disruptive\nI think we somehow look back and have made it seem like all good people thought what Dr King was doing was right at the time that's just\nNot true the majority of people at the time did not approve of the civil rights movement while it was happening they did not approve of Dr King if we look at the\nFBI attention to Dr King their surveillance of Dr King their harassment of Dr King ... only escalates after the march on Washington speech\nSo if we think of the march on Washington speech is king\nThe way it's presented ... schoolchildren this is the most American thing that ever\nHappened and then we look at actually how it was treated at the time most Americans did not agree with it it was heavily policed and heavily surveilled by the FBI editing is in the wake of the march on Washington at the FBI increases that surveillance of Dr King with the Kennedys\nAgreement so if you look at the documents signing off on the kind of bugging a king\nHouse in office and stuff it's signed by Robert Kennedy so I think sometimes that we talk about king and we say okay in the last year or two he became unacceptable in the last year or two he angered the powers that be the powers that be were terrified of Dr King and sixty three\nI mean they're terrified of him in sixty seven\nBut they are already terrified and sixty three I and I think we have to remember that because I think so\nDidn't like that today new movements they're just you just strapped to their to their to all over the place but many of these same criticisms argue against that\nAnd statues because we're done with that\nAnd so it's not merely coincidental that the statue of or the parks has unveiled on this\nDay I think it is revealing\nOf the ways the civil rights movement it's misused to say we're done to fix that I'm a canal in a sort of celebrate our progress\nThat world professor gene your ... speaking from Brooklyn New York\nPennsylvania is twenty five state prisons all went on lockdown last month with no notification to inmates or to the public\nIt eventually emerge step to state was claiming that prison guards and other employees had been poisoned by\nContraband drugs that were smuggled into the prison medical experts and others question that state story\nAmong the most skeptical parties\nAll the lawyers for the abolition is lost senator and the Amish stab Law Project who fight for prisoners rights in Pennsylvania yeah Chris Henderson is with the um is thought Law Project in Philadelphia\nI was actually on a legal visit the Wednesday that they lock down all the prisons are meeting with a client to prepare for a\nCourt hearing we had coming up\nAnd you know we're told that er visits are ending and at first we thought it was just that facility that was going to be locked down once we were out and able to communicate with people and look up things on the Internet we realize that actually the entire system was shut down and you know went from being like\nLike what is actually even the cause of this and like you know realizing that they were saying it was because of this massive influx of drugs that was getting all staff sick to them like actually looking\nPeople that they find the drugs in the mail and also we know that a lot of the drugs getting into the facilities if not most of them are coming in through staff\nYes sir I'm university we seem to be in prison and he wrote the country the guards to come and go from not being made the new rules outlaw book in some form\nYeah at this moment there are a number of people that I correspond with you know both as their attorney or you know and like a more like friend personal level I mean there are number of people I send books to if I read a book on the tickets good or think that\nYou know someone that I Know would find it interesting before I Would send that person has a book from Amazon\nNow we can't do that they're supposed to be some new system in the works\nWhere people can maybe send books from some places or\nWhere certain places that had been able to send in books like books through bars amazing organization based in Philadelphia and it's been sending donated books to people inside Pennsylvania presidents for over Twenty years none of those things are able to happen right now they have been rolling out this system where people can get the books on\nA one hundred and fifty dollar tablets that if they have that tablet within those ... books there's very few e books on there\nWas a little over a thousand which you know may sound like a lot but in comparison to the millions of books on Amazon is really miniscule and those books are more expensive than the e books even that we would be able to buy on the outside from Amazon\nAnd so no matter how they cut it talking about how they're going to be more books in the future and who's going to be more access to the fact of the matter is that right now people don't have the same access that they had and\nWhat they're given now is not enough\nThe system so things like you know solitary confinement not being used as much or other things that are really just like making the system a little bit more humane they just see as an affront to their power\nAnd a way that they aren't able to control the people who are helping to incarcerate definitely think that pressure from staff in different ways that I think we don't totally know how that is actually being manifested but that that definitely does have an influence on these policies and practices\nAnd how credible Margaret guard complains that they've been poisoned by drugs coming in\nI mean I think looking at the different reports of the various elements of staff members you know I don't doubt that at least some of those folks were very concerned that they were being poisoned or second but I think\nGiven for those people that the science doesn't make that something that is very likely now what is more likely than not is that some staff members saw the writing on the wall\nSaw people who are becoming sick or looked like they were sick and you know we're kind of going along with the flow and that some people know did have panic attacks or whatever else as a result of feeling like maybe they were going to be harmed or were in danger in some way\nBut that's just not the reality of how these drugs work\nThat was that journey
