this case she'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing that's because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing\nRebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing has change just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that their line it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focused on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromise or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the

Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week Rick\nRobert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork\nThe Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination adventure Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that it's being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics of the government work hike okay Hi the here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process offended how does it affect their legacy or not ... well out of a hundred and\nSixty three nominations the president is sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on so we don't have any\nMeans but it's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen have been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with them over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice to aid for just have to achieve also failed in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWell the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nOnes have different courses Robert Bork resign from his judgeship and went on to write books to make speeches then the man President Reagan named after Bork a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to it\nOh rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused him to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for\nThomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with him politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John Randall off in the house of representatives that hit wipe the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly know\nA dead end the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing a just just for political reasons\nAnd that leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth of Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime equipment and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now if so what was the result or what is it with these lifetime appointments well lots\nOf judicial plans and various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age some at both uh they've been talk of the Eighteen year term limits for Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere\nThat would require a changing the law or in the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much and his name's commentator Cokie Roberts and you can ask Cokie your questions about our politics and

winners presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate oh not so you know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by searching an element of randomness to the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but\nThe randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme up putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display uses the virus to infect bacteria and it can be used to evolve new proteins and\nIncluding antibiotics that is what Gregory Winter did took phage display and apply to the antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies there's all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness and too important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know and I'm make chemical reactions go faster and you could you know developed and time to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved in two thousand and two and it targets a rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease\nSo you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer we heard

commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics or the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process offended how does that affect their legacy or not well out of a hundred and\nSixty three nominations that presidents are sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on some words do how do\nYou mean it's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen have been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington while when the Senate refused to remove Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with them over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas up to achieve also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWell the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominate after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resign from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches than the man President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because he had to legally smoke marijuana but he said on the federal appeals court until he took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask us to Ming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused him to be removed\nWould be highly unlikely uh the way you remove the Supreme Court justice is through impeachment\nEighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted him off the court because he disagreed with him politically he accused him of parted and rhetoric\nJohn Randall off in the house representatives said hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness there's hardly know a dead end the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing adjust for political reasons\nAnd that leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now it's so what was the result of what is it with these lifetime appointments\nWell lots of judicial plans and various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age summit both are there been talk of an Eighteen year term limits squares Supreme Court just sit here not likely to go anywhere\nThat would require a change in the law or the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much and commentator Cokie Roberts and you can ask Cokie your

add that the pro choice movement equally do the services to women\nWhen they don't look at the real complications in a woman's life and if you've ever been pregnant it's a no brainer you know you've thought about all of those things\nThat really segments really well into my next question which is\nI wanted to ask you a bit about Canada the development of the movement for reproductive justice it's a movement that is women of color defined and women of color lead and I I wanted to talk about that but I wanted to first asked you to define it to to talk about what is reproductive justice\nWell there's a shorthand version of reproductive justice reproductive rights married to a social justice is reproductive justice that's the shorter version the longer version is\nThe\nTo control the fertility the fertility of women of color is directly linked to attempt to control the destiny of our communities\nWhen you're trying to steal our land you're trying to limit our fertility when you're trying to exploit our labor you're trying to breed us so that you could have more laborers\nWhat ever you're doing whether it's to increase our fertility or decrease it you're doing it so that you could control what's happening in our communities so women of color don't see\nControlling their bodies as just an individualistic issue is about what's happening in my community why is this happening so they can't just say pro choice as my body it's my right no it is your body and your body as the template for what\nIn Nineteen Ninety four at a conference in Chicago organized by the Illinois pro choice alliance and as usual\nA few women of color came to this majority white conference and we immediately went off and caucus because that's what I Would have to always do at these conferences 'cause we don't have all spaces where we can organize that many times so we caught them\nAnd at the time we were very upset because President Clinton\nWas considering healthcare reform but at the same time he was not talking about covering reproductive rights and health care reform and we said well if we allow\nThis so called friendly president to get away with not talking about abortion and prenatal care and teen pregnancy an STD prevention and HIV aids and health care reform\nThat he's not worse than anybody else you may you know better than anybody else\nThat we have to deal with and so we coined in that meeting the concept of reproductive justice because we felt that the term pro choice didn't work for us why because\nHow can you have a meaningful choices in life when so much so much else will circle scribes you can't choose\nWhether or not you're going to have a baby when you don't have health care you can't choose whether or not your baby is going to have a healthy seat ... if you're living in substandard housing I mean there's so many issues that affect choice\nAnd the choice as a framework only makes sense to people who actually have choices [noise]\nPeople don't have choices find choice an empty phrase so we coined the phrase reproductive justice in Nineteen Ninety four and since then we've been popularized\nRight that talks about the right to housing the right to healthcare the right to free free from violence as reproductive rights issues\nAs well as the right to control what happens to your body but also to control what happens to your community so to immigrant rights as a reproductive rights issue welfare rights as an immigrant is a reproductive rights issue it connect the dots okay and how has\nUm mainstream feminist movement within the United states picked up the concept of or how have they not the case may be I think that's the ... the concept of reproductive justice and really embraced it as something that's essential to women's movements going forward\nThe extent to which the mainstream women's movement has embraced the concept of reproductive justice I Believe is directly tied to their antecedent where they come from we find that the more feminist organizations tomorrow Mormon centered organizations\nTend to resonate with that because they see that we're talking about real women real lives not just\nYou know whether or not they're pregnant Arkansas contraceptive are those kinds of terms I find that those organizations who history is more in the population control movement\nThat's really focused on limiting population growth and particularly limiting the growth of certain parts for the population\nThey don't get the concept of reproductive justice and they really push back and say well we don't see how housing is a reproductive rights issue or we don't see why immigration is a reproductive rights issue as a matter of fact we think we should have increased immigration restrictions as a way of controlling the population\nAs though the term reproductive justice really doesn't work for them now there are few paradoxes in there [noise]\nSo every time a woman comes to the clinic is not just coming needing to learn how to use birth control are seeking an abortion but when she walks into that clinics you've got to tell you about are bad outing our lack of a living wage which is why you can't pay the bill\nThey're the ones that are beginning to say well maybe there's something to this reproductive justice but not because they understand it as a top down thing but because from their lived experience was real clients\nIs beginning to make sense and how they need to package to services that they're delivering to people\nMy understanding you know through the you know the history of women's movements in the U.S [noise] you know women's movements mainstream ones have been widely criticized for kind of excluding the voices of women of color and I'm Wondering if you can look at that exclusion within the context of reproductive justice\nOr one of the things that both the mainstream women's movement but it's also be cleared the coverage of the mainstream women's movement\nHas done has marginalized voices the perspectives of women of color but I don't think it's intentional so much as it is tied to the different reproductive gifted nice of white women and women of color [noise]\nLet me give you an example a woman that I Am much admiration for his Eleanor Smith who was the president of now I was at a conversation with Eli, Eli is married with two children\nShe and her husband Charlie had decided that they didn't want to have any more kids\nSo when Eli went to her doctor for a voluntary hysterectomy heart doctor insisted that she get examined by two different psychiatry has to prove that she was not crazy for not wanting to have more children\nOn the other hand I'm Nineteen\nThese are two different destiny imposed upon us by our white supremacy construct\nSo I tend not to be hyper critical of the mainstream white women for not understanding the perspective of women of color 'cause that's not the destiny that's intended for them they're responding to the pressures that are put on them to have more children\nBut from the perspective of women of color were responding to the pressures to keep us from having a child and so we have to fight for the right to have a child with the same determination that they fight for the right not to\nHave a child but I also made a point there is the mainstream women's movement but let's be clear there were women of color in the mainstream limits but myself included and so whenever we kinda repeat that we've kind of like wiped out the history of all the way with a caller that were in the movement\nBut then there is the media and the public perception\nOf the mainstream women's movement which is always read as white middle class and to be honest not all the white women in the\nMovement were middle class that were poor white women in the women's movement the rich white women in the middle in the women's movement\nBut they never say that they never knew what I said that way there were a poor black\nWomen in the women's ... like myself there were rich black women and the women's ...\nThey never talk about that so we have to be clear not to respond to the media dominated narrative of what the women's movement was but talk about it's reality but I'm not surprised that I don't offer critique now you asked me to relate that to reproductive rights [noise]\nWhen Ravi way legalized
