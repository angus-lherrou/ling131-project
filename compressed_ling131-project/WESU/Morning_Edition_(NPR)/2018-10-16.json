University of Nebraska he's going to describe two towns and you have to guess which one is liberal and which is conservative here ... number one\nThe schools would straps you know patriotism and respect him it would be a very rules based uh educational system but how is this would be fairly similar lawns would be a very nicely kept in a beautifully green and mode of the town of be quiet with lots of churches\nAll right and here is town number two\nThe schools would be based more on experience are all kinds of things rather than than rote memory people would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural um lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films are more of those than churches\nThis quiz was probably pretty easy for you and to explain why we're joined now by NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam Hi Shankar I Know so the first time I'm guessing was conservative and\nAutor and rules liberals prefer experiential schools and community theaters now those are stereotypes which means that they're going to be liberals who hate community theaters and conservatives who despised churches but the question that hitting and others are asking is how companies stereotypes are so often accurate\nIf being liberal and conservative is all about our political views how companies labels describe all kinds of other things about us from the kinds of food we prefer to eat to the kinds of poetry we laugh\nTo where we want to hang out so he is arguing that our political views spring from something deeper than just our beliefs about big government or small government\nPrecisely he's arguing that political preferences at least in part compromised psychological and biological predisposition\nThe most compelling evidence for this comes from studies involving large numbers of twins some of whom are identical and some of whom are fraternal\nIdentical twins share the same genes fraternal twins share fewer genes identical twins tend not to have more political preferences in common than fraternal twins do even though each twin ... presumably shared the same family and not bringing\nHeight for example turns out to be about eighty percent or heritable when you're subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent\nThirty to forty percent so he's saying some part of our political beliefs come from biology yes\nAnd of course that conclusion upset a lot of people\nAnd they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was was genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent that comes from the environment so our thing is that that genetic component is not zero but apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that\nHe and his colleagues are saying is that biology and psychology play a role in our political preferences know liberals and conservatives in the United states often accused one another or stupidity or malice but it's hitting and his colleagues are right\nFrom four to four

I went to look for help and dumb and the police I ride the same place that I had school they asked me for babies and I said mine I just had the baby I was calling you and you didn't gum it has to be

[noise]\n\nTo clarify ... did not have an abortion and nearly nine months into her pregnancy what happened to her would be medically defined as a late term that trick emergency her charge was not abortion but aggravated homicide\nStill the country it's harsh laws towards abortion and reproductive rights play a factor in these cases the total abortion ban has helped to generate a culture in El Salvador that seeks to regulate women's bodies\nSo in this context any deviation from what is considered acceptable behavior for women it's considered punishable\nYou enough but as long as you're on the court but we're not going to let them because\nThere is a perception of guilt in relation to women in society is changing recently but I think that the majority of society which is very religious reject any possibility that abortion via rye for women\nUnder certain circumstances and is also affects the mentality of the court's field and nothing good can be expected from a situation of this nature\nIf of roe v Wade or it becomes no longer the law of the land that abortion be outlawed\nUh either completely art type but and seen a week's like eight weeks after eight weeks and not state and so many of the states actually happened working like this\nAre passing laws in their state I Would say to be ready for I think the moment that were are now\nOther states like California or New York\nHave been um expanding reproductive access in our state with the same type of looking at how do we make sure that regardless of what happened at the federal level that women still have accepted into the we've also been looking at how do\nYou really look at the intersection of what it means to be a abortion but when it comes to like the Hyde amendment and getting rid of that and what we called ... which is another way many of these I'm conservative leaning\nA legislators have been putting into place in ... laws that um yet specifically targeted to abortion providers and making it that they have to do some type of\nFree in the type of laws or regulations\nTo have hallways big enough for you or needs to get past rate so we're talking about hospital type level um for a small clinic and most ... do not have the funding to rebuild their whole buildings in order to comply with many of those laws\nAnd so between ... and ... we are now looking at the vast majority of states where women live will have less access and\nIf for some reason I'm rover your way to get the mantle which we we think might happen in the next couple of years um [noise] that they would be just no work that day\nYou said the vast majority of states I Know you you can't lift all of the states but can you tell me like how many inch and which states will probably be the first to try and restrict abortion access\nNot sure which states are the most hungry is for that um [noise]\nOf course Mississippi Alabama a couple of the states that do have some of these laws on the bus I also believe Utah does as well [noise]\nBelieve twenty six states have some type of anti abortion um laws on the books that were strict ah abortion right I Know a lot of folks have been doing is social justice organization had been working in civic engagement for a long time and get each other out the low\nA boat one of the places that\nWe just haven't had an eye on the ball with courts and judges and this is also why we need to pay super attention to prosecutors\nIs super ... ah attention to judge us before we even get to the Supreme Court or most women are having to face these prosecutors at each with prosecutors and judges that are making and changing a lot\nAnd if they want to charge it right and they're the ones that are uh\nI Would have been seen the law to the will to start charging pregnant women because the intention of them was it really for anti abortion\nIt was really to kind of acknowledge pregnant women um and so if you get a committed a crime against a pregnant woman that there was an extra charge or enhancement charge\nAnd this is what they have been really working on is like well how can we make it homicide or how could we they charge us pregnant women with um some type of manslaughter are\nLike her body for some reason that that belongs to her when she becomes pregnant and they take her uterus essentially and get their own right outside of her [noise]\n\nSo I think what's also interesting to me but at the justice Will Smith started because of\nA particularly black women were fighting for the right to have children why hadn't a feminist movement was fighting for the right to not to have children and so I think that's really important to us so think about\nIs how both the anti choice laws are for all women however how as they are still try to regulate when there's bodies to have children\nThey are still still working on ways for women of color to not be able to have children right we just worked on a bill now and I think I think we'd have to ... Thirteen to stop the legal sterilization of women in prison in California right\nAnd we know that we're ... women of color\nSo it's always very this kind of double edged sword\nAnd it criminalizes all women and many women are color are are the ones to actually get criminalize and have to go to jail for these things that they're ... to a different way of of Jill ... being kind of economic policies stop women of color from being able to have children as well [noise]\n\nI was reading an article this ... this morning and it said it is not all women who are conflicted about cause and not it's white women and it broke down many of the polls that were happening and then when they broke it down by race\nReally women of color who wrote with causing a white woman fled I think we need to start paying attention to the idea of like woman that the monolithic group and that we all have the same things to lose [noise]\nWhen we have this conversation particularly around the anti choice movement we cannot take privilege out of that conversation\nAnd how that can be very pervasive and how in which people who I Would think that will be wanting to protect their right for their own body\nA ... privilege over their gender privilege in in what sense essentially trying to save lightness\nOver there and a woman right at the white folks in power ray I'm In you decrease access to people of color than we have\nA\nNew we're still winning even if it's at a loss of our own bodies\nWhat do you think\nThe outlook is for abortion access and reproductive justice access for women\nThe future for re pro accent is scary that we're going to go through a time where reproductive eyes\nThat it's going to be shrinking unlimited and particularly many of the states that have\nLegislative bodies that had been working on this for years\nThe reproductive laws in this country have never been where we wanted them to be health care that I've never been where we wanted them to be and so we do have an opportunity to completely dismantle rebuild what we want what we need right and what we wanted to what we need I think looks\nVery radically different than what we have already but what does it look like for people to have health access and health insurance um like a total and everybody having him and not have a ... a kind of cut out service for reproach to like abortion rights is over here in the rest of your health access is over here\nSo I'm looking forward to that\nI Do think that the fight though a is with women of color are leading the way um I think the fight\nIs that if we learned the lessons that needs to be learned and center are loose men didn't tear the things that we're going to do around the folks who are most vulnerable than there is could\nBe a very bright future for what it looks like to be limited in what it looks like that because that's what it looks like to be human in the country [noise] but that's only if we learned a lesson\n\nThat said for this edition of

and I'm Monica Lopez\nYou're listening to W. you idiot point one FM Middletown, Connecticut\nI think that they were just reinforces the message this is the way that women had been treated for millennia it's the way that were treated in this country it's the way we're treated around the world and the it's men protecting men it's men protecting\nThemselves in protecting their power it's the culture of um sexual assault of violence that's the culture that we live in\nThe culture of women hating and um\nBut I don't think it's going to work this time I really don't I think too many women have spoken out to men and women are on the line I mean I was up on the hill all last week a and even the day um women were flying\nIn one of our interns flew in with a group from her school University of Iowa to testify that people were holding a filibuster on the um on the Capitol Grounds so went on for over twenty four hours we're not going to stop or going to take back\nOur legislatures across this country and we're going to win in twenty Eighteen and the anger is not going to go away and no matter how gleeful they are\nThey are the mom they act like the ... they actually had actually act like the mafia their tyrants and we're not going to put up with it any longer we're going to put women in power\nInto the seat even though they've gerrymandered them\nAnd we're going to keep on keeping\nUntil we take this country back what we're seeing going on now is really more than just about women and sexual assault and sexual harassment this is a backlash against our first\nBlack president said this is not just about women this is about racism and we have to be honest about that they may not be saying that right now but that's that's a big piece of this is the racism the white\nSupremacy that's also going on the hatred in this country these people that are in power right\nIf the Democrats take control of the house of representatives a lot of analysts say that's a long shot because an impeachment process can be started but they need two thirds of the senators to actually booed him out of the Supreme Court so short of that you think just the process itself is worth investing politically and\nI Do I think that it is really a good ... you know people\nThat are liberal that wake up in the morning and they want and caring for all believe in that process was rotten from the start and I think that we have to talk and patron I think that we have to use it every single avenue and not say okay well there's no way that we can get two thirds of the senators so therefore we shouldn't try\nNow we have to keep pushing forward we can't just died that ending has already been decided before it's even been determined we have to keep our voices strong and loud we have to let them know we're not going to go way\nThey're not going to get away with it we are\nTaking steps to stop them\nWith a five to four conservative majority now established on the U.S Supreme Court what are some of your biggest concerns\nAbout Supreme Court rulings going forward in of course there's a lot of concern out there about reproductive rights labor rights environmental regulation and climb a regulation ... deregulation of Wall Street a social safety net programs\nOf overturning criminal justice reforms dimmer rights voting rights and we'll GBDs cue writes the list goes on and on\nYeah it does they want to rewrite America they wanna drag us back to the bad old days and uh\nWho knows what's gonna happen with that they're also selling out not just the Supreme Court but the other the other federal benches and the other courts where they are allowed to a point\nMajority and bought the house and Senate and now it's going to be working more women into opposite end did just that that put him at that point they can do right now we can get people to register that can help people get their own and we can all get out of office\nThat was Tony Van Pelt president

conservative Supreme Court majority by visiting our between the lines website at beach yell online dot org\nThousands of unaccompanied immigrant children are being held in detention by the U.S government with many being transferred to a refugee tent camp in the middle of the taxes desert\nMany of these children are eligible for relief but I've almost no chance of success without a lawyer kids in need of defense or kind is a national organization whose mission is to provide pro bono attorneys to immigrant children in deportation proceedings\nKind trains these lawyers who often come from the corporate world and then matches attorneys to children\nFewer than half the children in detention of attorneys when they appear in court as of mid September some twelve thousand eight hundred immigrant children were being held in custody of the health and Human Services department\nThe backlogs that has developed in moving these children through the legal process is in part the result of potential sponsors being afraid to come forward for fear of being deported themselves\nAnd the government's decision to prioritize the cases of children the Trump Administration separated from their families at the border earlier this year\nBetween the lines Melinda to who's spoke with Jennifer ... co policy director with kind he or she explains\nEvery person who the government decides that they want to try to remove from the country is put into removal proceedings or deportation proceedings the burden is on the immigrant themselves to prove why they have a right to stay here\nSo they have to make their own case so they have to have a understanding of us immigration laws to understand why they would have some sort of right to be here is it because they actually did have some sort of these or is it because they're asking for humanitarian protection and they want to make an application for humanitarian protection\nAnd so it's really absurd to think that somebody first\nOf all who doesn't speak English let alone have an understanding of US law let alone have an understanding of us immigration law would be able to make a case for themselves in court without a lawyer and it's even more absurd when you think about a young child\nSo when they are represented by attorneys how did these kids' fare\nOf the kids that were representing almost all of them are applying for some sort of humanitarian protection meaning you know they either suffered harm in their home country or they would set for harm if they had to go back and so that could be an application for asylum\nThat could be an application for special immigrant juvenile status which is a special visa given to children who are abused or abandon are neglected\nAnd a judge has determined it's not their best interest to go back to their country there is something called the trafficking be sesame for someone who for a child has been the victim of human trafficking they might be eligible for a special visa\nAnd so these forms of relief or granted to children and if they win their case there is an eligible to apply for what's called referred to as a green card so that they could stay and live and work in the United states\nYou know and I will tell you that when kind is able to screen cases you know make the determination about who we think might qualify and who we think\nWe have an incredibly high success rate how high is it so if we're able to\nScreen the case and represent the child to the end of their case it's generally been over Ninety percent of of the cases were able to be successful with\nA ... I'm curious you said these cases are hard to prove and I imagine these kids come with little or no documentation so how do you have such a high success rate\nI mean it's amazing you know these these attorneys who take the cases particularly a promoter attorneys I mean the amount of resources that they put into these cases is really amazing\nUm and so it depends what kind of application the child is applying for\nIf they're applying for asylum you know there's a lot of research that goes into what's happening in the home country and trying to cooperate with the child said about what happened experts can provide testimony so dependence on what kind of application that child is making\nWhat can you tell us about the expanded detention center for unaccompanied immigrant children in the desert a tornado in South Texas\nThe government is running ... as an emergency overflow a shelter for kids and it's the office of refugee resettlement that's in charge of providing care in custody to unaccompanied children until they can find a sponsor in the U.S is willing to care for them while they go through their court process\nWhat's happening in ... as the government has implemented some policies that is making it harder for children to reunify with a sponsor so kids are really backing up\nIn the system and the detention system so are are as had to resort to opening you know what they're referring to his emergency facility torn you know and it has over three thousand beds and there's over three thousand children can be how they're and they're holding children between the ages of Thirteen and Seventeen both boys and girls there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Middletown", "day": "16"}
