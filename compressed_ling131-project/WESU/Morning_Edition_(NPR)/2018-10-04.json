a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nUnder the soccer stadium right in downtown rock and this is the stadium that ISIS used to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nHow is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\nSteve Rogers seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for the streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open is kind of bustling in a way but what's curious is the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings is sort of a skeleton of the building and a lot of rubble just above the shops\nAnd they said there were more than five hundred homes that have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need for health officials say\nThey need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water sure\nAre people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes you'll drive the street so look\nCompletely desolate from the damage from the air strikes and ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see your family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states to control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves they're sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little aces here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syria\nRight and it was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa such as bomb removal and also education programs and that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars to the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with their basic needs for living resentment will grow people become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS\nSo um there's a concern that ISIS could continue to come back if this rebuilding effort doesn't continue NPR's Tom Bowman is in Rocco Syria thanks very much for

they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers [noise] so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened [noise]\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was a um they were\nVery very big you know there were very tight group loss of solidarity\nVery to time and women some of them um were engaged in political campaigning um they certainly didn't take any known since from us there was a a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in

Anthony Kuhn reports from Beijing she's message and it's media [noise]\nThe China Daily is the country's biggest English language newspaper by circulation I met with some of their young journalists recently at a cafe outside their headquarters they has to be identified only by their English first names as they weren't authorized to speak to foreign media\nOne of the mcgary he said that no matter

seen in China for decades\nParty control what media and of course that will control the message and basically she thinking well the message\nThat's University of Hong Kong media expert David Vander ski he argues that the media is obsessive focus on Xi Jinping is displacing or racing other important news contributing to an information vacuum about China just when the world can least afford it\nBut new channel you know media scholar at communication University of China in Beijing argues that China needs to focus on a main character to tell a story effectively and she is that character\nOn the hot down when the time on them any machine we call her leader the promoter and chief of the nation's public image himself takes this very seriously\nChina began taking its image building very seriously before the June ... became president traces back to the two thousand and eight Beijing Olympics he says that many Chinese felt that foreign media criticism of their pollution and human rights record spoil their moment in the world spotlight\n... down at the we sell our ability to travel I met her views was inadequate we're unable to speak up\nSince then China has poured billions of dollars into its state run media hiring journalists and public relations firms\nFor example the official new Chinese news agency or shame why has expanded his overseas bureaus from a hundred to a hundred and eighty and less than a decade state broadcaster China radio international meanwhile has expanded to allow it to put out twenty seven hundred hours of programming a day in sixty one languages\nThe message to his audience to this is David ... is that China's rise is a boon to all nations China portrays itself as a provider of public services and solutions to global problems\nIs all about China to this\nWell for all caught up with this in court new foreign policy up the belt and road\nMore than Seventy countries it's signed on to participate in Xi Jinping's signature policy aimed at building infrastructure reports in roads linking the world to China of course China is hardly alone and it's focused on its leader and his policies\nMaria ... a media expert at Georgia State university says Xi Jinping has a lot in common with other leaders from Russia's Vladimir Putin to Turkey's Reggie uptight ear to want to even US President Donald Trump all of them she says use social media to portray themselves as political strongman\nAnd to put out nationalist populist messages\nThat kind of the high like in the leader I felt like he's he's personality humor and the communication to their house up in addition to their communication system at large\nRep Nicole ... argues that China's story and a big sample of high speed economic growth has found more receptive audience is in many developing countries\nThink about the broader picture that many other countries would still probably continue to see China as strong global actor and protests neurons investor and all of those things\nBut independent analyst ... says that China is having a hard time coming up with ideas that appeal to western audience says that's partly because ... says the Communist Party is publicly rejected universal values which hit argues don't fit China\nPublic Google's itself ways and means ... they're going to train those leader publicly opposes everything from civil society to freedom and democracy that gives him a very little room to express themselves\nIf China has an alternative to what the west considers universal values it hasn't been clear about what those are despite this China appears to have put influencing foreign perceptions high on its agenda one of the young China Daily journalist named Bridget suggested this shift as a parent in her newspapers slogan\nNow it's report on China and influenced the world\nThis model doesn't make it explicit but it's clear from China's media policies that their intent is not just to shake the world in a way that suits

I'm Rachel Martin and I'm David Greene and we're going to visit rocketing now it was once the capital of ISIS territory in Syria but it was captured nearly a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nUnder the soccer stadium right in downtown rocker and this was a stadium that ISIS used to jail people for executions those world beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt\nTo be used for an actual soccer stadium now how is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\nMost diva Roger seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for you know the streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back there what's really interesting is a lot more shops are open is kinda bustling in a way but what's curious is the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings is sort of a skeleton the building and a lot of rubble just uh\nIt's er going back to school but there's still an enormous need for health officials say they need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water or electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes\nYou'll drive the street so look completely desolate from the damage from the IRS strikes ISIS blowing buildings out and you'll see your family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states to control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves are sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little aces here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syria\nRight and there was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Rocca searches bomb removal and also education programs\nAnd that really worried a lot of people it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates\nThe relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom why would that Steve if you don't provide people with the basic\nNeeds for living resentment will grow people become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass around so um there's a concern that ISIS could continue to come back\nIf this rebuilding effort doesn't continue\nNPR's Tom Bowman is in Rocco Syria thanks very much down your weapons do

found a good index your recent work linked in tweets at a place called\n... dissipated this isn't that name because we inhabit a dissipated system\nAre very much so I actually change the name to ... a log any P. H. O. L. O. G. U. E. if anyone was interested\nAnd yes it is based on the idea that everything that we identified the universe and in some way or another is a dissipate of system and what I mean by that is that it consumes energy from its environment high potential energy and hasn't turtles circulation within it\nAnd then a convert that energy into unavailable low potential energy that energy may be available to something else that is really the means by which any system\nExists and evolved and grows and ultimately shrinks\nSeptember tenth your tweet quote Arctic Air pollution already high but it's not super clear whether it will increase or decrease and you reference new science published September third or the team in the age you you'd journal hurts future\nTell us why the picture there is still unclear\nThe Arctic ... quite an interesting place I've I've been working a lot even since I was I guess a graduate student on how pollution from mid latitudes might be affecting\nClouds and the art type clouds in particular and it it's the there is something where we might think that the Arctic has really should be a pristine place because so few people live out there but the fact is is that\nAir from mid latitudes where most people live tends to be polluted there's also forest fires and this pollution this aerosol pollution blows north words and has the capacity to affect the Arctic in many ways one has to be deposited on snow\nIt turns out that the Arctic is unusually sensitive to this pollution the clouds um it we found the differences as much as a factor of a seven times more sensitive to the pollution than clouds at a lower latitudes\nAnd there's two things that could go on here um as the climate warms we are very concerned about how the Arctic will change since the Arctic seems to be changing about twice as rapidly measured by temperature is the rest of the world are taken as a whole\nAnd there's two things that might happen here one is that the aerosol pollution could increase do to increase industrialized nation on the Arctic shipping lanes open up so for example in the Arctic warming some becomes habitable\nAnd that might change clouds in a way that both warms and cools the Arctic depending on the season\nBut also has the Arctic warms up it just going to become wetter and if it becomes wetter there will probably be more rain and if there is more rain that could act to clean up the architect by scavenging the pollution from the air\nAnd they we we know just from experience that often is the earth polluted along comes a rainstorm and things clean up the same thing could happen in the Arctic could go from quite a polluted place at times to something for a cleaner but there are big questions in that way and it's it's it's an interesting problem\nYeah you coauthored another paper was to ... when a a bell this Arctic pollution that was in November twenty Seventeen and geophysical research letters\nAnd to me that papers a big deal first we know the Arctic ecosystems at ground level are sensitive there even fragile why do you see in the Arctic the clouds are also fragile there right at the edge of their existence\nMiss fear in the Arctic tends to be quite quiet they do get storms but for the most part the atmosphere is what we would call stable which means you don't tend to see big puffy cumulus cloud warming of the Arctic it tends to be this\nVery shallow strata clouds\nAnd they can be just maybe a few tens of meters thick and so they are just barely there you know it could be clear could be cloudy\nAnd it turns out if the air is polluted due to pollution emissions safe from Europe that can change that cloud properties by quite a lot I mean the main way it changes them\nIs to make the droplets in the clouds smaller uh one surprising thing might be for most people that even though the Arctic as well below the freezing point\nClouds and tend to be made of liquid nonetheless down to quite low temperatures minus twenty degrees Celsius\nAnd they do change to allies we just had a paper accepted into physical research letters which showed that the pollution seems to make it much more likely that the clouds will switch from liquid to ice and the art tech\nSo what happens is the pollution comes along something about the pollution is enabling those liquid droplets to switch to ice crystals and when they turn to ice crystals they tend to precipitate a form of delicate snow\nAnd that can change their lifetimes the clouds now how that will affect the climate is uncertain because the art to climate system like any climate system is complicated them any feedback back and forth\nBut this is an important ingredient of the problem we think the pollution from the mid latitudes is disturbing the Arctic environment and\nExcellent question I don't know if this you can imagine ways that they would be\nSo one area that I've been working hard on is trying to um show how the clouds tend to cool the climate and the Arctic in the summer\nWhen they're perturbed by ourselves and then this aerosol perturbation tends to warm the Arctic surface in the winter\nNow how that translates to changes at mid latitudes is not so well known although there are people scientists like Jennifer Francis who are arguing\nThat the rapid Arctic warming is having profound effects on the temperatures of a winter in places like the United states and this is highly contentious\nI'm not an expert on it myself but there are many people who are arguing that the Arctic is not isolated from\nWhere most of us live but rather that can have its changes can have substantial um effects on the climate had been attitudes\nYou know we just went through a second or third summer of almost being burned down here in living in wildfire smoke\nAndy September twenty teens study that you referenced by Jay small found quote in the summer boreal forest fires cause high levels of atmosphere pollution but if I read your word correctly you seem to say that wildfire smoke did not contribute to the formation of Arctic clouds\nThat was one of the surprising results yes there is a lot of forest fires smoke in the Arctic I've seen it in my own eyes I was a aboard an airplane and once\nFlying through clouds and then the atmosphere and sometimes it would look like we were in the smog of Los Angeles\nAnd I didn't know at that time the because this was back in the nineties were that that that that smoke layer came from but now I think there's a realization that at levels like let's say five kilometers above the surface\nThese small glares are due to forest fires and they just get up there and then they hang around for a long time [noise] so he's quite common\nHowever what happens is that the aerosols from the forest fires are tend not to be at the same levels that the clouds are at\n[noise] ... it's interesting you say to get ... heads out at the clouds because I think actually there is there an incredible parallels between civilization\nAnd clouds these are complex systems that can see them a lot of energy that grow explosively into there and by consuming energy from their environment tend matter from their environment and ultimately reach a point where they consumed all that is available\nAnd die and I think\nFor clouds we can see this all the time for civilization we are still in this explosive growth face so the point I Am trying to make is that this explosive growth face that we are and currently it with our global economy for civilized nation as a whole\nIs based upon consuming energy and matter from our environment that is what keeps all the circulation going if we did not consume energy from our environment all of civilization would grind to a halt\nWe would die of starvation and our concept of a global economy would die with us\nBut that's not what's happening now right now we are discovering new energy resources at quite a rapid rate one way or another whether it's we're new ... or false\nAnd that's in a blink civilization to grow extremely rapidly\nBut there is is consequences to this growth cannot be sustained forever it's simply impossible eventually the sources of energy will be depleted I mean just to take his knee example is a simple calculation [noise]\nWe will consume as much energy and raw materials from our environment and the next Thirty years\nAs we have since Seventeen fifty that's an incredible number I mean we are going to double civilization over again the next Thirty years over what we have to in the past two hundred and fifty and this is just a consequence of the of exponential growth\nAnd in Thirty years we will our energy demands and raw material demands will be twice what they are today a current rate of growth\nAnd then you think well that's just Thirty years was Thirty years beyond that and again that would be a quadrupling\n[noise] and so you know maybe we can do that um you know I don't I don't know there's there's lots of unpredictable things out there it seems in some sense impossible because\nOur environment is already starting to grown under the burden of our consumption or perhaps um there's there there's a means to continue this growth\nBut growth necessitates I'm an accelerating rate up production of waste products and there's a variety of waste products that we are increasingly swimming in\nOne of the ... of course carbon dioxide which leads to climate change and there's other things too like\nTop soil depletion and nitric vacation of our waterways a depletion of fish stocks on the ocean I'm the waste products of\nTaste something has to get it I think we are left in a very difficult position um\nIf civilization does not start to collapse very soon\nAnd the growth stalls and then not just falls but then\nCivilization into enters into a profound decline if civilization does not do that then it may be forced to that decline under either the burden of its consumption of resources or under the burden\nOf the waste products it is produced either due to climate change or I'm a deteriorating environment\nAnd this is probably going to happen quite rapidly because we're not talking about centuries here we are talking about decades\nInto squeak that you posted August fifteenth he linked to New York times article where even climate aware Germany still depends on coal for up to forty percent of its energy and you say\nHistorically new energy sources add to the mix rather than real pleased their older foundation that sounds pretty bleak for the future of green energy like solar and wind that's not what world dreaming about\nYeah I mean we would like to think that solar and wind might replace coal but if you think about it we like ... if if nothing else historically that has not been the case\nOur consumption of various energy sources that does go up and down over time\nBut in general we have been introducing new energy sources and these tend to be additives so you think at one point in the distant past we consume much less energy and then our primary source of energy he would have been would\nAnd then we had to call and then we added oil and then we add a natural gas and nuclear an hour adding renewables\nEach tradition that's like we had a new degree of freedom and the system\nAnd civilization is not made of energy is made up matter we use is energy from the new rules\nTo build more of civilization and then when you build more civilized nation by consuming raw materials using energy to consume brawl materials from the environment and converted into civilization\nCivilization grows a civilized nation grows its demand for energy of all types increases contracts for renewables but of all types\nAnd so there is no obvious link between adding new energy sources types of energy\nAnd our reduction and old energy sources it just simply it enables us to do more to myself I don't think about when and sold or as being particularly green\nThey are sources of energy our civilization is not made of energy it is made up matter we use energy to extract raw materials from our environment if we add new energy sources that old chest enable us to rape environment further\nThat's what we use the energy for it is to extract crawl materials in one way or another\nWell is part of your analysis I'm Still burning wood so that hasn't been replaced we were still using the old systems as you say\nNo in several places you suggest that we may revisit this system like depression like the Nineteen thirties I'm not sure the Nineteen thirty is a good analysis or that we can reach any historical precedent\nFrom where we are now I mean maybe the Nineteen thirties will seem good or mild compared to the climate ravaged future or maybe humanity will squeeze into a brand new place your thoughts\nAnd ... who is who said that history doesn't\nI Wonder I Am not a historian but I think we can look back at various times in history and say when a nation's or you know regions with civilization as a whole even has been more resource constrained\nAnd that competition for resources has increased\nThen the competition plays out and predictable ways I mean one of those ways of course is\nWars and the other ways as inflation I I Would not be surprised to see more of a fragmentation of civilization of the future as we have increased resource sketch city\nRight now we're at a point to where we are growing more rapidly than we ever have before but that rate of growth is has stagnated and that was something that happened to the Nineteen thirties\nIt wasn't that the rate of growth was comparable to today but it stagnated\nAnd I think what that means is in a capitalist society that is predicated upon growth there is competition for growth um among countries perhaps so that if one country grows faster than that and that's necessarily means that it will not other country must grow more slowly\nAnd of course that means winners and losers and nobody wants to be the loser\nW E s U Middletown what's that I hear a record there and what it means campus oh yeah why the court\nYou eat when one at an annual phone records there is happening Sunday October or millennium more widely that come home information about you can be found W. U. N. N. dot org\nOr on the W E S U ... or ... vinyl memorabilia and cold or can you there\nThis is ready to equal shook my guest is Tim Garrett from the University of Utah now I did discover that you have a blog called ... August ... day just log means something\nWhat's the collective memory that we have a similar event and we don't I don't think we have it\nMay be somewhere in our brains there was the arrival of the ice in the ice ages and we all had to move so or or change what we were eating but that's not the same time with it\nAnd I was rather a long time ago I mean I don't feel I have in my thinking some sort of built and planning for a future ice age and maybe the reason is that these [noise]\nUm climate changes in the past tend to to happen over sufficiently long periods of time\nThat still I mean relative to the lifespan of a human hand that still the dominant thing anybody would ever think of would it be planning for the winter not planning for temperature is being a couple of degrees colder a hundred years from now\nWell I've just been reading that our homes are totally designed for the cold and and we're trying to keep the gold old unused installation and so on and not for the heat so we've missed designed or houses for the future that is developing\nYep well I just a mortgage my house to buy some land up that eighty eight hundred feet in the mountains nearby so that's my future refrigerator\nWow [laughter] okay well no one last point on the economic front do you attribute what I call or what many call the great exhilaration after Nineteen fifty two increased energy availability\nBut then I asked myself well what if the economy crashed is due to war or human misunderstanding or just plain greed and there could be no direct relationship to energy availability\nFor him but look if everybody's doing well and there's a ton of energy out there and everybody can grow successfully\nIs they're relieved that much of the need to be killing one another I I I don't I don't see that I see that you know war is tend to crop out when there is for a competition for resources\nAnd you know we've been in a period of extraordinarily extraordinary wealth since Nineteen fifty because of this\nOf flourishing discoveries of things like oil and natural gas and eventually that will come to a halt\nSo it's not until then that myself personally I Would expect that things like wars and inflation would rare their head\nI mean if it will happen a these are scarcity issues will happen I mean it can happen in two ways\nOne is that we run out of the raw materials or another is that they just become much more difficult to access even if they are out there\nBecause things like climate change start to become such a burden that it destroys the infrastructure that we have and use to access those resources so I mean we are scarcity\nIs a question of the veil ability or we can deplete we'd make things less available by depleting it we can also make things less available by a fraying of the fabric of civilization that is used to access those resources and that can happen by way of\nEnvironmental destruction and that's at that point that I Would expect things like wars to become increasingly common but we've seen a trend since the fifties\nThe American navy and cut off from the energy supplies they needed for their new economy in Germany similarly you wanted to invade rushed in order to get at the Balkans oil because their economy needed more energy so I I guess it does hold up but\nIt who your point you just may be on science and philosophy it looks to me like billions of humans are headed into a great time of suffering I don't know if that's in this decade or the next but by state twenty fifty for a number of reasons would you share that\nYeah um I mean of course there's suffering at all times and I think it's some of I mean many people today are suffering incredibly I mean they just look at a place like Syria\nAnd I think the question is whether or things like Syria or Venezuela will become increasingly common and the future and yeah I mean I I I Do expect that to happen um I mean you and I we live in extraordinarily rich countries\nThat may be able to insulate themselves from our time but the United states and Canada are connected to the rest of the world we aren't isolated we are connected through international trade and\nEverybody wants to live somewhere up there as refugees looking for somewhere to live one thing that um you you see and systems growth is um when something's growing incredibly rapidly\nI Would use the word super exponential growth or explosive growth so it's not just that there is growing exponentially with a constant rate of return but the rate of return itself is increasingly time and that's the situation we've been in since Nineteen fifty\nWhen the conditions had supported that explosive growth are no longer there\nSo you know there's when we talk about the future and they're being um a fraying or decline or whatever it is\nI I think that they're being two modes of decline one is a gradual decline like civilization has subsided and but that does so gradually and\nArguably fairly ordered fashion\nAnd the other is um a super expert natural declined where the rate of decline excel facts on our rights and that would be a collapse so maybe an analog is just to think about an ocean way if you could think of an ocean wave moving up and down\nMaybe us like the cork on that wave moving up and down and move out gradually income down gradually or you could also have a situation where that wave explodes up words as it approaches the beach and then ultimately when it runs out of water\nIt collapse that it's a crash is on the beach\nI suspect I hate to think of this that way but I suspect that\nBased on civilizations recent past we are more like that wave approaching the beach and like a wave at will subside and perhaps rise again out in the middle of the ocean\nJim gear if we're all part of super organism falling inexorable laws of physics does it matter what any of us does or whether we fear the future or enjoy the president\nI mean yeah I mean I can tell you my own feeling and I guess that's what you're asking uh yeah [noise] I mean I myself\nThe world and I truly want to believe that you know there is the capacity for individuals to make a difference in the ultimate trajectory of civilization\nAnd I'll admit that myself I struggled to reconcile that with what I see with testable hypotheses based on fundamental physics\nWhich suggests that ultimately and in a statistical fashion one way or another civilization is on a trajectory and\nUs as individuals cannot change that trajectory because of the the tournament by things that are beyond us such as just simply the geology of the planet and whether or not the energy reserves that feeds civilization are out there\nI suspect the superorganism idea is really correct It's civilization as a super organism that will grow into the resources that sustain that just like a cells in the petri dish and till\nTill the cat and then it will grow to the maximum extent possible until no further growth as possible and then the collapse will start to happen\nIsn't that what stars do\nEverything gossips now this is that it's not yes yes that is what stars do but they're [noise] everything in the universe is a consequence of an initial available event availability of energy and matter of that is what created it and the first place and that energy and matter had to come from somewhere\nAnd when an energy and matter runs out that thing can no longer sustain its internal circulation and dies", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "04"}
