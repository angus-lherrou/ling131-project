test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I get allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I was\nPart of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive\nPlace to live well no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospitals put them in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high prices become the norm because insurers look at what usual and cuts to marry so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nNot about competition it's about what customers\nThat's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey that might get expensive and expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy tests\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert and the peace sets that thirty five dollars per ... is normal in the bay area well in other places that might be four dollars or six

high the mass just doesn't add up ... says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars and that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this vision is being left with to pay out of pocket so the mass still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she did that down to Fifteen hundred to put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I stop mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that ... you know\nOur hotel me not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive bill Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for a partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a buck forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of test at\nA sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I get allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it there is much more sophisticated version of that about forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place\nTo live well no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means they're few hospital system in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but in that basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy tests oh how could expensive could it be it\nIs to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert and the peace says that thirty five dollars per ... is normal in the bay area well in other places they might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for reference says\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks

It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm David Greene Brazil has elected a new president ... and our old and he is from the far right\nThere were celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro\nTake office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things that you're about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can redraw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil or almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and\nThey use for the restoration of national pride I think that it helps explain why both now defeated the workers' party candidate financial and Daschle so comprehensively I should say the most amount of himself insists the survival of dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is cutting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted and afterwards he read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects\nTo the judge had to remind him and the people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which this is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent and on corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in ...\nRainy on that plane to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he really\nCorruption to fight crime as as you said that he has a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do do already\nPeople hit David off sick of robberies and the sky high moody right yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence also concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is rolling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... powder a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil's new president NPR's Philip Reeves reporting on that election in Rio thanks You're welcome\nNow we are more of a social media site where the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect reportedly posted anti Semitic attacks\nBefore walking into the tree of life synagogue with for weapons Robert Bowers apparently got fired up with words he reportedly used gab which calls itself an alternative to Twitter and as popular among the far right Here's NPR's Jasmine Garsd\nGap in the state that proudly promotes free speech it looked at it let anyone say anything but it's been controversial critics have called it a home for anti Semite and white nationalist Robert powers with a user\nBefore allegedly going on a killing spree he posted about the Hebrew immigrant aid society a group that supports refugees he took the group quote likes to bring invaders that kill our people I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw your optics on going in and\nThreat in there because I don't what what would you expect us to do with both like that where you would you want us to just censor anybody that says the phrase ongoing him is that what you're proposing here why running I learn and here's the thing he answered the bad speech or hate speech however you want to define that\nIs more speech and always will be\nWhen does online free speech become a threat just isn't the first time the issue has come up in social media just last week it came to light the man accused of sending explosive devices to prominent Democrat in the media had a history of threatening tweets\nTour because gab follows strict rules including no threat he said he created gap because he's someone no room for conservative point of view on social media take Twitter\nWhen there are thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone to kill Ronald Trump thing they're going to kill Donald Trump\nAre expressing hate toward white people towards Christians towards minorities who made a now keep court Donald Trump or they allow hate to be viewed at certain groups and certain people\nStill where is the line between free speech and inciting violence\nI think the line is where free speech become a threat\nKelly McBride senior vice president at the Poynter Institute for media studies she says poor about is prioritizing free speech above all other constitutional values\nAnd that is not necessarily what our constitutional Kramer's intended right they didn't want the government curbing free speech\nNor did they want to be irresponsible with their speech she says last year Google band gaps up apple rejected and Microsoft terminated its agreement with that last month just in the left\nNot backing down we're not going anywhere tortoise that gap condemns the shooting but he thinks it's now being targeted unfairly over the weekend the social media site was filled with anger some of it directed at the Jewish community Jasmine Garsd NPR News\nSo that was over the weekend

up another ten thousand that can cause some\nRuler moving here and they say uh today's momentum put a woman to be to me I'm cooking really loud against this war and they gave this problem if they showed some day you and I said to know that\nBut also here in the United states because every time they warn that is outside the United states\nComing back and be put in ways you know economic ... um the police violence against\nPeople here in the United states\nThey violence against women to get a day or night and\nDon't have the ... all these a tendency\nTo the to the fact\nTo the award was this time just wrote them entirely hope this teacher is going to do\nSo and said he'd cortex all day how they put them all around the country and many on at home\nAnd you cannot hear and making clear that we don't want any more toward a here\nUm some of our democratic politicians in the United states especially black ones or best in the military or as a career as a solution for young black people what would you say the bill\nEvil because it's not put on my\nCareer but\nPut on my right and it's sort of black people\nStay for the fans they said that some people who\nSo I Would say that is very rights\nBecause they have to be a little lonely\nRelocation up what they do sort of black people really jump up with this person I think\nRespond to that today and they live with and\nSays look people in my daughter's not close to people and continue the spelling I Want to know and what do you live what they did it and I know a lot\nCould I make as you might be and that's why they are doing\nThis show me that's wrong at the Pentagon on October forty seconds to say thank you very much\nI'm Talking to a movie predator here\nAnd then we've been an educator for admitted here quite a long time actually um but\nMy question is you're asking about the army\nAnd how we're supporting um the army and and the other armed forces\nWhy the Democratic party is doing that\nParty has been supporting the the downfall of education than\nI'm you know we're talking about\nAll the different programs that I'm working under that is keeping us from actually doing our job in the teachers and we still don't get paid anything [noise]\nThe thing is that the Democratic party will help the army to people who do not have the education as a way to get out of the situations there at their basically kind of handing off their job to the army\nUm and and that is something that we really need to look into if we actually educated kid we actually putting money into kids' education especially in places let's say in rural Georgia are real\nWay that they could start thinking about things overseas they don't even know what's outside the states\nAnd of course they don't have any questions about foreign policy they don't need to that\nThe liberal candidate they don't need to because\nNobody knows to ask these questions because nobody traveled outside of their own counties especially in rural areas are my question is if we start giving money to education to teachers to\nGetting materials that teachers want instead of what we're given to less testing to um [noise]\nTo trying to get the kids who are desperate to figure out how to get to better places outside of their areas and inside of there to get to that and possibly we can start talking about foreign policy but for right now nobody supporting it because nobody can\nDrives me crazy there's a lot of people who haven't got now\nIn Chicago where I'm from the past ... past mayors um have given one high school to the U.S army and enclosed public high school across the street from there and they gave a heck of a number of high school for the U.S navy\nAnd for a while um they gave a middle school for the marine corps um they took that back\nBut the navy still owns half was in high school and I'm Still I'm a military academy now which is called the public school system allegedly where do you think of the military officers should\nWe have high school ROTC we had kids who are learning how to shoot guns and getting ready to go into the army the army or armed forces it counted for a way to get kids off the street it's a way to give them discipline it's a way to show them the world\nIs ridiculous schools or the ...\nThey can tell their kids to vote for Trump that they want to they can tell their kids to vote for\nWhoever they want to but army people only tell their kids how to make more\nIt's all they do that is their job so how can we possibly possibly think that we're doing a good job if that's what we're offering kids\nOption and I'm saying kids\nWho are in uh the the rest of them kids who are in Chicago kids who are in your county the Cherokee county Cobb County Cobb County [noise] I mean I Know what they don't have\nPolice are the folks who are kind of most obvious to us in there that people that are inspiring the most interesting protest movements right now that they're the people who are the objects of reformist uh temps\nSo that's why I'm focusing on police here is the kind of quintessential silence workers that we can learn a lot about if we think about it in a slightly different way\nThey generally clean driver write\nMonopoly on virus we won't work stupid about capital [noise] big room so legal limbo moves all black and brown people\nWell I think capitalists states need to generate surpluses and then they need to soak up those surpluses may need to generate surpluses of people to keep wages at a certain level and they need to generate surplus populations therefore\nThey've done that in different ways in different phases of capitalism but I think because the capitalist state is so focused on organizing the market and protecting people from the excesses of the market protecting the market from the excesses of the people that is people who would like to escape\nThat the market state has decided to organize violence is through race is through institutions such as colonialism or plantations\nOr transatlantic trade the all of these institutions require the intense violence of surplus populations or populations devoted to\nLabor whose lives are expendable and you know I think in our day the institution that most marks the capitalist market state is the prison is the system of mass criminalization which\nMaybe it's not right to say that it's the prison because it's so much more than the president it's also the hyper policing of neighborhoods\nWhere black and brown and poor people live let police and the state have decided are the places where they can best expands the kinds of energies that will give them the political and economic feedback that they need\nThe work of violence extends into the ideological around right it's not just about keeping some people idol for the suppression of wages it's also about the psychological impact of lightness of the feeling of fear and protection of the promise of protection when the fear of state violence is so\nClear an obvious unreal to any observer so I think the market is half the state\nOr the state is Hassan market or the state in the market are so intermixed just to be irrevocably intertwined and\nThey require a certain set of violence is together and they generate them and then they ask\nA group of people to put the violence is into practice and a lot of those people we call police\nStations also on the responsibility own education abroad in ...\nI mean all to Sarah understood that very well\nWhen in thinking about education systems as ideological apparatus is and for coal understands them as disciplinary institutions and you know I think we really need to think very critically about our educational systems particularly the ones that\nHave been so deeply altered by Neal liberalism in the last forty years I mean I think that a lot of my book is about the disappointments of hopes for state salvation under kneel liberalism that for example\nFolks who are working and hoping in the sixties during the civil rights movement\nThey really place a lot of faith in the state and they thought\nThe thing is like voting and laws can make a big difference and integrating public education and you know the university system the U. S. is really excellent public university system in the Nineteen\nFifties and sixties and then what we saw over the course of the seventies to now is just that the total disintegration of those hopes and in terms of the educational system of the hollowing out of that system through its new liberalization you see\nTuition rising state support falling\nThe ability to hope for fellowships and scholarships support eroding\nStudent debt rising curricula changing so that\nGetting kind of critical all over the arts and sciences education is now no longer possible except for the very elite few and universities educating international populations rather than the local population that say the land grant institutions such as\nThe one that I teach for were created to serve and that's the sort of extension of the Internet\nNo one can look at sixty then they moved her\nTo be legislated to arm of government grants is black the right to vote for you to roam anti poverty program then be your arm of governments don't believe in the ... created my black incarceration\nYeah I mean I think that's absolutely right and there have been a bunch of\nWorks recently tracking that in federal and other branches of state policy so I think of this may Weaver of her dissertation an article about front last not backlash but the ways that\nResponses to the civil rights movement they couldn't really make headway in the moral universe because the civil rights protesters had captured that universe so they began to kind of go around the back door and create\nThis legislation that would eventually build up mask criminalization and on I only Mercado was wonderful book the first civil rights is about how liberals were involved in that process and earlier than we think of it wasn't\nA process that began with conservatives in the Nineteen seventies but with both liberals and conservatives in the Nineteen sixties and even the Nineteen fifties so that's not a conspiracy theory it's really well documented historical process\nIt really is exactly what happened to forestall social and racial justice lawmakers created a new system of racial discipline to replace the one that was being dismantled by civil rights protesters\nThey dismantled Jim Crow segregation and they created mouse criminalization which has eaten up you know not only the bodies of African Americans but\nA range of racialized people black and brown and poor and now in the war on terror we have to understand that system is\nPlumes as well\nOn the part of that process you ride on the off of public safety for room and\nHow you're beginning in the sixties and seventies roads divided so recent the violence throughout the country and the\nFirst of all it didn't spread it in this country by working in this country worked abroad it was a group of police trainers who went abroad and trained other nation's police\nAllied nation and it definitely cook with it all in the U.S policing systems strategies and tactics and those strategies and tactics were already the product of\nLots of transnational exchange and the hybrid or the U.S military and civilian fears because the U.S police have constantly gone abroad and come home and been nourished an educated\nBy us engagements globally from war of Eighteen Ninety eight in the Philippines and the Caribbean to Eighteen forty eight conflict with Mexico and the anticipation of\nA large part of Mexico's northern territory and the Indian Wars over the whole course of the nineteenth century and Eighteenth a Nineteen centuries and so us police have cycled abroad and returned home and\nTake in the tactics that they learned in war situations and situations of colonialism\nAnd of genocide abroad and they have applied them here at home so the authors of public safety is only the latest chapter you know at the moment that it occurs it's no longer the latest chapter that have been other chapters now since then but in the moment of its lifetime which is\nFrom sixty two to Seventy four it is the latest iteration of us please\nTaking that experience into all of the other things that they did in their later careers the reason the office of public safety is such a good object of study is because it was terminated by Congress in a way that its employees\nThere's ... singer songwriters my fingers live local commercial\nTune into voice of the city Tuesdays from eight thirty to nine thirty PM\nRich people queen but bring me we need a better place by giving a portion of the world to charity\nBut often run back to the war was rich people who might be used to from we will be going to be rich old ... poor people and\nThe need for German Rudy ... lives in more luminous Spain and the all the new book beat the income ... conditions read them\nActually began with the religious depictions of charity which were first of all they've added a lot of times so charity the Ryman charity where the vote and is that\nMagnanimous feeding a little babies and killing of saying it was odd problems and all the rest of it and then we go through things\nLike turkey is not a gift and my main based\nOn the work of my mouth and then the role of charity and all the different religions as many as we could possibly cover and then they you're kind of budgeting academic cycle discipline\nOf altruism and then the charity of the celebrities and make a rich people but it does manufacturing may for charity because I think that when you have such an intense\nConcentration of wealth so that we've got half the world is hungry that's billions of people and the freedom of the rest of us is being more and more clipped\nBy the fact that these rich people are dominating everything from education through to the ... summit\nAnd this is where charities that saying before I think we could argue that religion played some of this role but now the high priest or basically the celebrity so we're supposed to admire and wants to be like\nYou have these rooms dean is we are

has the nerve to cold that senators are we supposed to think of him as some kind of ... on I mean really I think charity and really really on the pain is a system in ways that hasn't been discussed and even worse than that\nIt's very fertile ground for extreme corruption which we discuss in ... to the book and Trump is a good example with his term foundation rare with all kinds of tax low loopholes\nThey can stashed away for trends that we don't know about and I think another thing which is even worse is that it's such an unequal relationship that the person who's receiving cannot reciprocate and in the end I think that this idea that there are human beings who\nHave to depend on the opposite the whims of\nRich people it also\nHelps with the notion that there are populations which candidate Kissinger would've called basket cases or redundant ...\nBeing licking sink in the Mediterranean\nThose people that were done that nobody wants them\nAnd I think that charity this idea that there were some people who was so hopeless icon do anything for themselves and I have to be dependent on the likes of the gate old people who engage in smaller kinds of charity helps to reinforce his idea of basket\nCase populations hope populations but of course you know then again you know this acts\nOf kindness and we do go to some trouble to try and distinguish switching charity and kindness and of course there are a lot of people who will create charities like Paul Newman for example do common ... or ... and the British poet\nWho are really sincere and trying to do something against is terrible system\nWho countries have been to Haiti\nTest that say let's call it the corruption round of the Clintons politics and on and we divided some pop because part of charity on the institutional ... we're talking about charity on the institutional scale not\nParticularly attacking oil individuals' although there are some of the Clintons who\nDeserve to be attacked we talk about finance for pay and humanitarian aid some as institutional forms of charity but\nOf course they end up paying them in a tree industrial system as well and so if you read about what the Clinton Foundation actually did in high tea and even the American Red Cross you know is another really scandalous case where they receive so much money after the earthquake\nAnd beat up saluting nothing for example one very\nSimple things could have been to sort out the proper live\nThe water supply but that didn't do that so now we've got thousands of people dying of cholera\nHere we are the Clinton

can't help thinking when you look back at the\n... the history of hay to eat that it's almost a historical punishment you know because it was the first slave republic in the history of the world it's
