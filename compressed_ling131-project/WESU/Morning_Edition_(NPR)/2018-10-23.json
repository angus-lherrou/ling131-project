criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\nWell we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table in twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen and we will be serving four year terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team will be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact that we want to have one twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing\nAnd the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nMillion dollars and we are distributing um the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting lens so governors always matter a state legislators matter but in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor the state's secretary of state um they matter in certain places um Supreme Court justices will matter so in North Carolina we're supporting and eat earls\nOr who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so hard for Rebecca ... who won he Wisconsin's Supreme Court seat\nArgue campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nOh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says uh they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally and I think ensure a a a fair process\nOne of the attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech major mature ripped off a famous remark by Michelle Obama\nWhen they lost [noise] they go low\nWe can what did you mean or what I meant ... in that remark was that uh I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that and all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful is that something to be expressed through votes drew protests through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants something else what's appropriate well I certainly think ... votes\nGoing to their their homes um you know I I'd be going at them I'm at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the day after the Trump ... who's very powerful when young people marched here I'm In Washington to ask for

but in the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage they were elections for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others they will have great influence\nHis former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty twenty what is the problem that your tried to address\nOh we're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering or we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election and the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and then so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are actually going to represent the the people let's\nBe blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that it's slanted more to Democrats than to Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their bench\nNo I don't think I Would criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\nWell we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table in twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen and we will be serving\nTrump's and who are elected in twenty eight team will be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so\nThe impact that we want to have one twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing and the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a hundred over thirty million dollars and we are distributing um the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting lens so governors always matter a state legislators matter\nBut in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor or the state secretary of state um they matter in certain places hum Supreme Court justices will matter when North Carolina we're supporting an IED or else who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so hard for Rebecca ... who won he Wisconsin's Supreme courts he\nArgued campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says uh they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally a ... and I think ensure a a a fair process\nOne of the attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech major mature ripped off a famous remark by Michelle Obama\nWhen they go low [noise] they go low we\nWhat did you mean or what I meant\nWe'll try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that and all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protests through yelling at lawmakers have restaurants to something else what's appropriate\nWell I certainly think votes through protests um I I must say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them lawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes\nUm you know I I'd be going act them I'm at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the day after the Trump ... who's very powerful when young people marched here I'm In Washington to ask for more is saying gun safety measures\nThose are the kinds of ways I think in which the people should or should express themselves\nAttorney general holder thanks so much ... thank you\n\nAll right Steve the mega millions lottery it's up to one point six billion dollar billion billion with a B they set for tonight and

control so people can actually have\nLife plan for the future and then some\nThis summer do do it in the kitchen from school I'm planning to go visit my mother I hit when she heard twenty two years and now I have to cancel this because I don't know where it has to leave because I don't have money to pay for my apartment\nAnd I'm thinking you touch disrespect too that people uh who doesn't have a high income for low income people and it's kind of cruel it's even I Can't say it's not even you know just stuff like that to the people who can really afford\nThat as a non human rights here\nBefore

a couple of blocks away at a different encampment a man named Jacobs sits on a curb surrounded by open suitcases filled with clothing he's recovering from an encampment sweet Jake up was reluctant to be interviewed you had a bad headache but he said that when the police came he had to bargain with them they told him he had to give a passage suitcases or to bike\nHe chose to keep both bike so they took three of the suitcase throwing them into a garbage truck directly in front of him\nA social worker came afterwards he said and when he told them what had happened social workers that they're not supposed to do that the worker gave Jake up a business card told them to call report the incident studying night\nWhen I asked about what happened to Jacob or junior formulate the mayor's office said sometimes city officials might need to dispose of people's things but they shouldn't be throwing them away for no reason\nDo have to clean the street because that that's a reality living on the streets and we want to protect the health and safety of those that are living on a street almost two years ago\nAnd they're made up of homeless outreach workers sanitation workers and police officers the idea was that police officers would receive special training on the laws governing homeless man like ordinance fifty six eleven and how to deal with the homeless population on the program first started it was pitch to cops acting like social workers\nAre LAPD officers are out there twenty four hours a day so they've already been engaging with people that ... that and trying to connect into service that\nAre doing it as a hope teams those special teams of police social workers and sanitation workers they've helped the city to reach more people looking to expand that program\nAnd our ... going to encampments that many outreach workers don't feel safe going into it\nBut some advocates dispute the notion that social workers need a police escort I think that's just ridiculous this it's a ... a public defender in Los Angeles based activists\nI worked in criminal defense for six years I've gone into all manner of encampments a sorrows [noise] you know drug houses whatever in a suit and tie and I've never felt threatened even ones\nIn general do gone from LA can says police presence might actually hinder outreach workers ability to connect with the homeless population\nWas skin hell out of people because they're nobody want to talk to you would you walk in the ...\nThe goal should be to remove police from homeless outreach entirely build on says not asked police to act like social workers you\nDon't need to polling do always poll we already said is not social work\nWhere people ... don't even expelled goof to do that that many ... with mental disabilities we know the hill in front of you know identify the people that are most in need of you're not even going to be able to approach it within ...\nPlus ... the public defender says he's seen first hand how police involvement in homeless outrage in ...\nThe last person wouldn't even be ticketed things like being in the park after hours being you know having an open container and people get arrested for these things\nOr they get bail but because they have a history they probably of failures to appear a due to lack of funds like transportation et cetera uh and as a result wind up spending a disproportionate amount of time in jail on these minor offenses\nCan tone of experience is borne out by the facts are recent analysis from UCLA research project called million dollar hood found that an overall arrest in Los Angeles have gone down I rest of the homeless population has increased\nHere's UCLA researcher Daniel ... you know it's like really startling that I think that about Nineteen point six percent\nOf the arrest and the first half of twenty Seventeen were out of house with people um that's about one in every five Iraq where as you know how the people according to the last homeless count make up less than a up one percent of the city's total population\nSo that inequity is just huge and do we said looking at the criminal charges homeless people face paint a vivid picture of how homelessness and poverty are being criminalize the top five charges that we found were failure to appear possession of a controlled substance\nA supervision or parole probation violation petty theft and trust passing and these charges accounted for over fifty percent\nOf the house with Iraq and the first half of twenty Seventeen so the majority of a raft of houses persons are for\nThese types of non violent crimes and really are reflective more of the condition of poverty even the LAPD own statistics bound than in the first two quarters of twenty Seventeen\nA hundred and forty seven people about a third of the LAPD the wrath of homeless people city wide during that time LAPD homeless coordinator commander Dominic choice that Iraq numbers may have actually been even higher than that he was working on re analyzing the data to release arrest numbers the heat that would be more inclusive and choice either\nCourse police are arresting people when they go to in camp but that's their job to enforce\nWell the comment that there's more than ... and of course because of their new officers on the scene there'd be no enforcement right\nBut that didn't mean he would stop sending out teams to homeless encampments Detroit side\nBut I'm a I'm not going to I was when I was just stop because it's human nature if somebody's asking for help and they can prevent it you know they they will\n[noise] numbers from the LA homeless services authority or lost a show that the hope teams may actually be connecting more people with services than the LAPD numbers reflect over roughly the same period as the LAPD report losses that it hoped to place about a hundred and sixty people in some form of housing\nBut activists argue that could happen if law so workers went on alone without police and a recent study by the national Law Center on homelessness and poverty found that relying on police as a response to homeless encampments both expensive and in effect here the executive director Maria ...\nAnd it will not solve the problem\nThe sweeps mean that people can lose hard to replace documents an identification that they need to get into housing Oscar any size cops being there makes it more likely that people will get arrested and having an arrest record can also make it harder to get into housing plus ... he says it's expensive does on cops out on a regular basis\nAnd she says the evidence suggests that it doesn't help\nOn it will not to eliminate the encampment and it will make life for her to people who are living in it but last associates\nInteractions with people experiencing homelessness regardless of whether there's a whole project or there isn't again that's the first call that concerned community members business owners homeowners are going to make is to LAPD because often it's\nHard to know where else to turn like I said at the beginning I I don't think that we can rest of our way out of homelessness I don't think we can enforce our way out of homelessness\nSo yeah I Would obviously like to see a lower number of arrest the lower number of citations\nBut again I I Do believe that it is lower than it would be otherwise [noise]\nBack at the Korea town and cat network ... she says that the street she lived on it's always filled with trash\nArbitrage if you look at the foreigners out at the the very\nNeedles

the Saudi Government denied that it knew anything they've said he came in and he came out of course there was no camera footage of him having left and his fiance had been waiting and waiting and waiting\nAt looks like now they're going to announce that indeed they didn't kill him but it was an accident it was done right by rogue elements in the government even they were supposed to kidnap him and bring him back to Saudi Arabia and uh things went badly and instead he was killed\n... summer as tourists a bit about Donald Trump and his administration's response to the allegations against Saudi Arabia for the charges he murdered the dissident journalist Jamal ...\nThere has been quite an outcry in the United states even from very conservative Republican Congress people like Lindsey Graham\nOr who said there would be hell to pay or like Marco Rubio who said we'd have to recalibrate our relations with Saudi Arabia but from Donald Trump first it has been silenced then it was downplaying it\nUh then it was saying that well it no matter what happened we're not going to want to cut off weapon sales because that's jobs and a lot of money and the\nUh those orders would just go to the Chinese or the Russians and then he throughout this idea of maybe it was a rogue element which really set the stage for what the Saudis are going to make up now as their excuse\nSo all along he's been trying to either make this story go away or cover it up\nMy ... in your view what is the proper response of the United states here to ah would almost certainly was the death of this journalist draw ...\nSaudi Arabia but immediately stop a aiding and abetting the Saudis and the horrendous war in Yemen they should impose sanctions on anybody who is involved in this a heinous act of healing the a journalist and they should stop 'em\nIntelligence cooperation with the Saudis and uh I think then there's also an issue about businesses and businesses\nReally should severed ties particularly those businesses that are hired to be foreign agents in the Saudi Government and they're over two dozen of them I and then there's also the responsibility of the think tanks the universities in the United states it receives Saudi money\nAnd the high tech companies that have been courting large investments from the Saudis are all these kind of connections really need to um be rethought and then on the larger issue or what really would be the uh\nPositive silver lining that could\nPossibly come from all of this is a rethinking of U.S policy that has been one\nThat is focused on the interests of Saudi Arabian Israel instead of the United states and its drag the United states in two wars it shouldn't be in\nA put the United states on a collision course would be run that uh is hurting many Iranians because of the draconian sanctions for could also lead us to another war there\nSo I think with the American public now having somewhat of an understanding of how repressive Saudi Arabia is um perhaps it is a moment when we could create some distance between us policy in the interests of the Saudi Government\nThat was my dear Benjamin cofounder of ... I think women for peace\nHuman rights violations and war crimes by visiting our between the lines website at B. T. L. online dot org\nAnd it's sobering report released by the un Intergovernmental Panel on climate change or eyepiece DC on October aids\nThe world's leading climate scientists issued a dire warning that the nations of the world have only at ten to twelve year window to take action to eliminate an increase in global temperatures below one point five degrees centigrade\nThe report concludes that an increase beyond one point five degrees will substantially increase the likelihood of disastrous drought wildfires crop failures flooding extreme weather events and coral reef destruction\nThe report lays out the case for urging international action to limit of rising global warming to reduce carbon in greenhouse gas emissions the recommended measures including increasing the cost of burning fossil fuels re for a station\nChanges and land use moving to electric powered transport systems and the adoption of carbon capture technology\nYour reporter spoke with Michelle Chan friends of the earth vice president of programs\nWho discusses the warnings and recommendations founded the un climate change report as well as the political obstacles in the U.S where President Trump and the Republican Party that controls all branches of government refuses to acknowledge or take action to address climate change\nTwenty Fifteen at the Paris climate talks country that great to a couple of calls and the first one was held in at the increase in global average temperature to ... degrees below pre industrial levels and then the second goal is to try to stay under one point five degrees centigrade and said that's report\nWhich was prepared by hundreds of scientists under the auspices\nTax on earth and two people would be different between these two different scenarios to degree temperature warming versus one point five degrees of warming\nAnd so that was what the report set out to do and one of the things that the report says that you know even if the world doesn't emit one additional kind of greenhouse gases even if we were just stop today that were already on a path\nTo increase in global average temperature is by one degree and this level we have to remind ourselves\nAt this level people are already suffering and dying because of climate impacts and then the report goes on to describe what would happen the difference between one point five degrees of warming and two degrees of warming and I can get into a couple of examples if you'd like\nCould you cover for some of the most dire warnings here that were the consensus of scientists across the world\nRight well they go through um a number of different\nProject that impacts between the one point five versus\nTwo degrees scenarios and for example if we only warmed by one point five degrees Celsius then it means that sea level rises won't be as high and that would mean we could avoid displacing like a million people says went up to two degrees that would be\nTen million people already you know would be essentially forced to move\nAt one point five degrees the science says that will lose maybe Seventy percent of our coral reefs instead of Ninety nine percent of them so I mean one point five even though that's the goal of the world is shooting for\nStill is um I'd hopping we devastating for the state of our coral reefs in our oceans but at one point five degrees of warming instead of that too we can help prevent what scientists call feedback loops these feedback loops create run away climate change so one example here\nArctic snow we lose then the more the earth absorbs the heat and then the more melting is caused and then there is less snow and less\nSunlight reflected back in so that just creates a vicious cycle or a feedback loop and so\nThat report goes and interest chronicles all of these different scenarios I'm likely scenario is likely impacts between one point five and two degrees and it's very very sobering to to say the least\nI'm it says that technologically if we go over one point five degrees then we will need to increasingly rely on technologies that sucks carbon out of the air and a lot of these technologies are just completely unproven and they could be hugely risky\nWilma show when you look at the advisory here to the world in terms of the dramatic action that will be necessary to do the under that one point five degrees centigrade rise in temperature across the world\nHow realistic is it that that could actually happen in terms of political will a technology alternative fuel systems in the like\n[noise] yeah um it's a great question Scott because I'm ultimately\nAt friends of the earth believes that we need political and not just technological solutions to tackle climate change this report\nBut I'd PCC put out was pretty technological I didn't seek to really answer the big hairy questions about whether or not for example we can get corporations and big oil companies out of our government\nUm as they are blocking us from making these radical transformations in our energy food and economic systems that we all need at the science says we need right so um it's a really good question about how to tackle this from a political perspective and that's why you know for example friends that he has you know is working against voters", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city":
