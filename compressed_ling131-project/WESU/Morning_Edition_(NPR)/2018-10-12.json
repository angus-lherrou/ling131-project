Kennedy had enormous crowds in Nineteen sixty he was constantly straining to fire codes\nOr the night before the election and he was at the Boston Garden were twenty two thousand people were estimated to be there I was actually there David and it was terrifying there were so many people well um but also keep in mind that in early history\nIt was considered unseemly for presidents or presidential candidates to campaign though they did it through surrogates a course which is pretty much what Trump is doing for Republican candidates this year\nWhere there was a time when Kennedy didn't want to campaign\nI Know isn't it doesn't sound restful in real but [laughter] but Andrew Johnson when he was president did go out on the campaign trail in Eighteen sixty six campaigning against the Republicans in Congress that he thought a word to radical\nIt was called his swing around the circle it backfired totally um it didn't help that he often appeared to be drunk and sometimes fell off the platform of growing up but it's also true that much of the public and press a thought it was just undignified for the president to engage in a campaign\nOver the next question comes from someone who uses the Twitter name with you hear that give me a freaking break at the gym near freezing branded after and was there ever a time when money wasn't an issue it sounds ... but I'm hoping\nHistory has a positive example of where it wasn't that the questions were was money ever not so involved\nI hate to disappoint give me African break but um basically money's been there since the\n... and caused that body to pass the nation's first campaign finance law him\nThe first year presidential campaigns were not particularly a dependent on money uh but that changed with Andrew Jackson and Eighteen twenty eight when he ran much more of a grassroots campaign\nAnd then an Eighteen thirty two he was re nominated at the national political convention and of course as you well know David political conventions costs money\nAnd and that and from there on out uh it's basically been Katie by the door for the rest is history you're always to talk to you nice to be talking with you David\nCokie Roberts with David Greene you can tweet us your questions at MORNING EDITION with the hashtag askcokie or email your questions to ask Cokie at NPR dot org [noise]\n\nYou're listening to MORNING EDITION on\nNinety One point one W.

our\n[noise]\nWelcome to the Ralph Nader radio our my name is Steve grove and along with my co host David Feldman hello David how are you are the bears a little warm today but all soldiers through it he likes beer he likes beer\nI don't know how this man feels about beer but the man of the hour is here to Ralph Nader hello Ralph\nOh I don't like beer I don't like the taste of liquor period\nTo stop his nomination yes\nWe're usually on this show we talk about things that don't get the twenty four hour play in the mainstream commercial media but this subject is just too important that's why on the show today\nWe're once again going to talk about Brett Kavanaugh and we've done a number of shows on that in the past couple of months we spoke to Robert Weissman of Public Citizen about the report they put out detailing how as a lower court judge Brett Kavanaugh came down on the side of corporate interests over the public interest\nAnd the downing eighty seven percent of the time\nAnd he also wept on the two civil rights cases but before we also spoke to a constitutional scholar Bruce Fein who warned against cabinet his views on executive power\nBut today we're going to talk to Lisa Graves who worked as the chief counsel for nominations for Senator Patrick Leahy when he was the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee\nSomething that has been lost now and all the scandal over beer drinking and sexual assault is the earlier charge that Kavanaugh lied about receiving stolen emails\nWhen he's an advisor on the a\nJudicial nominations in the Bush administration well at least the graves is a particular insight into that because she actually wrote the strategic memos that were stolen she makes the case that not only should Brett Kavanaugh denied a position on the Supreme Court issued also being piece there's a federal judge altogether\nBecause he also lied about it during his confirmation hearings back then\nThat listeners should know that we're recording the show on Thursday morning Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell has promised to plow through and vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on friday so by the time you probably hear this we won't know what happened between now when I show begins to air\nOr wherever the relevant point remains even if he is confirmed as the Supreme Court justice there seems to be a strong case for impeachment\nDiamond who's written a book titled Trump care lie broken promises how it is failing and what should be done I personally I didn't even know that there was something called trumped care I don't remember any coherent program being put forth but we look forward to talking to a doctor Gaiman about that\nAnd somewhere in between the two important topics we'll check in with the corporate crime reporter Ross the ...\nFirst let die back into the cabinet story David\nAt least the graves is the cofounder of documented which investigates corporate influence on democracy she serves on the board of the center for media and democracy and us right to know and is on the advisory board of coke my campus and free speech is for people\nThere's graves was the former chief counsel for nominations for the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee under Senator Patrick Leahy and was deputy assistant attorney general in the department of justice welcome to the Ralph Nader radio hour at least the graves\nAlley fight we I'm thank you so much for having me on\nHand I sort of graves and on the frame this discussion about judge Kavanaugh and the nomination of the judge to become a social justice of the Supreme Court in the United states\nQuote from a article written by Andrew Cohen who's a fellow at the branch to for justice and I quote him quote we can already predict from his past rulings as a judge and the U.S court of appeals to the district of Columbia and from his loyal work for the Bush administration\nThe Kavanaugh as a justice will do great harm to the rights of women the health of the planet and economic welfare of workers but none of a garden variety ways in which he'll do the federalist society is bidding on the court\nIs the fact that if confirmed justice Kavanaugh before the end of the year could cast the deciding vote\nIn a case involving a direct challenge to the power of the dubious president who nominated him and quote\nWhen my dad that judge Kavanaugh is antagonistic to the rights of plaintiffs who are wrongfully injured and who use the law of courts and want their full day in court before trial by jury\nHe also was a political hack in the Bush Cheney administration right in the White House\nWhere he was secretary to President George W. Bush when Bush and Cheney were launching an engaging in the criminal invasion of Iraq which has taken over one million innocent Iraqi lives and destroyed the country in so many ways\nYou also was a supporter of dragnet surveillance under the ... act\n... violates the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution so there are just a lot of reasons Lisa Graves why he should be denied the nomination and in your context even impeached\nQuite apart from the sexual assault charges which we will discuss a little later\nAnd her interview so what is your appraisal here of the performance of the Democrats\nOn the Senate Judiciary committee and overall the supervision of this nomination by what I called the tyrant Mitch McConnell who has closed the hearing of two important request to testify\nFrom Republican constitutional scholar Bruce Fein I asked formerly to testify we never even got into college [laughter]\nWell I think that what you're seeing happen in the United states edited in some way\nDemocratic you see a Senate that no longer function the way\nIt used to in terms of hurting the towards fellow members in terms of having the opportunity to have full hearing with\nFull set of witnesses you're seeing a the active and sort of might makes right way to the house has operated and that and what that's done is it has reduced any incentive for compromise for ... geology and for just basic courtesy in terms of having the opportunity to have\nThe time to consider matters which is supposed to be one of the rules of the Senate historically and the way it's structured and to have the opportunity to have members have what used to be considered equal stay or equal weight at senators to request things ... were requesting delay\nOr was requesting time for full inexpensive debate that might stop matter\nAnd you know those packets of the Senate have not always been used for good in fact for most of the history those powers were deployed by segregationist southerners to thwart the right moment and more but as soon as they've been deployed by more progressive members to advance justice or to\nAdvance the interests of ordinary American they've been curtailed particularly in the area of nomination\nAnd so the Democrats have I think fought very hard\nTo try to protect the courts but they're fighting from a distinct advantage because there's so few Republicans willing to cross the aisle and there's no incentive for them to do so with as you say the pirate Mitch McConnell leading the Senate and him doing the bidding of\nYou know big coal oil and gas interest and more like the Koch brothers him you know steam rolling thing through with very little real process which we can also in the Senate Judiciary committee Senator Grassley has broken nearly every single role of that committee and they've all done this in a quest to install Brett Kavanaugh on the court\nEnd right wing agenda of Congress I hire um [noise]\nForeign was ... taking orders from McConnell does your friend McConnell for from [noise] well\nYou know I I could have had the same dissident route I had some sliver of respect for him as having some independence from the party from his party I think it's been very very slim and now it's nonexistent he you know behaving in the same sort of\nHave tested to that basically so in terms of senator call in and they were ... they certainly should vote against Kavanaugh\nHe is definitely someone who\nHad lied to the Senate in my view and he's also been very helpful in his reassurances to senator Collins about roe v Wade it's quite clear from his statements that are in the emails from the White House how he was coaching witness the nominee\nOf the Bush administration to not really fully a from roe v Wade at truly binding precedent but merely as president and that could be overturned that first and then that they get the chance\nRan on the main my college\nWhen she was George governance she came out of her offers uncertainty approach the judge covenant around her she would not vote to overturn roe you weren't well why wasn't to judge governance and open hammering on drones\nExactly right well I couldn't believe that he could get away with making such an insurance\nTo her such a apparently from assurance to her and then refused to answer that question under oath before the Senate Judiciary committee refuse to give the famous ... you really dodge on that question over and over again you were called out on dodging on it and yet somehow\nCenter Collins would prefer to believe what he told her behind closed doors than its own actual testimony and that also flies in the face of the actual evidence of how he would coaching Bush judicial nominees to avoid really giving\nProvided to that that it that show that he was actively promoting hardcore right wing judges to the ... who were devoted to overturning roe versus Wade like William prior operating eleventh circuit and others and so he just not credible on that point and for her to give him credit on that is willful blindness in my view\nWell let me call Andrew calling again he's a camera on will gleefully endorse the idea of sweeping presidential powers during Republican administrations and sweet free and restrictions on executive action during democratic ones I'm quoting Andrew Kong continuing quote\nWe now know the cabinet once mused about the power of a president to pack the court\nWe now know that he wants to just to the Supreme Court ruling against president Richard Nixon requiring the White House to turn over the president's tapes may\nHave been wrongly decided we even know now that he didn't think much of the independent counsel start you\nKnow gone a position that helps us get a clear sense of where Kavanaugh would land and a clash between\nThe Trump White house and special counsel Robert Mueller unquote what is your view of the FBI investigation I must say I have never been impressed by the\nOf FBI investigations in certain events in past years this one seems to be very very quickly done and many relevant and witnesses not even contacted to be interviewed\nWell I have to say that it looked like a whitewashed to me and there are a couple of component that one is that it's clear that the FBI\nFailed the interview nearly forty witness said who had tried to reach the FBI wanted it has to buy about the battered what's involved in the most recent controversy which involve Brett Kavanaugh being drunk and attacking people sexually or\nAnd so it seems like a real whitewashed what they've done is basically go back and interview people who who don't remember anything like that happening which is exactly what Dr Ford has said they wouldn't remember it was it a significant advance for them and they refused to interview witnesses who could backup Debbie Ramirez that her claims\nFrom when she was at Yale College as a freshman\nAnd they refused to interview other people but that's about all when you hear now about the prior FBI reviews you learn that his freshman roommate wasn't ever even interviewed which is a basic ordinary part of these FBI background checks\nYou hear the President Trump saying things like there have been six and seven FBI investigation well the first one just go through and looked at your roommate\nAnd neighbors then employers and ask them you know basically are used to when he was a drug problem there fixated on\nPot and drug use and have you ever since with communist they clearly apparently skipped one of his roommate from his very first year of college I'm not sure what kind of answered they accepted from its frat brothers\nI in terms of what what has good character was but it sure sounds like the ... FBI investigation wasn't thorough and then the next one after that just pick up the next five years and that that's that picks up the next five years\nAnd so on and so forth it's not as though he's had a probing review of his background\nIn light of the most recent allegations at all\nInside the community and it's a key stuff for on June ... trickling who's the chairman of the committee wanted to do our crunch control the Senate\n... projection oh John McConnell the Senate is\nBy the hour for a lifetime appointment ... on the court burned George comment on to become common and the Chinese economy without accountability and it's a key\nHow would you run us through the process and see whether apart from enough Republicans moving to oppose him and ending combination any procedural obstructions or process each\nWell yes you know in in general the Senate rule they have a role twenty to which the cloture rule which allowed a certain amount of debate before a debate close\nWhat McConnell did last year in twenty Seventeen would destroy that role as it applies to Supreme Court nominees so President Obama's nominees his two nominees to the U.S Supreme\nCourt were subject to the traditional super majority rules of the Senate which meant that they had to be at least ... senators who are willing to end debate to allow an up or down vote\nWith their McConnell did last year was to destroy that role as it applied to the Supreme Court nominees and so now you and then it you only need to have a bare majority fifty one\nMember of the Senate in order to end debate and also to force a vote that leads the Democrat very few procedural options stop that\nThe only real options going forward are going to be options through the house to possible impeachment and other measures for example to pursue Brett Kavanaugh perhaps for his life today state Senate for perjury or through the bar\nExam a calm in a risky situation where she gets the\nNomination of judge Kavanaugh through the Senate and a few days later even more damaging accusations leveled or chargers are interrupted or things come out of snapped me I embrace fusion\nThen where is senator O'Connell what can he do something you strongly serious incredible and rub say a week or two after\nThe nomination just confirmed or judge Kavanaugh\nThey did with Justice Thomas which was they had a very speedy informal swearing in of him as soon as that boat happened shortly thereafter I think within one day and then he had a formal message or a couple of weeks later in the meantime the Washington Post that come out with more information backing up Anita Hill but he was already or in the end of the court\nThough I Would suspect that they do the same game plan here because you point out the president finding more and more information out about Brett Kavanaugh\nEvery single day and just because the White House and Senate McConnell have participate in this whitewashed with the FBI did not include the important witnesses that doesn't mean the story in for Brett Kavanaugh I suspect there'll be more to come\nTo use it to be a limousine ready diminish the vote confirms cabinet to work from over to the Supreme Court begins oath of office probably\nI Believe so I think that's exactly what they'll do they'll they'll do that same the same game that they did with ...\nAnd then it's Thirty years of judicial nightmare because\nKevin doesn't hide his views I mean he's got a lot of judicial opinions those are his views he also has been part of the Bush Cheney regime and he certainly supports what they have done to the country into the world\nOften unconstitutional wars of aggression\nFederal statutes electrify surveillance statue of violence or drug nuts snooping on the American people torture violating the Geneva Conventions\nThis is a much damage judicial creature and\nUnfortunately the Democrats who didn't win enough Senate seats in when they had three Republican seats up for every one democratic seat ... for the Senate in two thousand sixteen barrel very wary of responsibility here as well Senator Harry Reid\nThe district can circuit court level on leave us with fear and the trends are very difficult process and the Democrats don't have much stomach for and there'll be other crises are to be distracted onto the Trump administration's\nQuote Obamacare Trump care\nWhen are we going to get America care we're running out of time and options working Americans in their families deserve better\nDoctor Gaiman shows us how we can have accessible high quality and affordable healthcare insurance American families deserve better than are expensive and fair patchwork of unpredictable insurance plans in benefits\nMeanwhile American businesses our son who goes on this health care expenses making it hard to be competitive for example because of the companies in Canada and he urged people to read this book from my wife's family doctor to find out how we can create a better future for our loved ones our economy\nAnd our country and quote that really sums up your book very very well and yes it is also praised by the premier scholars of the deficiencies of our health care and Dr David ... and Dr Stephanie will end or\nWho called us quote the soup ... book is essential reading for anyone concerned about where health care is headed under President Trump Dr Gaiman meticulously documents what the administration is doing wrong\nAnd provides vital road map of where we need to go from here let's start with chapter fourteen ... new book describes the current crisis in US Healthcare\nLet's run by our listeners as a context for further discussion\nThe current crisis is terrible pulled number one inadequate access to care they're reporting on a million people uninsured before the Affordable CARE Act the Obama erupting now it's about twenty or twenty nine\nThe congressional budget office that's just about up to where it was before Obamacare is now being uninsured is still a big deal being under insured is a huge deal there over thirty million people under insured now\nAnd that's gonna get worse and worse there are huge disparities across the population\nThat are based on race and ethnicity or\nSocioeconomic status or age or location\nGender and disability status and those are getting worse for instance as an example seniors even though Medicare has a pretty solid rock for them doesn't cover everything and much of it as being private ties with Trump wants\nAnd the sabotage that they've done already of the Affordable CARE Act\nHas made it possible for insurers to charge seniors much more than they could under the Affordable CARE Act\nWhich is still about Medicare\nClean it's a huge rip off these Medicare Advantage programs they charge big premiums they say they will offer more they actually offer last year abroad and\nProfit tearing their administrative costs are really high the costs of regular Medicare that started in Nineteen sixty five is less than three percent ...\nStraight of cost\nYeah ministry of cost so part of the crisis as an adequate access to care on affordable cost of care is I Know there are huge area the average family of four now pays twenty eight thousand a year for\nHealth care and insurance premiums twenty eight thousand\nThat's just totally unsustainable\nAnd by the way there are some er nurse now as we speak\nThe health insurance industry sure or Medicare Advantage and they invite elderly people and provide refreshments and then they give them a totally one sided deceptive appeal to switch from traditional Medicare to Medicare Advantage\nThat our government doesn't do much about it and have prosecutors Medicare Advantage fraud syndicate but they they don't counteract what goes on every day and the seminars all over the country is that correct\nThey turn a blind eye that's exactly right and they have\nDevious ways of recruiting the healthier patients like they'll have those conferences up on a second floor with stairs and no elevator [laughter] so you got to be able to climb stairs and such as that the insurers are expert\nAt selecting up the the less costly healthier patients and avoiding the sicker patients\nOverly who are in Medicare traditional plans are subsidizing this rip off\nFor ... or so the crisis is number one the Barry inadequate access actually getting worse the increasing costs of care that are totally unsustainable and we can learn anything we've done to try and control costs have not work and I can go back to that\nAnd then the quality of care is really poor were were among the if you compare this country with ten other countries as a commonwealth foundation has done ... years where at the bottom among those ... countries and access in ...\nAnd then on the fraud yeah the estimated ... billion fraud is three hundred and fifty billion dollars this year billion with a B according to\nHer funniest Malcolm sparrow the apply a mathematician expert at Harvard and isn't there a loss of life to for people who can't afford insurance to get diagnosed and treated in time\nOf course are so many people because it costs Saper go care they just don't go\nAnd then they get sick later and they do worse and die earlier ... preventable deaths that could've been prevented so the quality is a care is really bad man and it varies a lot across states and you can guess that states in the news basically in the south and\nWith more restrictive policies that just for Medicaid\nDo much worse soda mapping to us uh shows there is a healthcare divide New England is better and ah the west coast is better and the south is worse so\nMarjorie because they've restricted Medicaid for poor people\nExactly in the Trump Administration has put all kinds of new things on Medicaid they they get waivers to states so they can apply work requirements already it turns out most people on Medicaid already are working so that's just an administrative were\nShocks Canadians I was up in Canada recently and I said yeah Trump wants to put her work requirements for health care they said what we just have a little card called Medicare and I went to see a doctor or hospital which they can choose by the way there's no networks\nThey get on an average ... tell us about the system and how the readers digest always tries to degrade it\nThe Canadians set up in the seventies a national program a single payer program which is not socialism\nThe hospitals are not owned by the government and physicians and other health professionals are can be on their own practice but it's a single payer system\nWhich is much more efficient than us it takes up maybe nine percent of their gross national product versus Nineteen percent in this country so\nThank God there anymore and glass last I kind of difference listens or everyone for nine percent everyone twenty nine million people uncovered millions more undercover and we were not Nineteen percent of the economy\nAnd it's just getting worse there is no end in sight we cried to control costs by stupid ways that don't work but we have to change our financing system right now the whole ... healthcare system here\nIs a for profit huge medical industrial complex the corporate interests are and Wall Street and their shareholders and CEOs are doing phenomenally well the health care stocks were up on\nAnd the leading and standard and cooler up there and\nThey are massively paid like a United healthcare CEO windy and won't be buying more and more physicians who are sick and tired of the president commercialized system compromising their independent judgment telling them what to do and not to do with their patients", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city":
