college athletics is Washington Post sports columnist Kevin Blackistone also a familiar voice on our program Heather Kevin how you doing I'm good thank you so what does all this mean for college basketball as a whole what happened yesterday you know unless your name's anything for\nBasketball um in in total because what happened here was a pretty isolated incident um but what it does is it exposes the recruiting practices have been going on\nI can remember and that is basically they're channeling of money from a one source\nUm to the families of talent um to ensure that that talent goes to a particular school and what has happened over the years is that the uh manufacturers of of basketball shoes Adidas\nA Nike or those those uh operations\nHave gotten people in the middle of them um to help transfer that money so that will surprise here is that it has been criminalize or by the federal government as opposed to be policed by uh the NC double A. as it's been done for years\nAnd it used to be that the worst thing that would happen in this situation is that a someone would be banned from the NC double a a coach who was who was caught um funneling money or or some middle man\nNow it's like ... which is which is a step up\nAbsolutely now you could possibly go behind bars which is uh what these uh these three men are facing\nWhat you have these three men facing that you'd say um but I Wonder your colleague at the Washington Post Sally Jenkins room recently that the real defended here should be a university but the universities are actually considered victims and all of this do you stay at the same way that she does I\nDon't see it that way but that was the way that the federal government decided to get involved in this basically they said that the euro universes were being defrauded 'em by the system\nAh because by funneling this money um two players are are players families um these people knew that they were making these players in eligible\nUnder NCWA rules and therefore that at some point\nAnd to fraud at the University of of value which is a very strange thing to me because I still don't know how that's fraud I mean universities or a University of basketball programs and football programs are still going to get these talented players\nUnder they're very um a low level of remuneration a for athletic talented brings them um tens of million dollars in revenue every year\nWhich speaks to what you said this is something that uh this is this is just a drop in the bucket in terms of potential real change here it really is Kevin Blackistone

in on this Thursday morning a chilly morning with clear bright skies of sunshine throughout the day\n[noise] they say it's raining out of any kind of shocked without [noise]\nThere's a long shopping list of extreme weather and scary new science of there you're just strange times in Portugal in the Florida Panhandle in Wales and even in pulled back was sold them down to bottom all Canada\nDid I mention the inter governmental panel on climate change and our record climate bond fire this year our record carbon bond fire\nBut there's another huge climate story that is getting missed and Paul has it or justice climate so I just pulled back was he taught at Canadian universities and these days he teaches the world through his Youtube videos and appearances on radio it go chalk ball welcome back to the show\nIs always a pleasure to be on your show you've done a lot of\nAnd missing Arctic Sea ice ice side and I wonder well so what does Paul on a boat and now you know I thought I kind of food at all you know great and after Thirteen Years of covering the climate beat 'em pretty jaded about the possibilities\nBut I watched your two new videos and I was shocked again and I'd like to build methodically towards understanding what I Would call a new climate force that you're talking about that could shift life in this whole northern hemisphere and beyond that\nSo let's start at the start to what is the situation with Arctic Sea ocean tortilla Eighteen and how does it compare to previous years\nWell we just had the minimum the ice minimum but a month ago\nIt I'm normally happens on a boat September Fifteen but it was later this year it to um they were two minimum one on the Eighteenth I Believe in and one on the twenty second or something like that anyway it was about a week later than normal it didn't set a new record\nBut the surprising thing now is that it doesn't really seem to be warming back um that quickly in fact in the central Arctic base and it's still being declining\nUm it's very very thin very fractured very broken up and is behaving quite differently than it has in the past so I expect to see it all gone by twenty twenty two you know when September you know in the next ... years we'll have a completely open Arctic Ocean\nWell you've predicted the blue ocean event before and and been wrong about the timing but you know what Paul I don't really think the tide matters because scientists agree that pretty soon we will see an open Arctic Ocean maybe there'd be a couple of small patches device channels around the Canadian archipelago but [noise]\nWell it's being hit from all sides so to speak um atmosphere is extremely warm effect next week or so\nIn the Arctic is going to be Fifteen to twenty degrees Celsius warmer than normal that the air temperatures were talking about some of the ice is not forming forming quickly on on the surface the ocean water temperature is also\nQuite warm when the ice melts in the in the summer there's a layer of than if you like of of called fresh water\nThe meltwater from the ice just underneath and it goes down to I don't know about a forty fifty meters something like that\nIn places and underneath that the ocean water is actually warmer um it's salty and warm so the salty ... think makes it heavier than the colder freshwater then\nThat there's enough heat and that water underneath to to basically take out the whole life so if there's enough mixing up the water and a wave action then that\nCan be a big feedback to take the ice there's also\nLots of encouraging of of warmer water into the Arctic Ocean goes through the bearing straight from the Pacific ocean and through the friends straight and through the I'm from the Atlantic ocean in in the north were part so there's there's this\nSalty warmer ocean water coming into the Arctic Ocean underneath the surface and on on both sides so there's a lot of feedback so going on here to a rapidly ah accelerate the ice lock\nPeople keep sending me shots of what's happening with those warm Arctic waters coming in especially through the ... street people Sam parental will post of photographs I've seen them from Robert scribble or who's doing the video blog now about the climate change\nWhen you look at those maps and you see that red or even purple heat going up through the Bering Strait right into the Arctic Sea your goal what is happening why is it being pushed in\nYes I think the biggest factor is that the circulation patterns have completely changed both in the atmosphere which is a jet streams mostly we're talking about and also in the ocean the the ocean currents so\nThe Arctic is much much warmer because it's darker and darker place I'm having having a lost tremendous amounts of sea ice which is highly reflective that also snow cover over the ah land over Siberia northern Canada et cetera and the snow covered mostly in the spring\nIs much reduced so these trends are happening so the jet stream they're\nBecoming so way the the the the riches of the wave going right up into the far gets in the trucks are going very very far so so this is a very strong feedback because you know moving warm air into the Arctic is of course it's going to warm it but at the same token\nYou know large excursion to cold there in the Arctic moving so where'd are then displayed in the Arctic by warmer air as well so that's it's all these things are contributing to greatly warming the Arctic so so we're heading to to know C I F um and and that's going to be you know a completely different situation for us\nYeah and that's partly because as you explained in your two new videos of the distance that wins canal blow over open sea you rather than over the sea ice but why does that make a difference yes\nThe wave height ocean a wave height is dependent on a number of factors it is dependent on basically the wind speed and there's ... you know\nThe generation so how long the winds are blowing over the water you know the longer they go for the more they can get the water moving and also the distance over which they flow which is the patch the fat which is what you were just talking about so with less than the sea ice more and more open water\nThe way I can build up much much higher than they would if the if the ice was still there\nAnd this uh this um wave action on to the number of different things that causes lots of coastal erosion and when when there's coastal erosion there's organic material that is released often you get coastlines kind of\nCollapsing and exposing the organic matter which can break down and produce the methane so you know lots of the coastlines are essentially permafrost which has been dogged by contact with the ocean water\nAnd yeah there's also lots of mixing of water with that so when the waves build up and there's more vertical mixing and the problem is is that can bring up the heat that's in the water that's in a saltier warmer water down below\nAnd that that mixing will then you bring up more heat and all all of these things combined to moving more and more sea ice\nSo the jet stream so it will change completely I think ah when there's no sea ice left\nSo you talk to both this vast part of relatively warmer water below what looks to me like the western Arctic Ocean is there a name for that why is there\nA faith so this is fairly recent research we're talking about a paper that's described this in detail because that came out just within the last few months\nAnd I don't know of a name that is going for it but basically the origin of the water is thought to be incursions of watts\nBut it's warm or so you know warmer water float on top of hold their water right later but the salt in the water makes it heavier so\nThese two factors determine the density of the water and it turns out the warmer water because it's so ... is actually ... than the ah fresh cold water which comes off the mouth of the sea ice\nSo are you saying that this could end or the side is saying that this could be a news source of warmth into the Arctic coming up from under the ocean that that we hadn't really expected\nAnd then it didn't just continue to this new moon strength it actually it was a time period where it actually maintained an even slightly gain strength\nAs it was moving across and and um I've heard this phenomenon rip off the boat is being sort of a ground ocean event to feel like you know to the hurricane perspective the very wet hot land in the evaporation and peeled storm almost like the ocean but\nOver the land is water on that land that does that and of course last year we had you know was was a horrible for one year we had\nI mean Florida got off lightly when Irma came across was heading for Miami and Palm Beach and it was looking to go right up the eastern coast of Florida this was twelve hours with where it ended up hitting Florida\nA beard alive minutes we'll just came across the Everglades\nAnd you know it was a bad going but it would have been a trillion dollars perhaps the damages it's hidden in the rain Miami and Palm Beach and know that the east coast of Florida in a court Maria you know just a huge devastation on on Puerto Rico so the so these storms are becoming much worse and of course the storm surge\nIs very large and when you add worms or John ... of them\nMay be a very very high tide and tied it all on top of sea level rise\nThan you know the great race for people living on the coast\nShows as well as in my blog\nIs that there were Twenty one listeners last week in Pittsburgh all North Carolina which surprised me but we also have blisters in Dallas texas to another couple of dozen listeners there and and of course we have stations throughout the south in the northeast\nAnd I'm thinking that from what you're telling me between this idea that the tornadoes are moving east and that we're going to have more extreme storms from a hotter Gulf of Mexico and hotter Atlantic\nOur listeners in the southeastern United States and the eastern seaboard better get ready for more flooding and more terrible weather\nYeah I mean it's just that the real risk when we lose our if the ice\nIs that Greenland living up there it'll be the only called spot left and of course the melt rate from Greenland will not shop very very quickly as the cold Arctic is much much warmer and not only that but the jet stream which\nCircle around recipe the center of called in the Arctic if your life which is right now is the sense of the north pole the north pole shifting were towards Greenland agreement go quite fires that we\nWould know the ice the funnier Greenland is it that we read degrees north latitude so that where I Would like it at the center of a patient could be that that called a lot about about the call center of of Greenland so\nWe're going to be not just the deaths in becoming wave here in lower\nLike hunter of the Haitian I think it's going to shift though that's going to be very significant new our ability to grow food and supplies food there will be in a in an quantity things there are very ...\nClimate change getting back\nTo strange storms Spain and Portugal hardly ever see an actual hurricane and I think one struck in the Eighteen hundreds but on Saturday Tobar fourteenth hurricane Leslie's struck Portugal with winds of a hundred nine miles per hour or a hundred and Seventy five kilometers an hour\nThings are getting very unpredictable why would an Atlantic hurricane cruel back towards Portugal and Spain that's really bizarre\nYeah Lesley with another amazing storm a hurricane Leslie it was formed I think about three weeks or like the storm lasted about Twenty one days or so so it was meandering around the Atlantic you know doing loop and stuff like that before then\nYou know reach the latitude where the prevailing winds were to the east it it just went right across the red cross and and uh impacted Portugal is used as you said\nYou probably remember a hurricane of Celia um last year which hit Ireland and Ireland had a tropical storm I Believe this year that off but also impact it ... it wasn't quite a hurricane but it was a tropical storm\nAnd I remember a few years ago there was a hurricane or\nMaybe it was downgraded to a tropical storm that that hit Brazil which is again very very unusual so with the jet streams it's very important to remember that the extreme weather events and that includes hurricanes tornadoes everything else trench rains\nThey're increasing in frequency in general they're increasing in severity they're increasing in generation and they're also hitting regions of the world that never had them before\nYeah on a job or sixteen the storm cold count them maybe that's wonderful\nYou know I'm Wondering not long ago Dr James Hansen the former chief scientist at now so he warned that storm stronger than any scene in our past records could blow up out of the Atlantic\nWhat was he talking about and does it relate to what we've just been talking about today\nI'm James Hansen he wrote the classic book a\nStorms of our grandchildren dorms of our grandchildren yes a few years ago now and\nWhat he was talking about mostly was the contrast between warm and cold air and they're very very warm oceans and\nWith the idea of these massive uh dorms and high winds with the jet stream shift over the Atlantic which that you could build up these enormous wells that would be heading for example\nTo hitting area like reviewed in some of the um island that was west of Bermuda like these massive with a wave trains of a you know thirty meters height type of thing\nThat he he was looking at Boulder and some things that had been actually moved\nFar inland on some of these fires and the idea being that they were picked up from the sea floor and and toss stopped thirty meters above present sea level\nYou know so these type of massive storms he he wasn't really focusing too much on the jet stream I I'm a despot fries I mean there's a you know had since then great work of course he's still continues to it and but the the kids lawsuit against the u._s. government is proceeding it is\nYes but what but one thing that is surprising is that the government really doesn't really talk too much about jet stream and like the ... the warming are like on the impact on jet stream and\nIn fact this is the thing about the I ... a one point five report hold on that's what I Want to get to in my very next segment\n[noise] you're listening to equal shot radio for the world [noise]\nI'm Alex Smith get it

with your hopes Alex Smith [noise]\nYou are tuned to radio equal shot I'm your host Alex with my guest is Canadian climate so I just pulled back with we're trying to cover a world and climate trouble\nAnd poll is moved right on to the very next thing I wanted to ask him about this latest report by the inter governmental panel on climate change their final report on one point five degrees of warming found another magical ten or Fifteen Years of blind fossil fuels\nYeah I think one of the most significant things is that the baseline used in this report is Eighteen fifty Nineteen hundred\nWhereas when these reports and the PCC with first talking about the two degrees Celsius guard grill that we have to stay within\nDollar project the liquefied natural gas project I mean it boils down to you know governments are\nYou know they may talk a good story but their actions or what is important and their actions they're still subsidizing fossil fuel companies and yeah it's very discouraging in Canada because\nWe knew that the conservatives wouldn't have climbed that planned\nUm we thought that the liberals woods and we've seen what happened I mean the problem is is the a symmetry it seems to take for granted government years and years and years to actually put it in a price on carbon\nBy that time there then quickly voted out and replaced by another government which will kill\nThose years and years and years of planning and work in a day or so I mean it's very simple to quit the on carbon carbon uh the ... and you could just send out the next relying on the income tax form that could've been\nImplemented within a month the liberal government being elected but we could have had it could've been having it for three years already almost in in Canada that of that it's going to come in like twenty ninth scene\nAnd then know who knows what's gonna happen with the liberals the poor recently showed that if the election was the day the censors would get a majority [laughter] so [laughter]\nPoll we won't be worried about all this stuff because we've got plenty of legalize pot now in Canada so that that we can all get stoned as the climate goes to ...\nIf you the story I Do or thoughts on something you've heard the contours of radio a dog or the radio equals on going forward [noise]\n\nIs Rudy we'd go sure my guess is climate scientists pulled backwards and listeners if you're sick\nWas really happening here's the story from their business paper Bloomberg News publish took Tobar twelfth\nThe world is pumping out more oil and other petroleum liquids than ever before global supply rose to one hundred points three million barrels a day in the third quarter the international Energy Agency said friday and its monthly report\nOutput includes crude oil natural gas liquids biofuels and refinery processing games so here we are the carbon bonfires hit another new record over a hundred million barrels a day at a time when ten years ago I thought it would be slowly creeping down bird and we'd be replacing it with other things it's not happening\nYeah I mean crossing that a hundred million barrels a day\nI remember I mean the number that sticks in my mind is eighty eighty to eighty four million barrels a day\nAnd that's the only for about a decade ago or so\nSo I mean we're just heading more quickly I'm In the wrong direction\nWith this and know people think OK well natural gas is cleaner burning which it is you know remember we talked about the phrase is where natural gas it'd be a bridge he'll get off oil to transition to renewable that the problem is is this rich you know\nHas very high rate from hype and transport and stuff which make it is that is coal unfortunately and you know methane of course is a very natural gas is Ninety percent methane\nMethane is a very potent greenhouse gases as we know\nAnd here's the real shocker as we burned more and more fossil fuels carbon dioxide in the atmosphere broken other record into what are you a teen we went over four hundred and eleven parts per million in May of this year according to the observatory in Hawaii and the article at Yale environment three sixty ads this hair raising stable\nWell in six parts per billion per year in the Nineteen eighties one point five million parts per year in the Nineteen Ninety two two point two million parts per year during the last decade poll what does that increase on her increased mean other than exponential climate change\nWell this is the key number right the level of field to in the atmosphere so we're we're about close to four hundred and ten parts per million and a as you've said the average rises into point two parts per million over the last decade\nWe've had some years of being as high as ... parts per million\nOr put this in relative terms to the south as rises that we have seen in the paleo records though in the earth a deep history\nEven time periods when the C. O. two is very rapidly rising in the past it's only rising rate something like\nZero point two parts per million per year so we're at least ten to Fifteen times\nFaster now in the change of the two in the atmosphere than we have seen it any other point can in earth's history from the best we can tell from paleo proxies and things so you can look at just about any climate for amateur whether it be you know rides and methane rise in\nGlobal average temperature you know rising sea level you can look at any of these metric than nowhere\nNear the top in in the history of the climate not there yet with the level rise is back with the level rise that\nThere's been periods in earth history where the average sea level rises in about five centimeters a year for fifty or a hundred years that would be five meters in a you know in in a century sort of thing and I expect that will be exceeding those who have rate\nI Am working right now on a series of videos on all the climate feedback and also I'm going to look at the melt rate from Greenland and Antarctica and you know identify the regions that are most concerning for rapid sea level rise\nAnd are there are other news stories are new science but to have caught your attention that you want to tell us about\nWell I Love I Love to read you know book book you know there isn't it remember those two\nYou know advice is and and there's a couple of great book well one in particular I'm reading I finished and\nThe author is Lawrence consult lays um the book is called deep survival who lives and dies and why and it's a fascinating book that delved into you know the human emotions and intellect and psychology\nWith loads of examples of you know people that have survived the most horrendous conditions you know being like breaking a leg and being stranded on a mountain or\nBeing the only survivor of a plane crash in the Amazon in the Peruvian jungle and walking through the jungle and you know being found like a few weeks later a twelve year old or a fourteen year old girl\nWhereas you know a dozen people survived the plane crash in the wreckage and they were all dead when they were down about two weeks later and they had all kinds of supplies they had ability that they had they could have buyers they had food had water that everything but they\nYou know twelve adult died in in the face of a couple of weeks where his twelve or fourteen year old girl you know was on her own ... nothing in the deepest jungle and basically walked in survive so what is it that allows people to be able to do this like it's not just lose there's lots\nAnd it changed really attack biking and and the emotions are you know it makes people you know think about what do we do I mean you know what can I Do nothing throw up your hand you know but I'm ignoring or\nGive up those there's a lot of good tip in this book in the author's also written another book called survival and survival\nAnd it's ... you know people that often survive with extreme on they have problems later on they have all the notes about why did they survive and nobody else info to things\nSo I'm I'm reading of certain things I'm finding that they're very fully bought the lessons to be learned and a lot of things and those books that can help help at all as we go through just a abrupt climate change situation\nYou know I find that I couldn't read a dozen climate stories\nAnd then I'll run into some little detail it it it might be a boat disappearing turtles or or it might be just some statement a well here's here's one here this is a quote from D esteem Nicholas totally\nAnd he wrote it in his book fooled by randomness and it says it does not matter how frequently something succeeds if failure is too costly to bear and I mean that's where we're at now with industrial civilization were succeeding hey everything's going great if I Want to fly to Peru I could do it\nNo problem there's lots of food on the shelves and that could go on for a while\nBut failure climate failure is too costly to bear\nI write for blacks one yes yes he did\nYeah I think um there's there's a lot of a really good book on on different topics that can help people come to grips with you know how to deal with what's happening", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "25"}
