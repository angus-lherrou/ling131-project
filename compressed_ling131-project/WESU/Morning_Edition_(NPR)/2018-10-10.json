were\nAnti executive editor John ... says that at one point the Dodgers called one of their own employees unbelievably corrupt or as I'm told me that in order to get access to top baseball talent in Cuba teams often go through agents called boustani\nThe ... is a middleman base in Latin America who essentially takes equity stakes in prospects sometimes it can be forty fifty sixty percent of future earnings but for prospects desperate enough that's a that's a rift undertake\nAnd now it might be a legal risk according to Sports Illustrated the Justice Department is investigating whether some teams broke federal corruption laws just time Cuban players\nExtraction of Cuban players has always been shrouded in mystery in baseball but this evidence that the FBI was presented with and we were as well indicates that ah that the complicity runs potentially to teams and agents as well as the middle man does ... have always been implicated in this\nAnd basically impossible for a baseball player in Cuba to find his way into the the major leagues without help from one of these middle man\nIt's very difficult part of that is\nBecause of the embargo of Cuba and a player must establish residency in another country usually in the Caribbean or Mexico before coming to the U.S [noise] so what you have a network of the street level agents that really have been operating outside of anything that the u._s. or major league baseball has restriction over\nSo you obtained these documents that are ... they offer a window into how baseball teams operate in Latin America especially in Cuba can you explain what you found and what a chess\nIs that teams and agents have what seems pretty clear from the documents anyway on a level of complicity and in some cases that scouts on the cake and in some cases that is about helping to arrange documents using outside counsel to\nEssentially falsified documents and one does think that this is something that could implicate teams and and major league baseballs and institution which is something that hasn't really happened before this is the first time so far as we can tell where you have this level of documentation\nClearly I mean as you've articulated this has been somewhat of an open secret for for generations really but now that you have the documents that allegedly shows some of this a dubious recruiting behavior do you watch these players on these games differently\n[noise] it's interesting as played with the information you do watch these games and some of these players differently you realize that the story of the extraction is often a lot more complex than if perhaps portrayed as being and you also wonder about the economic but again a lot of these players are not operating under the standard rates\nFor agents you know four or five percent agent fee if not applying it a lot of these cases and to me one thing you think about is just how many people along the way how many institutions even have profited by

she was prosecuted for murder in Georgia\nThere was a woman who was convicted of child abuse she may have been legitimately convicted of child abuse I think that's questionable but the doctor lots of back to the judge\nSinister sterilization and told her she did not have any more children or she was going to go to jail and it's not just happening to people of color\nWeek I called in by a white guy in Wisconsin\nWho because he was not paying child support when we can argue whether you should have been paying job but what I don't care\nBut the judge told him that if he did not submit to sterilization you're going to go to jail for failing to pay child support and so he ended up calling our human rights that are saying what can we do if this right\nAnd so we've got the criminalization of people's behaviors directly tied to their right to reproduce or not\nAnd it's creating cannon fodder for the prison industry that creates profit for the corporations are interlinked and\nWanted to ask you about the urgency of this issue I mean I think one of the things that I hear from people from time to time as\nYou know when you look around the world reproductive rights reproductive justice is not as high on the priority list as as um maybe we once thought it was the Bush administration isn't moving as quickly as people had been concerned that maybe they would on you know passing a major legislation\nAnd they're moving quickly on stuff it's not on the radar of the media but it is happening quite ...\nExplain that explain the urgency of the situation today\nWell first of all I Want to sound the fire alarm but I'm also saying don't panic so I'll talk about don't panic the fire\nNow elevated the unborn fetus to the status of a murder victim\nAnd in that whole discourse\nThe woman is a visible at the same time\nThe Bush administration and the government is pushing the unborn victim of violence act they're cutting funding for programs to violence against women it knowing the logic that the best way to protect an unborn child is to protect them other from getting beaten or killed\nI mean that is absolutely the best way but even more pernicious the\nBush administration proposed including unborn children in health care which is really sad because at the same time they're cutting back healthcare for children who are already here\nI mean the children's health care programs are being slashed all across the board the only way a woman can get an increase in her prenatal care benefits is because the fetus has more benefits than the woman does\nAgain this is happening and it's not dominating the media but it's very pernicious it's very dangerous\nOn wings you're listening to the rhetoric is a long time reproductive justice activist from the United states she was interviewed in two thousand and five by Sarah Olson\nNow they are talking about passing a series of bill ... feel pain deals where they are alleging that certain things certain behaviors that people engage yeah actually cause pain to the fetus\nSo they're saying that having an abortion causes pain to the fetus but I wouldn't be surprised for them to say partying too much causes\nIt tells you you should not be doing causes pain to the fetus and so all of this is happening\nAt the same time we're looking at the Supreme Court which just only one vote away from overturning roe v way a lot of stuff now after having sounded that fire alarm let me get to the don't panic side\nI think that they're going to do everything possible to re criminalize abortion to elevate the fetus to attack women\nAt the same time I don't think they can put the toothpaste back in the two because I'm a white\nPre Nineteen Seventy three too many of us know how to do abortions too many of us know the technology you can download abortion instructions off the Internet and so unless we\nAll suddenly throw our skirts over our heads to pretend we don't know how to do this technology again how can they re criminalize something that we're just going to take back then they go out and say we're feminist we care about saving women's lives\nYou don't have to use that coat hanger again I can show you how to do is safety in the in the comfort of my bathroom\nAnd so I think the feminist movement\nMakes a mistake to found the fire alarm without saying don't panic people because we haven't lost our agency we have a lot of our ability to directly take care of women and as a matter of fact that might not be a bad idea\nFor us to really gain and re learn that technique right now because we are not happy\nThat we've turned control of pregnancy over to the medical establishment anyway\nYou mentioned I think before we started recording and about how women have been kinda flattened to their\nA lot about women especially women of color organizing and having the agency that you just mentioned still wanted to talk a little bit more about you know women of color organizing around the areas of reproductive justice and you know what is happening and where are the areas that need more focus in ...\nWell a lot of the accounts detailing what has happened to women of color always talk about what has happened to us not what we have done for ourselves\nSo there's been some mentioned in a lot of the literature about the population control strategy eugenics strategies directed towards women of color but very few accounts tell\nWell women of color weren't just passive victims in the face of this we were concerned about saving the lives of ourselves and our families what we do and so a team of us wrote a book detailing what women of color did\nOther team was ... Solomon Marlene fried Elena ... and me Loretta Ross and our book is called undivided writes women of color organizing for reproductive justice\nIn it we look at the four main ethnic groups African American Latino or Native American an Asian Pacific Islander\nAnd we take a very long look at the history of reproductive rights organizing in those communities of color\nAnd then left me do the look the longer look at the histories of those communities and organizing\nThen be profile eight organizations representing those communities and talk specifically about how these women of color reproductive health organization organized what they did how they related to the mainstream how they focused on these issues in their communities\nOne of the things that characterizes the work\nHow has a right to have a child [noise] those are twin parrot values that they always keep it in the forefront\nThe other thing is that they're always deeply embedded in their communities they don't see themselves as separate from the communities but as part of their communities and they see themselves as bonding responding to their community needs\nAnd so if it's a community that is dealing with intense immigration restrictions\nThen they the immigrant rights as a reproductive rights issue if their community dealing with um the feeling of native kids through and ended up placing of them in boarding schools are with white families\nThan they do the right to control their children and the right to control their land and sovereignty issues as reproductive rights issues\nOne of the projects that we looked at the mother's milk project which is a Native American project in New York\nThey got involved and reproductive rights activism when they noticed that babies new born babies were getting sick from drinking their mothers breast milk\nAnd it turned out that these peace the bees were being dumped into the lake where the people were fishing\nAnd so this really unhealthy level of toxins were getting into the breast milk and that's why I became known as the mother's milk project\nThey ended up defining the womb as babies first environment so they neatly connected environmental job just to reproductive rights\nIn looking at the stories that we tell and others that we weren't able to tell because the space and time limitations it's clear that as women of color work on reproductive rights issues they don't", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "10"}
