rights activists that John ... who was the green parties vice presidential candidate in twenty sixteen is trying to revive the black movement against imperialist war [noise] Morocco is director of the black alliance for peace [noise]\nThe way that we re ignite this conversation to begin the conversation again to engage in a dialogue with\nOur activist Raul why is absolutely necessary to have a into national understanding of the world you know we remember ... comes to my uncle is that you can understand Mississippi unless you understand the Congo\nYou can't understand the Congo unless you understand Mississippi and in that simple phrase what he was getting at with that\nAre specific to the U.S territory but it is an oppressive into national system and international oppressive reality\nAnd that for us to be able to\nConstruct strategies to address are concrete situation is in the U.S we've got to understand how the system is organized and how it impacts not just our folks both people around the world\nIncluding our folks so having a\nAn understanding of how the world is organized how the oppressive system operates is absolutely\nNecessary because we don't have that we'll find ourselves pursuing just reform of strategies that we think are addressing certain kinds of symptoms of the disease and we are stuck at that level\nAnd so when you talked about twenty four chain 'em in the push for\nFor criminal justice reform [noise]\nYou know that push to respond to the systematic killing about people across the country that was important\nBut what was happening was real guinea stuck at a very narrow understanding of what we're up against when they're just up against the so called bad apples were involved in executing up people in various parts of the country we\nUp against a state apparatus a repressive state apparatus has a particular kind of mission is to control and to contain\nA population that basically at this point it's redundant\nIt is a apparatus that has a class interest is upholding and so we have to understand them that we're not going to be able to reform that apparatus because the very care of it is that it's organized against us so we've got to have a perspective\nWe have that can understand in that we can also understand the connection between this apparatus and the systematic undermining and exploitation and the pressure by people in the African continent\nThroughout Africa world and other oppressed people on this planet so we don't we don't get confused and that's the kind of perspective we get to have at this moment we can no longer play with this Glenn we can no longer play with any Mr say cases about what we up against\nAnd so what we're trying to do with the black alliance with peace is to penetrate the\nIllusions and to bring some real clear understandings real clear politics to the table\nThey wake people up to the fact that there's a war being waged against us a race and class war and that will get to be prepared to now they respond to that war over that got to be equipped in Beijing where we need to be able to go beyond is\nAnd how difficult is it just put me on the bone of anti imperialist black conversation when most of our people can't find not only on the map\nAnd even those of our people but no that's six new you know on more Congolese have died in the last [noise] once a year or so years most of them including activists [noise] don't know how the U.S was complicit in that genocide\nWhile you know it requires us to continue the systematic public education a lot of people it's a difficult thing there's no short cuts\nWe have to deal with it for the rightly directly and deal with the knowledge gaps that in fact are there so we have to engage in community teacher and we've got to use opportunities that we create for themselves like for example\nOn the existence of a United States Africa Command after all calm\nMost people who don't even know anything about that you might recall that when those for us service personnel were killed and measure than most people even people even members of Congress didn't know they were us personnel in that country well we need to\nEducate people and the fact that not only do we have us personnel in that country but we have us personnel across the African continent that\nThat right now Afrikaners being used as an instrument of U.S foreign policy to enhance the ability of the u._s. to control the politics and the economics of that continent in reaction to the inroads being made by the Chinese\nSo this campaign is part of an effort to engage in that kind of public education\nWe want to connect that to the fact that we have this ongoing war against people in the U.S\nWe want to demonstrate to our people that these manifestations\nOn the African continent in our communities is a part of a global capitalist imperialist system that is in fact our enemy so we can get around the fact that we've got to engage in systematic political education\nAnd systematic political organizing\nThis campaign and building the black and White House the piece is one component of attempted to rebuild a viable independent black left here in this country that's the only way we can go forward\nHistorically the Congressional Black caucus lobbied most leave for more U.S involvement in Africa once the black caucuses position now\nWhere the black caucus position or the quality of that block\nThe debt in various parts of the world but also in terms of the war being waged against up people in the U.S I think it's important to us to remind people that\nHalf of the international is understanding of the world\nSo we can be able to determine our friends from my enemies and we're not allowed to be confused with our allow our young people to be\nWashed off this fight for the answers are the one percent against other poor\nAnd oppressed people in other parts of this planet so\nThat's why we are focused in on raising the issue of militarism that's why we say it is in our interest to be anti war and to advocate for peace\nAnd that's why we say that that moral opposition to war has to be connected with a political understanding an opposition\nTo imperialism because the material reality of imperialism\nThat helps to explain why you have this dress for war on the part of the U.S state NATO and all of these colonial capitalist nations that are trying to maintain their grip on the globe\nThat was a jumble Veronica director of the black alliance for peace and a columnist and editor of black agenda root

politics and Latin American immigrant activists\n... Escobar is associate professor of Chicano studies at California State University at Northridge she's author of the new book\nCaptivity beyond frictions criminalization experiences outlet Tina and migrants Escobar said the U.S mass incarceration system can only be understood as an extension of slavery\nThem really drawing a lot on the work ... who law professor and something the school university and so she posted doing her work as good as to understand how the model that was developed\nIn relationship to slavery labor the eight bringing non white bodies into\nThis country well initially into the colonies in order to labor for a pre dominant Lee\nWhite society she says has been the model that has carried over into\nRelationships as immigrants entered the United states so the idea of using non white bodies bringing them into this country\nTo labor in terms of slavery of course for free labor and in terms of immigrants and very exclusive conditions so I'm really drawing from her work in her analysis and trying to get us to think\nSo that's really where I'm drawing from so what what I see in terms of immigrants is again the use of non white bodies\nBeing brought into the United states and being brought\nI really want to emphasize\nIn the book I Try to I think the idea of the American dream and that people come to the United states because it's just a better place and people are looking for opportunities it's much more complicated\nThe United states of course this placing people in other places causing the kind of conditions that people are not necessarily looking for a better life but they're scraping really violent situations that aren't part produced by the United states but\nAlso the United states going into other countries\nAnd recruiting people to come and labor for the United states so that's really where I'm drawing from from Ronda Mickey's work to try to understand how lucky next folks today I'm particularly ... folks but migrants a general experience labor in the United states\nFrom these relationships in the United states are not necessarily just between employee urine for you but if you're involved people with color they are religion that one guard the role as between Europe and in theory you're\nExactly and that's that's all right\nThe labor relationships in the United states developed based on ideas about race who in terms of slavery who could be enslaved who could not only themselves on their labor and who could own other human beings\nAnd so those ideas about race we know are not gone they're still very much with us and they look different depending on the community and the depending on the time and the geography but there's\nWhat the United States is and so that continues to shape various relationships including labor relationships in the U.S\nWould of course the rescue view America does not um you [noise] why [noise] either\nNo no no exactly and so going\nBack to that time period of colonialism is really important to understand why the world looks the way that it does today\nThat colonialism the idea that Europe was civilized the idea that Europe was superior\nAnd the development of that notion of white miss during colonial period didn't just impact the United states it impacted\nAnywhere where they call and then they went everywhere\nOutside of Europe so that's very very much with us today those relationships so magical race relationships looks differently but it's still white supremacist\nAnd sets Central America several of the people that I worked with for the book where Central Americans and you see those ideas also shaping their experiences\nSo in what the my left for example that are the strong my community and the genocide that migrants experience I mean what the islands experienced during the civil war and continue to live to some extent\nThis proportionally impacted indigenous communities for example so yeah\nColonialism is still very much shaping our our present moment how could a colonialists explain to themselves the violence that they were carrying out against entire populations the idea of race became a useful tool to explain those relationships\nAnd in fact raised federal law to do a lot to do\nOh yes very much and we see that you know right now it's a little bit more openly racist and white supremacy what the new administration but consistently we've seen\nIdeas about who the supposedly led the third world is in relationship to the United states and it's a very much white supremacist racialized understanding\nOf the United states in relationship to those other folks and so the notion in terms of immigration that's why the common sense in the United states is that people come to the United states because it's superior because it's better because it offers more opportunities jobs education et cetera\nWithout recognizing the kind of violence to the United states there it's on other countries\nAnd that ideas about race are central to that violence\nAnd of course ideas about race cars central to the violence that is practiced in Germany in the United states via when all this big huge institutions the institution of incarceration\nYes central and again going that goes back in terms of incarceration specifically it goes back to the experience\nOf enslaved black folk who were supposedly freed and then we see polls fourteenth amendment that we continue to see their enslavement now to incarceration\nIn houses all ... ... people who are not you partially readers who are trying to get a job or are you going to
