bill of rights\nThank you so much Stephen and I should say that I Am currently on sabbatical from national nurses United so they have ... give me some time off to do this work\nWell Michael welcome indeed I go back a long way with the California nurses association we went up and down the state of California once and buses pressing for a statewide initiative which was on the ballot to give single payer\nFull Medicare for all free choice of doctor and hospital to the people of California unfortunately the industry spent a lot of money on TV to distorted and we lost that fight which is a fight we're continuing\nAll over the country here is my first question you and I and others have read in written and spoken about full Medicare for all single payer for years I'm astonished at how little reference there is in the media\nTo this country to the north of us called Canada where the people look like us and we're in the late sixties early seventies starting assess got you on the province they installed a single payer system that is public funding of healthcare\nPrivate delivery of health care this is not socialized medicine as Britain as\nAnd it works every healthcare system in the world has problems we shouldn't have candidates problems they cover everybody in Canada at a per capita average half of what we spend and we have twenty nine million people without any health insurance even with Obamacare\nAnd thirty million more under insured and so in Canada they spend about forty five hundred dollars give or take per capita year to cover everybody and we spend over Ninety five hundred dollars a year to cover not everybody stand\nDread in fear they don't move from one job to another because they might not get health insurance and the second job on why isn't there more mention of Canada to make the case for single payer here\nThat it's a very good question and\nIt is a great honor to be on this show with you and talk about it because which of course funny about it is you hear\nOften when you go around the country you encounter these anecdotal stories about oh my God my aunt couldn't get a hip\nSurgery in Canada for six months before you just outlined is the truth rather than those anecdotes and it's no wonder the don't hear Canadians clamoring for the U.S health care system yeah let me let me have a adding instead you know it just doesn't happen and the reason I think we don't talk enough about Canada has because\nIt's part of a media narrative that says government can't do anything right and when it comes to health care that's the last thing we want and it turns out in fact that the Canadians have discovered that not only is government more efficient but having a Canadian Medicare and that's what they call it\nBrings the country together it both rises from a sense of social solidarity and enhances it and builds upon that\nAnd so when you talk to Katie and do you find that Canadian Medicare occupies a central role in the national identity and that's very threatening I think for a lot of folks on the American side because\nIt contrast with the supposed individual ism hyper individualism that characterizes our society\nSo the neighbor to the north as you say that that looks very much like us in terms of very much more diverse country than people realize and it has a very similar economy and kind of population so we don't want in the media narrative to make that comparison because it is unfavorable to the American system\nThat's a good point like the Reader's Digest as always distorting what's going on in Canada in healthcare area in Canada and nobody\nBased on a Harvard Medical school peer reviewed study by doctors won't ... ...\nAbout thirty five thousand Americans die every year because they can't afford health insurance to get diagnosed and treated in time and of course far greater numbers get sick and injured for that cause that is they can't afford health insurance\nAnd I might add that the attack on Canada is almost always focused on delays well first of all when the conservative party took over in Ontario they closed twenty three hospitals that's not good for preventing delays there are forces in Canada that one a\nMonkey wrench the system and their help by U.S companies want to get in there and make profit but I Know a lot of people in Canada I have relatives in Canada\nAnd they don't have to wait except for elective surgery for example they may have to wait but how long is the way when you don't have health insurance and you can't pay for anything in the u._s. it's interminable\nAnd in Berkeley sometimes you have to wait months for certain procedures there aren't enough primary care doctors in the U.S so even with this huge profit making system\nThere are all kinds of blockages end in Canada you don't have a drug industry that says payer die the way our auto control drug industry profit tearing out sourcing to China bringing the drugs in without adequate\nSupervision by the FDA we had a program on that by the author of China are ex wonderful alarming book\nSo I think one way we could start taking single payer to a higher level already HR six seven six in the house of representatives you know Michael has over a hundred and twenty signers all of them Democrats so it's not like a starting from scratch we ought to talk more\nI think Ralph that what you say about delays is so true if you actually look at this study is like the commonwealth fund does you find that the U.S to get a specialist can take as long as six weeks have been in the U.S when you get diagnosed with something that requires a specialist that's not an elective that serious and urgent\nIn many cases folks cannot get access to those appointments and that's just kind of the random experienced people have the notion in the U.S that so counterproductive is that Americans used too much health care and in fact we use less\nHealthcare we have less access and as you say that's in part because uninsured but also particularly the under insured we know from again commonwealth fund research it's\nOr the civil rights movement and I couldn't even come up to the number of a hundred a hundred full time people working on this\nAnd that holds true when Obama tried to expand healthcare coverage during the last one of the major\nFlaws in organized labor Michael lady they got their health insurance they could have got it for the rest of our country if they had enough field organizers from their surplus funds give me a comment on that\nI Do think that we have to recognize Ralphie the you're right we've had historic moments Nineteen Ninety three which are speaking of where the F ... decided to endorse Hillary care instead of single payer and also there was a great effort to get behind ... character in the public option\nI Do think that they put organizers in the field on that effort to a greater level but essentially you're right because workers\nAre desperate for a different system and the only way to organize that is on a grassroots basis and put organizers out there we've been doing that we've been doing that through national nurses United but it's not sufficient and so what we found is that\nAt the base Medicare for all single payer is hugely popular I you've seen the polls right the the Reuters poll had Seventy percent overall eighty five percent among Democrats fifty two percent among Republicans and we know that workers who voted for Donald\nAnd a mobilization and maximum pressure on members of Congress and currently that's going on in some states there's door knocking going on we're trying to make Medicare for all essentially litmus test in twenty team make it the defining issue\nIn twenty twenty eighty five percent of Democrats supported and there's not a mobilization there's not a media narrative that reinforces it and the only alternative really to Medicare for all is going to be increasingly more costs on to workers and that kind of on your own healthcare system where you literally only get the healthcare you can afford\nAnd loss of life loss of limb loss of health\nWhen you can't afford healthcare the diagnosed and treated I don't think the heads of the Democratic party are fully on board for single payer and this coming election next month\nAre they really boring the don't no national coming are they still foot sea around and trying to repress the insurgency there's going on among progressive candidates around the country and the Democratic party\nI think you're you're on to it they are trying to stifle this I mean imagine Ralph a political party anywhere else in the world that doesn't pursue a program that eighty five\nPercent of its supporters want it's inconceivable and so here you see the gap between the base and the donors because the donor class of the Democrats are the ones who are invested in Wall Street who would be affected by the speculation tax\nThat could fund human need programs that will be affected by the roll back an insurance company profits and it's that class that we're up against represented by the Democratic leadership Chuck Schumer was horrified at the notion that Democrats would support the elimination of the private\nHealth insurance and yet it is literally killing people so this disconnect is becoming intolerable I think\nAn account that thinks that the Democrats are so relatively passive on this and then he can actually come out against full Medicare for all\nBy the way Robert Weissman regarded head of Public Citizen that's on the website citizen dot or gee if you want the robot will for our listeners who are going to flood the members of Congress I Hope with phone calls after this program Michael lady to increase their level of in patients historically\nIn effect full Medicare was proposed by Harry Truman the American Medical Association blocked in the Nineteen forties it was put forward tenuous lead by Lyndon Baines Johnson in the Nineteen sixties he backed away\nAnd just went for Medicare and partial Medicaid because of all the money event now more was costing the Vietnam War is reported to have cost millions of Vietnamese lives and about fifty five sixty thousand American lives\nBut it really cost a lot more American lives because by blocking full Medicare for all it blocked the way to save over forty five thousand American lives a year from the Nineteen sixties to the present day\nSo this has been going on a long time\nIt's ridiculous shows we're weak democracy we can flip this thing into humane full Medicare for a which by the way produces a lot better collective data on trends and perils than Fifteen hundred insurance companies with proprietary data managed to do\nThis can move very quickly\nIn Congress and once you get it in Congress overwhelmingly doesn't matter who is in the White House it's a a wave of humanity a wave of catching up to western countries who have universal health insurance or waved to catch up to Taiwan in Japan who have universal health insurance\nAnd everyone's got to do their part there's no such thing as oh I'm listening to this program it's interesting route\nMonths looking for your vote for members of Congress now in state legislative members to put the heat on Congress what do you recommend in terms of increasing the heat here Michael you know more about this buddy\nThink we've got to build organization Ralph and I think we've got to use that organization to build mass support and I actually think that it requires everything we can do but what it requires most is a strategic sense of really competing for power and be bold and make an aspirational affirmative\nDemand for guaranteed healthcare through Medicare for all that represents an alternative vision to what the Republicans represent or what the\nDonor class if corporate Democrats represent and if\nAnd I and I honestly believe that if we were able to build the presence in every congressional district as you've talked about\nIt is not a partisan issue we can move Republicans who represent working class folks we can move Democrats who wouldn't otherwise do this because it's not quote unquote safe and it's only through that popular mobilization and you know I've talked about as we there are small tactics we can do letters to the editor matter\nRight small group meetings that didn't build into a door to door canvas and that door to door campus recruits people to a town hall that tell stories about how inadequate the system is in those stories point to an alternative and then we build a bigger meaning that then is able to mobilize direct actions\nAnd members of Congress at their offices at the district level get into small medium market papers obviously we're building a story and a narrative about health care in social media I think we literally have to do it all but what is particularly frustrating is we've never seen the level of resource commitment\nEither from organized labor or nonprofit foundation for Medicare for all that we've seen for every other type of liberal reform right eighty million dollars to support the\nIs to hire organizers to put them on the ground\nAnd that is really the demand we've got to make on our institutions if you support single payer than actually put money and people behind it and if we had everyone who supports it actually working for you would change the political expectation that we can't win it and in fact this is a winnable issue it's a unifying issue\nIt brings people together because this is a public policy the effects in the most intimate way in our lives\nYou hear that listeners is this is a wonderful issue first of all you have\nThe single payer built spent in the house it's called HR six seven six\nYou're just supported by more than a hundred and twenty democratic representatives and outside it means a hundred and twenty congressional districts back home they're already on your side\nAnd you can get up to a hundred Ninety pretty quickly if you make this a big issue and can they start winning on this issue and then is off to the races once the way from the public wants the rumble from the public gets going it's unstoppable it's a situation where the people lead\nAnd the leaders follow go to citizen dot org you'll get information\nAbout how to organize on single parents Public Citizen citizen dot org last words before we conclude Michaeline\nThis can be a unifying issue this can bring working people together to define\nThe issue that is most affecting us every day we can actually use this as a model for making the decisions that determine our destiny and this demand needs to resonate and really people need to understand that\nIs is a popular program it works if we build a movement we were when it and we can break through power as you say on this question and open up possibilities\nThat right now seems so distant and I really urge folks to engage in this issue talk to your\nOver Seventy five percent of the people on your side a majority of doctors even\nAnd also accounts majority of nurse are on your side so what are your way for folks number on these corporations fast to get over thank you very much Michael ... of the California nurses sort of think you're out on a word\nFiles and what they call misstatements fabrications or outright false choice not to mention like to reproduce insults to individuals who cannot answer back because the press just covers his insults and not the ... by his victims of this herbal sparring\nSo really it's just more of the same and to be fair to Trump he is trying to open the door to North Korea which is a Republican and democratic presidents before him\nDidn't choose to do it doesn't mean it's gonna work but at least it lowered the level of these ... threats between North Korea's dictator in us member when Trump said I have my button on a much bigger number of nuclear missiles chairman Kim\nSo he is lowering the temperature on that for the time being but by and large you know more drones more special forces\nAre written in the papers the other day that special U.S forces went into over a hundred countries last year and I don't think all of them were legally invited by their respective governments around the world and the various continents\nSeymour Hersh was talking to a couple of months ago about all this stuff we're doing in Africa that nobody knows about\nYeah well that's still a bigger story yet to be disclosed in fact do you remember Seymour said he you might write his next book on this\nYeah we we got soldiers operatives in all kinds of African countries it's interesting that most of Africa was broken up and colonies by the French the British\nPortuguese and even the Germans and the nineteenth century and later and yet they're not is present in these former colonies were they still have you know business contacts and educational institutions religious institution\nThey do you take us back to Reagan and then go through age W and then Clinton and\nNo it isn't now that gets to be a little tedious when you do that it goes in and out\nIt has some interesting letters that I've sent to Bush and Obama it mixes it up so makes them more reasonable but that's generally the theme I might add I didn't do justice to Reagan in terms of his fabrications as mark rein did\nWhen he wrote his famous book Reagan's reign of error Reagan's reign of Arab by mark ... wonderful book\nShows how much Reagan got away with just\nBy smiling and shrug in his shoulders and with that nice voice ... yesterday ... grandpa\n[laughter] for some of the stuff in and mark ... book is just beyond hilarious\nWell and of course as we all know regular says no you are always offering a path forward not just lamenting the path\nSo they the second part of it this is one of the longest titled one of the books you've had which you know how Bush and Obama paved the way for the Trump presidency and how it's not too late to change course how is it not too late to change course\nAnd how does that relate to the fable you just wrote which we talked about a few weeks ago called how the rats reform to Congress\nWell not surprising to a lot of our listeners I start with the Congress the Congress is the fulcrum ... federal government and a lot of impact at the state and local level\nI mean that's where the appropriations authorizations were declaration clower confirmation of judges trainees ratified hearings on consumer protection healthcare minimum wage all English\nCan start with Congress and the nice thing about it is\nAround a lot of the executive branch certainly can determine public budgets deep float a bloated wasteful military budget as some retired generals and admirals have been calling for over the years\nThey can develop a huge jobs program in terms of public repair of our infrastructure schools and bridges and\nPublic transit sewage water system you know the same old list of our crumbling public economy services and so it gets back to one percent or less people getting together organizing Congress watchdog groups and you know I've done this in books and articles\nAnd I thought maybe I better use little humor so I did this ... book called how the rats were corn to Congress is actually quite timely 'cause there's a major rat infestations in Washington DC all over in the alleys just a\nMore and more complaints than ever before to the D.C authorities to do something about it\nAnd it is affecting Congress are coming up from the catacombs below the Congress which is almost ... science fiction in terms of fumes and the\nParticular it's in the pipes it's so dangerous they don't allow the senators and representatives to go down in an elevator so in this book the rats come up to the toilet bowl of the leaders of the house Republican Democrat creates huge embarrassment they try to cover it up a\nDemon Runyon type character a reporter sniffing around he gets a story you puts it out or all all over the country and the rest of the media gets into a frenzy trying to find out which bowls are being invested which members of Congress are running off the bowls\nAnd this develop such division against an already low in the polls Congress that\nInterest in members of Congress\nAnd they mobilize from the grassroots up surround the Congress with hundreds of thousands of people\nA little horns demanding change demanding the resignation three billionaires come into town and they say hey you know\nWe've got tons of money less helped fund these people so they don't go scratching with the tin cup to pay the expenses\nAnd it is on a drama or Wall Street masters get involved with the trade association people lobbyists and Washington are trying to block the trying to infiltrate the crowds with educators and\nThere's a lot of drama bizarre auto realism Steve\nRussia's could become a little movie it would be really fun right\nThere's too many Mickey Mouse movies let's have a real serious move\n[laughter] rats help change the country route you mentioned this before and I just want to ask you about ... you said the Congress has the tiniest brand small branches and what do you mean by that five hundred thirty five people there's only nine people report one person in the White House what how is it the tiny\nWell it's the tiniest compared to the executive branch there's no doubt the executive branch has over about two million people\nMilitary civil servant icy and it's smaller\nThe federal court you take the federal district court\nThe circuit court of appeals and the Supreme Court that budget is larger than the Congress and it's smaller and another way it's personal people know their names how many people know the names of the district court judges you know half the people don't know the names of their member of the house to be sure\nBut you know in an instant they can find their names and a lot of people do know the names of their two senators and representatives and why well you know district court judges don't go to ... they don't go to high school reunions and\nDozens with citizens own agenda so many them and this book by the way how the rats reform the Congress has summons where the citizens some and the senators and representatives to their own town meetings and their own agenda that was very very important tool of democracy\nThat I outlined in this book how the rats were harmed the Congress\nSo personal politics should interests people these senators representatives have their own stories their own virtues their own frailties they have\nKids or grandkids and they have their own friends back home\nAll these can be turned to the good in terms of making them accountable right now Steve Congress is a bubble in Washington in circles by the thousands of corporate lobbyists whining and dying\nAnd you can almost see a cartoon on that and the short way to describe Congress and its secrecy and its exclusionary attitudes toward the American people\nOther than asking them to vote they get their money elsewhere as you know the best way to describe it in a short number of words you know what is Congress is open for business but closed for democracy\nRoute now it seems like in the past couple of weeks with the ... the murder that apparently happened in the Turkish caught led by Saudi Arabia that some of Trump's own party in the Congress is finally pushing back against and how do you see that playing out\nI don't think that's going to have much stamina I think the elections Trump going through their districts attaching to the Trump or is going to prevail coming up next month everybody's got to go vote you know you don't like who's on the ballot right in your own name or say none of the ...", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city":
