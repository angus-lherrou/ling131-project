Seventeen here on radio equals shocked Dr William Erbil ripple from Oregon State\nUniversity explains a simple beginnings of the second scientist warning to humanity but\nWow that article that was published in the journal bio science it just blew up and it did ripple around the world didn't\nYeah yes it did um I Believe it holds a record for the number of scientists who signed a paper at publication\nAnd it's gone on from that Fifteen thousand plus to have an additional eight thousand or so so it's it's gotten a a very wide acknowledgement distribution ah it's\nUp opened a lot of eyes hopefully and hopefully we'll continue that's the work we're doing I was trying to continue to use it to open people's eyes\nAnd bill started a group called alliance of world scientists and I gather that you'd think hey this shouldn't be just scientist everybody in the world has to take part in this so tell us about your new project and website\nBut let me go back just to see how that got started when I ah another person familiar to you Paul back with\nA introduced me to the a typical rip on and what they were doing and and so I\nWrote on over wrote on over and asked bill if he would distribute to his mailing list or another initiative I was involved in or the the ... Nobel Peace prize and for the sustainable development field\nAnd um he did I I was a little bit surprised but they felt it was not fun\nThat there was a very important stakeholder left out of what they were doing and that is the public\n... public in terms of individuals and in terms of organizations\nAnd so I asked permission from bill and the steering committee that he has to be allowed to do a public oriented website called scientist's warning\nDot org I'm where we would basically invite the public to endorse the world scientist's warning to humanity second notice and thereby become part of a a what I was calling a global constituency for change and it's gone on from there\nAmerica has two or three TV channels devoted exclusively to Donald Trump and lately judge Kavanaugh\nAnd yet if I start asking people on the street I'm willing to bet you Stuart that most have not even heard that tens of thousands of scientists have warned them that the future is in extreme danger how does that work\nHow does that not work because the question um I today I'm In Washington DC and I spent the day on Capitol Hill and I came back from that a new kind of dejected state uh not despair quite but um\n[noise]\nI met with ... uh the senator from where I live in Hawaii Mazie Hirono I met with her this morning and [noise] when I she asked me while I was there and I told her I gave her the fire hose elevator pitch and raised her eyebrows some and then I\nCame back later in the day to meet with her aide who handles environmental issues\nAnd we basically he he basically school me and the reality of a lot\nVice president he realized it was a huge impact is between the maximum commanded by the science and the the minimum that could be achieved and the political arena and um there's no way that politics can approach the problem it's just the oh a\nMillion or enough with people who watch TV dead on arrival we are not that's the reason for my ... and we are not going to deal with this time\nAround until now I've been kind of reluctance to acknowledge that but at least the United states government\nIs not going to deal with it in time the only thing I can hold out is that a reality tends to move in non linear fashion and certain times there are jumps either jumps up or jumps down depending on your perspective\nAnd we may have some sort of jumped in the the panic level or the activism level of society when the full impact of the ecological stressors we've unleashed to come back to haunt us\nI generally agree with you in in both cases that were not acting in time that our best goal now is to search for a less bad future\nBut you know you're talking about Washington D. C. you know the inter governmental panel on climate change prepares a summary for national politicians attending conferences which may decide or future\nBut do British scientist save that report for national governments has been seriously watered down they make the world future appear less risky than we know it is so what do you expect to happen this December steward at the so called top twenty four in Poland\nI expect the can't be kicked down the road um a few years more I don't I don't really have a great X\nAnd then I gradually came to realize that they were ... political theater again the uh politicians don't want their feet held too close to the fire so they set up the rules so I think the scientists are sincere but I think they set up the rules are the best scientists can do is come up with\nWith watered down a results so I don't hold much faith in in what will happen the reason I continue to go\nIs because the work I Do which would require tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars of of equipment and a skilled personnel and making these climate matters TV programs is available for me for free just by showing up\nAnd so this year I'm going to be co branding the press conferences that I Do at the un climate talks and they will be both climate matters dots TV\nAnd scientists warning about TV and uh my point both to the same a YouTube channel and mix the programs up\nWhether they focus on climate more or less exclusively or whether we go to the wider group of ecological stressors that humanity has for swimming\nI Know that there are millions of people out there who don't understand the situation I think maybe we'll just have to accept a human planet to maybe we'll just live online or will replace those natural systems with technology and bioengineering or something\nThat I'm reality about how much we totally depend on things like coral reefs and and the Amazon and all the natural systems around us that seems to be the walls that we have two on build\nWell I'm ... yes that wall\nThe functioning of the system when a on the planet gets too hot to grow food reliably in the ... mid latitudes um the question then is how soon that will happen but what you're hinting at there is a huge divide\nThat happened increasingly somewhere along the line when we\nTook her ourselves out of nature out of interaction with the natural world\nAnd uh put ourselves in what I like to\nRepeat slowly apart mandates\nThat is we live in little boxes which set us apart they're not together ... they're not in neighborhoods they're apart and and so we were set apart from one another and set apart from the natural world\nAnd right now climate change is the most serious form of run out we are running out of the waste sink for carbon in the atmosphere uh most of the carbon goes into the oceans once we release it into the atmosphere and so we're ... to find the oceans which is leading to\nA collapse of ah the marine ecosystems the coral reefs of the world so it's a very complex problem and we ... we have not managed to educate a a generation of systems thinkers we\nEducate people who um are trained to uh take jobs to take their productive place in society so we are not a problem solving species of for the most part so that's Neal classical growth economics now environmental economics\nIs the neo classical economic view of the environment that is an environmental economics says if you couldn't put a price on the value of natural capital\nAnd if you can price the cost of distributing your waist and to the east coast here then everything will work itself out in the uh in the market this is untenable and I give the example that one year the Japanese government put a price\nOn the ecosystem services all their wetlands and came up with sixteen billion dollars ... some years ago now well how did they did for sale for sixteen billion dollars they would all be built out with hotels\nPotatoes decisions that need to be made I mean if you think of elephants last elephant on earth to his tusks will be worth an extraordinary amount of money [noise] so the market does not have the right signals to handle things like survival of species\nDestruction of ecosystems things have to be done qualitatively which means that governments have to step in and make laws and right now in the United states we have a government that is only in it for the money\nAnd not for the wellbeing of people are on nature\nAnd so they're dismantling the environmental laws last forty and fifty years\nThat's environmental economics ecological economics takes a different world view\nIt says you must recognize that the human economy exists within the biosphere drawing its resources on the biosphere distributing it gets wastes back into the ... year those things cannot be escaped\nAnd unless you take recognition of those limitations you've got a system that won't work so ecological economics is actually a a trans disciplinary field it's not simply a group of metrics that predict how\nThe market will react in various conditions of interest rates it say trans disciplinary field that includes psychology and ecology and purer forms of economic theory\nAnd for my money and whenever I say that I look at how it's invaded our language a money has been pages how we think and how we talk from my part ecological economics more something quick onto it is how we must go if we're going to survive\nSeeing more and more warnings from academic sense\nDropping and that has already been done in Europe steward you live in Hawaii maybe that's a good place to be considering how hard or expensive it is to get their\nE. S. but there's no place on earth is really going to be safe and and the kinds of things were headed towards in Hawaii we've got the problem especially the island I live on the main commercial island Oahu\nWhere we have a one point perhaps one or two million one point one one point two million people\nAnd we import Ninety five percent of our food so a dislocation in the shipping and the ... the shelves will go there and a couple of days I'm sort of know places really really safe [noise] [noise]\nThat gets me thinking of home and I'm three weeks into a trip that will spend three and a half months so you'll forgive me for a little bit of a home sickness [laughter]\nAnd yeah you are a father or how do your apocalyptic warnings play out in your own home I I mean I have to deal with this to my kids are I don't know if there's guard or or wall but uh they certainly know what climate changes because living with us\nYeah how old are your kids\nWell now they're adults they're like thirty five and\nThey all K well your kids may have lived through a similar experience to mine I have two sons\nAre one's twenty five hundred twenty seven and yes they lived within apocalyptic dad I mean I started off with Al Gore and and the his climate projects now climate reality project\nAnd and he tends to uh uh insist that you balance hope with hope with urgency in in all your presentations then I Move more towards the urgency because I felt the hope was somewhat in disingenuous that\nNo number of of electric vehicles or solar panels who's going to bail us out of a an economic system which is destroying the planet by its nature by its growth nature so my kids went and different\nLittle bit when when the topic comes up and it comes up all the time when I'm In conversations with strangers so I have to kind of watch what I say her around him or he will rolled his eyes and walk away from me he wants to have a normal life I\nHave a family buy a house of course buying a house in Boston presents a set of issues because Boston it's this city at sea level the other son stayed home and Hawaii he just wants to be left alone to enjoy his life\nBecause he really doesn't see much purpose in trying to pursue a career and I can't say that I fault him so he uh has taken it harder than his older brother\nAnd ah I just want him to be happy doing something being productive in his own life\nLearning what it means to to pay rent if he ever had to of course we live on a very small farm property so he just wants to take it over from me when I get too old or pass on and God Bless them you know I I Hope he can do it I Hope he skills himself so you can take care of the farm\nUp people can learn I learned at thirty really how to become a small time farmer and and survive doing it you know get into your new Web site at scientists warning dot org you offer resilience news and impact news briefly what's the difference and where does the news come from\nA kick thank you you've studied the website very very well there are actually three kinds of news we offer the first one is scientist's warning news and that comes from the lines of world scientists but they only posts news items rarely so it's that news is fairly static\nThe other two news feeds I picked up from a group called the environmental health network EH in dot org I Believe and I came to know them through something called the daily climate or daily climate dot\nEnvironmental health things you can't help you can't separate things off into just climate so they have stories occasionally about the ecological impacts in more general sense so those two news feeds come from them impacts is more of the the downside is more oh my God\nAnd a resilience is more what people communities are trying to do to adapt\nAnd to a shall we say a dodge the buck shot\nAt what do you want our listeners to do with your project\nLet me explain just a little bit before I give you that ask a tell me if we're running short of time we are okay well we are trying to get an ecological movement started environmental movement of the past fifty years\nAs far as I'm concerned did not do the trick it was not equal to the to the task of changing the direction of civilization we did not wake up\nThere were very limited successes those big green organizations are still collecting money and still trying to save the whales and et cetera but but they're not really change in policy and they don't even get that growth economics is the problem for the most part\nWe are trying to create a an ecological movement which sits out above not better than but above it's kind of out of the plane and we want those environmental organizations to join with us and message that all of these different\nIndividual environmental fragments of the problem are just part of a bigger hole so we ask people to come to scientists plural warning dot org\nAnd join become a member free membership that is just give us your email address you'll get an automatic email that says if you'd like to do more let us know we don't send out lots of the ...\nThe way we're co branding ourselves or kind of code describing what we're doing and if we can get a sufficient number of concerned citizens than we are hoping to move them in certain directions with what we are developing a wiki\nTens protections to dissipate what will be the future of change beautiful permafrost with the climate system in general we need computer models that updated on mathematical and physical rose to project the future for loosened up the system\nSo we have these models that's what I call the complex climate models so they are complex and the sense that they are actually resolved\nSo they're they're replacing the U.S as the greed of many many smaller as a cube depending on the model and they estimate that process happening in every single of those greed settles\nA with a very fine\nTemporal and special resolution but the problem the drawback of having the complex models although they are very precise models detailed models at least the drawback is that they require a lot of computing time so you can take months to a one simulation of such modeled on a super calculator\nBasically to be able to explore or all the possible futures\nWe need another kind of motherland this is the kind of mother that Scott is we need a emulate towards the ... get a bill to of reproducing the complex models results and uh then to\nInterpol eighth and extrapolate them to really investigate or the possible future even a so to do simulations that the complex models cannot do\nThat you know over the years top politicians met to discuss international climate goals\nThey always include the nicest budget of how much carbon we can still burn and stay below the supposedly safe warming levels of two degrees centigrade or even one point five degrees C\n... when they meet like that word\nI don't really know what I can tell you that in the last ... last night basis you report\nThis was included but maybe in just one bullet points but there was so much information in those reports and all that information has to be summarized in a a digestible away for policymakers that I can actually tell you whether the new enough\nOr what I can tell you is that we scientists you about the ... of the like then oh at least for the last I'd be this report we couldn't really quantify idea sect in terms of the ... of a remaining emissions\nRight your new scientist something to contribute to that now you're working with the international Institute for applied systems analysis\nAnd among many nations the Soviet Union was also a founding member of that ad that relationship continues now with Russia my question is did you have access to Russian data on permanent frost saw two Russian scientists or to their projections\nI did not directly use these kind of that so I said I basically integrated knowledge from ah the ... those models complex mother\nThere down based on a compilation of data of observation ... and I know for sure that ended that that there is well a lot coming from the Russian Federation\nNow we want your study results but they're not so simple Thomas why is there such a wide range of values to each emission pass away that you checked out\nThat many reasons like you said for the first one and then maybe in a sense of the most important is that this\nThe and the huge knowledge gap this is mostly because this is a slow process and in the recent past it did not happen so much\nSo we basically lack that are too for the on the train the models without good observations basically the mother of the uh west mess but that's not the only reason or\nAnother reason is that this concept of emission budget that is on much we can they made before reaching a given global temperature change although it seems very simple it is actually quite\nDifficult to estimate and now I Love the methodological uncertainties behind the simple concept\nSo part of the uncertainty is not because we don't know what's happening is because I Would say of the ... of the the concept itself\nSo if we take the low end of your projections than we include the perma frost loop that you study what is the best we can hope for\nI think the best case scenario is as you said are are they are that the process we be so slow that it really badly affect us in the coming century\nAll right and what about the worst of your projections that look like if the permafrost feedback really kicks in\nSwing the worst case I Would distinguish to suck case is actually\nSo the first one is that we do everything we can to actually meet the Paris Agreement targets but the permafrost feedback is quite strong and in this case we would what part of our efforts\nThe second that case is may be more interesting is in the San Juan dissent if ...\nIf we do not make that much effort and we really plan to do this over shoots and for instance the ... if we first to reach three degrees of warming but then we want to go back to one on five\n... really ... a lot of my four oh wing and then\nWe would that to more than ... to go back to this one on five so this is not only now you have you on that we uh we really are good for what now is to do is I think really the the key result yeah\nRadio equal shot\nYou are listening to the weekly based science program radio equals shock I'm Alex Smith from Austria my guest is Dr Thomas Gosar a research scientist for the international Institute for blood systems analysis and we're talking about going permanent frost\nHere on radio equal shot Dr Kevin Anderson from the u._k. Jindal's center warned that all the climate path was developed by the I. P. C. C. depend on a technology that does not exist now large scale carbon capture and storage\nDo you think that technology should be part of our plans to keep a livable climate\nWhat is the answer from the the scientist is that relying on this is risky but can make some sense in which case we should strongly increase our effort to actually develop the technology\nAnd the cities and believe that did from Vicky crazy\nAre we sure the permafrost song how do we know why don't we have\nGo with that and to observe it in the sense that local populations and life that they can see if we can see the the ground owing infrastructures that were previously they just don't fully grown are collapsing\nBut we also know from a more global perspective things to lock scandal ... flu flux money selling network for hours that I Do too well ups of the the flux of greenhouse gases that is released by this uh phone off off but also who are thought to like to meet you\nIs it possible to say how much carbon will be added to our atmosphere from thawing permafrost or does that all depend on how much carbon we humans keep adding to the atmosphere\nWe firstly depends on how much we will be adding\nWhen I'm reading your paper or talking with other sides of the talk goes to ... grams of carbon each pedigree and being a billion metric tons\nBut here in the public we're told ... parts per million as you'll do in the atmosphere is there an easy way to understand that relationship or to convert from one to the other\nOn the conversation is not straight forward this is because of what we called the common cycle someone\nAlbum and goes to the atmosphere it then enters the natural carbon cycle for instance thought of this ... is it kind of by the ocean so part of it is that you did in the ocean than transported around the globe\nBut also part of it is removed by the uh terrorists your biosphere\nSo to actually know how much in the end from one gram of ... you will add in terms of net effect to ... ... it's a necessary to account for these common cycle and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Middletown", "day": "11"}
