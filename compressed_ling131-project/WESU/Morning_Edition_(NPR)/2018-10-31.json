coming November sex voters will go to the polls to cast their ballots but they will also on that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity\nDid I hear that you've been taking online quiz is to figure out where you actually live in the eye\nBecause I don't\nKnow I I I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics all we talked a lot about politics\nKnow my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about you know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity [laughter] how did that take shape\nShort it was after the\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and immigration because I saw all the families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and\nAnd some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with I Wanna go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I thought is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me\nAnd believing that there's another solution that there's a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the rights that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more because I I had thought before that I've been listening and I I found out that I hadn't and\n[noise] I understand you also watch the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely identified how did those [noise]\nHow did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election it's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally is\nSomething that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um\nI Believe Dr Ford and I believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough evidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime\nSo I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know [noise]\nSo how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think with everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I\nI don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous I guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angers\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nThe first time despite President Trump correct and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic checked boxes I\nI Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a a Republican in the coming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nI has [laughter] than avoiding it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio and I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go which is that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is best for the job then you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus my optimism\nElectric ruin thank you so much for talking with us thank you and\n[noise] this\nIs NPR News It's MORNING EDITION on Ninety One point one

China that is impacting economic activity\nRachel Bachmann teachers trust and technology and the author of who can you trust\nShe says a lack of trust in people and businesses have helped China's

behave\nCompanies really big companies like Ali Baba that a Chinese version of Amazon Ali Baba owns one of the largest online payment systems in the country and has its own credit scoring system

think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't\nKnow [noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in the same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflakes said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I\nI don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous I guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\n[noise] so you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump\nCorrect and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on strictly party lines and\nWe've gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and that's coming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nI has [laughter] than of leading it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio and I I don't think that they would ever think leftist me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things in my case hey that so I just\nIt's it's taken

Martin with mass shootings happen in this country we often don't ever understand the motive that's not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people\nAnd to the to the climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten has to document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out took control of the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful enormously all\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros don't go to\nThe first thing is I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody [noise] back\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump has personally promoted as they did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest talking about they talk about the the lead you ever see the elite\nYou are the only [noise] her says when people are encouraged\nWe are prominent it whether it's Hollywood academia thanking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in law are Jewish and Herve is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people\nKnow so then what's the connection he wants\nTo win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that is the editor in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy than he is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they can find other people that share their views and urged them on and\nIt's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat and anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply\nOver the last two years

engaging they attract families\nAnd towards notes that pop ups aren't just holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nThey're using that pop up model store to test the waters so I think that the Halloween stories may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting
