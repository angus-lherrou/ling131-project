from a first round victory last night to supporters that we're celebrating apply to house in Rio de Janeiro as if he had one [noise]\n\nIn fact there will now be a run off so he has not won at this point at least we're joined now from Rio de Janeiro by NPR's Philip Reeves morning Phil\nMorning so how close was that it was quite close to it and he needed to get both of them they just get more than fifty percent of the valid votes in fact he go forty six point two percent that's much better than the polls have been saying on the remarkable performance given that he has no big policy behind and he had very little\nShould a political rally buddy ... how specially on social media and now he's not as strong position to go on them possibly win or isn't a strong position to win actually\nJust an amazing story I mean it not only will be campaigning from a hospital um doesn't have a party behind him as you say are really controversial figure rights of what the appeal here well\nThere's a tremendous amount David of public anger in Brazil people have lost the loss of faith in establishment politicians and this because of a massive corruption investigation which has exposed gr often offer ethics kale in the highest places yeah\nThe countryside is was to have a recession and it's come out of that but its economy is still stagnant this epidemic of violent crime\nAnd both of NATO who's actually being in Congress for more than a quarter century has done a good job of positioning himself as an outsider and he's kept in\nTo this hunger for something radically different and that was obvious when you talk to people outside his house celebrating last night I mean listen to sue to feel that she was sixty two at a speech therapist\nWhat I think that what I deal with the family is now in\nBrazil needs to change she says it's it's in the hands of corrupt politicians and people are unhappy\nAnd and what both in our did very well was channel that frustration and anger towards his chief opponents which is the workers' party which was in government and the most of the ... when the time when all this bad stuff is what's happening to people are being willing to overlook both an hour's records and the ...\nAnd racism and making homophobic remarks\nAnd also his oft expressed admiration for Brazil's past dictatorship [noise]\nSo what happens now that there's a run off and and

critique of the recent national prison strike\nA veteran activist says the strikes organizers failed to couldn't told local people on the ground or California prisons activists addresses the difference between prison abolition\nAnd prison reform and we'll talk to the offer rubber new book on how to be less stupid about race\nBut first Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to be the next justice of the U.S Supreme Court had a hard time during last week's Senate confirmation hearing\nOne of the many Americans so that was glued to the television was Kevin Alexander Gray\nThey activists and author from Columbia South Carolina gray says even when the subject of contention is women's rights ... tax and America is race\nWhoever the Republicans and conservatives put on the court is always about what the purpose\nAre worried about their survival of about having enough kids to maintain power and to maintain this idea of white supremacy that's what it's all about this what has always been about the control populations of the others as best you can while having enough people to assume power and to maintain power\nSo Kevin ... is the perfect example of the kind of judge that they want he comes out of federal society he talks about\nThis idea of settled law but there's no such thing as a law that was the case we'd all still being changed literally instead of bigger tip but the hearings exposed once again the hypocrisy of America the hypocrisy of the Republican Party\nThe Pacquiao see a white males who so a is to maintain white supremacy white male supremacy\nAnd of course the federalist society has had a lock on all the Republican nomination for a long time this is not a Trump phenomenon\n[noise] no I mean the federalist society has been around I Believe since Ronald Reagan nothing roost wrote a really excellent piece about how the judges have come up through the cover of society and to Republican Party ranks with through the ... a Republican Party political machine so as I said when you looked at the cabin now hearing that was totally partisan\nThe one I Can't call it a good thing but the one thing that really came out in the testimony of Dr Ford\nWas the idea that the Republican Party and a two Kavanaugh's testimony have have bred a group of lawyers to maintain power and to change the constitution and to change the course of this country\nOf course the federalist society most of its members may they believed in original intent of the original lean Jenny Jones the founding fathers on most of whom were slave\nIs is it is about the same issues that we have thought about since the origin of this country it's about white supremacy and maintaining white power that is to cut and dry up and you can't put that in\nSeven hundred and fifty words a thousand words the is it the nature of this country so when you got judges that are talking about\nOriginal intent you're talking about even going back and attacking the thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth amendment it's about the idea that African should never been citizens or had the right the Bodo women shouldn't advice to both\nSo no question unless people get organized and wake up\nAnd open their eyes as to what's going on in this country I mean the country has always had a government that protected white power at every level but for me it's about people paying attention to what's going on at the local level in these gubernatorial races because ... that's coming up and the way\nWe got into this mess is through Republican Party gerrymandering and to some degree the Republican Party cutting deals with black you elected officials so that you had more black elected officials in state legislatures but you have less power\nWell of course when it's actually working the federalist society pays a lot more of a change in to corporate law then Jew issues of original in change and it shouldn't jerk rotation of the law always come down on the side of the property holder\nAmerica is based on this idea of property rights so even when you argue when slavery was argued was argued on the basis of property rights people as property workers as property that property in and of itself has constitutional rights that the whole idea\nOf cooperatives in capitalism and workers' rights and to some degree socialism is always about the people versus the powerful\nThe Democrats are also talked about their fear that the new Supreme Court justice will give even more power to a president\nBut the Democrats in Congress and in fact been he'd be more powers on President even as they excoriated the president that's in office [noise]\nWell that's the central problem with all of it you have people in Congress people running for office who will protect the expansion of presidential power because they hope one day to have it it's like when people ask why there's so many people fight in the civil war\nWell there are people that one day I Hope that they would have legs\nSo they fought to defend their privilege or they're stolen privilege if that's the word we can use\nTo own other people the idea of protecting the rights of the wealthy and you see a lot of people vote against their interests they vote in the interest of the corporations because somewhere deep down inside they think that one day they may be a millionaire so they're defending something that they may never see\nThat was an actor Kevin alec hand air gray state get it from Columbia South Carolina\nOne guy's a is an activist tend to charity based in Greenville South Carolina where she

either inside or outside the prison walls\nThe focus of the free South Carolina movement organizing has been on truths building community building as it has been for a number of years and it has

been supported at some level in some way by the community but now the community is coming out publicly and not only continuing that support but also talented the necessity of it\nWhy does the state of South Carolina cough or Nineteen billion dollars\nAbove and beyond its regular budget and at the same time plan to use that Ninety million dollars to further militarized the prisons with cell phones jamming equipment\nNine hundred thousand dollars a year for subscription services to Janet by companies like ATM fee for rise and putting up golf netting at fifty thousand dollars per prison which is that Gulf netting scam has already been defeated the threat\nHaving said both the Mississippi and Tennessee all ready for thankful to do video conferencing video visitation both in and out of the state at the expense of the families\nThey have become so burdensome that folk will no longer tolerate though\nThat was good for you one ... of the ... century for snow determination in Greenville South Carolina\nRole Marilyn Rustin spent twenty three years that some inmates at the California prison system she's now the program coordinator project ... down at the state university at full or ten\nAnd serves as policy coordinator for the California coalition for women prisoners it seems that Ralston has been on a mission since the moment she set foot outside the prison walls\nWhile I was on a mission prior to being released\nI was on a mission from the time I entered prison\nOr basically what from county jail I started working on ways in which I could understand the criminal justice system\nUnderstand social justice my place in my party and what had happened that landed me in prison serving a life sentence and how I could could help other people around me then break down the system and and push back against so many people being relegated indicate the so\nUnderstanding mass incarceration and doing all that can to support folks who are serving time was was my mission from day one\nI'm sure that you often around questions about prison reform Bruce risen abolition\nYou know there's a a fine line between the\nOh good than abolition and how we can abolish presents within our society and we can't think about abolishing prisons in this society without doing the work of those who have been directly impacted now\nAnd who are living in those cages now so both of those things need to work in concert with one another I Believe\nSo prison reform\nIs for me about\nAll that we can to address the conditions of those who would disenfranchise now while they're serving sentences whether it's working out on the voter restoration or conditions of prison addressing reentry\nYou know providing work training and education for those inside and also figuring out ways to push policy across the lines of\nPrison reform and sentencing reform and those sorts of things and at the same time the abolition is working on ways to\nDo away with the prison system working on mental health issues in ways that\nOther people who may commit crimes inadvertently because they have mental illness so they are living in abject poverty ... conditions trauma\nAnd so they crossed those blurred lines because we don't understand the laws and our community and some people over police because of gender race and class that we think about ways to to abolish presidents and incarceration at the same time so\nThat's just kind of where I sit I kind of sit in the middle of that I work towards prison abolition as well as working on reforms to through policy through creating better conditions for those inside through visiting working with\nGrassroots organizations that advocate for prisoners rights\nTo prove that you may June for you but do you think\nOr who have been enough to say about [noise] you don't go to the population that is most targeted for improvements that is black and brown people\nI think that now and in two thousand Eighteen there's been enough movement work done where the largest society a mainstream society is starting to take notice that\nFolks who are incarcerated or who have served time of who've had any kind of justice involvement have stories\nThat needs to be heard about the punishment system that we have in America\nAnd what has led to mass incarceration and over representation of black and brown people in cages across this country I think we're because of organizations like just leadership usa initiate justice California coalition for women prisoners higher education programs like private rebound\nUnderground scholars and many many more\nOrganizations who have been around for decades all of us in on\nA new way of life or into program in Los Angeles\nI'm we're starting to do work in areas where we've we've come out of the streets and now we're in the capitals and we're talking their legislators and we're talking to throw in the fish and people who have money in power are now here in our stories\nAnd started to hire us than incorporate us into their mission and so we're not forgotten population anymore we're moving to the table of some very important conversations and so we're changing the narrative and shifting the way that people\nThink about mass incarceration those who have served time but we're still fighting against a huge machine called mass media that continues to pick people like me who have been incarcerated or people who are still incarcerated\nBut um we're in it's all in it\nWe just saw the end do they prove you write about in a number of these across the country and of course they did everything you could do muscle the boys' room in the world\nThat is true it's hard for incarcerated people to get their voices\nHeard inside the prison so\nTo have information coming out of the prison into the free world is it's very difficult because prisons are isolated area what goes on in prisons as opposed to stay in prisons and that have been the problem for centuries\nAnd so now that light ... they'll they'll the light is mean shine on prison conditions on what's happening to incarcerate and formerly incarcerated people\nAnd the rest of the ration of those rights are being pushed by organizations on the ground and legislation\nUm we're we're starting to see things change and so the the prison strike was able to to gain some ground because they've got some media attention which is really fabulous but still because of the policies and practices\nOr prisons and jails and the surveillance and monitoring that goes on to people inside those places and spaces it's hard to get the word out\nSo we don't really know what happens we don't really know what we know a small\nPortion of those things because of of people who survived that captivity were able to explain more to the general public of what happens in those places and so now through\nAccess do visiting do or access to telephone calls and and writing letters and and more organizations being approved to go inside\nPrisons and jails across the country we're able to have face to face conversations with\nThrough that advocacy but yes prison officials normally a typically wants to keep those spaces hidden from the public we have to continue to push and push and push and make sure that the public has access to those spaces because it is our public dollars that paid the salaries\nOut there in our stories out there to to pick that set of humanizing way because we are your neighbors we do ride the bus with you we fly on planes with you we serve your food you serve food to last and yet we're not being treated with dignity and respect that we deserve\nOur tax dollars come out of our checks every week just like everyone else and yet in many states we don't have the right to vote it's wrong and it's time for this country supposedly the greatest country in the world to start doing right by its most vulnerable citizens\nThat was California prison activists Marilyn and\nYou're listening to W E s few Middletown eighty eight point one found it doesn't ...

Bush you know I was in college when nine eleven happened I didn't have all of the\nHistorical context and the political literacy to understand what was happening at that time but I knew you know even at Eighteen Nineteen years old I could tell that you know there was a lot of lying coming from our government I could tell that there was a lot of myths representations and the media\nAnd a march to war in a way that was against my values even at Eighteen or Nineteen years old\nBut what I also saw was that with the Democrat became president who had you know campaigned on\nSupposedly wanting to end all wars I saw that we then got involved in at least eight wars led by someone who had won the Nobel Peace prize and I saw the hypocrisy and it and it it really you know just really drove me to a level of outrage with without politics\nThat for me but I don't understand is how people can have lived through many more election cycle than I have and really seen this part isn't pretending to care about issues and then going back to not carrying with their parties in charge I don't understand how people live with themselves and sleep at night\nWith this really agree just morally repugnant\nA level of ... so whether it's the title a how to be stupid about race or whether it's just you know what I Hope that comes to the page which is just you know however you feel about not just think about how I feel about these issues I really hope again to\nBe writing about this stuff in a way that you know to just get more\nOr be reused subjects they're not funny but you said that you want to be good if you learn from your book so don't work before the storm\nOh well I don't know about a funny story but let me say this what I mean by you know being able to laugh about it\nI Do think that is one of the unique things about my book I Do we've together a very serious treatment of these subjects but also\nWith that time a sense of satire reflections that also involved in my own experiences and and laughing about my own racial ignorance and political ignorance but also I Know being black\nHad grow weed up not only in the black church which is my family it would be completely preposterous to pretend to so\nBeing able to laugh even in the midst of our outrage and suffering is not a core part the black political tradition so you know for me I think it's important at least in the way that I treat these issues whether it's in my teaching as an agitator or in my writing\nTo bring the full range of human emotions that I'm not going to pretend to so I go to her every hour of the day renting my clothes\nOr you know just bowling over an outrage I have to\nLash eat or when I'm Crying about some of these issues I have to maintain my sense of humor and at point whether you're reading headlines or you're just hearing the absurdities you know that are spelled it from our political leadership or just from everyday\nFolks in the street I have to laugh because it's just overwhelming how ridiculous how hypocritical\nAnd how absurd statements about our country get wrapped up as respectable or [laughter] or accurate it'd be just the prevalence of Trump talks about fake news and the liberal you know so called liberal media talk about fake news", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Middletown", "day": "08"}
