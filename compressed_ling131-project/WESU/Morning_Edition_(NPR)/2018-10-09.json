national police are in twenty sixteen he became the first Chinese had of Interpol and there's no election was a big victory for China's government which under leader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate and extradite Chinese officials at it deemed corrupt\nYeah they investigating him for\n[noise] what China's government has been released any details besides that he's under

arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by in a mood to even nights to just in that he was in danger\nA week later she reported

government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with lung is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over

minister of public security bureau which is China's national police are in twenty sixteen he became the first Chinese had of Interpol and there's no election was a big victory for China's government which under\nLeader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate an extra day Chinese officials that it deemed corrupt would have skates China\nAs it turns out among himself is now under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption what\nExactly are they investigating him for\n[noise] what kind of government hasn't released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how is the attention unfolded has come from his wife greats among on September twenty fifth\nThe day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by in a mood to even nights suggesting that he was in danger\nA week later she reported him missing to French police on Sunday she spoke to reporters and they own France were in trouble is headquartered in here's what she said\nWe had to go into any idea what I'm thinking I'm half of my father they won't let you know the emphasis on on my mother for all the wide\nAnd children's husband and father so that they may no longer just at the air\nAnd as you can hear in that tape now while she's crying during this part of the video with their back turned to the camera because she's received threats and his under protection by French police well when\nHe talks about the husbands and fathers who disappeared in China what do you mean\nWell she's talking about the government's anti corruption campaign was launched by getting paying immediately after he took office in twenty Thirteen and it neared hundreds of thousands of official both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party\nIn fact the man who appointed among home way to vice minister of public security was Julian Kong highest ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this camp\nBefore he was sent to prison for life and twenty Fifteen\nRob by removing money from the presidency of Interpol time loses a lot of sway within that organization that much is clear what I mean for Interpol well even before\nThis happened trying to use of Interpol under amongst presidents he was starting to raise some red flags earlier this year China attempted to issue a red notice that it's an international alert for wanted person\nFor an exile weaker activists readers are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with lung is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over into international organizations\nReally interesting stuff NPR's Rob Schmitz joined us from Shanghai thanks Rob thanks do\n\nAcross the United states more criminal courts are turning to video proceedings says in an effort to save time and money that that happened some public defenders and others in the criminal justice system are questioning whether the rights of those accused are being affected by this technology from Illinois newsroom in Urbana league games reports\nToday like most days thousands of defendants will show up in criminal court for their first appearance in front of a judge it's likely that more than half of those appearances will not be in a courtroom in person then the defendant will instead face a video camera from inside a jail\nSheriff Jeff standard likes that system he's in Lewis ten and rural west central Illinois he demonstrates what his deputies used to have to deal\nThey would have shackles on their steps are going to be half of what we're taking and they're\nVideo system they now use freeze up more of his officers for patrol and he argues that the convenience of the system is better for everyone\nSo we can take them to put it in front of the video camera the judge has access to the video camera or our conversation just like we are now is just over a video screen\nBut Charles Davis and said it's just not the same David then is sixty eight years old and a recovering heroin user who was in and out of jail and prison in Illinois for over two decades he finds the video processed both off putting and demeaning\nWhen I first went to the radio court it just blew 'em up because I was in a row to get up and go in front of the screw studios or a nose or you know you couldn't thirty to\nDavidson said when you're in the same room at the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them and he's noticed there's a greater chance they'll listen to what you have to say he said the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nA shortage blow to the judge what happened and they told me to record\nSoon after Davidson was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison\nLawyer Rosalie Joyce said she hears stories like David sends all the time she's with the national legal aid and defender association and says the increasing use of video court has some defense attorneys concerned that alienates the accused from those deciding their fate\nEven before the proceedings began you already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling a little bit from the process you are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction\nAnd as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom for my client\nUnless my clients and shoulder to shoulder to me\nPrivate communication between attorneys and clients more public on the prosecution's side many defend video court for its cost savings and efficiency while acknowledging that some of those advocating for the kids say it's a tradeoff that's unfair to defendants\nFor NPR News I'm regained in Urbana, Illinois

[noise] as\nThe sad part is that [noise] everybody on the first ... so we really don't know the truth about food thrills loses\nHurricane Sandy failed into New York city\nThis was all flooded the cause of the cause of voting solve the boardwalk was on the street\n... is a narrow strip of land line along the coast south of Brooklyn it would hit especially hard by the storm and because it's so removed from the rest of the city official rescue efforts were dangerously delayed\nYes the street was covered with a ... percent garbage everything's exploded right there on the boardwalk was destroyed\nScissors really is hard for you know some of it you don't even want to remember [noise]\nBorn in the fifties still working class immigrant family with ten children down dropped out of school pretty early on in the construction work at first but later in his twenties he got caught up in some illegal activities jewelry store robberies bank robberies that sort of thing which ended up lending them in prison with a Fifteen year sentence\nBut in an interesting twist natural life began to transform for the better\nSo because I was in this so I turned it into so like a milk when I look back on it was like a time for me to really indulge your books on this day in politics or understand life in the same way self really was a good time for me to understand my show\nFrom where I fit in in the planet and getting ready for when I got up\nSo fast forward about Thirty years to early two thousand eleven it's a year and a half before Sandy hit and south and out of prison for a while now he's been working to open a center in Rockaway Park to train residents in trade like solar installation\nGoal was workforce development on training center cars that show like this area was an opportunity to teach people that don't have degrees teach people that don't have academic background how to get into mainstream hunting again can mainstream very simple you learn a trade so that was my goal\nWas around New York city around the whole country for that matter but I live in New York\nSo you can go into certain areas and you actually see but just as you see a woman trying to get money should go buy diapers for her child she's a woman trying to get money so you could buy food for her child step disaster were living in a disaster\nArea these people are in isolated areas\nWhatever the causes that got him to that point that's worth that and I saw that here in Rockaway and I felt like I could make a big difference\nSouth port all of his time and energy into getting a center up and running he was paying rent getting supplies building wall you know all that kind of stuff it took a lot of work but after about a year and a half of crap he finally got the center open he was even able to run a seminar too for a couple of weeks and then Sandy hit\nBefore it hit I wasn't that concerned\nI thought it was just another storm coming me and a friend of mine went up to the beach and would you started collecting than making sandbags were already one block away from the ocean but someone I sure storage shelf and felt that I knew that we have the guy\nWas just a really dark dark or the wind was like a grow the ocean was ... it was it was devastating\nOff south could do was to put up some sandbags board the plane up and hope for the best but when he came back the following day it was obvious that it's Africa had been in pain\nMy officers just a total wreck totally touring rock show\nWas I'm sitting here looking at the I just finished took me almost two years out of my own pocket you know if you don't share in there to get to play off\nI didn't know what to do was I was my friend said to me dollars just got to give it up and did your best and that's it and as I Am pondering and praying [noise] I was like\n[noise]\nAnd they were from Occupy Wall street so we don't do a occupy Sandy and from that moment on people just showed off you go to the office job got everything on the street and started putting up tables who started serving breakfast for the big side of\nTrucks just started showing up with supplies and used to play the ... to ... people to talk of the school it was in this office\nTower was suddenly thrown into something much larger than he could have ever imagined\nAlmost overnight his base was transformed into relief housing community service center which became known as ...\nIn fact a lot of the time disaster recovery can be aimed at simply restoring the status quo as quickly as possible or worst at taking advantage of shock communities in order to advance and unpopular agenda\nBut an area like the Rockaways the status quo wasn't working for most people\nSo instead of limiting their efforts to getting the existing social order back into gear Terry and the folks that occupies solve the disaster as an opportunity to let the light shining through the cracks that existed in the Rockaways far before Sandy ever hit the peninsula\nThey wanted to harness all the energy created after the disaster in a way that could empower the community and leave them in a better position to not just recover from the hurricane but to actually start addressing the broader social and economic challenges they experienced on a daily basis\nThe first step and empowering communities well it might just getting to know your neighbors\n\n\nMy name is Dennis long [noise] and I'm the or the ... going to church\nLocated in the neighborhood adjacent to you on a pastor lungs church was completely flooded when Sandy hit he lost almost everything but just like with bells nonprofit\nTeam in um inquire of me water this time we're going to church and the box with the dining room and they begin to\nSee what was the appropriate here they come to help the recovery and throw 'em they made me an offer that I couldn't er issues that can reuse your facility we are not\nA big organized issued money but if you use your ... your dilemma ice hallelujah thank you and they were\nKind enough to do all I'm more than I expected they were the ones who literally refer mission the older worker and give it back up and running\nTowards the hardship that sometimes you wonder why people go to the health ordered\nWas the right to see for yourself the um order to give up them so liberally give up some of the get older people back in their homes\nDennis bonk someone that we worked with a lot in the ... section of the Rockaways and now he's a really good example of someone who has church destroyed yet to Homs that we're above destroyed and saw the destruction of\nLots of his congregation towns and town she\nAlso has started interacting I think a lot of people in the community he hadn't necessarily interacted with before in part because the Rockaways as a\nPretty segregated place and so if you travel down the peninsula that you can see that there's one area of the rock layers that actually I think\nMay have the highest density of public housing in Queens and then there's two gated community is on the peninsula right and so people are segregated and a number of land and maybe haven't really interacted much before and seeing people trends than that\nThis is like when I walked in he has a coffee for\n[laughter]\nWe met up with pastor ... style at Harvard pilgrim church they were hanging out just talking about the days and weeks after Sandy hit we had\nLot of really good meetings yeah as soon as right or even did a play what am I the LA Riots of actors came in and they look a little play right\nYeah it was it you know what it was it was really needed because people a lot of pain and suffering and struggling and frustration and then they could stop from you know and just enjoy each other\nYou know each other before the storm\nNo no no we we we met each other during the strongest to undo it altogether I'm just going\nReally did you Nineteen I'm breaking coming to power you know because most of them are living on um\nOpinion\nWe knew that the other person who has Lou Grant green on the other side of the ... they had no need for this one on the honeymoon no need for the other women don't game everybody opinion or just the appeal of liquor would turn\nGray for believe really recognize that there are lots of people that have all different types of east to ah to the store and it will not just the only the financial loss or the property law it was it a week in the community to what is going on\nInside than what we have a um neighbors a flip that true\nWe asked Terry if she had any advice to impart after
