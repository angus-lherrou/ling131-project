the Supreme Court nominees still in the news it's hard for a lot of us\nTo get last week's hearing out of our minds author Rebecca Traister keeps thinking about how differently the tone was of the two witnesses\nDr Blass before it was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me any impact citizens had on my life and I my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his own\nBehalf of his number one in the class I thought well no no no no no I'm going to go out there so\nI'm going to borrow more I don't know I'm sure I'm going to talk about my high school record in Studio ...\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still come off as credible he had in his arsenal the ability to use anger\nYuri tears\nA way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people [noise] I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone\nYeah well and be furious in her retelling of what happened to her tracer has been exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThat moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen election anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger\nAt some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really just missing a lot of quarters as being about the pain cats the put the hat you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not\nJust running for school board down the road but this week and of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office and historic numbers and then meet you\n[noise] you lean into history in the book and it's full of examples of men anger\nBeing laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically was so threatening about women think well in part\nThat anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protest it in ...\nBe codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out our condemned it in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outside penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment\nThink it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long when in fact it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading thinkers of so many of our social movements in ways that have remained invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment\nStems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces in Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of the men did the idea\nThat sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class\nAt Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience of the reality of the harm they stand but in fact all of that is for grounded by women of color\nRevolutionary power of women to anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years although\nWe have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that the the character assassination by the left those women think are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time\nAnd that kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around calving off is going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend it into our future [noise]\nRituals folk there with Rebecca Traister of the author of good in math the revolutionary tower of women's anger which

found a way to attack high health insurance prices and that's news because it's hard for any one person to do if you go\nTheir price and that system Marshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs and he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall\nGood morning Steve who's this woman we're talking about sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan and twenty fourteen\nAnd when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families that plan was in deep trouble it's self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go broke\nSo the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you exactly\nAnd if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us\nWho get our health care benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care and so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Maryland Bartlett do differently\nShe had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a math nerd who knew how to follow the money\nAnd so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid each hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare published as its prices and so she could see\nThat her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets\nPaid while and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge was to get things under control\nAs she decided to set her own prices and stuff the plans prices\nNow in this case you have some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because of the healthcare industry really does need our money so she said look you hospitals that are at five times the Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape I Wonder if hospitals\nSimply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital that would just say listen our prices are price it took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high price hospitals\nShe called in the union to campaign against the hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign state wide they spent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders\nAnd eventually all the hospital dined on and the plans saved about a million dollars a month just from the reduced hospital prices\nIs there a lesson here for employers of all sizes that if they put in that time they can get the leverage to hold down what is paid for hospitals and other medical costs\nMarilyn was pay absolutely yes her message really to employers is you need to push back you need to read the fine print in your contract\nYou need to demand to know where the money is going and why the costs are so high get an itemized explanation for all of the expenses and when you do that you know you may need to smaller employers may need to join together with other small employers to increase their leverage\nBut they can bring down the prices Marshall Allen of ProPublica thanks very much thanks so much Steve this is NPR\nNews It's MORNING EDITION on Ninety One point one W s age

still come off as credible\nHe had in his arsenal the ability to use anger Yuri tears\nIn a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people [noise] I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which you would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that same tool that she couldn't yell and be curious in her retelling of what happened to her\nThere's been exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women thinker\nIn election anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious and it was really just missing a lot of quarters as being about the cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together\nAnd there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road but this week\nAnd of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers and then\nMeet you [noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger\nBeing laudable creating admirable political changed the Boston Tea party is a great example [noise] what historically was so threatening about women think well in part\nThat anger of the founding our founders to where the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protested in ways that we understand correctly to the to this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government\nSo they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women [noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too\nUh under many circumstances but there is an outside penalty for women of color who do though\nI Do you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment\nI think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color who has been the leaders and the leading fingers have so many of our social movements in ways that have remained invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost [laughter]\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment\nDamage from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces in Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea\nSexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter] it's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of a racist\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise] that's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years although we have to say there are plenty of women who support Calvin\nIf it's done in the service to a progressive part of that China not at all it is very often politically ... and yet we're told not to take it seriously ill\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social events take a long time and that kind of anger that women are failing in this moment around Kavanaugh\nIs going to be part of a far longer story that's

also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's a computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in a raft and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of veneer of objective science attorney rifling says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIt's a pretty well documented fact the police stop search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people\nAnd that the courts treat people of color and treat poor people worse or the various factors that they use risk

to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges your insurer\nWhich passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system Marshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs and he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall good morning Steve who's this woman or\nBenefit plan in twenty fourteen and when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families that plan was in deep trouble it's self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go broke\nSo the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you\nExactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us\nWho get our healthcare benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care and so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Maryland Bartlett do differently\nShe had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a math narrative knew how to follow the money\nAnd so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid each hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare published as its prices and so she could see\nThat her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets paid\nWhile and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge list to get things under control and so she had to do some really hardball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea in the health care world as she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case you have some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because the healthcare industry really does need our money so she said look you hospitals that are five times the medical\nSimply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals\nThere surely would be a hospital that would just say listen our prices are price it took them hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high price hospitals\nShe called in the union to campaign against the hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign statewide they spent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders\nAnd eventually all the hospitals signed on and the plans have about a million dollars a month just from the reduced hospital prices\nIs there a lesson here for employers of all sizes that if they put in that time they can get the leverage to hold down what is paid for a hospital and other medical costs\nMaryland was pay absolutely yes her message really to employers is you need to push back you need to read the fine print in your contracts you need to demand to know where the money is going and why the costs are so high and get an itemized explanation for all of the expenses and when you do\nThat you know you may need to smaller employers may need to join together with other small employers to increase their leverage but they can bring down the prices [noise] Marshall Allen at ProPublica

they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S will be able to enforce the new labor provisions with Mexico\nBecause if you don't have real effective enforcement then you don't have anything changing\nLori Wallach agrees she's director of global trade watch a consumer advocacy group she says ultimately support for the deal will depend a lot on details that have yet to be decided\nUnless strong labor and environmental standards are subject\nThe fact that this deal would eliminate rules permitting companies operating in foreign countries to do the host government which Wallack says allows them to circumvent local labor and environmental laws\nThere are elements of the proposal Wallach decried for example the new deal allows a longer term on pharmaceutical patents delaying the introduction of cheaper generic\nDrugs that could undermine the changes needed in our country to make medicine more affordable here\nBut it's the auto industry that would be the most affected by the deal it would require automakers to boost the percentage of parts made in North America to Seventy five percent in order to avoid terrorists\nHad bound as a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics says such new requirements would have ripple effects\nOr some parts to that now have to be made with workers that are earning higher wages and that just means that the cost for automobiles in North America are likely going to go up\nThe big three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules that down says it makes us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia you're building a

myself really was a good time for me to understand myself\nFrom where I fit in in the planet and getting ready for when I got up\nSo fast forward about Thirty years to early two thousand eleven it's a year and a half before Sandy hit and south and out of prison for a while now he's been working to open a center in Rockaway Park to train residents in trade like solar installation\nGoal was workforce development on training center cars that show like this area was an opportunity to teach people that don't have degrees teach people that don't have academic background how to get into mainstream hunting get into mainstream very simple you learn a trade so that was my goal\nI sort of Rockaway and a\nDisasters room\nThere's a lot of disasters zones around New York city around the whole country for that matter but I live in New York so you can go into certain areas and you're actually the best you be a woman trying to get money so she could buy diapers for her child sees\nAre in isolated areas whatever the causes that got him to that point that's where it's that and I saw that here in Rockaway and I felt like I can make a big difference\nSouth port all of his time and energy into getting the center up and running he was paying rent getting supplies building wall you know all that kind of stuff it took a lot of work but after about a year and a half of ... he finally got the center open he wasn't even able to run a seminar too for a couple of weeks and then Sandy hit\nBefore it hit I wasn't that concerned\nI thought it was just another storm coming to me and a friend of mine went up to the beach and we just started collecting stand making sandbags we're only one block away from the ocean but someone I sure storage shelf and felt that I knew that we have any idea\nWas just a really dark dark stuck with the wind was like a grow the ocean was ... it was it was devastating\nOff cell could do was to put up some sandbags for the place up and hope for the best but when he came back the following day it was obvious that his efforts had been in pain\nMy office was just a total wreck totally touring rock\nShow was I'm sitting here looking at the I just finished took me almost two years out of my own pocket you know if you don't share in there to get to play off I didn't know what to do was I was my friend said Mitch dollars has got to give it up and did your best and that's it and\nSays I'm pondering imprinting I was like oh my God what am I going to a bunch of young guys come in and they were like we want to use this as a home [noise]\n\nAnd they were from Occupy Wall street so we dumped it occupies Sandy and from that moment on people just showed off you go to the office out got everything\nSo to show up with supplies and used to play the two of the ... people to talk of the school it was in this office\nTower would suddenly thrown into something much larger than he could have ever imagined almost overnight his face was transformed into elite housing community service center which became known as ...\nWhich stands for you are never alone [noise]\nFortunately this kind of thing wasn't unique dozens of similar hobbies began to pop up heavily hit areas in a spontaneous phenomenon I became known as occupy fan\nBut an area like the Rockaways the status quo wasn't working for most people\nSo instead of limiting their efforts to getting the existing social order back into gear Terry and the folks that occupy style the disaster as an opportunity to let the light shining through the cracks that existed in the Rockaways far before Sandy ever hit the peninsula\nThey wanted to harness all the energy created after the disaster in a way that could empower the community and leave them in a better position to not just recover from the hurricane but to actually start addressing the broader social and economic challenges they experienced on a daily basis\nThe first step and empowering communities well it might just be getting to know your neighbors\n\n\nMy name is Dennis long [noise] and then in the past or the ... church\nLocated in the neighborhood adjacent to you on a pastor lungs church was completely flooded when Sandy hit he lost almost everything but just like without nonprofit there was a silver lining\nTerri Bennett about the turtle for the after the bomb they came in and I'm In choir me what it is um the expanding the church and the spot you're dining room and they begin to see what was the perfect here they come to help the recovery\nWe are not a big organized issued money but if you use your ... your drew dealer nice hallelujah thank you and they were\nKind enough to do all I'm more than I expected they were the ones who literally root for Bush and the older worker and give it back up and running\nFor hardship that sometimes you wonder why people go to the health ordered it was the right to see for yourself the um order to give up themselves liberal to give up to them to get\nOlder people back into your home\nPastor Dennis bonk with someone that we worked with a lot in the ... section of the Rockaways and so he's a really good example of someone who has church destroyed yet to Homs that we're both destroyed and saw the destruction of\nLots of his congregation towns and so she\nAlso started interacting I think with a lot of people in the community he hadn't necessarily interacted with before in part because the Rockaways as a\nPretty segregated place and so if you travel down the peninsula that you can see that there is one area of the Rockaways that actually I think may have the highest density of public housing in Queens and then there's two gated community is on the peninsula right and so\nPeople are segregated and a number of ways and maybe haven't really interacted much before and seeing people transcend that\nI think it was really important and I think that that's also not uncommon after disaster\nHowever I told them this is what will I Will feel the cold for [noise]\n\nWe met up with pastor lock in south at Harvard pilgrim church they were hanging out just talking about the days and weeks after Sandy hit\n... right yeah it was you know what it was it was really needed because people a lot of pain and suffering and struggling and frustration and then they could stop from you know and just enjoy your show did you know each other before the storm\nNo no no we we we met each other during the stronger those who are doing altogether\nI'm just going\nReally did you live in a break and come into power you know because most of her living on um\nOpinion we knew that the other person who has do grass green on the other side of the ... they have no need for this one on a honeymoon no need for the auto women don't game every movie opinion and just didn't

can to communities to what is\nGoing on inside than what we have a um neighbors in uh Florida true\nWe ask Teri if she had any advice to impart after experience with occupy\nSandy I Do think that there are some things that you can do to make yourself and maybe people\nCloser to you at least in proximity more prepared or more capable if you\nDo have some kind of disaster I think having\nNeighborhoods helped being civically engaged to help the best advice I can really get to know your neighbors have people's phone number is be able to get in touch hopefully have them trust you said that if you go in their backyard and you're getting some kind of ... or something\nKids than disaster mitigation technology are important parts of keeping communities safe during a crisis but how effective can they be when resources in society aren't distributed equitably in the first place\nWithout socially intervention the contours of a disaster will probably reflects preexisting divisions which are often shaped along race and class lines so like Terry suggest\nMaybe the best technology we can deploys a kind of social technology closely knit organized an empowered communities that are more resilient drink catastrophes and that are better able to demand the resources they need to not only survive those acute disasters but to thrive on a daily basis\n\n\n\nAnd terrible as they can be\nDisasters present an opportunity to expand our social imagination and dream of new possibilities perhaps these events can open up the space that is normally closed off\nA gap in which we can begin reclaiming community agent in power\nAn opportunity to tell a different story about who we are and what gives our lives meaning and purpose for a few weeks at least the driving narrative in the Rockaways was marked by altruism solidarity and cooperation and that shift\nIn the mainstream story had lasting consequences\nOne can't help but think what if we structured our society along these lines normally what if a mother\n\nI was never able to get his workforce training center going again after the storm he ended up panning the space over to a church and nowadays he makes his living driving for less\nBut he's not better in fact quite the opposite\nOr just where you see around on a scale the good outweighs the\nChoice you\nI I feel so great for a short thing for me\nYou can go a

want to cement in place a conservative majority on the Supreme Court\nThat will hold sway and make important critical decisions for the American people for a generation to come and apparently they think that is more important goal than going through any kind of fair process and getting out the truth about these allegations\nThey're weighing both those options I think we see where they come down they want that conservative majority regardless of the price\nBut that's that's exactly right and that process I think they're totally undermining origin in a sea of the court which is a serious problem I mean that democracy works because people have faith in there in the institutions of government and one by one they're destroying\nThose institutions have governance destroying the American public's faith in those institutions and how could he possibly believe that someone coming through this process is going to get any live again before unfair treatment\nThis is very clear purely part of their plan to pack the court with justices who will rule in their favor\nAnd that's not the way it's supposed to work it's just not the way it's supposed to work and it really undermined some legitimacy of the court\nIf this nomination goes through if Republican Senator Susan Collins and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski both Republicans who said that their moderate in their politics if they

failure understand survivorship and treat spiders with decency and they're really fearing what kind of court we could get with somebody like Brett Kavanaugh on the court so people are mobilized and I

going to see that many times over I mean you're going to have a situation on Thursday were eleven white men on the Republican side are gonna be assessing the credibility of uh survivor who bravely as

Court ruling in the Shelby County versus holder case that effectively dismantled the Nineteen sixty five voting rights act\nDidn't than more than twenty states across the nation has imposed new

rights of African Americans Latino students senior citizens non English speakers and other voters viewed as likely to cast ballots for Democratic Party candidates\nNow a new report by the bipartisan us commission on civil rights\nFinds that federal action to enforce the voting rights for minorities have declined sharply since the Supreme Court struck down key sections of the voting rights act in twenty Thirteen\nCatherine Malone chair of the commission called the president's state of discrimination against minority voters enduring in pernicious the report is critical of the Justice Department's enforcement of voting rights laws both under President Obama and President Trump\nYour reporters broke with well Shawn Moran senior vice president of campaigns in programs with the Leadership Conference on civil and human rights here she is just as the commission's report which concluded that the right to vote for many minority Americans is under attack\nSo the U.S commission on civil rights has actually been a gays and voting rights for many many years\nUm and actually the recommendation that they put forward I'm In the in the sixties actually were adopted and the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five um they recently put out a report they basically validate what the civil rights community has been saying for many years\nWhich is that voting discrimination remains a significant problem in the U.S and it continues to be a threat to our democracy we have witnessed many aggressive efforts by state and local officials to limit access to the ballot box\nAnd in fact we have seen deliberate processes that have been put in place to make voting difficult for people of color voters with disability\nHighlights a number of the problems that remain with respect to the voting rights and basically highlights a number of issues one of which and it's something that we're seeing not only in our work here in Washington but we also have a program called all voting is local\nAnd our local state directors of seeing some of these same issues there are number of polling place closures I'm In predominantly minority communities are we're seeing a vote purges we're saying strict photo ID requirements that are being\nImplemented we're also seeing limitations not only on early voting but also same day registration and what's interesting is that a lot of these particular procedures and processes are being implemented in states that were formerly covered by\nSection five of the voting rights act which was significantly weekend by the Shelby County versus hold a decision and and two thousand Thirteen\nInch speaking about uh the Supreme Court decision on Shelby versus holder\nCongress was supposed to fill the gap or rewrite or reformulate that particular part of section five in the voting rights act for Congress never acted tell us about what happened in Congress under Republican control that froze the process in place\nThe legislation that has been introduced in order to restore the the voting rights act which is sorely needed um\nHas stalled I mean there it had there hasn't been any movement there but I Would say that all parties should have um an interest in making sure that all constituents particularly their constituents\nCan exercise their right to vote and I think any effort to allow this um allow the voting rights act to continue to be a week mechanisms I said\nThat on the federal government has no ability to really make sure that\nHappening in our country [noise] so um I Would say even outside of Congress um there there is significant interest actually and restoring the voting rights act but you know honestly we're in a very difficult political environment right now and so um we still are\nPushing to make sure that we restore the voting rights act um but even in the midst of that there is a provision of the voting rights act\nThat can challenge some of these pernicious actions um buys some state and local officials and that section too which basically prohibit\nVoting practices and procedures that discriminate on the basis of race um color or a membership of a of a language minority group\nAnd unfortunately all of the enforcement has really fallen to a private\nUm to non profit organizations to private entities um and so there have been a nonprofit many of whom are part of our voting rights task force who have been challenging some of the um like the poll closures and the prices the procedures that limit\nUm the rights for people to vote and um they've been doing that under section too but I Would say and I think it's important for people to know that there has been little or no\nI'm enforcement by the department of justice and they have a voting section and very well equipped to enforce section two of the voting rights act but have not done so and in fact I'm of the sixty one cases that have been filed since the Shelby decision\nThe OJ has only filed four of them one was a language access case and there'd been multiple um transgressions and problems in violations with the voting rights access the Shelby County decision\nBut there's been little or no enforcement by the department of justice and I think we need to ask why but I think it's important to ground this conversation", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Middletown", "day": "02"}
