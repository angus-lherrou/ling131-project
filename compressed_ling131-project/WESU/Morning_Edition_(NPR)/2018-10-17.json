curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ... she had thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go on a street selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there are still on the streets when her\nThey need was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote this story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with that charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's that more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its find or keep the mile or had an incredible ability to connect with those could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story that will really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually by taking a small that are making a difference\nSo who is Katie mylar why did you start this organization\nKicked him out there's a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of yeah community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on on evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued their relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and kicked him ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia are demanding Macintosh Johnston tell us about him [noise]\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of disorganization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier um and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is\nIt's kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked than he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls that he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie my other and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within the scope of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nGet Katie ... the founder of the organization now what are you doing [noise]\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses and the peace one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with him but she conceded in an interview but that same year in twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nWho said that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get it\nOn my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think is rumors that jumps than had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she

the river and they're dead their stomach cancer and my dad's us you know teach different colleges so he could scientifically tell you what those cancers learn that from stomach cancer is that you get it from eating dirty fish so it's like\nI Want to be living off of Lansing standing up the river and there's dams everywhere and I just moved out of Maine and they're saving their salmon and their migratory fish\nSo I'm just trying to get educated so I'm learning to cleanse the laughter is what saved me from being fearful and scared because it shows we ... we can do something and then I can drink like water and without fear on the ball now and even though I'm right next to ... who is a time like I just tell people to be careful if they do move to the river\n... we should probably start water quality labs in every town is people are like once they get more of a ...\nUm because I'm feeling that the mud with that's why I have the staff\nTo see how deep the mud is because the mud can be almost like quicksand sometimes and then you stand there by the time you're done with your ceremony or up to your knees in the mud and then it's really hard to get out so I I Try to test the mud first to see if it's solid I mean it's going to be squishy is going to come between your toes\nBut house because she is it and [noise] you know how much pressure do I need to put on the staff to see if it if I'm going to\nHow how deep I'm going to sink and um but I wanted I Want to get at least ankle deep if I can in the water\n'em to do the blessing\nAnd it looks like a good thought to myself as a as\nI could not record ... wasn't ceremony but I talked to her at other times about her water walks as well as several women who accompanied her at least part of the way\nOn wings you are listening to a documentary about river walkers produced by Melinda to who's for her community radio series the forest and the trees\nAnother woman who walked with me was Catherine fried gang who live nearby and has had other spiritual experiences connected to water\nThis is your first day here on the walk is that right that is correct\nWhy did you decide to come uh I Am\nInvolved in have been involved in\nEcological awareness for a really long time and a recently\nWe've been working on things like local farming and renewable energy I'm the issue of preserving our water has come to the surface as the most important thing to a\nAbide by and so uh I've been involved in a number of ceremonies frankly from different cultures that involves purifying water and blessing water and\nHas got some song to it I think sound is an important part to this a lot of song in it and I'm just looking at the components of this ritual to kind of understand how to do this well\nBecause we need it so much with all the price of the lines that are threatening our um our waters and the fracking and the ... of water a there's a lot of evil underfoot so [noise] anyway that's when I'm up to\nThe women on the walk marvel grandmother Carol who is in her late sixties and has some serious health problems could undertake these walks which until very recently she often did solo but she responded this way\nHave never felt more guided directed him protected than when I'm On these walks ever\nAnd um two thousand and twelve I came across country and did twenty eight sacred sites as they came across country so that was that was when I really\nI really felt um\nThe guidance and direction because seven of the twenty eight sites I chose were changed and spirit would just get me last last um [laughter] and um and I was like I'm In the I I seriously the first time I was driving from Washington down to a a lake in Oregon\nWas going to do creators of the lake and then it was going to do this other like there was having trouble with their fish\nAnd I'm On a highway I'm getting off the exit I Know I'm getting off I'm not a GPS person a I've got my map and I'm getting off that ... and all of a sudden I'm In the middle of absolutely nowhere\nOn a dirt road in the middle of forest and I have no idea how we got there is I did you beam me up Scotty I had no I still have no idea how I got lost and uh so I get out and I dropped tobacco and I said I Know this is your prayer and I'm just doing the like\nHim and they came around the corner there's a big wouldn't sign headwaters of the wood river the main tributary to the lake that I was worried about and so it was just saying don't worry about the like the problems here\nUm and so I called my friends that were supposed to be meeting me at the lake and I said I met the headwaters of the wood river this is where we need to be um camp with me ... site now how did you how do you get there and I said I have no idea the look on a map because I don't know how I got here\nAnd um but [noise] always guided in at seven of those sites changed\nSeven of those twenty eight have since come under um either was currently having issues or have come under um\nSevere damage from fracking and I'm\nPipelines and pipeline leaks already existing pipeline leaks um arsenic contamination radiation contamination from the black hills um all of that since um that that change in two thousand and twelve and so had I not been led there\nI Believe that he led me there to strengthen that river before it got contaminated\nUm that's my belief um\nI I'm not it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't scare me walking with the bear\nI think people don't understand that these plants in these animals\nSeal that energy that you're that you're putting out much stronger than we humans do because we were so disconnected they still remember their original instructions on how to live in harmony I'm with the mother\nAnd um where the human beings are the only ones who forgotten and so we just have to re re remember but I Need to step away with your weight and find find our spot for tonight\n... dependent on the local knowledge not only of the women who accompanied her but also of a man who grow up here and still live near the river\nMorning of my time on the walk I asked grandmother Carol to share more of her story under philosophy or the shortest river I've done was the ... river\nAnd that's the watershed that my grandchildren and I live in\nAnd and that's and what's to Connecticut and Massachusetts and so it's uh Seventy two mile river with Eighteen dams\nDams or very destructive to our waterways\nBecause they um\nObstruct the flood the natural flow of water\nThat cleansing process of the water the way the water cycle works as everything flows to the ocean\nDeep within the ocean are places where that water is struck down under and kept underground for years and years and years before it comes up through our awkward for up to up through our artesian wells in our springs\nKind of like the blow how will the whale you know the whales sucks water in and filters out what it wants and then blows out the rest of 'em to blow and so that's kind of wet springs and and artesian wells do\nWe can't have healthy rivers and I'm so to kind of\nMake that on a little bit\nEasier to understand if the doctor told you you had eight teams\nCaught send your in your left leg um but don't worry they've been there a long time I don't think there's many people who would be very\nExcited about the fact that that's Eighteen clots in their life\nAnd it it's the same thing is if these rivers\nAnd are the\nVeins of Mother Earth and so we need to see her as a living beings and um and that those waters closer her the same way our blood flows through us and so she can't be healthy if we continue to obstruct", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "17"}
