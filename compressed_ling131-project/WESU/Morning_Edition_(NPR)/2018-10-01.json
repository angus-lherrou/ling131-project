currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the ... the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option\nThese are a niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nSimply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products available in the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's\nThere for many years of stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days now the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage more\nThan eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans the new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nThat are remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who\nThink that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to back up they may want something and they made by the plant thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to you\nPolicies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some\nAnd they may not cover things like prescriptions are mental health care\nAnd generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that deductible has met people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health need these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether figure options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules the insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people\nAlison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your health comes from exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer

revolution in cancer treatment\nThat nobody on the family how high the two ... two thousand Nobel Prize y'all ... joined the shame on how school on June\nThese two scientists invented a new kind of cancer treatment called immune checkpoint inhibitors with us in the studio to tell us more NPR science correspondent Richard Harris Corning Richard good morning so who are the two winters well the\nPrices being shared of course by James Allison he's a Seventy year old biologist who's now with the NBA Anderson Cancer center in Houston and also by to sue ... who's at Kyoto University in Japan he's Seventy six now you know how some years the Nobel Prize comes just a complete surprise male knock this year these names are on just about everybody shortly\nOK so not such a big shock uh but what exactly did these two scientists do well I'll\nStart with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties who was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer cells and they came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if he could release the brakes may be the immune system\nRevolution and cancer treatment it would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have heard that we've talked about them a fair amount on our airplanes and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers in the list is growing and growing and growing\n[laughter] okay so that's Jim Alice than the other scientists who is winning that's the word ... to ... how do\nYou have any now that him a hundred work independently of Jim Alison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one in ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nOne example one of these drugs that you may have heard about it as a drug called ... notes that goes on attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and it certainly is there more effective target\nFascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about cancer ... well before\nThe scientists made their discoveries cancer treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up the entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and this whole world of immunotherapy is now really the driving force behind drug development\nThese right I mean we hear a lot of in you know therapy how effective are these new therapies that one really wants to know ...\nAnd that's an evolving issue in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies a failed and some people have had remarkable recovery ... remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint\nTake these drugs that researchers are now working on combinations are combining checkpoint inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy or to improve outcomes\nIt's a very exciting area of cancer research but clearly there's a lot more to do this is not the end of the story I have ... science correspondent Richard Harris with us Nobel winners thank you so much by flushing It's MORNING

part of a rocket been semi autonomous since the U.S led a no fly zone there in the Nineteen Ninety to protect the Kurds from former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein\nAnd here's the interest joins us now from the Kurdish city of to the ... gene I understand there are no official results yet but any indication as to what a new Kurdish parliament could look like\nWell for the most part Rachel it's going to be this status quo you know there are two main parties here that have existed for decades\nIt's just in the last elections five years ago it seemed that young people and it looks like that party at least will do well here's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting the traditional parties\nWith most of them not just a lot of people you have to be implemented in reality but fortunately did before you get the walkers and making things get out\nAnd buy the multi almost lost\nAnd by that he means that he and a lot of the voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control a lot of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties so what does that mean to people was turn out good as a result of this frustration you're at polling stations right\nYeah that was a really interesting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're fighting are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fears has always been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the PKK immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in the very few polling stations we call it in one one of the approved polling stations and we were able\nTo watch them start to count some of the ballot so there is an election official taking out each paper ballot because they decided not to do the automated your ballot counting because they think that leads to fraud\nAnd he's reading out the names of each party's very laborious process so even at that approved polling station which you'd think would be like supers cocky people tend to get him a fake ID\nWe've heard for generations out the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there's an ... an innate tension between the Kurdish regional government and the central government in Baghdad so what how how could a new government in essentially Kurdistan affects the the relationship with that got\nAbsolutely you've hit the nail on the head because they had a referendum last year saying do you want independence and the vast majority of Kurds said yeah so the U.S says of course that it warned them not to hold this and there were serious repercussions after that\nThe Iraqi government sent in tanks so they're going to have to repair relations with Baghdad and a lot of other things on their plate as well the economy is so it's all quite up in the air but um yeah a lot of challenges ahead for

you agree\nYes I think so I mean in the first place it removes a great deal of uncertainty that's been floating over the NAFTA which is the fundamental trade agreement for the U.S Canada and Mexico a sin floating over that agreement for the last two years\nAnd based upon early reports of what's been agreed or Canada got it pretty much what it was looking for in terms of the update or it has the chapter Nineteen review of by National Review of anti dumping countervailing duty\nIt had had gotten rid of this guillotine clause which is going to say the agreement would just terminate after five

discoveries have led to a revolution in cancer treatment\nThe November we have to ward off on a Nobel Prize knowledge or join the James Holmes who ...\nThese two scientists invented a new kind of cancer treatment called immune checkpoint inhibitors with us in Studio to tell us more NPR science correspondent Richard Harris Corning Richard good morning so who are these two winters well the price\nAs being shared of course by James Allison he's a Seventy year old biologist who's now with the NBA Anderson Cancer center in Houston and by ... at Kyoto University in Japan he's Seventy six now you know how some years the Nobel Prize comes with a complete surprise male [laughter] not this year the center on just about everybody Portland\nOkay so not such a big shock uh but what exactly did these two scientists do well I'll\nStart with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties who was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer so I came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if you could release the breaks\nFact what's been called the revolution and cancer treatment it would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have heard that we talked about them a fair amount on our air and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers and the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alice than the other scientists who is winning this word ... school how do\nYou have any now that him a hundred work independently of Jim Alison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing and his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one and ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nOne example one of these drugs that you may have heard about is a drug called ... true to nuts that goes on attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and in some ways they're more effective target\nFascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about ...\nWell before the scientist made their discoveries cancer treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and the whole world of immunotherapy is known really the driving force behind drug development\nThese rights I mean we hear a lot of in you know therapy how effective are these new therapies that one really wants to know it went and that's an\nEvolving issue it in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies of failed and some people had remarkable recoveries remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of\nSo the patient to take these drugs\nBut researchers are now working on combinations are combining checkpoint inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy or to improve outcomes\nIt's a very exciting area of research but clearly there's a lot more to do this is not the end of the story NPR science correspondent Richard Harris has no doubt when they're thinking how much my pleasure It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep and

aspects of society manufacture white innocence manifest who's followed in the stores who is stopped and frisked who is afforded drug court or how the media\nNarrates different events and so when we think about\nThe ways in which blackness is criminalized we also have to think about the ways in which white miss is constructed imagine through innocence and felt inexperienced at the every day level but also it an institutional levels\nWe've always been told that sports she's the one place in society in which there really use memory chocolate treats you win who were you lose [noise]\nYeah I mean we've been told that and of course it's much easier for those who role in the wages of lightness cash in on the power and privileges of male Nathan and heterosexuality of youth sports as a level playing field as a meritocracy adds a place where\nIt doesn't matter who you are it's matters if\nYou can or touched down or make buckets but\nWhen we look at the history of segregation we look at differential access to sports if we look at the language of sports whether we think about this idea of\n... like a girl if you ask women is sports a meritocracy given the that sort of language isn't given exclusions if you talk to\nAny number of African Americans who experience racial slurs weather from the fan or from fellow opponents it's clear\nWell what I Try and explore the ways in which the media through its narration through the way that it engages in profiling makes clear that\nIt's not simply what you do on or off the field but who you are that determines not only media coverage than than reaction but also opportunities\nYeah of course we are all political be using including a leash but in the fields of I've medics we see as you point out that\nGarlic and talkative white athletes seem to be encouraged while my folks who told just just as you pointed dribble and shut up\nI think we see that that racial double standard although given that it reflects the logic of anti black racism of white supremacy it reflects that logic\nSee it in terms of yeah the celebration of white athletes who talk trash as either words Mets or passionate about their game as competitive I mean we just thought this past weekend with Tom Brady\nScreaming on the sidelines and it fit a narrative of his competitiveness desire to win and methane weekend Antonio Brown engaged in an argument\nWith a coach and that was seen as part of him being a problem and so we can see yet again who gets seen as a problem who is seen as counter to the east coast and the desire qualities of\nBeing an athlete and who is seen as embodying all of those characteristics yet at the same time that that\nAre empowered to speak out on social issues or be quiet\nOn social issues to use their platform or simply be athletes whereas black athletes are told over and over again to shut up and drip will even as part of the media\nAlso uses moments where black athletes have not\nFollowed what Howard Bryant would describe it as the heritage use those moments to disparage demonize black athletes I mean all through the the eighties and nineties you would see articles in the white press about what happened to the revolt to the black athlete or today's black athletes are\nYou concerned about commercials and materialism and are betraying the histories of Ali and Smith thank Carlos as if\nThat same press ever supported Smith and Carlos and so the notion of of who is empowered and who is celebrated and who is rewarded for using their voice and I think it speaks to a long history\nOf demanding black athletes entertain its that fits a long history of black athletes being expected to represent the narrative of American exceptionalism and American racial progress and so that speaking out on racial injustice\nThat role um and it speaks to a longstanding history of of white supremacist views and ideology is on black\nIntelligence that the demonization of black athlete to speak out it's a longstanding ideology ... who is capable are and who has the requisite skills to speech and so that that didn't\nThey're very different ways that the playing field codified the use of race and intelligent\nDonald Trump seems to understand perfectly well that sports is the political playing field and he seems to relatives and making black athletes into boils America First rhetoric\nTrial or the laws will be properly applied the lawyers and the prosecutors will follow all the right procedures and that will mean justice but that's not what justice means right we we all have an intuition that justice means something parameter that justice means something richer and often runs\nAgain the legal system that is more often than not based on who has more resources to win the case financial and sort of a social and political resources to win\nThe case and so when we're thinking about harm done to individuals into communities I'd just thinking about achieving justice for the promise by legal means by going to court for corrosive much broader sense of justice that we all I think feel at some level compelled to pursue\nAnd you seem to be saying that those leaders doesn't appeal to a higher law or the most effective because that is what's written to meet with the community a community that just turned itself a higher level\nI'm list on questions of tactics and what is effective rhetorically in one\nPlace will be different from another at one time will be a different from another but what I wanted to think through in in this book is what in the African American community from slavery to segregation seem like a particularly effective\nWay of organizing against racial domination and one that isn't talked about very much anymore now we don't often associate Martin Luther king for Frederick Douglass author Anatolia Cooper with natural law or higher law even if you know that might be one of the word that connection\nBlack political tradition is this mobilization at the grassroots level in communities by means of appeals to a higher law God's law\nOr natural law however one wants to name it\nEither way I read which you've written the our\nOwn jump to a degree by\nThis I don't belong been stored socialism\n[laughter] a rich defense of bottom up\nCommunity organizing is what I think this natural law theory and tell us and you know if that's what socialism name I think I think of socialism I'm more interested in the process of organizing an ideal ... points that process of organizing that icy associated with an F. robot tradition and that process of struggle\nWhich makes us fit to govern ourselves right through struggle that we become fit to govern ourselves and now that is what natural law in this African working condition and tell\nOne of the heroin when you're writing is Anna ... Cooper a lady who died at the right age hundred and five back in Nineteen sixty four and who was born in late ... but most of us have not heard of and a Jew your Cooper\nShe led a very impressive life she was born in\nNorth Carolina and went to study in college was a high school teacher and the Washington D. C. area was involved in many different local and national organizing efforts with a compelling writer wrote a masterpiece of voice from the south a collection of her as a reflection on\nBoth gender or questions and racial questions and then at the age of sixty seven completed a doctorate studying the Haitian a and French revolutionary contacts from the Sorbonne in France a really impressive woman who has become an icon of international and women\nWith concerned with appealing to a higher law and doing so in a way that mobilized a community of to challenge domination\nAnd you associate ... Cooper with like the w._b. to boys Martin Luther king Frederick Douglass ... you also may I ask you to a higher law which was so she ate with radicalism\nYes it is higher law is first and foremost something that I understand the in the negative right ... it's a law which is not the law of the road a law which is not the law of the wealthy and powerful\nAnd the white so what is beyond that what other law if they are ... what lies are they truly reflects justice well that's a question which required communal disarmament right it required reflection in community it requires drug over to get more clarity about the struggle against the powers that be\nSo I I don't want to say I know what the higher ... is that right and you should be my doctor figure out what it is talking about\nHigher by talking about natural law is a way of\nSaying we know the law of the road has limits and we need to think together about what the alternative is and we need to work together to challenge the law of the road\nAnd you've also associated the meat Black Panthers leader ... we just hire a law and the young but you know Newton was the scientific socialist that's what he considered themselves that there's secular as you can get\nOf the aspects of my story in this book is to\nReflect on the decline of this black natural law tradition from Douglas through Cooper and the boys and king it was at the heart of lack political organizing but then with the transformation of the civil rights movement and the emergence of a black elected leaders\nLeaders on the right like Clarence Thomas and other leader all symptoms of a decline of black political thought they might be electoral political actors right they might be people trying to get votes but they stand at a distance\nFrom the tradition of black political thought and so it's a Black Panthers a transitional moments where they're pushing on the ideology critique are pushing on the the grassroots organizing which are features of\nThe black and natural law a tradition but they're also moving at a distance from some of the religious said he says that tied together that grassroots community organizing an ideology critique with a sense of virtue is now with a sense of community building so\nAll of these things were central to black political thought were central to the black naturalized tradition I see the black Panthers as an important or\nIn the collapse of the black political tradition\nAnd you see the thing that you hear how you law by emanating from the black lives matter movement\nAbsolutely I think there's a renewed interest in justice beyond the law renewed sense that we need to not limit ourselves to electoral politics we need to not limit ourselves to negotiating with\nThe powers that be we need to think beyond respectability politics and we need to imagine a new one what\nAdjust road looks like and so I Want to point to this tradition of black political thought that imagines justice beyond the law from Douglas through king\nAnd say this tradition offers resources for active as an organizer today who realize that there's something missing with the way we're able to talk about black politics and who are looking for something more and who are looking for for\n... not for reform of the police or the prison system but the abolition of the police and prisons as we know them\nThinking in terms of the law on the books thinking in terms of the social norms that are generally agreed to that limit the possibilities for political action\nAnd political imagination and instead of thinking about how we can have more spacious ... we should be thinking about how we can affect the end of the prison instead of thinking about how we can\nHave more body cameras on police officers that we should be thinking about the day when we don't need police officers in our communities\nAnd these are all things that reflection on natural law\nParticipation in communities that are talking about higher law motivate\nThat was a professor of Vincent Lloyd Oakland rooms black natural long\nDr Anthony my Tara it said it boy scholar in Philadelphia where he works as Saturday free school lunches Harris says the world has changed in ways that are they're badly for us Cynthia ... than\nThe strategic alliance between China and Russia the\nInterests of both China and Russia and certain European country in a multi polar world rather than a human a polar world the movements towards limiting\nThe u._s. dollar as the reserve currency the major currency of trade on a world scale and currency like the euro to a certain extent but I think most importantly where you are on\nThe Chinese you on that is and the fact that nations are trading between themselves\nEisenhower conservatives and what we call neo conservatives are conservatives are neoconservatives who are far right now\nWhere does the line between a Bernie Sanders the Hillary Clinton me I'll liberals and the neo cons what are the lines of separate them and I would argue\nStarting with the Democratic party convention of twenty six team what we saw is that is very little that separates them and in fact there's now evidence\nThat the Democratic party that just in terms of policy but in terms of candidates that they are putting forward in the twenty eighth team congressional races are increasingly linked\nTo the military and the U.S security forces at home in other words they represent what we've come to call but deep stake\nAnd the anti war movement says on those ceased\nTo exist and it's been in the defendants for\nAbsolutely you know if we had an anti war movement the anti war movement could learn a lot from the trade union movement you meet\nWith dominant politicians\nEven if they are your enemies on a number of questions but if you can fine points of discussion and support on specific issues like mad after the world Trade Organization\nRe industrialization of the United states and that type of thing if you can find a great that you need and say we agree on this\nThe peace movement is\nA movement that has the crazy idea of all or nothing we're not in an all or nothing moment we're in a moment where\nA good part of the American\nWars in Iraq Afghanistan and Libya and they're saying we want to pull back from this we want\nThe government and the politicians to serve the names of ordinary people and we can go on and on about that but these wars and the neo liberal globalization policy have been published the working class\nHas impoverished the lower middle class has pushed the professional classes increasingly\nInto the poet Terry it has divided the country along class line\nUnlike anything since the great depression which is not a bad thing of course but the question is the politics\nOf this new division of this new class division and class conflict in the United states and of course in the world\nOr whatever that does not seem to be young into lock you during the year in Trump him that despite what Trump may have stayed at various times\nDuring the campaign he is embedded in seems intent on being embedded in the Rio his military budget was the biggest in a very long time whenever you said about NAFTA he's already re need Don\nIt's very difficult to find the kind of Trump than\nPeople suspected might be out there back in when he's sixteen\nW E s U Middletown\nWell he would have to take those things one by one the United states might want to be some in his administration might want to be in Syria for the long run but a few hundred or even a thousand troops in southern Syria\nCannot significantly alter what is now moving towards a victory\nThis attempt to overthrow the Assad government in other words the Assad government and its allies in a stronger position now than they've ever been the United states is in the week this condition it's ever been it has no allies in\nSyria that can be effective against the government now Trump said he was against intervention and regime change well\nThat's what he said now he is surrounded by the administration of people who wants to prevent him from governing on the platform that he was on and I said that\nAfter the election the question now after you won the election ten he governs and he's finding it very very difficult to govern I think that if you look at the relationships with Russia it is for Congress\nThat has instituted policies that forced sanctions on Russia if Russia does X Y or Z over the head of Trump himself now that is not to say\nAgain I Wish to say Trump is not an anti imperialist I Would argue how ever that Trump's withdrawing of TPP the Trans Pacific partnership a principal\nPoint for the labor movement was very very important\nAt this point I'm not aware of Trump having step back\nFrom the NAFTA renegotiation especially on the issue of sixteen dollars an hour in plants both in Mexico and the United states that are run by American corporations my thing is\nThat to weakness of the people's movement and the weakness confusion and chaos in the left\nDoes not make it possible to put pressure in any direction and the state was made Glen and I'll say it over and over again when Trump was elected\nI think they supported resistance how does what is called the left\nBy its grounding ideologically and politically after such a how to read this mistake and that's the question for the left right now because then if you cannot find a separation or division between ... the real left\nAnd the meal that both resistance than they've left any longer and I don't think we have a left right now I don't think we have a peace movement right now I think the labor movement is finding its legs and its standing up\nAnd saying what is it ... inches wide support what won't support the type of international trade relations that in the interest of labor at least industrial labor and that type of thing I think they have to go much further I think this might be an opportunity for the labor movement\nTo assert its Political Independence\nAnd to break with the slave best relationship with the Democratic party which has betrayed it\nOver and over and over again but we have to have a peace movement we have to have a call people's movement we have to have an anti gentrification movement we have to have a genuine movement for universal health care and\nWe must not be confused by the likes of Bernie Sanders and here I you know again I Want to congratulate you on your\nVery bold and important work in exposing just to uncle Bernie ...\nThis neo liberal super cold resistance movement which it's infatuation and even loans from the CIA and\nItself like fascism that has no problem with diversity among the fascist actors do problem with for example a black candidate and homeland security or a black kid of the CIA ... more the twenty first century\nYeah and that's the problem that is the problem when you put the question of representation ... take for instance black folk what we want us to be represented that does not get to the substance of the character that representation a black face in a hot place does not mean that black\nInterest of the masses of black people especially the working class and the poor are being represented it just means you have a black face and this I think these are questions that are being hounded by ordinary black people and you know one of the things that I have argued that will continue to argue is that black folk\nNot having a party that they can turn to either the Democrats or Republicans have withdrawn and mass from the electoral process itself\nWhich is not representative of a kind of a retreat from thinking on a retreat from politics but it is representative of a rejection of both sides in the booth well political game\nYes we've seen huge reductions in Boulder jury now in local races I Know you've pointed out in Philadelphia but also in places all across the country", "year": "2018",
