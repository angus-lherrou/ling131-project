infestation couldn't get worse I'm back\n[laughter] and we have also of course the man of the hour Ralph Nader hello Ralph high an unusual show\nYeah exactly we are going to have a little bit of a different show today we're going to turn the tables on Ralph usually he is interview and get the buy books they have written today David and I are going to interview Ralph about the new book that he has written now regular listeners know that Raul Monterey has been\nThe Congress the Congress the Congress the Congress is the key to turning the country around well Ralph new book is titled\nHow the rat reformed Congress\nAnd it's a fable this is not route first foray into these fabulous\nMany of you are familiar with another worker fictional route pending titled only the super rich can save us\nThis is along those same blind so we'll be digging into that and what inspired him to return to the motive getting his message across after that we will develop the latter part of the show to listen to questions\nAnd it's not a show if we don't also check in with our corporate crime reporter Russell ... by the way on a side note last week's corporate crime report ventured into the surreal itself and Russell told us how Kentucky Fried chicken was holding a contest for parents\nWho named the child Harlan after kid he founded on [laughter] Carlin Sanders and if they when they're eligible to receive a eleven thousand dollars toward their child's college education\nThe including name pictures voice like this and biographical information will be owned by KFC for advertising purposes well yeah this is like the apocalypse\nGross gross it could get worse they could start paying people to put tattoos on with the brand name of the corporation the logo\nYeah while I was just telling my two kids about how outrageous this was my daughter Kleenex and my son preparation age [laughter] but anyway [laughter]\n\nBy the way these days eleven thousand dollars would buy you about two months of college\nI'd like to interview the corporate lawyer who thought this up or put it on paper\nWell that any way a long way of saying you don't want to miss Russell's corporate crime report but first let's get to our first guest David\nAnd it's purely a coincidence that we're transitioning from Kentucky Fried chicken to rats\n[laughter] that's just\nRalph Nader's new book is a fable about rats that invade Congress and the ... trigger A People's political revolt it starts with a congressional reporter breaks a strange and shocking story that rats have invaded the toilet bowl a boat the speaker of the house and the minority leader\nThe mighty rat invasion sparked a national news frenzy activists season the burgeoning story to organize for a populist agenda\nSpontaneous rallies breakout everywhere the activists see the rats up ending business as usual routines on Capitol Hill as a powerful symbol against the lobbyists and their corporate Congress the civic energy bills as millions of people begin flooding into Washington\nAnd I moved to take back Congress from Wall street\nCongressional offices back home are overwhelmed with wave after wave of citizen rallies and meetings\nWarn about economic collapse and mass layoffs if the citizen raise agenda passed as Congress corporate front groups are created to disrupt the peaceful crowd but the corporate lobbyists and think tanks can't overcome the organized well up to determine people\nThere is much realism serendipity and galvanizing motivations throughout fishing grossing fable welcome to the Ralph Nader radio our Ralph Nader [laughter]\nWell here we go now people might like to know who I dedicated this book too and it was dedicated to the spirit of vote terror and Mark Twain and specifically to Mali Ivan stick Gregory Jim Hi tower and victims of asking\nWho taught us how to laugh ourselves seriously and that really summarizes the sequence of the book if we can't do it by indignation if we can do a bio ... and maybe we can do it by laughing\nAs the rats lead the way\nRoute I think you just answer what my first question was going to be as what inspired you to write a fable instead of non fiction but let me move to my next question which is what in your mind you the rats represent in this fable\nThey represent the traditional rodent quest for food and water they're not anthropomorphize they're not like Mickey Mouse they just find the pipe then they go up there looking for water and food and there's a lot of\nCrumbs of food from parties and cleaning team eating after hours and they find the food but first starts with an intrepid rap which has NO NAME\nThat goes up to the toilet bowl of the speaker just as he's sitting down to do is business and the first few pages are quite jolt team\nAnd upsetting and I said well you're describing the behavior of Congress\nAnd so the rats then of course follow each other ten rats signal to other rats and as a rat infestation and the house of representatives and then in the Senate and then there's an overreaction\nBy the members of the leaders they don't want this to get out that they can't even control the rats much less the wall street lobbyists\nAnd one reporter ... Damon Runyon novel is intricately meticulous and he blows the story and then all the cable shows everybody goes wild with derision as the story unfolds and\nThe overreaction is massive slaughter the rats they keep coming they keep reading\nMore crumbs of food because they working overtime and that is what gets people's attention about Congress you know Congress comes in in the polls under Fifteen or twelve percent\nAgain nine percent as ... percent now\nSo that's about the lowest of any category even the\nProverbial used car dealer lower than ISIS is what I understand\nBut you see the other side of that is that people\nHave such a low opinion of Congress to keep sending bad members of Congress to Washington but they withdraw you know they become cynical new withdraw instead of becoming angry\nAnd moving to take control of Congress after all it's the sovereign power the people delegated to five hundred and thirty five members of Congress that is misused and turned against the people on behalf of Wall Street and other corporate\nSue premises and so because of the massive media\nYou have massive public attention the comedians late night talk shows\nWell like a tension massive derision fumbling and grumbling and tripping over themselves trying to deal with Iraq infestation asking for the national security people to come in on orders of the White House I mean they treat it like you know it's a foreign invasion\nAnd then the whole theme of this little book turns into Syria's\nLobby and it's a lot of tension a lot of backlash by the wall street crowd by the local trade lobbies in Washington DC I tried to make it very interesting and personal dialogue\nIs considered a genius even by his colleague art is yeah the rallies here are different first of all they build from day to day that's something politicians are very sensitive to is this something is going to Peter out\nOr it's gonna be a thousand people one day five thousand the next they're really scared of that kind of momentum\nAnd second it's led by people who are full time they just take off from their work or they're retired or what and they really develop a strategy and they open offices in Washington\nAnd third one of my favorite hopes three enlightened billionaires come to town and they say hey\nLet's fund says let's relieve them of all these fundraising problems and diversions and let them expand their numbers back home and everywhere so and that's really what's needed I mean there are in like ... billionaires but they don't have that kind of imagination\nTo build major movements I mean you have a fellow who's very progressive for raising the minimum wage ... an hour\nOut of Seattle and you know he writes for Politico he knows fellow billionaires somehow they don't know how to put it together in terms of mass movements\nBut in your book they do I mean there's it seems to me I think he's talking about like the three pillars of this rebel\nRich people providing an endless source of funding that seems pretty fabulous and\nA brain trust of course and a full time citizens who emerged from the masses to do the daily work and going up on Capitol Hill connecting with the progress is up there and going with the media\nWhich it seems to me that again talking about that was then this is now with all of the income disparity and people having a have two jobs three jobs that that works\nAgainst people being able to fulltime devote to this kind of action I touched on it last week interview with Phil Donahue when I asked him what was different about than than it is now and my theory is that\nIt was more prosperous time\nAnd when you're not scratching and clawing for the you know scraps of food you have time to consider more sophisticated new on issues like he had on your show at least that's my theory today we're in a situation where so many people are underwater\nYes where you see Steve you have a different media today you have a more instant media you have the Internet people when they see people like themselves rally in here and there\nThey pick up hope they pick up contagion of activity hey these are like us these people are like us must be part of it\nIt has almost a civic festival additives to it\nBut there is hard work and this book democracy requires work as well as rallies protest chants slogans et cetera and the more they feel they've got the members of Congress on the run\nThe more energized they become which is a natural reaction on the back of the book I have the indictment of Congress I mean people have a ...\nInflicted it's abandonment of its constitutional powers as the most powerful branch of government\nIt's selling the elections for money in campaigns\nIt's closing out even the people I mean I've seen Congress degrade to levels that I've never believed possibly it's impossible to get through some members of Congress offices even a ... campaign contributor you might get the switchboard\nIf it isn't on voicemail can you imagine putting\nSwitchboard on voicemail and show you how much of a straight on the majorities in Congress are giving people back home they had a tax bill as we know for the rich and powerful in the corporate\nIncreasing the deficit starving the public works investment and all the rest\nAnd they didn't even have public hearings into committee level that's unheard of you know then they had five bills to destroy people's rights to have their day in court if they're wrongfully injured they got it through the house of representatives blocked in the Senate Democrats didn't even have public hearings and how to do Sherry\nAnd then they tried to get rid of Obamacare and they lost by one or two votes in the Senate\nAnd they didn't even have public hearings so Congress itself has become a secret tyrannical bastion of Wall Street and that outrages people when they start trying to connect with the members of Congress or get them to address rallies back home\nI got a couple more questions but I Want you to break in here and tell people how they can get the book\nYeah the book is designed to stimulate living room discussion classroom discussion and they can get five books at a discount here's how you can get to go to rats reform Congress start or rats reform Congress started or and you can get a book for twenty dollars\nCopies at a discount totaling fifty dollars at rats were foreign Congress start or you can order online where you can send a regular check at the address designated\nAnd so on the Web page you have the description of the book the news release an excerpt from the book which will\nAnd like you I Hope and how to become a congressional rat watcher back home on your two senators and representatives and how to organize a congressional ... watchers group were even getting T shirts buttons mugs\nIt's all in the process of making people laugh at themselves serious and getting people who are usually not active and our cynical and it's never going to happen and they're going to decide whatever they're going to decide in Washington with the big boys involved\nAnd so people who get the book are likely to be more leaning toward activity in their civic experience anyway\nBut they have huge experience with the book who cynically withdraw who agree with them but say it just can't happen\nAnd that's what this book is all about and it's a tremendous amount of strategy tactics\nMotivation and he says the first program on the book I Hope to do more media we hope to pass it out on Capitol Hill Capitol Hill it's like a small city Steve and David has thirty three thousand workers\nThan it has a real rat problem I understand as a real problem re idea\nFor this came when my sister Claire Nader gives the annual Calloway award of moral courage and she gave it to the workers down in the catacombs under the Congress who have to work under awful occupational hazard conditions earlier was asbestos field\nTerrain in areas under Congress that senators and representatives were prohibited from taking the elevator down there\nThat's how dangerous it was well I gave me the idea you know the rats coming up a bottoms up movement so to speak for this book how the rats read formed the Congress they did their own thing and then the people picked up and did their thing and made history\nRap you refer in your book to a real book entitled the first American Revolution my re route the al ... about that book and how to inform your table\nYeah this is a book about the beginning of the American revolution which was not just in Concord and Paul Revere and it was in western and central Massachusetts where the farmers reacting\nTo an edict by King George the third that replaced or local government with chosen Tories\nAnd that was the last straw for the farmers and they would assemble just think of how low the population was in those days\nThey would assemble five hundred to a thousand farmers and surround the house of the Tory local ruler and demand that the Tory renege on enforcing this law and replacing their share of ... in their magistrates\nWith King George the third loyalists\nAnd that's how it started and some of the Tories woods open the door and they walk down the path surrounded by their farmers and green egg and some of them would fleet to Boston where there is a red coat garrison ... of soldiers at the time\nBut that was in Seventeen Seventy four\nAnd that was in ... was in Springfield there was in Sheffield that's where the first revolution started and we forget that\nPart of rioters mobs as the Tories and the red coats with call any kinds of protests\nRight so it didn't start necessarily with the intellectuals that we recognize the founders Jefferson Madison\nThere's also wonderful material on how to organize a congressional ... watchers group I mean that's really the end purpose of this book is to get people and every congressional district to organize and they will be amazed once they get say a hundred two four or five hundred people\nIn a club a watchdog club of their senators and representatives\nThe effect that will have on Congress I've always said takes less than one percent\nPeople back home to organize on the five hundred and thirty five men and women and you got public opinion behind you or growing public opinion behind you doesn't matter what corporate lobbyists they don't have any votes have money they don't have votes you're going to prevail and Congress\nWill very good the book is called how the rats reformed the Congress we will link to that and

new questions after we've come back\nSure and other rat's reformed the Congress has a Hollywood endings by the way\nThat it's a happy ending ... startling one [laughter] exactly well\nWe've been speaking too Ralph Nader author ... how the rats reformed Congress we're pretending that does not even his own show where ... were interviewing him we're going to take ... short break and check in

stock prices fell called the significant losses to shareholders\nFor the corporate crime reporter how most of them will\nThank you Russell welcome back to the Ralph Nader radio our my name is ... along with David Feldman\nAnd our guest Ralph Nader has graciously agreed to stick around and do some listener questions on his own show\nAnd I'm going to start that ball rolling with our first question from a name Kurt who batch he listens to show route while he delivers mail in rural Wisconsin and he says\nHe's referring to the Jeffrey climates corporate personhood episode we did a couple of weeks ago\nAnd he says I'm also writing by your answer to a question from Wisconsin caller about the growing community rights movement at the end of your interview about corporate person but he says I heard you saying that we the people can an act community rights ordinance is that the state and federal levels of government will just preempt them\nThat to me seems unjust if governments are instituted to protect our help safety in welfare then how come state and federal levels of government or preempting citizens that are using their local bodies of government\nFrom expanding on environmental and other protections already written in the state and federal laws\nThe answer is because they can under our constitution and state law\nThat can preempt local ordinances for example in Texas local metropolitan areas raise the minimum wage and so the fast food industry and others went to Austin and got a bill through which precluded any raise the minimum wage at the municipal or city\nCorporate person owed and corporate power in their area where people live work and raise their families the corporations are definitely going to go to the state and federal governments for preemption\nWell our next question David I Want you to take but it kind of is a good question in light of the mid term elections coming up in the elections in general and it's a question we've gotten in different forms a lot but I think it bears repeating so uh why don't you take this one David is from mark Erickson says Ralph I'm\nFamiliar with the ways you encourage voters and concerns citizens to support a third party candidate he says I Do live in a swing state Pennsylvania even though it's not a presidential election year I'm faced with a similar thing there is a Green Party candidate\nWho I Am considering voting for in the U.S Senate\nIt's the same old story about strategically voting for Democrats in swing states versus voting for the best candidate that has very little chance of winning what's the best course of action now especially considering the success of Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Dylan's Kansas City in Florida for governor\nWell they're going to have very simple answer I always encourage people to vote their beliefs to vote for the candidate and the agenda they believe that\nOnce you start tactically voting you're basically saying to a major party you don't have to look at the small parties agenda and adopt it even though it has majority ... support back home like raising the minimum wage or full Medicare for all\nBecause the voters are going to give you a pass they're not going to vote for the third party\nFrom Irene in American history I'm very happy that people voted for the liberty party in Eighteen forty against slavery or for women's suffrage parties and succeeding decades or for the people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlocks things even when they were in the minority they don't have the energy the Republicans have in the Congress I\nMean look at this fight over Kavanaugh it's unbelievable the energy that McConnell and Grassley and Lindsey Graham have\nCompared to their counterparts with all of this discussion about Kevin on when he was younger and the sexual harassment the question I ask is why didn't the Democrats investigate this\nFrom the beginning why didn't they investigate Kevin off from the high school on up\nInstead they saw the number of votes they expected the Republicans to put behind cabinet and they essentially gave up I was told by people staffing the Senate Judiciary committee that's all fixed the they're gonna get fifty one votes it's no way it's gonna change\nSo their defeat us and there there are serious responsibility for what's happened it's not just the Republicans\nWell I always say that the you know the Republicans are robbing the bank but the Democrats are driving the getaway car but getting back to our talk about the book and conscience it seems like people like Mitch McConnell Orrin Hatch\nCharles Grassley those are not exercises and conscience they don't seem bothered by this kind of thing and all\nWe're friendly with Grover Norquist I mean don't these guys sleep at night thinking yes people are suffering the government is not the answer isn't that how they sleep they think they\nAmazing how cold blooded at some of them are I mean they've come to adjust their mindset so it's a monetize mind Grover Norquist doesn't like corporate welfare cause a\nCrony capitalism but he keeps pushing for you know bigger military budget more tax cuts I mean you know where do you go on that right you cut the revenue and you raise the expenses of the bloated military budget and then the you know they go to work every day", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)",
