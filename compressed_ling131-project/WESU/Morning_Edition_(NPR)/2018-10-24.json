better ideas when based on ah the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats than Republicans ended up in control of the chamber one of them being Wisconsin and two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appeared to have a big majority and votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing of district lines that's where they came from right well I Would\nA couple of points on that first and foremost the system we've designed has to have local representative that people can count on carrying the interest of that\nA notion that a state wide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of Russia's but if\nYou drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issues stats and there are a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level I'm using Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as it as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is understand their district can advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nYou had a wave election in two thousand ten on that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand I too\nWell certainly always need to be prepared offered the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if they're a winding up for a wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district that Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win a\nPrize thing local government and I think part of that is an ideological difference

candidates would win but we didn't do myself democratic chairman Tom ...\nLegislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw district lines for future elections so I'm our future national leaders according to the Republican who oversees his party's efforts\nThere part farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments have\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group as the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWhen you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense um when you have an environment that the historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the meat\nAren't there several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber\nYeah you have a one seat majorities and Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and a number of other states are quite close further compounding\nOr what you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up on the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys want to drive you got the drawing even though you've lost a lot of ground in the election\nHow much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting and many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on ah the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states\nDemocrats appear to have a big majority and votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing of district lines that's where that came from right [noise] well I Would\nRaise a couple of points out that um first and foremost the system we've designed as to have local representative that people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that a state wide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of Russia's but\nIf you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue stats and there are a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level um you've seen Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump the\nState legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful his understand their district can advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nView at a wave election in two thousand ten on that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand eight team well\nCertainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if they're a winding up for our way of I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and just\nI think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement seems historically to be more focused on sort of installing a a a master architect at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue a and a more conservative philosophy wants to just use that power out to the locality\nThat's Matt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee after historic flooding in Austin, Texas that cities one million residents have been told to boil their drinking water most shelves member station ... has more [noise]\nRushing into Austin reservoirs has the look of chocolate milk\nIt's been so turned off by flooding the brown SEAL Team and when it goes to Austin treatment

shells were bear after stores started to limit how many\nBottles people could buy it's an inconvenience at this point but I technically about you know just ... that we use water I hadn't even thought about\nWhat kinds of things some restaurants are close to cafes aren't serving so you meet a lot of people desperate for coffee and on a more serious note the city of San Antonio cent above water tank or to help keep the local jail supplied with drinking water and the city of Austin worried about maintaining water pressure and it just dumb\nWe've been providing water for a hundred years it has never happened to us this is blowing our mind to\nMoved there is is the director of the city's water utility he said after all that they'll load water treatment the city's system of pipes and reservoirs started to lose pressure if it loses too much pressure that said he won't be able to spray water from hoses\nNormally accept the good news is there is that is that water conservation is working people and all that are using less more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control it how much water we use we can't control the weather but we can control that aspect of it\nHe says if conservation continues and the weather cooperates things could start returning to normal by this weekend if heavy rain kick up more silt and the river could last\nDay on that for NPR News I'm mostly shell in Austin [noise]\nAnd this is NPR News It's MORNING EDITION on Ninety One point one ws age you want to find evidence central public radio
