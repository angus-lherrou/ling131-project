Pamela constable covers Afghanistan for the Washington Post and she's on the line more to the program I'm Glad to be with you I guess we should figure out what was supposed to happen this weekend one of the original plan was to Duke and what's the campaigning bin Laden\n[noise] um the original plan was to have um a very big nationwide election more than two thousand five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament candidates of all all flavors uh and philosophies\nAh there was lots of excitement about the election but also lots of concern and worry\nPartly because of threats by the Taliban which has now come true well and partly the\nWidespread of widespread charges on that there was going to be massive fraud so you've seen a lot of a positive uh campaigning a lot of new fresh faces a lot of enthusiasm but also a great deal of of worry a and and and anxiety at the same time\nSo you've been reporting good in Kandahar Province really large important province the voting will be delayed for a week brought this does raise a question what was possibly going to be any different a week\nRight and we don't know that obviously this is a a measure of taken on an emergency basis\nUm just to to sort of calm things down and I'm In kind of hard to very large province which is tough loss it's the least have its intelligence chastened it's governor has been gravely wounded um there's a huge security vacuum people are very nervous and worried so I think this is obviously a measure designed for short term relief of that\nI'm obviously decision will be made later

record numbers of candidates out and about a four hundred women are among the candidates with which is extraordinary a for a very traditional society like this one\nUp on the other hand candidates although they've been busy an active have not been doing a lot of public campaigning they've been recruited they've been cautious\nThey'd had inside events um it had a loudspeaker trucks but you have

the sixties supposedly was going to head to head off voter purges\nAll kinds of software and voting machines owned by corporations and controlled by them all kinds of distractions in the mass media all kinds of Wall Street taking over Washington and created and ever deeper corporate state which even\nLibertarians call fascism libertarians call the corporate state state has him\nNear as opposed to it as progressive let's start with the voters Congress has the most powerful branch of government it's also the smallest it's also people's by legislators whose names we know five hundred and thirty five senators and representatives\nWhat's wrong with one percent of the organizing reflecting a majority of the public to turn domestic and foreign policy around and subordinate corporate and national security state power to read the paper which is the way the constitution starts\nWell organizing is is what it will take I think the point you made at the beginning about voter suppression purges is absolutely crucial especially to the moment we're in right now right now the thing to organize for it's for the Democrats\nAs bad as many of them are to take control of the house and take control of the Senate it's crucial turning point in American history ... that doesn't happen if the Democrats don't take at least the house and even if they failed to take\nThe Senate this country I couldn't turn in a direction that leads to the dismantling not just in your life's work\nTo voting rights to just equal income distribution to anti poverty to the environment to human rights women's rights dismantling not just of all of that\nProgress and rolled back to where the United states was a hundred years or more ago but also a basic turn away from democracy away from free speech\nIn the direction in the kind of uniquely American then uniquely modern Neal fascism that Trump and many around him have been promoting\nHelen which are part of so far saying the system as Saudi granted the owners kinda electron dictatorship\nWell that's the way many dictatorships come to power you know of course Hitler is the most extreme and the most famous example he got in through the electoral route\nBut in many countries you have situations where you have rulers who have been elected\nWho don't even need to impose a dictatorship but who were able through the use of the existing institutions to create the kinds of terror that you usually associate with dictatorship for example in the Philippines to charity\nAmerican reporters will sometimes referred to do ... as a dictator because he has presided over thousands literally thousands of assassination of poor people in the poorest neighborhoods in the guise of an anti drug program he is terrorized in jail political opponents\nBut he's not a dictator he was freely elected\nHe won overwhelmingly in the elections until recently he was doing very well in the polls in terms of his is public approval ratings he's using not dismantling the existing Philippine democratic institutions but yet he's ruling with\nUnless he or is it fair to say that foreign policy in this country is dictated that the people have almost no\nInfluence that most of the civic groups consumer labor environment they work on domestic issues they have virtually no impact of foreign labor unions don't either\nSo let's carve out parts of our political economy let's start with foreign policy which is about as long as soon as it's ever been in American history both Obama and Trump have declared that they can\nViolate any nation sovereignty drone warfare special forces going into over a hundred countries last year for example military bases everywhere\nNo declarations of war the Libyan overthrow it spilled into Africa and norms violence to this day and chaos there was no declaration of war that was Hillary's or by the way\nRobert stand by Obama opposed by secretary of Defense Gates\nAnd there was no appropriation of funds no authorization of funds is a total criminal operation the way the criminal invasion of Iraq was with a lawsuit over one million\nIraqi civilian lives and still huge chaos there\nSo it is it fair to say that U.S foreign policy is a dictators policy under both parties with almost no public influence cut to counter it no judicial court influence no congressional influence and those civic influence back home\nI Would say\nNo regarding the American public but yes regarding the world the United states is a kind a world government\nBecause U.S forces you'll free to intervene in any country in the world without the approval of the local populations and certainly without the approval of the UN or being in compliance with Internet\nGuatemala people anywhere have absolutely no say in what the US chooses to do to their country on the other hand\nUnited States citizens do have potential power it's less than they do on domestic crunch because as you just ... the U.S Congress has been giving away\nForeign policy making power to the White House systematically for decades now and the president has more and more\nArbitrary power so that on when you can send a drone he can set off a bomb you can send us troops any country anywhere he wants without congressional approval but\nWhen I was running as a Green Party candidate I gave all leads to both parties are not willing to accept is still ongoing Nader dot org off the two thousand eight presidential campaign these are majority ... we're not talking about UFOs here\nWe're talking about bread and butter issues where people live work and raise their families whether they're Republican and Democrat\nAnd the Democrats can share up some of these blue collar workers went for the Reagan regime and have been voting Republican\nSo that's my contribution and the way the Democrats are pursuing now's the following they're trying to obstruct Bernie Sanders type candidates and they tried to obstruct them in the primary just the way they obstructed Bernie Sanders and new presidential campaign in Nevada\nIn Iowa and elsewhere and number two the old guard is still in power in the Democratic National Committee and people like below sea Steny Hoyer and Chuck Schumer really bungled the Kavanaugh nomination\nSo this is where we're at you you can't even have them save themselves and so people have got to make demands on the Democrats that are winning demands and if all they are concerned about\nIs the stuff that's on CNN and so on they're going to be ...\nContinue the effort to have the Democratic base take over the Democratic party\nAnd expel the corporate and consulting class from power from its current control of the Democratic party but at the same time\nEven if the Democratic party does not take that very good advice you were just giving even if the candidate the senator congressional candidate in a given the district is the one most closely aligned with corporate interests\nI Would say on this November six you go and vote for that Democrat anyway\nEven though you fought them in the primary even though you will fight them afterwards because this is a moment of absolute crisis for the future of American politics\nWent up and down there was an article and washed post recently were not vote yet\nSome people are so disgusted with both parties are going to stay on chocolate what to talk we're seeing on guy you want to just stay home that's why they don't want universal voting as a way it is an Australian what's your profession on that by the way\nOh I think universal voting would be a good idea I think universal voter registration that's something that the Republicans and the rights fears but it's not a panacea\nAustralia with universal boating has a right wing government at this moment and they just changed prime ministers and they brought in a guy who is a mild version of a Trump style leader what's needed is first massive organization before election day\nAnd then matched with voting in the early voting and on November six this is a turning point moment we already have minority rule in this country we do not have anything resembling\nDemocracy the Kavanaugh agenda which will now prevail on the Supreme Court is opposed by a majority of Americans the Senate that confirmed him for the seat is Senate in which the Kavanaugh Trump position\nIf the Republicans have both houses of Congress on November six that structural rigging were increase radically and as hard as it is now where the majority of the American public to have any say not just in foreign policy\nBut didn't wage policy in global warming policy in equal rights policy in any kind of policy as hard as it is right now it will get radically harder if the Republicans exceed on holding onto both houses of Congress they have to be stopped even if that means momentarily\nUsing the tool of what is still a deeply deeply flawed in heavily corporate influence Democratic Party\nWell not only that but they have the cover of the five corporate state judges on the Supreme Court they have five to four majority now\nThat will rubber stamp the corporate state rubber stamp violations of civil liberty criminal wars of aggression massive government bailout of Wall Street and get more power to Trump\nAnd even block Congress liberal bloc Congress in that respect you know they have these two convenient doctrines Allen there and\nOne is the courts say oh this invasion of Iraq without a declaration of war we don't have anything to do with that it's a political question between the Congress and President George W. Bush and the other technique they have is that people who challenged these criminal\nActions by the U.S government have no standing to sue so they're abdicating their judiciary role here as a final arbiter under the constitution\nAnd the Congress as abdicating because they don't want the responsibility and for decades have been shifting power unconstitutionally to the White House lawn oppose hypothetical somebody said to you right now there's a hundred million dollars that can be spent on this November election\n... and can't districts in states in United States which are to take\nI give it to the organizers and put them in the field in support of the Democratic candidate to prevent the consolidation of this neo fascist minority rule and the point you were just making about the Supreme Court\nIf the Republicans retained control of the Senate\nThere is a very good chance that that five to four rate is majority that you were just describing so well will become a six to three or maybe even a seven to Republican majority are radical right is majority it\nHas the potential to slip completely out of reach and the same thing can happen in terms of complete dismantling of the voting rights act complete dismantling of the civil rights laws further radical gerrymandering to put the house in the future out of reach\nAnd I think a potential danger of revival of the Nineteen sixties in Nineteen seventies style FBI tactics of attacks on domestic distant\nI don't think that the ruling a chronic foreign says in this country have any self restraint aren't afraid they can push him so far but the massively not juice consumer demand tank the stock market and develop the unpredictability not to show the swing of our\nI don't think they have much restraint but who knows and we shouldn't be dependent on that we shouldn't be dependent on the wins the American oligarchs we should fight to reestablish majority rule and that's really what this election is all about the United states has minority rule now and the rule of a privileged\nMinority and whipping toward a point of no return where\nI was in you know let me interrupt you Allen Allen knows how fragile democracies are from his coverage all over the world well I have is fragile democracy perhaps as some other guy\nForces advise him have done just so hard look what's happened to the nomination process as Supreme Court I proposed a cabinet I'll watch a small group of people who watch dog the five corporate status on the Supreme Court\nAnd challenge their refusal to recuse themselves for conflicts of interest challenge them further decisions publicize their decisions\nAnd rain recognize that they are a political group of jurors that provide plus abilities and cash trees and the kind of smooth rhetoric in their decisions to cover up what they're really doing\nWhich is implementing enforcing the concentration of power in the country and fewer and fewer\nAnd let me put another hypothetical in front of you wonder if you're at ten million voters who are leaning democratic and\nThey were asked the following question what'd you say to the Democratic candidates will vote for you\nOnly if you come out for a living wage and full Medicare for all or will vote for you anyway because the Republican fascist are so much worse\nI Would say you would try to threaten them we will vote for you only if you come out through the living wage but then is that even if they don't come out with a living wage the situation is so dire that yes you vote for them any way because the Republicans are that dangerous\nBut you wouldn't want the challenge to come so that the vote for the Democratic party is one that has some progressive pressure\nAbsolutely I think the Democratic party has to be the leadership of the Democratic party has to be essentially overthrown within and you know it's worth noting that very surprisingly at least me grassroots\nNational Committee in the fight for the

which has been fighting for the rights of passengers ever since our next guest was a part of that might that change the tarmac policy\nAnd now heads this group David\nI've been through that it's unbelievable the claustrophobia Paul Hudson has been a groundbreaking public interest advocate for over Thirty years in the Nineteen seventies in energy and utility policy during the Nineteen eighties

and the aviation consumer action project today is the president of flyers writes\nPlease put your seat into an upright and locked position as we welcome back to the Ralph Nader radio hour Paul Hudson that very much for having\nA welcoming painful Hudson I mean you're an example of a one person\nCan make a tremendous difference and how it's easier than we thing\nBut you're also an example of a consumer advocate that's had a very difficult time getting airline passengers around the country to support\nThe small but very effective group called tyrants rights\nSo why don't you tell our listeners just tell them what you and I'm very very tiny number of other people have accomplished in Congress and on the FAA to make life better for them cry on the airlines every day getting to their destination\nWell thank you route I guess the first thing that you aren't as Asian dead and in two thousand nine ... said it and getting what's called a three hour rule enacted that meant that the airline that not keep you on the tarmac more than three hours without\nHad a number of other victories in terms of getting the increase in baggage last compensation and most recently our our biggest issue is seat has\nPretty much everyone knows it's been flying the last ten years since I've been getting smaller and the average passengers getting somewhat larger\nIn fact a lot larger and so three years ago we filed a petition\nWith yet they have to have some minimum state standards\nThey rejected it and we went to court the court more or less the grade with us it went back to the agency they rejected it again and now Congress is enacted something requiring them to look at it again so we're hopeful that we get some strong public support we're going to see a reasonable\nAccommodation or\nPassenger not the way the airlines would like to be with the way where they are right now anyone or were six foot two or two hundred and fifty pounds or\nIf you're into one third almost one third category that's unfortunately rated obese you simply cannot get into the state there are health issues as well as top British ships\nWe worked on a number of other issues but all overall approach is that a reasonable regulation and to encourage more robust competition to get better service and to lower\nDinner service and to lower the cost of air travel that was the promise of deregulation but unfortunately it hasn't always worked out that way\nThe Congress the main concern of passengers who complained to their senators and representatives are these crazy fans are United American but not show was put on people two hundred dollars for reservation change for example\nEver higher baggage fees for\nEven though and most instances southwest doesn't do the only thing itself was a guy from enough credit you see a lot of these reporters they come down hard on American United delta and doing these things go jing passengers\nWhich I don't have a couple of paragraphs said well you know southwest doesn't do these things and they're making money\nYes south west just kind of in the national niche date however generally are not a carrier that flies\nOutside the United states they also have a system where you do not have reserved seat and that turns awesome people and there's a variety of other things southwest does not allow their age their ticket prices to be advertised on the Web sites where most people were like\nSo a lot of this this is limiting it\nBy south West is quite profitable other airline however have taken a different tack they're following what is being done in other industries I can think of banking for instance they used to make most of their money with interest now they make as much or more with the\nAnd the the thing is allowed under current law for a couple of reasons why\nThere is no definition of what a ticketed clue no legal definition\nSo an airline could advertise a ticket price for one dollar\nAnd everything else to be she now why would they do that while they do that because it would give them on a marketing advantage they would come up and it's the cheapest one but also fees are tax exempt\nThere is no ticket tax applied to shape so the airlines get a big increase in their bottom line for that reason as well\nAnd it's been a progressive flyers writes simple Hudson who succeeded in doing this you can get into bumping compensation\nWhen you got a confirmed reservation you go up and years ago the ... just bumped you say oh you know the plane is full to bed you see what I have a component reservations to bad the plane is filled with they tried to do that with me once on a flight from Washington to Hartford\nAnd I took it to the Supreme Court and I won nine nothing and the Supreme Court ruled that there could be regulation of the so now people who show up was confirmed tickets and they say the plane is foe\nThe airlines have to inside the plane before the doors closed\nOff for passengers to go on the next flight and they can give them compensation and now that compensation can go as highs four hundred to eight hundred thanks to pull Hudson and flyers right Paul how can people find out more about flyers rights\nTo join to support to pay their dues and get a huge return in terms of reducing some of the anxiety and some of the stress and the frustration and sometimes anger that airline passengers
