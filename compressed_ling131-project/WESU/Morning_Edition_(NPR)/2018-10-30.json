he said that when the police came he had to bargain with them they told him he had to give a passage suitcases or to bike\nHe chose to keep both bikes so they took three of the suitcase throwing them into a garbage truck directly in front of them\nA social worker came afterwards he said and when he told them what had happened social workers that they're not supposed to do that the worker gave Jake up a business card told them to call report the incident study my\nWhen I asked about what happened to Jacob or junior ... formerly of the mayor's office said sometimes city officials might need to dispose of people's things but they shouldn't be throwing them away for\nWe do have to clean the streets because that that's the reality of living on the streets and we want to protect the health and safety of those that are living on her street almost\nHope teams they're made up of homeless outreach workers sanitation workers and police officers\nThe idea was that police officers would receive special training on the laws governing homelessness like ordinance fifty six eleven and how to deal with the homeless population on the program first started was pitch to cops acting like social workers\nAre LAPD officers are out there twenty four hours a day so they've already been engaging with people that turned in homelessness and trying to connect and to serve it that\nAre doing it as a hope teams the special teams of police social workers and sanitation workers they've helped the city to reach more people looking to expand that program\nAnd our team is going to encampments that many outreach workers don't feel safe going into it\nBut some advocates dispute the notion that social workers need a police escort I think that's just ridiculous this is a ... a public defender in Los Angeles based activists\nI worked in criminal defense for six years I've gone into all manner of encampments a ... you know drug houses whatever in a suit and tie and I've never felt threatened even ones\nIn general do gone from LA can says police presence might actually hinder outreach workers ability to connect with the homeless population\nWas skin hell out of people because they're nobody want to talk to you would you walk in the ...\nThe goal should be to remove police from homeless outreach entirely build on says not asked police to act like social workers you\nDon't need to polling do always poll we already said is not social work\nRoad people ... don't even expelled goof to do that than me pull especially folks with mental disability we know the hero in front of you know identify the people that are most in need of you're not even going to be able to ... within ...\nPlus ... the public defender says he's seen first hand how police involvement in homeless out\nWell off or wouldn't even be ticketed things like\nBeing in the park after hours being you know having an open container and people get arrested for these things are they getting bailed but\nBecause they have a history they probably of failures to appear are due to lack of funds lack of transportation et cetera uh and as a result wind up spending a disproportionate amount of time in jail on these minor offenses\nCan tone of experience is borne out by the facts are recent analysis from UCLA research project called million dollar hood found that an overall the rats in Los Angeles have gone down I rest of the homeless population has increased\nHere's UCLA researcher Daniel deeply you know it's like really startling that I think that about Nineteen point six percent\nOf the arrest and the first half of twenty Seventeen were out of house with people um that's about one in every five harassed where as you know ... people according to the last homeless count make up less than a up one percent of the city's total population\nSo that inequity is just huge and do we said looking at the criminal charges homeless people face paint vivid picture of how homelessness and poverty are being criminalize the top five charges that we found were failure to appear\nPossession of a controlled substance a supervision or parole probation violation petty theft and trust passing and these charges accounted for over fifty percent\nOf the house with the rats in the first half of twenty Seventeen so the majority of arrests of house with persons are for these types of non violent crimes and really are reflective more of the condition of poverty\nEven the LAPD own statistics found that in the first two quarters\nUnder six hundred and forty seven people about a third of the LAPD the rest of homeless people city wide during that time LAPD homeless coordinator commander Dominic choice that Iraq numbers may have actually been even higher than that he was working on re analyzing the data to release arrest numbers the heat that would be more inclusive and choice either\nCourse police are arresting people when they go to in camp but that's their job to enforce\nWell the comment that there's more enforcement as always ... and of course because of their new officers on history and there'd be no enforcement right\nBut that didn't mean he would stop sending out teams to homeless encampments Detroit side\nBut I'm a I'm not going to I was when I was just to stop because it's human nature if somebody's asking for help and they can prevent it you know they they will [noise]\nNumbers from the LA homeless services authority or lost a show that the hope teams may actually be connecting more people with services than the LAPD numbers reflect over roughly the same period as the LAPD report lots of that it hoped to play it's about a hundred and sixty people in some form of housing\nBut activists argue that could happen if law so workers went on alone without police and a recent study by the national Law Center on homelessness and poverty found that relying on police as a response to homeless encampments both expensive and in effect here the executive director Maria ...\nAnd it will not solve the problem\nThese sweeps mean that people can lose hard to replace documents an identification that they need to get into housing Oscar any size cops being there makes it more likely that people will get arrested and having an arrest record can also make it harder to get into housing\nPlus ... says it's expensive to live on cops out on a regular basis and she says the evidence suggests that it doesn't help\nOn it will not to eliminate the encampment and it will make life for her to people who are living in it but like\nThese are going to have interactions with people experiencing homelessness regardless of whether there's a whole project or there isn't again that the first call that concerned community members business owners homeowners are going to make it to LAPD because often it's\nHard to know where else to turn like I said at the beginning I I don't think that we can rest of our way out of homelessness I don't think we can enforce our way out of homelessness\nSo yeah I Would obviously like to see a lower number of arrest the lower number of citations but again I I Do believe that it is lower than it would be otherwise [noise]\nBack at the Korea town and cat network ... she said that the street she lived on is always filled with trash\nArbitrage if you look at the foreigners out at the very\nNeedles all kinds of\nFor months at a time and then they do the cleaner and it's a joke it's built because all they do is what they really do is they come over here\nOne time she said she stood out on the street waiting for a garbage truck to come by so she could fly get down and ask them to pick up the trash\nSo I stood out there I had sit out there for a whole week I asked him if all we had a knife and\nCan you actually took ... it's like why can't they get to\nAre they're not allowed to there's got to stop or do they not give up\nThat wraps up this edition of making contact\nThanks to this week's contributor Carl agreed\nTo making contact team is executive director Lisa Redmond audience engagement directors to being blazing staff producers needed Johnson money can Lopez and ...\nDevelopment coordinator engineer or take\nYou're listening to W. you idiot point one FM Middletown, Connecticut\nListener supported hard Connecticut thanks for your continued support of this radio station\nAnd so for the last ah almost two weeks\nThe Saudi Government denied that it knew anything they said he came in and he came out of course there was no camera footage of him having left and his fiance had been waiting and waiting and waiting at looks like now they're going to announce that\nIndeed they didn't kill him but it was an accident it was done right by rogue elements in the government even they were supposed to kidnap him and bring him back to Saudi Arabia and other things went badly and instead he was killed\n... summer as tourists a bit about Donald Trump and his administration's response to the allegations against Saudi Arabia for the charge of the murdered ... there's been a journalist Jamal ...\nThere has been quite an outcry in the United states even from very conservative Republican Congress people like Lindsey Graham\nOr who said there would be hell to pay or like Marco Rubio who said we'd have to recalibrate our relations with Saudi Arabia Mike from Donald Trump first it has been silenced then it was downplaying it\nAnd then it was saying that well no matter what happened we're not going to want to cut off weapon sales because that's jobs and a lot of money and the\nUh those orders would just go to the Chinese and the Russians and then he throughout this idea of maybe it was a rogue element which really set the stage for what the Saudis are going to make up now as their excuse\nSo all along he's been trying to either make this story go away or cover it up\n... in your view what is the proper response of the United states here to ah what almost certainly was\nOnly on weapons sales to Saudi Arabia but immediately stop a aiding and abetting the Saudis and the horrendous war in Yemen they should impose sanctions on anybody who is involved in this a heinous act and\nKilling the a journalist and they should stop 'em\nIntelligence cooperation with the Saudis and uh I think then there's also an issue about businesses and businesses\nReally should severed ties particularly those businesses that are hired to be foreign agents in the Saudi Government and they're over two dozen of them I and then there's also the responsibility of the think tanks the universities in the United states it receives Saudi money\nAnd the high tech companies that have been courting large investments from the Saudis are all these kind of connections really need to um\nBe rethought and then on the larger issue or what really would be the uh positive silver lining that could\nPossibly come from all of this is a rethinking of U.S policy that has been one\nThat is focused on the interests of Saudi Arabian Israel instead of the United states and its drag the United states in two wars it shouldn't be in a put the United states on a collision course would be run that uh is hurting\nMany Iranians because of the draconian sanctions for could also lead us to another war there\nSo I think with the American public now having somewhat of an understanding of how repressive Saudi Arabia is um perhaps it is a moment when we could create some distance between us policy in the interests of the Saudi Government\nThat was my dear Benjamin cofounder of ...\nLearn more about Saudi Arabia human rights

the nations of the world have only at ten to twelve year window to take action to eliminate an increase in global temperatures below one point five degrees centigrade\nThe report concludes that an increase beyond one point five degrees will substantially increase the likelihood of disastrous drought wildfires crop failures flooding extreme weather events and coral reef destruction\nThe report lays out the case for urging international action to limit a rise in global warming to reduce carbon in greenhouse gas emissions the recommended measures include increasing the cost of burning fossil fuels re forest station\nChanges in land use moving to electric powered transport systems and the adoption of carbon capture technology\nYour reporter spoke with Michelle Chan friends of the earth vice president of programs who discusses the warnings and recommendations founded the un climate change report\nAs well as the political obstacles in the U.S where President Trump and the Republican Party that controls all branches of government refuses to acknowledge or take action to address climate change\nIn twenty Fifteen at the Paris climate talks countries agree to a couple of calls and the first one was held in at the increase in global average temperature to\n... degrees below pre industrial levels and then the second goal is to try to stay under one point five degrees centigrade and said that's report which was prepared by hundreds\nOrder to describe how the impacts on earth and two people would be different between these two different scenarios to degree temperature warming\nVersus one point five degrees\nOf warming and so that was what the report set out to do and one of the things that the report says that you know even if the world doesn't emit one additional kind of greenhouse gases even if we were just stop today that were already on a path\nTo increase in global average temperature is by one degree and this level we have to remind ourselves\nAt this level people are already suffering and dying because of climate impacts and then the report goes on to describe what would happen the difference between one point five degrees of warming and two degrees of warming and I can get into a couple of examples if you'd like\nCould you cover for some of the most dire warnings here that we're the consensus those scientists across the world\nRight well they go through um a number of different project that impacts between the one point five versus\nTwo degrees scenarios and for example if we only one by one point five degrees Celsius then it means that sea level rises won't be as high and that would mean we could avoid displacing like a million people says went up to two degrees that would be\nTen million people already you know would be essentially forced to move\nAt one point five degrees the science says that will lose maybe Seventy percent of our coral reefs instead of Ninety nine percent of them so I mean one point five even though that's the goal of the world is shooting for\nStill is um I'd hopping we devastating for the state of our coral reefs and our oceans but at one point five degrees of warming instead of that too we can help prevent what scientists call feedback loops these feedback loops create run away climate\nHe's into space and the more Arctic snow we lose then the more the earth absorb that heat and then the more melting is caused and then there's less snow and less\nSunlight reflected back in so that just creates a vicious cycle or a feedback loop\nAnd so the report goes and interest chronicles all of these different scenarios I'm likely scenarios likely impacts between one point five and two degrees and it's very very sobering to to say the least\nI'm it says that technologically if we go over one point five degrees then we will need to increasingly rely on technologies that suck carbon out of the air and a lot of these technologies are just completely unproven and they could be hugely risky\nWilma show when you look at the advisory here to the world in terms of the dramatic action that will be necessary to stay under that one point five degrees centigrade rise in temperature across the world\nHow realistic is it that that could actually happen in terms of political will a technology alternative fuel systems in the like\n[noise] yeah um it's a great question Scott because ultimately are friends of the earth believes that\nWe need political and not just technological solutions to tackle climate change this report that the IPC put out was pretty technological I didn't seek to really answer the big hairy questions about whether or not for example we can get corporations and big oil companies out of our government\nUm as they are blocking us from making these radical transformations in our energy food and economic systems that we all need at the science says we need right so um it's a really good question about how to tackle this from a political perspective and
