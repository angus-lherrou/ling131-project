{"month": "10", "state": "CT", "station": "WESU", "content": "Listener supported Connecticut thanks for your continued support the bill rigging which make it all pop\nPressure of theoretical physics at City College anti graduate center of the city University of New York and this is exploration every week and exploration we discussed a fascinating world is science center impact on society and today we have two very special guests talking about\nInnovation and the future of progress and technology [noise]\nYou know just last month there was a major report coming out\nStating that American students once again score near dead last among students in the industrialized world in fact our students compared to students from Jordan scored just a little bit better in terms of math and different kinds of reasoning skills\nNow the report had a summary of the report said that this is unsustainable\nI mean how can you have a great industrial power which graduate students were simply cannot cut the mustard in the new technological age now of course there's unemployment in the world today everybody knows that however it did you also know\nThat there are plenty of jobs out there unfilled jobs\nJobs that are just begging to be filled high paying jobs but unfortunately they're not enough American students to fill those jobs in fact this report says that there's actually been a decline\nA decline of the cognitive skills of our students compared to the past and especially compared to students in China\nAnd India and throughout the developing world well that's why in this hour we're going to talk about invention innovation science science is the engine of prosperity although well we see around us yet it comes from labor it comes from hard work\nThat comes from a trumpet doors it comes from visionaries and dust your list\nOf prosperity and the question is will we continue to graduate young kids that can keep us at the forefront of innovation and wealth and prosperity well we have two very special guest today\nThe first special guest is Randall Strauss who recently wrote a biography of the greatest innovator of modern times Thomas Edison we forget the Thomas Edison pretty much created the twentieth century in terms of household appliances in terms of power in terms of entertainment\nAnd it's something that we should emulate it's something that we should try to learn how was it\nThat Thomas Edison who came out is practically a penniless kid could achieve so much in his lifetime and then the second half of exploration of bringing her bring on somebody who was at the forefront of innovation itself\nMIT professors that Lloyd who is pioneering something called quantum computers which some people think could be the new technology of the twenty first century now of course a lot of hurdles that have to be negotiated before we have commercial quantum computers but once we do\nPerhaps some time in this century it could create a second industrial revolution quantum computers can leave ordinary computers in the dust\nNot to mention the fact that ordinary computers are beginning to flatten out now Moore's law which says that computer poverty doubles every Eighteen months is slowing down and we need something like atomic computers molecular computers quantum computers to save the day\nWell once again our first guest is Randall Strauss author of a biography of Thomas Edison and the question is what makes a great innovator\nAnd now I like to introduce our special guest for today he's Randall ... a columnist for the New York times\nAnd he's written a delightful new book called the wizard of Menlo Park or Thomas Alva Edison invented the modern world that's right invented the modern world\nWe're talking about the man who invented the phonograph invented the light bulb invented the motion picture industry\nInvented the electric power grid and most of what we today take for granted as the modern world and the question is what was the secret of his staff and if you are an ... especially in Silicon valley what kinds of trades can you learn what kind of tips can you learn by studying the light and the mistakes\nOf the wizard of Menlo Park [noise] once again our special guest today is Randall straws\nThe book is called the wizard of Menlo Park and he's a columnist for the New York times\nThe first question for you is how did you get interested in writing a biography of this iconic figure Thomas Edison\nAbout ten years ago I wrote a biography of Steve Jobs\nI was looking at jobs as attempt to have found a fact that company after apple and he was a big fan of medicine\nAnd in the course of doing research for that book I kept running into at a friend's name and then the book the fault that which was about Bill Gates and Microsoft again Iran and to ... I think it's fair to say that anyone working and the high tech\nThat uh that that to be inventors are contributions that fed up the infrastructure and also set up a bottle of the inventor slash businessperson the tech savvy entrepreneur\nAnd also served as an inspirational example for today's a successful entrepreneurs yeah\nOK and well let's talk about his early years ah of course he wasn't born rich or he didn't have a scientist professors that parents and yet he's a self made man that changed the world so what about his early years\nHere we have virtually no formal schooling or he was home schooled for a few years by his mother\nA but not for very long at all and was a selling a part ... selling fruit and a snack or on a train or as a very young boy a and he was self taught and I think one\nReason we have a long uh\nBeen curious about his\nEarliest years is because he was really the last you might say the last\nA prominent figure in a technical field who could get away with absolutely no formal schooling or in a way he was an exception than\nA and he has remained a curious figure uh it says if the more formal training that is needed in a given scientific or technical field the more interesting the Edison counter example is\nGuess he shares some similarity with a Michael Faraday of England who was also self pot and born into poverty was a book binder and became one of the greatest a scientist of the Eighteen hundreds I guess there's some\nHe is not interesting has a he had six children up and two of them went to MIT oh one did not complete his degree but he's very youngest son\nOr theater or did complete his degree and actually do some graduate work and it's interesting the contrast between the a formal training or that the father received compared with his youngest son\nSo in the course of two generations we see a change a very dramatic change in what is necessary or being a educationally equipped to ah create new say\nOkay well let's talk about his great first grade invention which we take for granted but you could tell us a little bit about that shock that people felt when Edison invented the photograph\nIt did come as a shock and we've lost that sense of all that was a present when the very first ah witnesses to this miracle all heard it for the first time pilot the\nShock was this is a call the mentioned it was a small device essentially it was a film that was mounted a crank and a sheet of Penn fall was wrapped around it at a stylist was placed on top\nOh and the spouse was connected to a very very crude device or\nOr they had a lot of fun with this to a not just trying outlandish materials to see what would work and it would be a a a strip of a ball [noise]\nBamboo that would turn out to be the basis for the first generation of really a workable a incandescent bulbs up the other thing about this story that I think uh it's interesting to look back on was how\nIt was not informed by a a scientific theory or at the time it was termed a cut and try that is just try everything oh today we would ah more close we say throw everything was stopped against the wall and see what sticks\nOh gee if I had been a fight with the term methodology really the absence of a methodology\nOff is not going to be a serviceable model for ah the institutionalization of invention that's going to follow medicines career he's going to be the one who makes F. and appealing kind of story book\nTo invention but it's not an approach that\nCorporations are going to a copy as they institutionalize the bench\nOkay let me ask you about a famous story about Edison I he was suspicious of people with fancy degrees from college and\nHe was going to hire according to the story this one PHD and he asked him he asked him to calculate the volume inside a light bulb okay so this PHD candidate got out you calculus ten and after many many hours came out with a number or that approximately the volume inside a light bulb\nAnd then edited simply got delightful put it under a faucet put water in the ... and then simply weighed the water and got the calculation within ... seconds just to prove that you don't need so much book learning is that really true\nThat is a true story I saw several different accounts of it up\nWas it involved a actually an employee of cats mob and you have to feel sorry for the\nUh the ph D who ah was hired for his all for his training\nUp out was subject to really what we're cruel a prank up at us and about ... about those who had received a ... graduate Reeve but what received advanced training I she couldn't resist looking for opportunities to\nThis is ambivalence\nOkay now tell us to lose about the motion picture industry\nStop motion pictures are going to be a a passion of his he works on a a\nA camera a that is going to uh advance a field or he's going to uh by uh the rights to use a\nA protecting system are that are really makes possible or\nThe ability of audiences or to see a motion pictures on screen he was not able to invent that himself up and he and his advisors\nOr we're willing to acquire the technology and marketed under his knee or he understood that he had acquired a reputation that are that had commercial value\nAnd just the association of his name made this technology viable credibly competitive marketplace there were a number of competing protection system that we're all jostling with one another he was also\nInvolved in the production\nOf a movie you saw you had a movie studio a aunt or under his name a number of very poor so early early ah movies are very short movies uh were made until he did eventually leave the business uh he\nIn movies as in a recorded sound uh enjoy\nThe\nPrivilege of making artistic decisions about what would get produced a ah what kind of movies what kind of fish and uh would\nA wielding power in to be in in the artistic realms a and he enjoyed that role very much\nOkay let me ask you the key question then what was the secret of his genius was it that he was born that way was it that he simply tried everything under the sun until he got it right what what is the secret of the genius then of course Silicon Valley in ... today trying to emulate\nYou certainly a serial entrepreneur and uh he was very gifted without\nA technical sense of being able to identify the crux of a technical problem ah being able to guide his assistance in a search for solution and in a memory of the\nEdison legit just as it is is the case today in Silicon valley we do remember the successes and we are\nInclined to forget the failures of Steve Jobs is a great example I mentioned I read a book about or his career when you started this second company I Would imagine\nMost people are certainly know of his recent successes as well as his early successes but probably don't remember there was this in trouble about ten years where he tried to start\nOff and failed a\nIn making a a new company that offered a a a workstation\nHyun computer for a a a academic mark in Salt too and the case of adolescence career there are times when he try something and feels out early the most dramatic example was when he left the electric light power business and basically look\nPut virtually all his money into iron ore mine are in a venture that did not work out all that part of being a fury entrepreneur or you will succeed\nBut not always so I don't think that ah the tracks while his excesses at pharmacists failures were glorious failures we can talk about the electric car is what I think of as one of his glorious failures\nWell that can lose our interview with Randall Strauss author of a new book about Thomas Edison and stay tuned for the second half of exploration when we talk about the next generation of innovators\nAnd the question is what can we learn about the spirit of creativity innovation that will create wealth into the future\nI think of the enormous wealth generated by the light bulb and by the work of Thomas Edison and the question is are we up to the task can we create the next generation of Thomas Edison's [noise]\nWell not conclude the first part of exploration stay tuned now for the second part\nWhen we talked about perhaps some of the next innovations may come from New advances in computers like molecular computers and even quantum computers our next guest is an MIT professor professor sat Lloyd will talk to us today about quantum computers\nWhich if we can harness their power could initiate a second industrial revolution\nWe're talking about a generation of computers that would leave the old computers in the ducks [noise]\n\nYou're listening to W E s U Middletown eighty eight point one ... than it does it's good to another W E s U Middletown I Can't tell you a chip on do annoyance pain\nWB issue is supported by Wesleyan University Center for the arts presenting a concert of the vocal music of south India by\nBe by law Subramanian as part of the forty second annual ... festival of Indian music and dance this Friday October twelfth at eight PM in crowd concert hall accompanied by percussionist David Nelson and joined by ... uh not tickets and information at age six zero six eight five\nThree three five five or Wesleyan dot edu slashed the FAA\nWhat's that I hear a record fair and what it means campus oh yeah why of course\nW E s U eighty eight point one Evans annual phone records there is happening Sunday October lord came from a lemon I Am for pm at Wesleyan spec I'm home all information about you can be found W E s UFM dot org\nTip of the iceberg of this rapid improvement\nHowever or it can actually go on forever or for a simple reason that is that computers are governed by the laws of physics and the laws of physics tell you how small you can make things how fast you can do thing\nAnd I'm a ... so if you actually took all the energy in the universe\nGigantic computer or a possibility envisage by a Isaac Asimov and his story at the last question um I was able to calculate using the physics of information processing how big such a computer would be\nUh this computer this universal computer if you like up till now it could have performed about tend to the hundred and twenty ... elementary operations or hops on about tend to the night he bit\nAnd if you actually look at the exponential progressive Moore's law and asked when at what point could the whole universe become a computer it's only two hundred and fifty or four hundred years\nParticipate in a competition than Moore's law couldn't last for more than a a few more centuries\nOkay well let's be very practical or on your desk is a laptop with a pentium chip let's say\nAnd that pentium chip has a layer a layer of chemicals or the smallest later being twenty Adams across plenty Adams across the smallest later in a pentium chip on your desk\nIn Twenty years in fact less than Twenty years\nThat layer will be fine Adams across at the rate at which we're going five Adams across and at five Adams we have to introduce something called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which says you don't really know precisely where that electron is in which case if electrons leak out\nOf the layer your pentium chip judge George marketed and your laptop is now useless and so the question is how small can you make a transistor before you bump up against Adams and at the atomic level everything's uncertain\nYeah well that certainly is something to worry about and indeed if ah entail starts making chip where the electrons are just leaking out all over the place chips wouldn't work so that clearly can't make them by exactly the same design\nOn however it's certainly there's certainly nothing wrong with 'em or nothing against the laws of physics to actually store bits of information at the atomic scale indeed one atom one that um and\nAs a the components of computers get smaller indeed bottom effects like the Heisenberg uncertainty kick in but um maybe we can actually uh uh take advantage of these effects like the Heisenberg uncertainty principle maybe we can turn it from being a bug in through a feature\nAnd indeed that's what my colleagues than I Do when we try to build computers who's a teacher\nSay what's in it for me well the government of course would ask the same question what's in it for us and let's not talk about the CIA\nThe CIA of course is very much interested in breaking codes are they loved to break the code of other nations\nBut many times to break a code you have to have a key\nAnd sometimes the key is a uh the ... the ability to satirized a huge number let's say I have a number with a hundred digits take a sheet of paper and write a random that advantage or as a hundred digits long would fill up many many sheets of paper and then you were asked to factor rise it as a product of two numbers\nWell how would you do that or it would exhaust most computers and some people therefore think that certain codes are safe\nThat it beyond the ability of most ordinary computers to crack a the factories nation of a number that hundred inches long\nBut now let's talk about computing on Adams is it possible that this new generation of computers that Clinton computers that you are pioneering could be able to crack codes that even the CIA cannot crack well it\nIt's possible and indeed uh uh if we could build a quantum computer\nComputer that stored bits of information on individual Adam one with only a few ah ah tens of thousands of quantum bits and\nAble to perform a few hundred million operations which is to say something quite peddling compared with the laptop\nMy lap right now um if we could build a very small caught a computer than we could use these kind of weird features like the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to compute in a different way\nAnd indeed uh uh in Nineteen Ninety four or Peter Shore a Saturday teen teen out MIT showed that in fact you could exploit quantum weirdness to factor in large numbers and break these codes with even a rather small on a computer [noise]\nDigital but what does digital means and what is it the arrows into one zeroes and ones that sometimes we see in the press and uh like if you saw the movie the matrix you saw a bunch of girls and one zeroes and ones what are these arrows and was so what does this so called digital age\nSo so uh uh a zero one is what's called a bit a bit is the the smallest possible chunk\nOf information and it doesn't have to be through and one of famous bits are yes or no heads or tails\nTrue or false or black or white essentially any um any hot thing that can take on two different states to different distinguishable states register is a bit and that's the smallest chunk of information and the way that\nDigital computers work is they break up information and\nTo fit into small chunks of and process it that way\nOkay so if modern society the wealth of nations uh everything we see around us if it's governed by zeroes and ones\nThen let's not talk about too but a quantum bit where Adam's don't have to be in zeroes and ones said they could be zeroes and ones in in between so tell us about about how Adams can be in between zero and one\nYeah so so well as soon as one starts talking about quantum mechanics then things start to get weird uh you know Neal is or famously said that anyone who can\nContemplate quantum mechanics without getting dizzy\nHasn't properly understood it um but ah let's go on any way back a century a little more than a hundred years ago I'm a physicist including Max Planck Einstein Neal sport others realized that there was an essential chunky next to nature a kind of a digital quality that\nThings that people thought of\nA little particles light sound came a little chunks called the phone on\nLittle particle of town\nAnd so at this quantum level things that look continues actually are somewhat digital for instance you could have no photons in a spot or one photo on on the spot or\nYou could have won electron over here or one electron over there and indeed that's how a conventional computer registers bit though with a lot more electrons so you know bucket empty lots of electrons out electrons out of the bucket that's zero bucket full lots of electrons in the bucket that's one now\nIn quantum mechanics so quantum mechanics is the bottom of the world has the digital feature on which is good because that means we can use the digital nature of the world this quantum nature to store digital information but there's another weird feature of quantum mechanics that goes under the name wave\nPolitical duality so just just waves like later made up of particles so things like particles like electrons for instance have waived associated with them the waivers are electrons wave a tells you something about where the electron is also\nIn a digital world ... an ordinary bet you could either have an electron here that the euro or there that's one but in\nThe quantum world the electrons wave can be both here and there at the same time so a quantum bit electron here and\nThere at the same time is a bit that can register in some funky quantum sense but nobody really understands zero and one at the same time Cubans or not either zero or one they can be zero and one\nOkay so let's take an analogy of atop a spinning top everyone's play with them as children and Adam's been and therefore Adams are also like spinning tops and Adams can spend either up\nNow we can have popped that spin up\nPops that's been down in ... it's been in between\nNow these ... these Clinton bids can be between zero and one and they can do that Adams now not molecules of silicon that you see on and the transistor so how would you actually now build a quantum computer let's say that you were an inventor\nHave access to laser beams and magnetic fields and the ability to play with Adams' individual atoms how would you build a quantum computer",
