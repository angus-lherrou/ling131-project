[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only is the earth heating up but what does that mean if the polar ice caps begin to melt\nThe glaciers begin to see\nIf he levels began to rise and we have to have dikes and levees and all sorts of different kinds of the barriers to protect ourselves against not flooded her once again are for a special guest is Peter ward author of flooded or [noise]\nNow I'd like to introduce our special guest for the day after Peter ward is professor of biology and earth and space science at the University of Washington in Seattle the book is rather disturbing\nAnd hitting the bookshelves this week\nThe book it's called the flooded are our future in a world without I stopped\nNow an exploration of course we've had programs about global warming we've talked about the effect on population in on agriculture and on top of the diseases\nBut here's the book is like specifically about how our cities some of our major cities\nWill go underwater or may have to be abandoned because of global warming\nThe book is controversial however it gives you a frame of reference as to what scientists are thinking\nThe levels continue to rise not one but two but by five six seven eight feet above normal what happens to Margaret city [noise] what about warfare between nations when national borders begin to collapse because of mass migration\nMuch more fun project I've been in a rare earth with Don Brownlee I'd rather do astrobiology\nOh well I actually interviewed you either you or wrongly I forgot\nI bet you did a sitting right it just seems to be happier topic to me to put my head and fan but unfortunately I don't think we can do that\nYou know our yeah I don't think so either okay well the engineer gave it to go ahead so let's start with the first question oh the first question that we always ask our guest is how did you as a youth now get interested in science all lead off with that question so uh you know dig back to the ... and are\nThinking about what it was as a child that sent you off in the direction of science\nOkay so the engineers said we're going to start in ten seconds with that first question about you as a youth\nProfessor award Europe professor of biology and earth and space science at the University of Washington in Seattle however as they use what do you do in the direction of science\nWell thanks so much for having me and I think scientists know from an early age that they're going to be scientist so it was indeed youth what got me going for dinosaurs my mother and father were from New York I grew up in Seattle we didn't have a single dinosaur skeleton\nAnd so I was given this guilt treatment that\nI had to be in Seattle and it's my fault or something that are known for Skelton foot that got me going\nOkay and that said you off and how did you get interested in astronomy and earth and space science\nWell certainly started in ... so I was looking at my feet all the time down to the ground but it became evidence I think in the first part of this century or really the end of the twentieth century that there was a great deal to learn about life in space and especially how other\nAbout astrobiology and in the book I've just done now it is deeper history which can inform us about what climate change is capable of\nOkay well the book it's called the flooded earth our future in a world without ice cap so let's start with the ice caps\nThe north pole region over the past fifty years since submarines have visited the north pole seems to have decreased by fifty percent just in the last fifty years [noise] so what is your projection of the north pole and also Greenland going\nInto the future well ... the great dream of the Europeans coming to North America was for the northwest passage and this was a driving impulse to try to find a quick trade route to China\nWe're going to have that but what really I really didn't understand thoroughly enough was the difference between an ice cap and an ice sheet all of the north polar ice cap can melt away and it will have no effect essentially an sea level\nIt is the ice on land the ice sheets which are the biggest which of course are Greenland and in Antarctica\nAnything that melts on those goes directly into the ocean and raises the level of it and the biggest scariest scenario is equivalent to what we call an ice sheet collapse so imagine you have a couple of really warm water and then dumped in about ten or Fifteen ice cubes\nAnd up goes the level that water really fast all that is the scenario for a ice sheet collapse in Antarctica\nOkay well we've heard about what's happening in the north pole her region but in the south pole we have huge chunks of ice breaking off but what does that mean given the fact that most of the ... same stable at least temporarily [noise]\nYou know I've I've come back from two separate trips to Antarctica over the last two years\nIt was melting like crazy when do you have you have both kinds of ice down there and he's got floating ice which again is that melt doesn't matter what you've also got all this ice on land when it melts goes\nDown to the ice rock contacted course and that acts as a lubricant for when you have really a normal is warming stuff that is on the edge of this can have off into the ocean that causes great global change in terms of sea level rise\nOkay and talking about sea level rise a dozen the heating of the earth itself cause expansion of warm water which causes the sea level to rise just the sheer fact that the earth is warming up\nIt sure does it matter of fact if we stop all emissions right now we just went completely emission neutral the ocean is still going to rise in this level because of thermal expansion there's\nBeen so much warming already that the ocean has the leg effect but over the next forty fifty years we could expect nearly a three foot sea level rise if\nOn the temperatures that we have now been continued warming Jones thermal expansion noise at all\nOkay three foot rise without any ice and I guess for every one foot vertical that you'll lose how much horizontal um the coast do you lose\nHistoric cities such as London than any of the cities in the Mediterranean will do everything and anything to try to keep their shorelines that they are now\nBut it it really all depends on where we can stop the\nLook if we melt every single glacier on the planet we have a few of the rise of over two hundred feet that was the case less than Seventeen thousand years ago we know from the deep past that one carbon dioxide has been a thousand parts per million there is no ice sheet\nAnd we're at three eighty three Ninety and climbing\nIt's just that that to me is this book is aspect of it all\nUh other places have gigantic growing areas what happens when salt water begins to intrude upon these growing areas\nAgriculture becomes very dicey\nObviously the San Joaquin Valley is enormously threatened Twenty years ago it was already recognized that there is salt creeping in once again to the level goes up a little salt goes sideways the whole law and if any sort of fall within your soil reduces productivity\nAnd and to the point that you could no longer grow crop plant so this this and what can valley itself as endangered this northern Sacramento Valley is in trouble\nAnd as I mentioned earlier every delta on the planet and all that rise from Southeast Asia those are the targeted places that we should worry about most agriculturally\nOkay and uh well let's be very specific I live in Manhattan\nManhattan is a little bit above sea level or the place where I Am is about I don't know Fifteen twenty feet above sea level however is certain parts of Manhattan are very close to the level a Wall Street for example so what is Manhattan gonna look like and are we going to have to use a system of dykes to prevent the flooding uh Manhattan\nYeah they will have to be some sort of mitigation going on in Manhattan if not for the sea level rise itself certainly for the storm surge again a small level storm surge is the take off point for\nOh I'm Sorry it's a small level silver rise the tick off point for storm surge and in my book I actually did some elevation count for various areas and various streets in New York and not not off the top of my head um I I actually protected winners and losers in New York City borough\nOkay and uh let's talk about Venice I engineers have seriously looked at the problem of Venice a saint Marc applies to the famous plaza is actually under water\nProjects like four minutes\nWell Venice is really interesting because they are putting out into the bay that Venice faces what is\nSort of a non traditional dyke in a way it's not like a single walled little Dutch boy can put his finger and what what is interesting and sort of alarming for Venice is also in Holland is not just the sea level rise is the fact that the rivers behind yourself these these big cities were often built upon rivers\nAnd be caused by global warming\nIt's not snowing in many of the mountains in the Alps and in the Sierra for instance do levels higher\nAnd so instead of snowing in the winter rain and these rivers rise at times they never used to rise before so Venice is fighting a two front war as is many of the Dutch cities\nYou have to worry about the river that runs through you as much as the see coming at you and as any of the military geniuses said two front wars are often hard to win\nSo then it may have to abandon at some point you figure I Would suspect yes\nOkay and your blood goes beyond Twenty one hundred goes to twenty three hundred and beyond\nSo what is the coastline of the world and it looked like now beyond Twenty one hundred I have a map of the world what will school children see ah the north pole dawn on the coastline changing uh what will the earth look like beyond Twenty one hundred\nWell it really boils down to some some simple a geology continents\nAs we know move around in the direction that they move like North America as west coast there are high mountains generally but trailing edges recall them passive edges don't have mountains or they have mountains that eroded away as our east coast does\nBut you've got the enormous Gulf playing you've got the enormous east coast playing in front of the Appalachian there'll\nBe inroads all three\nBut at Twenty one hundred if it's business as usual say were say we kept to three feet it doesn't stop there\nIt keeps going and accelerated fashion so if you have three to five feet by Twenty one hundred is not going to mean that you would have twice that by twenty two hundred you could have three times that the acceleration is the most ominous aspect of this business\nSo let's just do a computer program assumed that at some point we stop a greenhouse gases into the future but we just let the computer program run what will the world look like we'll all the great cities be underwater by then by twenty two hundred twenty three hundred\nNo ice sheets in Antarctica\nThey are spinning and spinning and both Greenland and Antarctica a great deal that water is going in but the ice sheets are enormously sick in both places Greenland is far more endangered than at article is you're not going to the wholesale flooding the city is by twenty two hundred and twenty three hundred which\nPossibly gives us time but your certificate is the effect\nWhere the cities that will have to be a band and I think that will already be taking place\nWe just have to maintain these ice sheets with as much integrity as we can then that means lowering the global warming temperatures which seemed to be inexorable liquid just wants to have this huge recession we should have had two or three years because of the economic downturn\nWhen the missions could have been or should have been reduced they weren't I mean they're right up at the eyepiece these these maximum emission production\nWe're not lowering emissions were increasing admission\nOK Now let's go into the past or you can do that because we can drill into the ice cap and get the ice cores from thousands of years ago or ten thousand years ago we had the ice age it was very\nFine at times similar to what we're going to be experiencing in the future and what did the world look like at that time\nWell the conventional answer is that if we get up to a thousand parts per million which would happen in two centuries from now\nIf we have some sort of control and emissions are a lot of us think that a thousand parts per million would be a lot sooner than that but you are going all the way back to a time called the ESPN\nAnd he is seen was a very interesting time when we had crocodiles up on the north pole we have palm trees and Seattle we just had this wonderfully tropical climate the bad news is is that sea level was two hundred and forty feet\nHigher than it is now because there was no ice there were no ice sheets at all on the planet and when I'm older than\nThis was about fifty million years ago ... we only have to go back a hundred and ten thousand years ago to see a world where sea level was at least ten feet higher than now and then there's great of a ... in Florida\nIn the Florida Keys there was a beautiful Korean wins the key is a national park and you could see big coral heads sitting for five feet above sea level now seek offshore with your mask and flippers did you find the same corals ... they're called\nLiving down about ten feet deep that that's the shallow us they can live\nSo here is evidence that we can date these with radio metric dating that\nA hundred and five a hundred and ten thousand years ago sea level was ten feet higher than it is now and the entire geography of that place was different what caused that short term rise and this was a blip in the ice age was orbital changes\nBut at the same time we had a slight increase in carbon dioxide and these two conspire\nGreat melt enough to produce a ten foot rise in sea level\nThat concludes our interview with Peter ward author of a disturbing new book called the flooded earth and they do now for the second half of exploration or we're going to continue the discussion with David Archer author of yet another disturbing book called the long haul\nAnd once again this is Dr Michio Kaku host of exploration and if you want a copy of today's program called the Pacific a program service at seven three five o two three oh they do\n[noise]\nDo you middle [noise]\n\nJoin us for the W E S U eighty eight point one FM two thousand Eighteen fall community record fair Sunday October fourteenth\nAnd there's you know smoke coming out of the the gun and your partner is sort of a contrarian guy you're you're you're a policeman trying to to you know solve the crime your partner says well I think the chauffeur did it\nBut you know for your partner to convict the chauffeur his first going to have to explain to the jury what the butler was doing with the smoking gun in his hand in other words translating back out of the analogy if we want to say that the warming is not from C. O. two we have to explain what's wrong with greenhouse theory that\nThat a C. O. two should not be causing the warming\nWell if you look at temperatures rises over the last many centuries you see a gradual warming because after all there was an ice age ten thousand years ago but some scientists say that there's a Mike\nMike that is quite anomalous that in taking place in the last hundred years and that's proved that human activity because it's not part of the natural cycle what are your thoughts\nWell there is this large scale glacial hatred glacial cycles that you referred to there's also a sort of a milder much shorter\nSeventeen hundreds was a time of generally cool temperatures called the little ice age so you could you know ice skate and Amsterdam and and and things like that that you no longer can do and that uh is correlated with um\nA dearth of lack of sunspots which indicates that the sun was cooler we don't have satellite solar intensity data going back to the sixteen hundreds but we have observations up a number of sun spots that date back to you know Galileo's and bench or the invention of the telescope in the sixteen hundreds and\nUh there's a correlation between the number of sunspots and those\nSorts of a climate changes I think the climate the evolution of climate up until the seventies though can be explained pretty well a ... by by natural for saying that it isn't until\nTill the seventies that the the climate signal started to the human forced climate signal started to\nCome up out of the noise of natural variability\nNow also some people say that the last decade or was perhaps the hottest decade ever recorded how far back does that go because of course perhaps during the dinosaur euro uh things were a lot warmer back then\nSure sure so there are a thermometer records that go back to about Eighteen sixty from Fahrenheit invention of the amateur or they can piece together um the temperature of the earth going\nBack further than that with what they called proxy records of of of temperature or from the\nWidth of tree rings or from\nChemical measurements they can make in in high scores or sediment corps or something like that and so they can record they can they can figure out that the little ice age was cooler and then there was a period of general warmth before that's called the medieval optimum climate those\nRecords generally go back a thousand or two thousand years and the conclusion of the last\nThe community outside of your own field very useful very very authoritative reports or they concluded\nThat current temperatures are warmer than they have been in Thirteen hundred years but if you go back millions of years you're absolutely right that a during a\nPicky about fifty million years ago the earth was was it felt tropical to the polls and there was no ice anywhere to be found and this is a\nThought to be due to a higher C. O. two levels in the atmosphere at that time we don't have as good a ways of estimating what the CEO to concentration was when you go that far back in time but the evidence that has been piece together is consistent that there's\nSort of ... million year or tens of millions a year fluctuations in the natural C. O. two levels of the earth to the truth\nI don't like that\nNow scientists that I've gone to the polls to extract ice cores are essentially getting I that was\nA deposited or perhaps several hundred thousand years ago to maybe a million years ago yes they see that carbon dioxide levels and temperature levels go up and down in unit then like to roller coasters what does that mean\nIt's rare that you find such beautiful correlations in nature I think it's just astonishing Al Gore showed showed this plot in his movie that sort of highlight conduct it is it's a it's an astonishing thing\nSo Professor archer I'd scored data shows that carbon dioxide levels go up\nAnd down but the temperature of the earth goes up and down and the two of them go up and down like two synchronized roller coasters so what does that mean\nIf the ups and downs of carbon dioxide exactly mirror the ups and downs of temperatures on the earth\nTo a pace the\nProgress of the ice age cycle when the ice sheets are gonna grow or when they're going to collapse but somehow the CEO to concentration of the air follows along with the the changes in climate so that when\nThe robot tells the ice sheet to make the earth warmer the CEO to says okay I can pitch and something to that too and so it amplifies these the climate changes\nSo which comes first the temperature rise comes first and then the carbon dioxide rides vice a versa with the relationship\nA it's a it's a back and forth cause and effect it's a feedback system so to ask which one is driving which\nI think is like asking if you see to figure skaters you know trolling each other around on the ice or you know which it to to try to analyze the trajectory of one without\nPaying attention to the other would make no no sense on the the uh the\n... the transition from the ice age climate to the present day climate the\nFirst thing that started to happen as recorded in\nAntarctic ice cores is a change in temperature in Antarctica and then a few centuries later the CEO to concentration started to rise but then the total change and climate took much longer than\nA few centuries so there's no way you could explain the climate transition from a glacial rural till the inter glacier world without\nInto account the change in the field to concentration so it's it's a it's a feedback loop of cause and effect it doesn't to\nJust one or the other drives\nSo summarizing if you were to go back ten thousand years we had the ice age uh things have been warming up in the last ten thousand years but is it safe to say that recently in the last\nEarly ... the the the inter glacial period is called the Holocene\nA and the early Holocene\nRight at about ten thousand to six or eight thousand years ago may have been warmer than today BP hurts orbit around the sun was a in a different\nYou know slightly different configuration than it is today so it almost seemed like there was at a at a peak in warming and then and then maybe a little bit of gradual\nDriven by the earth's orbit over the over the millennia but certainly over the last thousand years we're we're we're to the\nTemperatures of the last decade\nAre are ah a novelist Hi\nOkay let's talk about the present uh what's happening with glaciers in the north pole and the south pole uh we see evidence of the melting of the glaciers around the earth or that's why scientists are finding so many\nA mammoth bones and email and remain correct plagiarism receding so what evidence do we have that the earth is warming\nWell we just have the thermometers I mean for direct measurements of type temperature thermometers are hard to beat but ah the um\nThe mountain glaciers\nAre almost all melting it's difficult for a\nGlaciologist graduate student to find in advancing mountain glaciers to study anymore because they are very few that are that that that exist um\nThe there's a warming detected in the deep ocean or would not I mean sort of\nI mean fairly deep not all the way to the to the bottom of the ocean but but\nYou can see the the one set of penetrating the ocean or in the high latitudes the Arctic is melting like crazy it's the the sea ice covering the Arctic Ocean is melting much faster than any of the models a few years ago predicted or the year two thousand and\nI'm actually in the southern hemisphere\nIt's not so clear what's going on in the interior of Antarctica it actually is a cooling which is not that that's something that the climate models also predict uh so that's not a discrepancy but the there is also I'm\nNot been a milk back in the sea ice in the in the Antarctic either and I gather there's still some messiness about that issue that that may be a caused by ah changes in the", "show_name": "Explorations in Science", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "05"}
