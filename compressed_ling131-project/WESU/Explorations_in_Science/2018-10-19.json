follow us on Twitter dot com slash our you know\nA website is rising up with ... dot com where you can find all our programs are\nWaller video and audio file [noise]\nYou're listening to W. you idiot point one effort in Middletown, Connecticut\nListener supported for hard to Connecticut thanks for your continued support the videos they should make it all possible [noise]\nWelcome this is Dr Michio Kaku professor of theoretical physics at City College at the graduate center of the city University of New York and this is exploration every weekend exploration we discuss the fascinating well the science and its impact on society\nAnd today leading off we're going to summarize some of the top stories in science or lead story today [noise]\nOr lead story today concern is a very gloomy you and report concerning global warming\nUnless we he the message of thousands of scientists say the United nations were headed for a new normal where is he level rise gigantic hurricanes droughts famines forest fires you name it the earth is going to be afflicted by these things but there is a glimmer of hope\nThe paper also mentioned that if certain majors are taking place now than perhaps we can blend\nThink about the weather the United states had a one two punch in the south\nWhere Hurricane Florence and now hurricane Michael\nHave created tremendous havoc [noise]\nThe Carolinas Georgia devastated by one hundred year hurricane\nHurricane did you have to go back back into the records to find anything comparable and yet here we are in a hurricane season with yes many weeks to go there perhaps there could be more hurricanes working out there\nAnd the question is well the obvious one is there a link to global warming [noise] and then let's talk about outer space\nFirst of all we had a near disaster in Catholic sand where the United states piggy back on the soil you spacecraft in order to send our astronauts to\nThe space station it turns out that the launch had to be aborted just a few minutes after lunch and the astronauts could have perished however\nThe saw your spacecraft had a special ejection mechanism\nAnd they were able to parachute back down to cats extent safely we had to disasters with the space shuttle\nFourteen astronaut perished and the question is do they really have to die I mean we saved the astronaut is just the other day but the question is why didn't we do that but there's a shuttle\nAnd speaking about outer space let's say a few things about new discoveries in the universe first of all we now know that there is a Jupiter sized planet out there called Kepler sixteen twenty five beat\nThat has a moon going around who would've thought not only can we detect extra solar satellites we can now detect satellites going around the satellites\nThe more planets and objects out there to be discovered first of all there's a new object call the goblet and\nDiscovered during Halloween that goblin which is near Pluto sized working out there and the heavens and that points to the existence of planet X. so let's talk about a new entry into our solar system\nAnd then the Nobel Prize the Nobel Prize of course has been mainly awarded to men but hey in physics but in physics and other disciplines women are catching up in particular three people won the Nobel Prize in physics for improvements on the laser\nAnd one of them was Donna Strickland a woman and it points to the fact that in the history of the physics Nobel Prizes\nThis only marks the third woman the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics\nAnd speaking about physics Einstein's God letter is up for sale that's right earlier is sold for three million dollars I had written manuscript of a letter that Einstein wrote concerning his ideas about God and religion\nWell that's big news free resilience over three million\nSome people say it will sell for even more when it's up for auction\nWell let's just jump right into some of the top stories of the past week\nThe big story concerns the weather in South Korea United Nations assembled a team of scientists Ninety sciences wrote this report it was peer reviewed by six thousand scientists\nAdded predicted that in the future temperatures could rise by one point five degrees centigrade by mid century now that doesn't sound like much\nRose one degree Celsius around the earth and now within a matter of just a few decades is going to rise again one point five degrees and this of course is going to have substantial effects on the weather skin affect you and me and the economy\n[noise] first of all sea level rise sea level rise does not necessarily result from the melting of the ice caps no\nMost of the sea level rises due to the fact that the oceans are warming up\nBecause the oceans are warming up hot water expands and it's hot water expands sea levels rise\nAnd we can measure that very accurately because we know to the millimeter the level of sea water over the past decades and yes it turns out that island nations will disappear by twenty fifty and not only that but major cities\nMajor cities could have to have dikes and levees surrounding them or else they'll go either underwater or gigantic storms will hurled tremendous amounts of water over the dikes flooding the city's making them uninhabitable\nI for example if you take a look at Manhattan where I'm taping this conversation\nIt turns out the lower Manhattan probably will be under water in the coming decades and that's where a Wall Street is located and already there's some talk about building super dikes and levees around Manhattan or else the economy of a good chunk of the usa could literally go underwater\nAnd speaking about going underwater the north pole or region is also following\nLarge parts of Canada Alaska Siberia or thawing out an essay about what they release methane gas methane gas frozen in the primary process for tens of thousands of years\nIs our being found in Siberia carcasses of ice age mammoths and why\nBecause of the fact that they were locked locked in the permafrost for thousands of years but the temperatures change and therefore they're going out so we're seeing a change in the ecology of the north pole regions and the south polar regions\nI remember when I was a grad student people would say that the south pole it's a solid rock nothing nothing no to science can cause the south pole to melt or even crack well is cracking it turns out that we see\nHuge chunks of the Larson ice shelf beginning to break off pieces of ice a size of Delaware or baking off the Arctic and this was not supposed to happen for centuries are thousands of years and then droughts\nSalmon flooding\nForest fires a new normal could be emerging\nAnd this is something that's gonna affect everybody you me at the very minimum it means that agricultural prices are going to rise because the fact that foods cannot be grown cheaply because of droughts famines and flooding that's going to affect the bread basket around the world\nNow we're witnessing essentially a new normal with regards to the weather new heat waves simultaneously with new flooding a new normal one hundred years storms one hundred year droughts that's than your normal and speaking of us that\nThe engineers said no don't launched that space shuttle but the bureaucrats that well the president wants a space spectacular he wants to talk by telephone to outer space to Christa McAuliffe a the woman astronaut orbiting the planet earth that was the game plan\nWell it backfired big time and it just goes to show you that cost cutting is one of the least important and most dangerous activities of the space program\n\nWe have news from outer space that's right first of all\nCould begin the process of reaching the moon first we have the less booster rocket sponsored by NASA itself scheduled to launch an unmanned probe around the moon at the end of two thousand Nineteen so write that down the end of next year we're going back to the moon in an unmanned capsule\nAnd after that humans will go into outer space shortly after that but not to be out done we have you learned must who has his own plans independent of NASA\nHe has built not only the Falcon Heavy which was successfully test fired a few months ago that is a moon rocket fully capable of sending the dragon capsule around the moon but he wants to go even beyond that\nNow he has a new rocket called the beer far even bigger than the Falcon Heavy which can go to the moon\nAnd he's paying for it by himself this is amazing private enterprise you learn mosque is a billionaire the billionaire behind pay pal behind Tesla Motors and space sex\nAnd he's selling tickets for the first moon rocket selling tickets and we had a buyer a billionaire Mr ... of Japan a man who made billions creating the Amazon of clothing for the Japanese market\nAnd he bought out the beer far now what is it to be a forest and for well be stands for big are stands for rocket and F stands for well whatever your imagination will take you\nSo the ... very interesting because it's not just a moon rocket is actually a Mars rocket\nIt will be the vehicle that'll take us not just to the moon but also Mars and so even ... has a plan independent of NASA to go to the moon and eventually to Mars\nNot just one seat you bought all the seats on to be a far\nAnd it'll take a few years to perfect now the Falcon Heavy is already ready to go but Musk wants to go to Mars and so he's delaying it and creating there'd be a far that'll go to the moon and eventually to Mars so we have two different game plans the game plan of NASA\nIs to create an orbiter a lunar orbiter that goes around the moon just like the international space station goes around the earth\nAnd from the orbiter called the gateway NASA plans to lunch launch a Mars rocket okay that's playing one\nBut you learn must not to be done has planned to\nHis plan is why bother with the lunar space station what a waste of money why not go directly to the moon in one jump one job beating out NASA by years it'll take years for NASA to construct a lunar orbiter\nBut you learn must watch his shoot directly to Mars we'll we'll see how it goes many\nAre saying that the final thing could be a mixture of these two possibilities of course he's traveled is not so cheap prices have been dropping of course\nBut still it costs a pretty penny to go to Mars and so perhaps there'll be some kind of compromise between the NASA and the Mars program\nAnd speaking about outer space new discoveries about our universe first of all scientists have been analyzing a plan it out there a thousand light years from earth called Kepler sixteen twenty five be\nIt's a rather unusual planet it's about a Jupiter sized planet but it has a moon going around that's right a moon going on\nI mean think about it for a moment our instruments are so accurate now that we can detect a distant planets going around a star eight thousand light years from earth\nAnd then detect a moon going around that plant that's how accurate are instruments are and it means that the universe is much more weird and much more strange than we thought\nOur solar system is the exception our solar system looks quite normal we have circular orbits going around the sun we now realize that that's the exception that's the exception to the rule and so we now know that our solar system is actually the oddball\nSpeaking about odd balls new objects are now being discovered in our own backyard the solar system first of all the gambling [laughter] that's right that's the nickname given into it by scientists discovered around Halloween\nAnd it is a chunk of ice in Iraq beyond the orbit of Pluto about the size of Pluto\nSo we know there are large objects out there and what it's called the ... the ... belt of comments now they're not really planets\nBecause they're small they're mainly icy and they lie in the ... of climate so Pluto sorry to say is not really a planet in the usual sense of the word\nHowever if you look at the orbit of the gobbling\nIt wobbles a little bit meaning that some thing is talking on the gambling and you use computers to calculate what is causing the gravitational wobbling of the goblin it seems to be that a planet X.\nIn other words a new gigantic planets out there now account tax using just computers they were able to analyze the orbits of these objects and\nIs out there now it was not supposed to be that way the Khyber dealt with suppose that consists of comments small debris small chunks of ice the biggest chunk being Pluto but now we have planted acts and so even though we have not observed planet X.\nWe know if it's existed is because of the slight perturbations in the orbit of other planets or like a Neptune and like the goblins and so our instruments once again are so accurate when coupled with computers\nThat we can find all sorts of anomalies in the universe\nAnd speaking about anomalies one system that is causing a lot of interests discovered a few years ago is a tractor system\nSeven count them seven Earth like planets going around a star now it was not supposed to be that way in our solar system we just have the earth which is Earth like which is earth size going around our son\nVenus and Mars are caught outside the Goldilocks zone where you can have liquid water oceans well it turns out in the trap the system we have seven or size planets it wasn't supposed to be that way and I love the seven three\nThree appear to be\n... that are ... just right if he could in fact harbor life and speaking about life the holy grail\nThe holy grail of all of this is to find a ... a twin of the earth and space so far we haven't done that\nBut already we have a handful of very likely candidate that resembled the earth but are a little bit too big however it's now believe that because we find so many planets and because we have a new orbiter are they're looking for them called test test may ...\nSpace and then we'll ask another question who lives on that when I [noise]\nWell I'm afraid that's it for the first part of exploration and the second part of exploration we're going to re run an interview with in noted climatologists talking about the effects of what happens\nWhat happens if global warming gets out of control what happens if the worst fears of the un report or realize what happens when sea levels begins arise when cities become inundated what happens to the human race when the weather goes ...\nThat's what you're talking about the second half of\nAs a wake up call and he bought a copy of today's show called the Pacific a program service at one eight hundred seven three five o two three o\nBut you know for your partner to convict the chauffeur his first going to have to explain to the jury what the butler was doing with the the smoking gun in his hand in other words\nBack out of the analogy if we want to say that the warming is not from C. O. two we have to explain what's wrong with greenhouse theory that that a C. O. two should not be causing the warming\nWell if you look at temperatures rises over the last many centuries you see a gradual warming because after all there was an ice age ten thousand years ago but some scientists say that there's a Mike\nMike that is quite anomalous that in taking place in the last hundred years and that's proof that human activity because it's not part of the natural cycle what are your thoughts\nWell there is this large scale glacial hatred glacial cycles that you referred to there's also a sort of a milder much shorter I don't know if it's a cycle or or just sort of fluctuations but uh back\nSort of between the Thirteen hundreds in the Seventeen hundreds was a time of generally cool temperatures called the little ice age so you could you know ice skate\nA ... a lack of sunspots which indicates that the sun was cooler we don't have satellite solar intensity data going back to the sixteen hundreds but we have observations up a number of sun spots that date back to you know Galileo's and bench or the invention of the telescope in the sixteen hundreds and\nUh there's a correlation between the number of sunspots and those sorts of a climate changes I think the climate the evolution of climate up until the seventies though can be explained pretty well\nA ... by by natural forcing it isn't until\nTill the seventies that the the climate signal started to the human forced to climate signal started to come up out of the noise of natural variability\nNow I Know some people say that the last decade or was perhaps the hottest decade ever recorded how far back does that go because of course perhaps during the dinosaur euro uh things were a lot warmer back then\nSure sure so there are a thermometer records that go back to about Eighteen sixty from Fahrenheit invention of the comet are are they can piece together um the temperature of the earth going\nBack further than that with what they called proxy records of\nOf of temperature ah from the width of tree rings or from\nChemical measurements they can make in in high scores or sediment corps or something like that and so they can record they can they can figure out that the little ice age was cooler and then there was a period of general warmth before that's called the medieval optimum climate those\nRecords generally go back a thousand or two thousand years and the conclusion of the last uh IPC report which summarize climate you know for non specialist and for you know for the the community outside of your own field\nVery useful very very authoritative reports or they concluded\nYou're absolutely right that a during a picky about fifty million years ago the earth was was it felt tropical to the polls and there was no ice anywhere to be found and this is a\nThought to be due to a higher C. O. two levels in the atmosphere at that time we don't have as good a ways of estimating what the CEO to concentration was when you go that far back in time but the evidence that has been piece together is consistent that there's\nSort of ... million year or tens of millions a year fluctuations in the natural C. O. two levels of the earth to the truth I don't like that\nNow scientists that I've gone to the polls to extract ice cores are essentially getting I that was\nA deposited or perhaps several hundred thousand years ago to maybe a million years ago yes they see that carbon dioxide levels and temperature levels go up and down in unison like to roller coasters and what does that mean\nIt's rare that you find such beautiful correlations in nature I think it's just astonishing Al Gore showed showed this plot in his movie that sort of highlight conduct it is it's a it's an astonishing thing\nSo Professor archer I'd scored data shows that carbon dioxide levels go up and down\nBut the temperature of the earth goes up and down and the two of them go up and down like two synchronized roller coasters so what does that mean if the ups and downs of carbon dioxide exactly mirror the ups and downs of temperatures on the earth\nSomehow or the the orbit of the earth around the sun has had these ... in it and that is thought to a case the progress of the ice age cycle when the ice sheets are gonna grow or when they're going to collapse\nAnd the climate so that when\nRobot tells the ice sheet to make the earth warmer the CEO to says okay I can pitch and something to that too and so it amplifies these the climate changes\nSo which comes first the temperature rise comes first and then the carbon dioxide rides vice versa with the relationship\nA it's a it's a back and forth cause and effect it's a feedback system so it to ask which one is driving which\nI think is like asking if you have to figure skaters you know trolling each other around on the ice or you know which is to try to analyze the trajectory of one without paying attention to the other would make no sense on the\nThe uh the deeply the Asian the transition from the ice age climate to the present day climate\nThe first thing that started to happen as recorded in the Antarctic ice cores gives a change in temperature in Antarctica and then a few centuries later\nThe CEO to concentration started to rise but then the total change and climate took much longer than a few centuries so there's no way you could explain the climate transition from\nA glacial world to the inter glacier world without taking into account the change in the field to concentration so it's it's a it's a feedback loop of cause and effect it isn't to\nJust one or the other drives tribes\nSo summarizing if you were to go back ten thousand years we had the ice age uh things have been warming up in the last ten thousand years but is it safe to say that recently in the last several decades there's been a spike in temperature rise and that due to human activity\nThat's more or less true actually the early ... the the inter glacial period is called the Holocene a and the early Holocene\nIt'd be the earth's orbit around the sun was a in a different you know slightly different configuration than it is today so\nIt almost seemed like there was at a at a peak in warming and then and then maybe a little bit of gradual decline\nDriven by the earth orbit over the over the millennia but\nCertainly over the last thousand years we're we're we're to the\nTemperatures of the last decade\nAre are ah a novel of the hot\nOkay let's talk about the present uh what's happening with glaciers in the north pole and the south pole\nUh we see evidence of the melting glaciers around the earth or that's why scientists are finding so many a mammoth bones and you know and remain re plagiarism receding so what evidence do we have that the earth is warming\nWell we just had the thermometers I mean for direct measurements of of temperature thermometers are hard to beat but ah the um the the mountain glaciers are almost all melting it's difficult for a glaciologist graduate student to find in advancing melting glacier to study anymore because they are very few that\nAre that that that exist um\nThere's a warming detected in the deep ocean would not I mean sort of\nSemi fairly deep not all the way to the to the bottom of the ocean but but\nYou can see the the ... penetrating the ocean\nOr in the high latitudes the Arctic is melting like crazy it's the the sea ice covering the Arctic Ocean is melting much faster than any of the models a few years ago predicted a year two thousand and seven was was sort of a train wreck for the\nThe sea ice up there it just it just plummeted\nI'm actually in the southern hemisphere it's not so clear what's going on in the interior of Antarctica\nSo that's not a discrepancy but the there is also I'm\nNot been a milk back in the sea ice in the in the Antarctic either and I gather there's still some messiness about that issue that that may be a caused by ah changes in the\nThe circulation of the atmosphere caused by the ozone hole which is a completely different a sort of phenomenon ozone is like a the greenhouse gas but it also absorbs ultraviolet light and so it heats up the air that at the end in the stratosphere and that's why the stratosphere gets warmer", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Explorations in Science", "city": "Middletown", "day": "19"}
