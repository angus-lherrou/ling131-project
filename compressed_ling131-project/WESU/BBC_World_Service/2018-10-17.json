I Hope that in the European Parliament elections we talk about Europe and not national issues because they tend to be a button\nOn record as I appreciate your historical perspective but here's a quote from a man widely respected around your Pasco Lyman former commission without change and reform\nThe eating you will remain as it is today and his view irrelevant to a majority of its citizens yeah that was an extraordinarily worrying calling from uh Europe file\nYeah it is worrying I mean you could wear yourself to death to do something with us I mean the first part where he is saying reform and he's of course that's essential I mean the thing about being a rather than just hold on a second\nIn art and for example many of us took for granted the thing that lives in customs game without understanding what's meant since breakfast right across Europe because of the debate people are beginning to\nI mean Europe has done that have pets can be brought on holidays smaller to the largest part of how we live today\nHad happened because of the good stuff that you're a dog but frankly and I was a journalist no media is interested in the good things and you're right to focus on all of that and that is in college I Need to be challenged\nBecause that's my job to do that but it not time it's no harm to remind people that went down to the European Union countries may we would not be at the table but we didn't get my facts and have a word and I think we would be in a much more difficult to orange\nRed McGinnis we have to end the famous you very much for the\nDistribution of the BBC will service in the U.S has made possible by American public media with support from fidelity investments taking a personalized approach to helping clients grow preserve and manage their wealth learn more at ... dot com slash wealth fidelity brokerage services L L C\nAnd by the three ...

words the performance that we say is excellent the issue is trying to make that happen for a long period of time to sit here and some rain just she\nProfessor Steve right well pioneers in the industry say these limitations could yet be fixed a new generation of batteries in the next year or two\nCould double ... flying time all the time some of those involved in driving than you tack like engineer every box of the top vertigo era uh playing it safe for now using hybrid technology to power veterans working on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also\nWho are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather designed for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now and then use the hybrids system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be\nAnd what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or as soon as possible and then upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nTo describe who is in the game it's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies then you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in about voting that can absolutely are thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angle to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where you'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of these start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they developed the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big west in the eighties how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across\nNew York or London or Paris if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus puts in Europe\nWhere you have maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board there is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now\nWhat I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power train like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to be an evolution over the long term\nHave aircraft types that grows we took about taxes I think of a taxi is going to be picking me up from I'm In my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably isn't the first thing we're going to be with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the cities that are or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think it's a nice traffic choked cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been open they have passed laws regulations that they have the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nAbsolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the self Palo market very carefully\nRight now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of hell a port on top of the buildings around the city\nAnd so this type of transportation model isn't something the theoretical it actually already exist in one city busy business people five to ten times a year and\nWe all find ourselves in the cities where okay my flight was late getting in and I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get there now on those few times a year when you really need to get somewhere\nIt's really a valuable to you to get up and over the traffic thing\nAre we going to see this revolution you're describing so I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and ... out by saying that I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a box and lost like attack so you are going to see a few cities in the world\nThe city [noise] go that you've you started to deliver this rap and transportation option and then it just starts to grow from there\n... botch of vertigo arrow hair on business day from the BBC\nThat really for the new tax will be when these flying drones become not just a novelty play thing for rushed overpaid business executives\nBut when they are a viable option for ordinary people that you will me well I'm Seventy or eighty dollars up battling to develop the hard way I'm ride sharing tech um ...\n... is investing millions of dollars in infrastructure in lobbying Steve ... says there's a public relations effort underway to persuade ordinary citizens that this could be that future trends pull model as well\nI mean they're doing a great job and galvanizing industry employing everybody together to go after a common goal to get air taxi ride sharing on parity with owning a car which is while it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but brilliant but realistic\nUh you know people would argue with the realism but even if they're close you know there are still going to be people that have a meeting across town and there's going to be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things and it'll be finding places in big cities to land I guess but it's it's kind of thought in Europe in America who isn't going to start somewhere else where about half the regulate three huddle so that's how I\nYeah I think probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong right at the water water bound and super crowded and there's a lot of money there and uh it just a natural fit\nA lot of islands to jump over ... less dangerous for that reason because I mean you're not going to crash onto onto a house if you did\nSo there's an application for this type of transportation\n... besides hyping to pilot flying taxis and a number of western cities Los Angeles Dallas New York or Paris as soon as twenty twenty five but it's not actually unrealistic shut you give them the technical and like a logical obstacles we're gonna have to overcome a professor Steve right from the university the west of England Wallace is the worry\nFirst time we have an accident which can be attributed to machine\nAs you can imagine people kind of lose their mind to it and say we're getting very very carefully because one major accident and they could shut this down in an afternoon it's a real worry and that's providing posed for so for us in the industry back in the seventies I think they used to be\nA helicopter taxi service operating around New York and then I flipped over and killed ... people and\nThey're not really done it since I've they oh what's the Pan Am building wasn't the weather's a helicopter crash that that was cool like us and say again we have problems in developing these these technologies but oddly enough this is one area in which the technology actually solve the problem we've had in the past\nI think the the ... that will pay an easing in period we the public needs to get used to the idea\nSuggested in the same way that we have the the the person walking in front of the car waving a red flag whether that's whether that's I ever actually happened that day that was the early days of ... days advice it raised to vehicles exactly\nWe a if a if a lot and we need to get used to hide days and so once it's seen to be Paul solve our everyday lives\nAnd this is what's possible with this new technology people will it sets it how long will it be how long will it take till we get to some kind of drugs and drug ... taxi\nIs ten to Fifteen Years\nNow the thing is I'd love to be proved wrong in this case because I really will by flying or\nI really wasn't much like taxi but the number of who we go to an should jump through as well in order to make sure this equipment is demonstrably say not will take time in the in the sense that we read and just now deciding which groups we do need to jump through\nProfessor of aerospace engineering the bright and not just about it for this program ... these days flying controls tomorrow\nShe'll be asking how can you switch off from your office when you're not at work your email your
