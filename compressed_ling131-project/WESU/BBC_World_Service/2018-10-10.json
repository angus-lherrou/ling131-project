I don't believe you do a mixed ...\nBut I think oh I didn't back off when you create a community\nPeople come and then join you that's a policy democracy stole the majority they voted for women's lock\nBecause they wanted to\nTo that ... a magical fear with women only where women could say what they want and express themselves\nAnd in the beginning I was really I was very sad about back home flooded I didn't back off I expected that the policy democracy that the majority let's go do know that when you have to uh I have to make the constitution because the comparison invites all\nWhen you want to create change you have to understand the art of flourishing if you burn all the richest behind you cannot be a bridge builder there's no I I really ... that because we have the women's march only\nCan only look very thought I had my life my point was that if it was to create change you have to do it so that when and why and we can to rewrite of those shows like the interfaith marriages gave everyone in the right to divorce we can do these things\nBecause we actually save the electrical found because nobody can criticize that if\nYou are making such interesting points I Need to pick a way I look at it now and go philosophy is fascinating move slowly you say never neo bridges and that by that way you achieve change\nWhat I'm hearing from you is that it is a very delicate insensitive balancing act let's just take one more example I think a number of things who are quote unquote your political opponents on the right to God your stand after that a crisis over the cartoon\nIn a unit is Boston fire I think it was five it first came out anyway that cartoon became a sort of litmus test in Denmark for whether you are supportive of\nFree speech that runs of old opinion or whether in the case of many Muslims in the country you said the defensiveness of dot com tuned to you trumped all else now it seemed\nTo many with that with that that kind of ... and what you do that shit that's not my quotation though I'm not quitting but\nThis is your quotation you said freedom of expression in your view\nBe used more delicately Sam shit when is the dialogue the the ... the cartoonist in this case is claiming to establish a to sounded to many dangers do you actually are defending the rights of Muslims in Denmark not to be offended and will not defending the rights of the cartoon\nNow not on the other hand I with you on that debate I bet that we have to understand we're living in a globalized world and if you're living in a globalized while you have to practice self what tell you what do you want to have a dialogue with people and you're not talking they said that they want\nCentral question what is important for you and why freedom of speech is in a central value to the majority of Muslims in the world\nAnd the ... of the Koran is also and the Central Valley too many Muslims and the world so we we have a group of Muslims who have different principle that they value at the same time so my point is that we have to understand that we have people among us who have\nA value poor it's central to that at the same time so it's not a matter of favoring the secretary of the crime over freedom of speech if the mattress understanding that if you want to enter the dialogue you have to have the stunt that people they have different principles of what a valuable at the same time\nAnd and I I I Do a ... century ... to ... that that you are trying to find a very fine line to conduct your world can you say well you've written a book on and it's all about how you want to see a\nSort of a feminist take within Islam and I understand a lot but you say at the end in a very searing the onus passage at the end of this comes at a price list is not easy\nAnd we have to pay a price if we really wanted to fight for our principles and values and you've paid\nA very personal price which you reveal at the end of the book test it cost you your marriage yes\nTo a man who you kind of drugs is a good man but he was of Pakistani Danish origin his view of his religion was different from yours he felt that you'll find for what you believed in was dangerous to your family and in the end it seems that ruined your marriage wasn't worth it\nYes it was worth it because I think that that so many people they want the rather than ... they support the revolution and they want to change it but they just don't want that to alter all that wife to be a head of the revolution\nIt's tough I head of the revolution and it's impossible to withdraw when you just started it\nBut that has a cost that goes beyond you your husband the coldest your children your wind a family that must be something that weighs heavy of course have died of course at that\nWhen
