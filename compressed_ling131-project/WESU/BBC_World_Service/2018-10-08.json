I didn't\nVolunteer my father was a Presbyterian goats\nAnd sheep patronize twelve years old what are you going to do for a job and I thought you meant a job when I was an adult and what he really meant was what are you going to do now\nAnd he expected me to have a job because he expected me to pay half of my income to my mother for my board and lodging that was my responsibility to let our children are listening to my mind that there is only the um and so my friends Susan\nGulf me a job in a farm shop selling carrots and things and I hated it\nSo I went to cross the yard into the butcher shop and loved it I really love\nTo you because you've written an extraordinary book about your life and career you say that I was up to like ... above and below ... and ... and you're clearly\nIn a way ... oh I loved it it should go into put yourself at the most wonderfully clean\nFinally plane a butcher knows exactly where to place to place to talk to a piece of meat but at the precision there's an art to it\nHer way of expressing her thanks for what you're doing and I've never finds a horrendous situation in the world that has an absence of some humanity somewhere and\nWhat you have to look for because that's what really reassures though for humans are genuinely cable\nWell that you've had to face I'm thinking of the ... on me for example are probably many of us remember how awful\nIt wants to hear that news in in the very end I think of two thousand and four of this this you know what I mean it had destroyed so when they coastal areas from Sri Lanka Thailand Indonesia catching holiday makers local people and hundreds of thousands of people died and you were cold\nWhich I think you decided to send yourself even before you were really cold you went to Thailand to helping the victim identification effort but but it was so overwhelming\nAnd for people who were doing let's say they're collecting bodies and they're pushing them on the ... truck and they were driving them into the fifties and leaving these parties at the temple\nAnd in the ring heat she would have these qualities to it in front of you were ... ... jobs become putting in the heat at your own most most beloved tend to the point that the skin would break\nAnd we had you know I can imagine just flying everywhere um Makin everywhere rap country where it was really ... it's a wonder how long are I think it was the early days in Thailand and pick up the slack\nLet let me change tack a little bit and talk about crime\nAnd here we are to a festival devoted to literature and crime fiction is a huge thing and I know you've become great friends with a fellow skull violent done right there is a great crime writer but she writes a lot in quite gory detail about violent crime and news\nI Believe offer some advice and I just wonder whether sometimes you fear that you run the risk of feeding a somewhat voyeuristic tendency in in us to want to know about how to dismembered body what happens to a body as it as a sort of at Rhodes over time we were sort of\nIntrigued repels\nBut are you feeding a voyeurism in all of\nDone by up to ... author fictional crime that makes things totally unbelievable\nTo me it was important that we are talking about how a ball they can be dismembered\nYou think it's important to get the details of how difficult it ...\nBecause there's so few people will ever become a member and for the chances that what I'm doing is educating them is extremely Clinton\nBut those people who reads forensic novel are probably more forensic clear where than any any part of the public has ever been before\nAnd they can quickly smell like something that doesn't try and rights to want to have the huge amounts of respect for the crime writers who actually go and rent search what did they really like so that what they're doing if they're respecting their readers to saying this is reality I'm not just made the thought\nThis was actually how it would be a\nYou've written a book which is full of extraordinary stories and you describe so many kill us experiences you've had with death but what you do you do and I don't know whether you feel like doing it now is is share your feelings about what happened was off today\nIf if when you look to all of these dead borders it makes you more or less convinced that there is nothing else or whether you believe having seen so much there there is an afterlife\nI have no idea but when I get there but I won't come back to tell you as far as I'm aware and nobody has ever genuinely come back\nNow I Know that we have people who die in the operating theater in our brought by by by medical life but there comes a point beyond which you don't come back we don't have or don't be I spent my entire life with a debt and I've never seen it goes in my life the living room and spruce living so to me the living\nAnd health insurance and getting so totally rational about it I mean\nConversation just before we came in here with potty and she thanked me were worried that by what happens before we were born\nWell why should we worry about the other end either somebody puts the lights on to give us life and somebody else which often to end it at the end of the day but why should we learn a\nLittle while the war let's don't get into why should we worry but whether I just don't know whether it's possible for you to apply the same\nRationality and logic for example to your own loved ones because we've all in this room experience probably most of us if not all of his experience death within our own families and I just wonder whether you when you experience in death in your own family and I know you've lost both your parents whether your feelings upon viewing\nVetted boulders\nHas been different from the feelings you took when you were to Kosovo or to ... to those major police investigations you've worked\nMy mother died a healthy to death within six weeks and my father took a long time to die because of all climbers and what was hard once they're dying\nThat that wasn't hard on them being that wasn't hard hit with watching what they went through in the dying part of that\nSo whether that was painful whether that's protracted whether it was there was some part of that they'd they'd never wanted to be um but when that came from both of them it walking up to loosen up ... for them and every body and being that\nThey were a lot smaller than they weren't in life they look very small very strong can but they were gone and there was something\nThat is a metaphorical thing as well ju ju feel I mean again it's digging deep and to sort of difficult things but\nWhen you saw your shrunken dead father did you feel that his soul\nAnd then something changed their health is times when he took his last breath in life and I felt there was nothing more than I could've done from adults from that it was the most privileged place that I could ever have been\nAnd it was such a gentle prospects for him that he didn't tell you that he had enough he stopped drinking he felt the things he turns of safe for the wall and he decided he was going to die\nAnd when he took that that last brass on on the rocks all that you hear when they talk about the detrimental is pretty much the fluid that goes into the lungs that comes out was the last breath\nThen I knew he'd gone and I had no trouble leaving my father's faulty but I Would never have left my father believing still alive and in the last breath\nSomething changed but my father the to be on the boat he that was left was not my father it was just a vessel that he ... for his entire life my father had gone he had died if there's something beyond\nI don't know until I get there but do you fear erode under\nNo tall I think it is the law it's great to adventure you're going to do once in a lifetime [noise]\nIf you're going in a long journey you'll always prepare for that journey what why do we know prepare for telling and I think I Want to experience every single moment to offer I Want to know\nWhat to like to like if I can remember being born so I'd really like to know in those last stage of this is what it feels like the search for things like this is what it tastes like\nAnd then presumably I'll Remember none of it because I'll just die\nOr what do you do ... to ...\nTo lately I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't so um I I have an organ donor cars that they can use my organs to keep other people alive for as long as they lose their views to anybody but by the time I'm sixty five or so far nobody's gonna want them anyway\nScience so that students can just facts and then I I Want them to be able to gather together my buttons you have to boil them times getting rid of all the facts and all the bits of muscle is ... and then I Want them to read string me into an articulation skeleton so that I can carry on living and teaching for the rectify that\nI've done a lot of engineers in where I started like housing more finite way of ending and then they'll just say sue blockage for the new moments pleasure to have you on hold till thank you very emotional [noise]\n\nDistribution of BBC

the ... ... talk he has said he will do whatever it takes to save the euro but there is this concern that Italy is everyone's into problems would be just too big to safe does that not worrying\nAbout whether we have to understand a lot of that because a busy street as you probably know we are and that's going to sort of the European Union so basically we are paying the European Union if he doesn't receive a single penny by European Union busting\nGot on me in Europe but I Would say in the ... the ... tend to I don't think that the thirty is lost the infamous off a foot ... and ... down sauce for industry play if there was something that these will have a positive but it stopped us so basically\nWe export much more much more beat us more than what we\nHave a primary budget stop blessed so basically we collected box is much more than what we spend and these numbers is not perception or something at the end of course we have a wonderful county so it's a it but he has got a lot of potential but to do stand with the policies that we put\nIn place in the past that show that they have to these incredible potential stood out to be\n... in the world in terms of girls so it's not to be a big prize and the economy and the standard that we need to counter secret code policies [noise]\nSo uh that's that's the only way you know the European Union is that new seats that we should do policies that they should the damage our girls ... what about that but we are paying the club and the ... that allows us to do something that it's obvious that is\nContrary to what any kind of things to both parties in the dumps off knock it off should do well probably we should discuss it will be more and I think that we are going to do these after the election of may where all these a five year old a ... that would change\nIf the market reaction is that the spread the cost of Italian debt compared to a gentleman dental Spanish that Don why didn't significantly as a result of these plans and as a result of the confrontation with the European Union\nWould you expect the European Central bank to step in and help somehow ... what what what what is it what you expect what what is it what you want to see from the European Union\nThey they should do because uh it's uh it's probably impossible to think of that the federal bailouts such a stupid finger that a country like keep that goes a out of the market the there was of everything you\nYou're putting down to the European Union saying we're we're going to do this you're just going to have to accept it because we are too big for you to try and find that\nI Would put it that way we're going to do this because it's the right thing to look for our economy\nIf the European Commission reject your budget well then\nWhat are the European Commission or reject a budget though we face the consequences sauce or being phased up or example science or something I Do some of the European Union we will defend the in that situation but I'm sure\nThat that we are going to defend ourselves in the new parliament and the and the new European Parliament believe me the balance of power would be much much you've spent the ...\n... what what is now I keep on having a relation with the new generation off a European pretty decent from prize from Germany or something I had these amber I'm very very confident that that that there is a ... will be up in Eastern Europe\nSo I'm very optimistic for the future\nThen against economic spokesman cloud of your book that oh he's holding out for European parliamentary elections next year which might see and you block 'cause most sympathetic populist candidate smells you didn't know so he hopes which in ten minutes away for at least do it likes with its spending plans\nBut why risk does is he now posed to the year as an important or even simply European Union as a whole\nJeremy places the economists columnist and correspondent in Brussels and we can speak to him from that now good morning Jeremy you're going\nTo be the heroes on Mexico for debt crisis\nI think it may well be in the last few weeks to happen here in Brussels particularly within the European Commission not to eat to leave government would be persuaded to back down on some of it as spending proposals and tax cuts\nAt that time I haven't been the case in the sense here is that there are people that the commission can talk to an written for people like for example Giovanni tree of the finance minister but then the people pulling the strings\nFor protection hold the upper hand in hand off do you think I mean at the end of the day at ... ... not the end of the interior minister who's the guiding light of the leg I it it is not going to back down and say\nI mean ultimately did did you get it in the hands of particularly Mr ... who now is the dominant figure in Italian politics he's the he's the interior minister but his leg up hockey has stored in the polls it's now much more popular even in the five Star Movement which was once built to the\nThe the senior ... on her and not coalition and he is determined to have a confrontation with the European institutions we just heard from the book you talk about the European Parliament elections next year\nMr Mr Bean you dramatizing the idea that he's standing up to Brussels or we saw for example when that bridge collapsed in ... ... ... a few weeks ago Mr Elving immediately blamed Europe for that you're a failure to invest in China structure\nAnd I think that's the conclusion that people here who've come to the the the Italian government particularly insofar as it's driven by Mr ... is determined to do a take on Europe will be things take on Europe\nAnd that means a a major bust up over this budget\nBut do you think that there's a lot of posturing headed in the end they'll just have a line that they'll have to tell you that I Know oh could date really take this to the brain can and were correct a real down to where it really affects the the market that really effects and that all over the years on what I think\nI think the the the best case for optimism and being from the European institutions perspective is that the markets will district in the government you've already talked about Italian public perceptions of law spread to the the the um it's a tiny and governments ...\nArising here but there's a Gemini and at the same time you hit people like the ... I mean I was just thinking on your interview with him that he was saying for example you know what's the difference between one hundred percent one hundred and thirty five to ten\nAnd uh there's no risk refund refunding refinancing ... Italy's debt victory is not a government living in the realm of of economic reality I'm afraid and and it doesn't seem like government you know especially if you're into\nThe government between the lake are now the dominant force on the five dollars which used to think of itself as a dominant force and so I I can see this becoming a set of competition between the two a governing coalition partners in Rome as to who can be tough for who can take on the market you can take in Brussels more\nUm you know we've we've seen the language escalating we've seen minutes does accusing Brussels market terrorism with one phrase used um and and I think this this'll this'll points in the direction of um of of of the major showdown in which the Italian government actually embrace to um penalties imposed from Brussels over its budget deficit\nHas kinda macho politics isn't it absolutely does cloud ... of the guy who had have appointing wrong and Gemini they've gotten away with overspending and and you know feeding their public debt limit that's that's how body why can't it needs to do this time it is one rule for them and one rule fits in isn't it\nIt's not to turkey and reasonable point and I think the ... there was some in the commission particularly ... Mr must be cheesy a commissioner responsible for economic and financial effect who\nWere willing to give it to the government to bits of breathing room on this they felt that if they could be escalate the conflict state they would actually denied the Italian government child to\nA theatrical ... that it is disagreements with Russell\nBut I I think the difference as opposed to what people here in Brussels will in in the commission would say that when Germany and France overstepped that um budget rules they were led by governments that seem to lead to understand the importance of those rules and we're willing to die that country's back onto a sensible path\nAnd then they look for example the Italian government budget proposals and the wildly unrealistic growth expectations and there's and say you know if the government we can do business with in the way that we could do business with for example the French and German governments have the time when they overstepped the debt deficit of it but\nThe European Union can't afford to bailout his late ... this is this is the ultimately the big problem frankly\nIt's too big to fail exactly and and I think this\nFine line on the one hand you have a country's I'm lucky to lead liked but also other other countries in southern Europe or who's the front of the week when you\nFeel that there is no ... years and he'd been pushing for greater burden sharing within two years and then on the other hand you have known European states or one of them is Germany but even more hard line on this is typical knew how to lead to this new kind of\nA bold take two and a Scandinavian states led by the Dutch who who are very skeptical about any further risk sharing within the years and I'm not going to come to a crunch and mid December summit here in Brussels\nAnd that may will now take place against the backdrop of escalating a tit for tat between Rome and Brussels which of course we'll make compromise at the summit very difficult indeed\nJeremy cliff the economists colors and correspondent in Brussels thanks very much for that\nHe brings it to the end of the tradition of business day there's a lot more business news online that BBC News dot com and they remember that if you missed the programs you can always download previous EDITION from your favorite post costing wet but I Do get in touch the Twitter handle it at BBC will fade or at Manuel", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Middletown", "day": "08"}
