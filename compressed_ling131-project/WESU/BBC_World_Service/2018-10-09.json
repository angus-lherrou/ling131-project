[noise]\n\n\n[laughter] just listening to Kenny\nWe always in our program it's about the strong willed personalities you can make these solutions happened and you can just hear that Kenny knows his world he street smart he slumped smart if you'd like he knows how to operate the\nYeah I didn't want to paint shelf though as a one man band you know Kennedy just up on his own and doing this in Kibera\nIt's a large organization now that does lots of different things they got that ... school like I mentioned in the health clinic football team as well and there are other people involved so Kenny runs they together with his wife and for those that was that they do that very well rewarded he makes a salary of a hundred and forty thousand US dollars a year\nAnd his wife used to make the same I think it's now a bit last still a lot of money the ...\nYeah I put all of that just shelf go\nThey said the salaries in line with over ... of a similar size or everything's being signed off by

one that I'm trying to solve this problem shelf that not the only game in town\nThere are lots of different people I Know when I say shouldn't thinking about how to live a will to into slums and\nJust in Kibera I you know the ... ... email said and I'm thinking one woman she's in one of the woman was ... she was glad the H a few years back she remember that yeah okay well she runs a foundation that are also dreading bullet holes that pumping oil syrup right from the ... of Kibera\nBut that delivering it in Jerry cans on caught so they just ... up and passing it out so they got the wolf at the same way by different methods of delivery yeah exactly and the Kenyan authorities themselves they're not doing nothing they do have some pipes going into the slum they're trying to improve that situation\nYou're in the daytime than illegally at night so it's a complicated picture ... different players involved at least that's how does tropical fits into that\nWell it's interesting one expert I spoke to said that this bull health system I actually be quite limited because at the amount of water or you can produce this way I said ultimately the real solution was what with governments and private utility companies to convince them\nThat you could actually make a profit by building ... piped infrastructure in some itself so that means working with the big guys but as we know that they can be a bit slow sometimes they come with some\nPeople like short Cohen Kenya a bit more fleet to ... you know fast to doing things on the ground they know how it works yeah exactly and that is the whole point of shelf cut their grass roots organization led by Karen ...\nThey didn't want to hang around waiting for help and that's why they're trying to solve this problem themselves why did I leave you with a clip from my interview with Kenny when he talks about how all of those mental ... remember he said he had invincible Mentos\n... mountain that Iraq's got be Rosa Parks they how he said they influence the way he thought about trying to help people in Kibera\nThese men and women who don't just\nSit down and watch when police on what's happening\nAnd what they did they organized

known enough going on\nRebecca hey get in the ... in history of science at the University of can't she says to understand you have to look at the historical role of women working in science\nIt's about how science developed and how it to find a space within rooted culture and I'm within society so when you get science developing sort of the new philosophy it was it was it was understood and the seventeenth century\nIt wasn't something had a great deal of SARS he wasn't necessarily particularly well under judge it wasn't necessarily seen as being you know relevant to economy is all to ordinary people or whatever it was so it had to find ways of developing it so far as the\nUh one of the ways to do that how often being to exclude women because women was seen as hot as being more dangerous or Syria or a nest intelligent because of the way that gender\nI don't think it's because that would lend the field moral authority how active excluding women lead to more authority to lately and once you get to science being seen as something that's relevant in the public face so women generally less active in the public say they've been excluded from politics and and so on so\nThat as a masculine kind of wrap up is going on and on owning a living and so the ... professional life is which is actually a very like developments we were talking\nLate Nineteen century before ... when you said professional what you mean um it said something way there is a uh Korea ... so a a kind of a joke that you could name for whether it's training whether all existing started societies channels you can publish in\nAnd a roots by which you can expect one living so that's something that really doesn't exist until quite and I told them\nAnd by that point ... women very much being excluded from those of cheating in historical examples\nIf we look for who is actually paid to do science in the Eighteenth century there's very few places that that happens so they're all upset victory and granted she's one of those places where you might be living by doing scientific walk\nIn the nineteenth century you might find it within the navy for example doing surveying what or in geology so doing ... which becomes interesting for\nYou know finding mind exploiting resources and not kind of thing but you're not finding people doing scientific research within universities for example so yeah it's really only later on that you get\nThe kinds of scientific career that we would understand that if someone that she paid to do ... solar particular problem is is pretty much across the\n... the case or is it or are you talking specifically about Europe ... I'm very much talking about the western European tradition and so what do I get sort of taken up in in America older I'm interested in these are all more opportunities for women in what is a very new in the back of the system in say then I\nIn the U.S and they are in sort of mid to late to nineteenth century so you have a ... system and often novelty give room for women I mean potty off and it just sort of reforming wells and that includes the idea that that women should be educated and have a more public voice ...\nSo we do find women there in a way that if we thinking of the traditional university system in Britain you've got to opt for the Cambridge in England and women's struggling for very long time to be given places that interesting the thing\nThat you say that when a field is new\nAnd it coincides with the development of women and an education then you do see more women entering those field I think I can see that in when you look at the desk go figures on women in science for example there's some of the countries that have the highest proportion of women in science are countries like Bolivia Venezuela\nThose kind of where the the lowest ones are the Netherlands surprisingly enough\nLove to know more about the ... and what kind of roles but you know are we talking back to a private company doing research or are we talking about investing system when what is the kind of funding that goes into research with any investigation there's different countries so in some cases\nI suspect that may be longer if I could come on women being at higher education and so on but in other cases it may be that it's a system that's not terribly well funded and way there are places that aren't very well funded or not seen as being particularly socially ... then you tend to find\nWomen funding and opportunity because men are not taking the option to because there are other things that they would rather be doing and certainly we find that in different scientific fields where a field is no full say they're a good example from the ... century of geology or in the late ... century of astrophysics so and you kind of way of doing astronomy\nWomen over from being quite early pioneers in those areas because they haven't necessarily be competing they own following the traditional education system they all competing with a lot of stuff\nUntil then often to start doing that then pushed that so far a typical an iconic ... computer programming which on the on was very much seen as a\nFemale role we sort of effect as you look for say goes all punch cards and things that are often seen as almost secretarial work on the very narrowly defined ... year old so you know it wasn't necessarily well paid\nAnd often it was left women to do this work but when it was understood to ... to ... it was going to be\nWe find that it's not being paid more gets things being open to just on women have them being the league shut Dr phil [laughter]\nRebecca get lecture and history of science at the university\nOf cans just how much wouldn't get filtered out was brought home by that and the u._k. a few years ago they found that two thirds of the British public\nWas unable to name a single famous female scientist to end this program we've compiled these women working in than subjects and all them to name that the females contest you'll hear in a pig every time a name is mentioned [noise]\n\nMy name's Roma structural engineer and my engineering hero is Emily ...
