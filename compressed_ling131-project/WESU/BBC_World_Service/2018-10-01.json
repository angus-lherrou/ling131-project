Greece avoided bankruptcy and an ignorant as exit from the euro\nThree years old Varoufakis is still trying to persuade Greeks and the wider world\nThat the ... you and the global capitalist system need radical progressive reform\nBut right now it's the populist right rather than the radical left\nThat seems to be harnessing popular anger and threatening the status quo so is the left losing the argument well yeah and his ... joins me now welcome to talk\nYou're still play a political role you have a new political policy which you are determined to make a force in Greece and in Europe but would you accept that as a radical leftists they tied in Europe the tied to popular opinion is running against you\nCivilization is in the street where experiencing a new boss\nIs the failing left five in the center and they are crumbling the Weimar Republic thankfully not with me but I'm sure it's on the streets yet\nBut we have uh the national average neo fascist international let these rising across Europe look up the severely phenomena intervene someone we're losing the battle which is why this is the time today group\nAcross a broad alliance so progressive Democrats but ... says left wing goes that has ... at the heart\nBefore we drill down into the detail about analysis I Do want to ask you whether you think it is justifiable to\nAs so many progressive left us to use this trove about Europe today looking like Europe in the Nineteen thirties the historian\nNeal focusing addressed that very reason for this absolute nonsense it's so lazy because if one just takes one example lettuce Italy you just mentioned Mr solving and you talked about New York fascism the truth is that since ... came to power and I spoke to the other day on TALK he actually\nHas abandoned and many of his more radical positions particularly on for example leaving the euro Asia\nWhy hasn't he has to teach the place the some of the ... but not for the year and we can discuss this next year above what his prime edited done\nIs that he has used the same story line from the Nineteen to this whole problem is saying the average badly and whose income has been put a cap with the falling for Twenty years there's no doubt about that too many stories but I'd back\nBy juxtaposed him against the ... the migrants even they ...\nThey did exactly the same other than I Do a lot you know if it ... it isn't exactly the same as the Nineteen thirties in Italy I didn't I didn't exactly the same day I said that more than ... history does not that it'd be something good act but\nWe need to get our towns back but to get out of town and our confidence back we have to get out of Europe back because problems with but I have a ... a mortgages wave a public way the low level or something\nLay of liberal England for that matter or the level of Germany we have to look at these problems together and have a program\nSo then I'm Sorry that that level of actually ... really important so you are a multilateral list and for all of your critique of the ... when you were finance minister you seem to be saying we still need sort of multilateral even global is solutions and I come back to all of this stuff about\nGlobal greed investment programs global\nFair trade deals global minimum living wages imposed it'll\nContinue talking to somebody who by the aided up and down this country before the June ... scene out of them and I complain feverishly against Brexit and in favor of the main even though no one can accuse me of being a lap dog in Brussels but my point is because while you were saying that going on each of\nJune ... with the spirit of the times people are thinking very much it seems in terms of nationalism in terms of their borders their security and hearing you proposing all of these new multilateral extremely ambitious they\nShould accept that frankly that would work\nIn ... and just the positions of the kind of the late ... they would work well on the ... let's have a debate about what is on the table by the way I Am a click I borrow from the best\nYou mentioned the ... the international pattern so that's my idea this was John Maynard Keynes in the bedroom was conference to put forth wasn't a major thing that I Know I think they should just buy more exactly but that's what we must do similarly if I waste\nIs we we must do we've just discussing for much of listen to the problems facing the European Union because frankly have a democratic deficit west side of the other day and I don't recognize legitimacy institution that hey you let me out we being some sort of a global institution that sets\nMhm and is going down to the European Parliament elections in order to understand embrace what kinds of stand with our friends and colleagues in that in most\nOf the ... the ... they were going to stand in Poland with a feminist to lead a political progressive tactical dies and we're going to Iran in elections in it against elevating\nThat's who we are and our challenge is how to create a not at the end of inclusive and that I knew that this completely humanistic at the national at least ...\nAnd you just laid out that you're going to fight in elections on let's face it you said you're a Democrat you're going to walk the walk as well as talk talk and I respect that but if one looks at\nCurrent polling and you say well when you you're white or movement has been around for a couple of years but you on you so the fact you'll scoring virtually zero in the polls will let that ... year old and by the way and grace we'll let you know ban could have led for ... and I just want to figure out what all they want to get to is this\nThe only country in Europe right now where\nThe law and its more radical form is actually doing well or at least gaining traction with a significant part of the population is in the United kingdom and if so want make can you know the u._k. very well want in your view makes\nJeremy cool Britain's Labour Party different from so many of the other left movements in Europe and across the world today what\nBrexit has had a lot to do with it because ... has been a slap in the face of progressive independently of what their view about ... what I mean I was gonna say labor party view on breakfast is extraordinarily confused so I Want to say you sound fusing issue\nIf you're not confused when you're facing a confusing issue you a fanatic but given the opens position on bricks that remains even off the Labour Party conference unclear I Can't see how bricks it can be the driver of the momentum and undoubtedly you said it was\nWorld and not be taken for granted it means to beating vent it let's look at look at the the bright side they give the people who have written and opportunity to reconsider their position in the world and I believe that the judge me has been doing a very good job\nAt a recognizing that the last fifty years of privatization of moving towards a business multiple that effectively tied to the economy grows on two bottles on the housing bubble and on the city of London and he's causing a reassessment of basically even with that or it's\nInteresting so you would say because you talked about last generation of politicians in the u._k. who in your view played that sort of neo liberal economic ... you would say the Tony Blair was in no way elective sent a politician would you\nWhat is with me on the one hand he was because he gave a lot of money but how service money that the Saudis to solve that national health service off but at the very same time\nHe did it by aligning himself fully with the city of London turning a blind eye to the private money ... thing of the by the banks and creating the second was on the left with because I was in an eight and to the collapse into housing in the night so\nWhat what I'm getting too is that the John Macdonald the the the current shadow chancellor of the sticker here in the case has made a big speech where he's painted a picture of a radical economic program including just one example the man the tree imposition on business in the u._k. ever need to have\nTen percent of ... given to the workers in the company the dividends would then go to those workers and\nThat would be a cap on the amount of David and to be received by each worker on the excess beyond that would go to the government so it actually is a huge new corporate tax it would fundamentally change the relationship between the states and the corporate sector in the u._k. in a very sort of left of center way\nDo you really believe the British people\nOn the program we eras things you've been saying for cyber opposing\nIt precisely that with one difference I've been proposing the creation of a social fund where the ten percent of the shadows after every ideal or capitalizing by corporations go into the public will fund and then the dividends are distributed in the universe of basic dividend\nWhereas the Labour Party is giving them up amongst the workers we think those corporations but what I think is very important to remember this is not even need the money factor yet which is part of the Labour Party conference he may go into the money festival I Hope that it is a very interesting discussions are that we must have even thought it must have\nAbout the division between competent labor but it differently statement once upon a time when ... first of all the machine that machine blocked industrialist and then the investors who claimed the profits of the machine confused for the company\nBut these days of Google and Facebook\nWhen every time you search and your Google Search engine for something you're providing capital to Google and no one is getting a defense for that except for Google we have to concede that property rights over that he types of capital and leave that everybody is the only party in the world that he's doing this okay\nSo for you definitely UK labor party represents a beacon of hope but throughout this interview you've been saying we must do this we must do that and I've been pointing out that actually in the real world and the world of politics and opinion polls your ideas are not gaining very much traction if we leave aside the United kingdom so I just was\nIs there any way I look at some point say to yourself you know what democratic politics doesn't what we're going to find new ways one labor MP ... said she said recently and there's no such that we need to topple the government and we can't do it at the ballot box\nWe will do it with a general strike by working with the trade unions is that you kind of policy what physically and so I could not be legal to the last time I checked\nScared because these dangerous times with their eyes off like streaming around the world and we have to be very clear in our language and the and the way that we support democracy so Blanca that great I'm going to quote from which some social\nThe Democratic process is a pretty awful it's pretty nasty but it's the best of all those ... and we have to be prepared to defend it with our lives I think that this would be faithful would answer to your question now whether it's right that was part of the political democratic Russia's I Do believe that they are\nOn the ... we have to end ... factors I think you very much for being on how to thank you

tell them or as well as success stories in China\nYeah tell us they didn't want to become an ecological heroes sort of an emission poster child but it didn't really succeed are there are many reasons behind it\nBut it's still in this case just keep in mind that within the next couple of years I think the government definitely has the capacity to relocate many of the state owned businesses\nTo this

still with us to discuss this and then the the wider infrastructure plan of the Chinese government\nI'm Joe ... things that came to the point is that the China has this record has done for twenty thirty forty years it's been spend its way through rocky times it will spend money on the big planning project I mean it's getting the large dividend out of doing that\nIt has a historically um something changed in a two thousand they actually as the financial crisis in the west started to turn ripples through choice\nUm and uh\nPretty what's happened in the last ten years in particular I Would say\nThat the the Chinese government has actually relied on infrastructure for two reasons one to offset downturns in the economy so Everytime economy looks like it's looking a little bit

kinds that kind of famous British economist ones that in the long run we're all dead\nAnd what we have to be concerned about really is about the missile allocation of capital in the short time which actually can lead to you know empty apartment blocks coast cities and and actually quite a lot of problem\nAnd it can lead to go to a huge amount of public debt ... how Big East Chinese public debt well uh it\nAbout the end of two thousand and Seventeen was around three hundred and thirty percent of its national income which is just over three times as big as it was ten years ago I thought I was
