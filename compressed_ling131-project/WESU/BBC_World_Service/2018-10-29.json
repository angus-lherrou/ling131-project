I have to add but what he's been able to analyze he says that the plane was traveling at a very very high speed when it made him packed\nWith the washer it's not clear what that would have done to the condition of the airplane but he also added that from the flight data that he analyzed the plane looked like it within trouble from the very beginning he said that it had struggled to find some sort of\nLevel balance from the point that it took off now\nThose reports that you were talking about the pilot had asked to turn around soon after takeoff\nThat's being reported in the local media we don't have any official confirmation of that yet all officials have said though is that they will continue to look for that flight data recorder which hopefully will reveal more information about why this happened encouragement give us an idea what do we know about line air and there's safety record\nWell lion air is Indonesia biggest budget Adeline it the airline that you would typically take to travel from one part of the archipelago\nTo the other it has hundreds of flights every single day but it also has had a very patchy safety record I think it would be fair to say I was in Indonesia a few years ago covering the crash of ally an air flight\nWhich crashed in Bali luckily for everybody on board miraculously in fact there were no casualties from that particular incident but\nThe safety record of this airline had suddenly been spotty to say the least over the last several years however an aviation analyst have also said to me that\nLion have taken safety most seriously over the last few years and have invested in safety procedures and that's been a statement that come in from the company itself saying that they are working in full cooperation\nAnd doing Thirty years he remains like this to the point\nEstablishment he was one of the most vocal voices against the workers' party that was untouched by corruption giving him an edge and this aura of someone that's coots represents or something you\nDid you think the vote for him which actually voted for Mr both an hour or was the vote against the leftist workers' party\nI think it's partially a vote for ... above anything else they vote of rejection towards the workers' party and he was the candidates death in ... the most and in the most efficient manner does rejection towards the workers' party\nThere are also many concerns that some people have for example he expressed admiration for the dictatorship his comments against the algae meeting cute community and he made racist comments about slave defendants what his presidency going to mean with all of these coming from concerns that people have\nOkay I think that all those concerns are valid these were polling remarks\nProbably from an individual who never thought that he wanted to reach where he ...

telling them or they encouraging signs are warning about something\nWhat I always tell them is that there was a parliamentary system disguised as presidential new system\nOr the president parliament is probably the most powerful parliament in the empire of Latin America so the decision or they go through the parliament to foot the aspects to observe his relationship between the executive between both for NATO and he's called they shouldn't be\nThe the indicators that these relationship gives we gave her a da da Da Nang six months for one year will be good or if his relationship starts to

World Service Brazilian economist Gabrielle elicit they was talking about where the free market reforms could work in Brazil\nThere is a cool a precedent for this in Latin America and warm that Paolo judges will be familiar with\nOkay with me here judges studied economics at the University of Chicago in the U.S in the Nineteen seventies\nAnd other times Chicago's economics department was well known as a sense of for free markets theory led by the influential American economist Milton Friedman\nAnd it was in the Nineteen seventies that a group of Chilean economists later dubbed the Chicago Boys because they do say studied under Friedman sets about making radical free market reforms to chilies economy under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet with dramatic consequences\nOr find out more about what happened from ... as a journalist and film producer in Santiago in Chile she recently made a documentary called Chicago Boys\nWere very young when they went to the U.S and the fifty they learn something that they deny near before the open market and free market economy\nWhen they came back in the sixties they try to implement the idea that they learn from Milton treatments but nobody heard them they were too extreme extreme in the meaning that they're free market we're going to ... everything and that people with with that for a lot\nSo they couldn't go ahead with their abs\nIm to apply all they\nKnow that they get in their faith under ... a guide them in Chicago\nSo the the two and the ... just a pitcher gave them the opportunity to enact some of the theories that they learned about free markets are settlements in America\nRight because they didn't have any support among the traditional politicians in Chile\nSo they knew that they they me Terry we're going to be strong enough to go ahead with their cream economy politics so they saw these windows to get into power and to apply to the pre made the are being support that by the military guns what\nWere these extreme edge to them it's or does what kinds of things where they do first of\nAll they they thought that the state walk mostly on usable that the power of the economy should be in their private hand there is one phrase that they say when things belong to everyone\nThey don't belong to anyone they really are due process this state so they wanted to have that small state of forcible\nSo were they successful they were very successful\nUm they came to power with Pina checked more or less the same day two years later they were in control of most of the government of the TV and sides of that the
