World Service for me Steve ... Afghanistan\nJust held its the parliamentary election since the Taliban regime was toppled in two thousand and one\nThe poll exposed fully recover and problems of insecurity the dome the country in the years since dozens of security personnel were killed hundreds were wounded and in some areas voting simply didn't happen as the Taliban attempt to the ... Afghans\nWave from polling stations nonetheless millions didn't to announce on results will be declared next month\nThe government of president Ashraf Ghani is likely to hail approach that says evidence of progress on the road to stability\nBut we all the rhetoric want as reality look like the Taliban operate with impunity in some ways the territory the national security forces are short on numbers and morale corruption as well as the insurgency undermined the authority of the state\nWell my guess is President Ghani has recently appointed national security advisor I'm ... formally Afghanistan's ambassador in the U.S a technocrat\nWith little previous security experience is the Afghan government really in a position to shape the future of the country well I'm dilemma he joins me now on the line from Kabul welcome\nTo how to look like he's too good to be here\nSpeak of course after the parliamentary elections would you accept that the\nWay those elections works out with so many Afghans are facing the possibility of going to the polls because of insecurity and the lack of government control of key parts of your territory like Bruce Lee exposed everything\nAnd there is precedents of attacks on polling stations the African people despite all of that and came out to vote I think that speaks for itself on what the act on people's verdict on democracy is and what it is that they want in their life\nThis was the first election that was completely organized by the Afghan government and security provided by the end the death\nAh I think they did a tremendous need a good job compared to what we had in the past\nUm even from the number of attacks that that ... that were um launched on on the election day in two thousand fourteen when we had foreign security assistance and the elections or had a lot of support from the international community ah we're much larger scale than we had this year\nLet's look at reality I I Do not mean to belittle the bravery of those three or ... million Afghans who didn't go to the polls in face of Taliban threats I Do not but liberal that bravery for one second but here's the reality your own electoral commission and\nSay that at least a quarter of polling stations across the country didn't open because of security concerns we know the whole swaths of territory including Kandahar and the guy's name a that was no voting because of security concerns of course there may be some more voting next week we're not quite sure\nWe know that your own a transparent election foundation and the country found that the biometric systems were not working and many of the polling stations which were open\nAnd if one takes all of that the guy's a plus the dozens killed and more than a hundred wounded around polling station as one has to conclude\nThat off the Seventeen years off post Taliban governance\nI issued a statement to our people our security forces that what I Would be doing is to reflect their voice\nIn on the front line deserve they have not failed out\nBut I Want to make sure that we also do not failed and when it comes to policies and tried to do that that protect their lives and their families\nYou know what I'm mindful law mindful of something that Hamid Karzai's former president said as he was leaving office it was something that deeply upset many people\nAre in the west in NATO particularly family members of those who lost their lives because he said this he said the navy so exercise all of its operations in Afghanistan have been ones that have caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering and loss of life\nAnd no games because our country is not secure he says that of NATO's operations and of course\nThe operations costs more than two thousand American lives more than four hundred and forty British lives one could almost say the same thing today to Afghan veterans the families of those who lost their lives in uniform serving the Afghan government all of this loss of life\nEither from NATO forces off from your own Afghan forces unfold waltz\nBecause this is all you can't win\nThat's again um something that you have the luxury to say how Afghans we don't need to do our country if it does not winnable we have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives\nAnd protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on a on colleagues from previous government\nUm they have their own opinion what I can say to you or a ... is that changed the country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show\nIs to tell you and and your viewers that they did not have gotten it some that you only see it from the TV there is so much more to that context I understand that there is only so much news\nA space for one is on and it's usually covered by this\nThat it socially I'm a ... a generation Seventy five percent of this country ah grew up in the war\nOur aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nTo help us along the way they know that your investment in this country has not gone to wait\nYeah that's where a war it's not an eight it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves it's a war that we must end\nA and it takes a it it it takes more now than just a statement to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures every day and thanks to reason with support who are being helping\nAnd equipment and training or security or I just got to provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe we don't have so much time to somebody so let me ask you some quick questions a pivot thing to what you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan ah let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand of them\nBut he clearly wants to end this conflict and America's commitment to it as quickly as possible one thing moved to America is privatizing\nThe U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently to our friends formula that had the Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action how would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military privatized contracted force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council\nMake to to turn our war into profit a it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our our life we're fighting terrorism or and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now it turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's Afghan\nAnd why is all my ... he had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know those talks with taking place at the time were you told beforehand\nWe knew he had to walk there even ... I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with negotiations\nThe Afghan government has the initiative on the peace and reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on the security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire where where\nAre you in your car could we have a new I don't think it was a stray down to the very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reports that sources saying quote\nFills that I have these meetings with ah the officials from the Taliban just uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... he quietly met them on Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government\nHeard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one confirmation for or or what is going on it's a lot more detailed than what you see in a news report\nIt it was a quick meeting a and a ambassador of the you know with me very exhausted from his trip\nYou didn't ask to be clear then I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the Taliban and it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided\nThat far from this position in the past where the Afghan government always says we must own any political process with the Taliban now the Americans seemed to be saying no we're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nNo you you cannot have one incident\nUh dictate an entire policy or that's not what the Americans are saying and that's not what the American stands as we are uh in ... I mean in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans my own and drive the peace process and guns to\nOwn and drive the peace process and that's the only way\nFor it it's not that we we want the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan and it would be ashamed that all your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste\nI'm already asked by a ... through a process right on that process and it's very clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground and many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take\nMuch to national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's right to a stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell where the Taliban contend elections there more than what\nIf the Taliban really feel that they have a place to knocked on society other than driving fear into them then they must come and content and the ... whether the Afghan people really vote for them or not\nThey they can only be a force of military force that um that drives fear can they provide governance and and the Afghan people accept can only be known if they participate in a in a in a democratic process and that the Afghan people choose\nHow ... we have to end of that but I Do thank you very much for joining me on hotdog\nDistribution of BBC World service in the U.S has supported

it's part of the good friday agreement the British Army would have been on the streets of Northern Ireland there would've been checks on roads and people being stopped in their cars and\nI must have peace day not fell away and essentially for the last Twenty years we've enjoyed what everybody refers to as an invisible border\nSo people can come and go without any restriction we knew it was time to show documents to the idea not that you might go back to there being any sort of the it presents or a military presence or anything like that along the border of deep concern to people people took the risk\nA real threat I think that it is you know when people talk about a return to the troubles I don't think that that's realistic I don't think we're going to go back to decades of sectarian strife\nI think about a hard border would introduce would range all the way from street protests maybe civil disobedience to physical violence from small groups of just sort of Republicans on what our most senior police officer in Northern Ireland the chief constable George Hamilton as sad\nIs that if there was any sort of border infrastructure or people in those people that are car and all that work would become a target\nThan it's the police Judy to defend people who are being targeted says if the police then arrive at the border then they become a target as well so\nThe play service here how serious concerns about ... a new day hard border breaks it would mean from a security point of view you all that people in ... would actually like to see the ball to come back\nWell everybody says you know the political parties in Northern Ireland devote persuasion is all say that they don't want to be a hard border but I think that people are suspicious that some people might actually want to see a hard border because\nUnionism view is that there was an article be treated any differently to the rest of the case was in the future if there was any trade deals that the northern I wouldn't be excluded from that\nWhereas the majority of the party's view the boxed off as sort of the best of both worlds I was speaking to some business leaders are for the last few days and they said to me you know we've called her head and her hands because we're being offered this opportunity to have this sort of best of both worlds arrangement and it's not being accepted as\nHow much of a discussion topic is for people on the day to day basis than what you are in Belfast this is something that you know most people are talking about a lot of the time it's something\nThat everybody's talking about a day in day oh it's ... that has done is put the issue of the constitutional position\nIt's a practice that people here are talking about Irish unity and away The Waltons on the agenda beforehand so it's interesting that union is feeding the practice it will strengthen northern Ireland's union with Britain whereas people who would never have been talking about the idea of Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland\nBecoming one that they're not talking about that as a serious consideration and some people who would actually of identified as one of the British union aside if things are nice starting to soften up to the idea so it's a very interesting set of circumstances I'm certainly it's something that's being discussed on a daily basis you know every radio show every\nTV show every talk show every pulling all of these questions Milwaukee one for the future of Northern Ireland you know how do you feel like\nThe idea of Irish unity\nWere in the middle of this big storm and everybody's looking at us not least because we're going to be the border between you and the u._k. but also in the context of the D. U. P. propping up Theresa May's government and have enough control at Westminster where their views have to be considered seriously by the British Government in a way that they've never had to do before\nThat was freelance journalist Amanda focused and talking to my colleague ... ... you're listening to business daily and today we're exploring the issue that could and Britain's Brexit negotiations\nThe Irish border all its history of division explains why the ... has become such a sticking point for the Brexit negotiations that's being old to a parent\nIn the British Parliament this week wet pro breakfast and page from the British prime minister his own party have been threatening to find out that has been lurid talk of a political assassination of foot with Theresa my entry ... anonymous sources have called the killings on\nShe's survive so far but the border issue remains so how might it be results\nNo it's been a tough week for Teresa maybe you could see it outside of ... can you know how she fed this way\nHe you're absolutely right you could say that most weeks and I think there's ... on one level she has some good some bad days and some suffering because it's horrid relationship with a I can only describe it as how the ... divided conservative coffee\nBut I think what doesn't change is the big picture which really does look rather grim and challenging for her and that is\nHow long enough to she got a deal about Britain's withdrawal and future relationship with Europe that somehow satisfies yeah stop the brown divide the conservative policy which doesn't why businesses in the ... too much which doesn't put a boat and all that on and and and and that was enough which satisfies the e twenty seven\nSyrup you've laid out a complex set of conditions that needs to be felt that all the different policies that needs to be satisfied but I actually the parameters of ... a fairly clear up because Europe has kind of pretty much light down you know what it needs to stay has met\nThe you're absolutely right I think in many ways that's why we are in the horrible fix that we are in that if you like\nThere's a contradiction in Nebraska projects among the EU is prepared to offer I mean if we're really going to try to get back to basics just than if you\nIf you think about what the what was what was leave all about it was taking back and I quote control of bulldoze all laws and all the money well it's quite tricky to figure out how you do that and have friction let's trade with the European Union and not have a bold in Northern Ireland\nUnless of course the European Union was just I guess ... you can actually have a folk tale you kind of something special we will recognize British rules and regulations\nAs in hot equivalent ... and that is why we are in the fix that we're in the basically Britain has been saying we'd like everything that we used to like about him being members of a you none of the things that we didn't like and the eight was dying\nShit how much is that is both sides kind of holding out for the best they can possibly get how much compromise can you do you think it's possible within their positions of the two policy I\nI think some of it as brinkmanship a dozen things that you've feels like compromising by much cause it things lying on a minute you know the people who voted to leave but Joel mess\nYou clear it up and clearly to raise the main hasn't got very much room for compromise given those are much mentioned divisions and our policy so I guess what's going to happen as if I had so rarely if someone put a gun to my head was to say that that will be maybe they'll scrape together a deal but one that\nPuts off all those issues that we've been talking about just the ... vaccine will the future relationship\nBe won't will happen with trade what will happen precisely how about the ball just so they sort of ... making sure that there is in chaos next march march of next year when Britain leaves the European Union but all those issues who's going to compromise how is the future relationship kind of what\nThat that'll get sort of kicked tens that transition period between next march and the end of twenty twenty\nBullets and if they can't agree again if they're struggling to agree just on the divorce agreement just on this withdrawal agreement\nThen how life is it that they'll come to a final sacrament they'll come to that that would get enough compromise between the two parties to come to a settlement that that will be able to actually find some kind of a deal for ...\nA fantastic question ... and of course it's it's one in a way\nWhen when he was good at Fort Dr ... people are already in the ... the crazy thing hang on a ... that that this these talks transition could go on forever and ever but it also all those people who would have preferred to remain in the European Union who think this this just looks like a recipe for kind of\nChaos and this is off to Britain's full of in the European Union the soles of north in it so now that that prospect of a long long process pleases neither remain us\nWell agreement for this divorce agreement how are they going to come to a Sacramento in the longest I bought my\nAssessment of the border look like who's likely to compromise look\nIt's an immensely difficult question just and of course some really smart people have been looking at it for two years and of course\nYou know the the reason there's nowhere in the world ... and one of the two countries Tom and the customs union so in a way that you in the u._k. are trying to do the impossible I suspect\nThe compromise in the show somebody will only be able to show some will be that the whole of the u._k. would have to stay on the customs union until a future relationship has worked out with me\nNo native would be such a close trading relationship that would be no need for both Raul absolutely no so I\nThought was Rob Watson the BBC's
