Rashid we have talks at some length about the number of prisoners that MBBS looks up for this and I think you put the figure in the thousands included\nAll the family some of whom were famously locked up in the rich Coulson including a will lead bin ... one of Saudi Arabia's biggest businessman Nicholas Burns Austin interesting question about just how secure MBA issues grip on power is what do you think\nWell if you're a crown prince who had already guaranteed that he did it would be the future of king of Saudi Arabia would not actually behave in the way my hammock the man had behaved ... his own cousin\nIn addition to what it was a lot there was unimportant stuff and I've been up to ... the head of the national guard and Saudi Arabia he had a military base and security officials in the country yeah absolutely and and the national guard was in charge of protecting their oil household and the oil in the nation\nBut if I'm at the time on it to cure and hit the dish and he wouldn't really go to these kinds of erratic act\nThe war in Yemen it's been going on for over ... like four years and we have seen no end to the bombing using ... and a ministry equipment and all the experts tease that's not forget that are\nPeople from the United states and from the ministry in Britain on the ground in Saudi Arabia and\nHeard that without us and you can support the war in Yemen would not continue for\nMore than ... because the Saudi Government continues to frame that war in the wider context of a struggle within the region within the middle east between\nSaudi Arabia and its allies and the Iranians a framework which frankly games a lot of traction in Washington and otherwise why they continue to be able to prosecute this war what\nUnfortunately that Saudi Arabia is seen as the shield against Iraq in fact at Iran yes it's had intervened and Arab countries\nBut the argument that we can tolerate it at a press regime that had actually gone after the way to kidnap prime minister prime minister of Lebanon and puts him under house arrest for him to resign just said bin Laden yet another country and the ...\nAnd that's probably another integration and ... and the crisis to go that far without actually they us the main protector of the Saudi monarchy putting a test and conditions on ... on equivocal unconditional support an unbelievable\nWe have to end in a moment Nicholas Burns I'm going to turn it back to you you've talked about the strategic importance of Saudi Arabia if we look at it on one level today we see a young Roula let's call them the ruler of the country I'm B. S. there's just thirty three years old he controls\nPretty much all the leaders of power as far as we can tell and Saudi Arabia remains a virus the wealthy oil rich nation which masses ... many other to the those strategic violence\nIn the middle east it is very hard to imagine the United states wants to see old prompt\nInstability in Saudi Arabia\nThe last thing the United states would want to see and I think the rest of the world certainly the Arab world will be instability in Saudi Arabia Steve I think we're looking at almost\nThe Shakespearian drama here you can see the promise of reform and the acts of reform or by the Saudi crown prince that will take Saudi Arabia forward and then you see a dark side\nYou see the paranoia you see the sense of vengeance you see this unbelievable violence inside the country and the rest of Saudi citizens and the exile of other studies and and it's really unclear how this is all going to turn out which way well this young man turned\nBut certainly the show he event if it's true that he was murdered um this is going to be a watershed moment inside Saudi Arabia and for those of us those country\nSaudi Arabia for a long time do you see this is a watershed moment\nNot under the leadership off we have not been ... I've lost hope that there is hope for reform in Saudi Arabia simply because we have heard that Saudi off reform for several decades and that the more reforms demoted stays the same and in fact we are things west scenarios\nBut that we our sheet here in London and make buttons in California I think you both very much for being on hold to thank you\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

[laughter]\n\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nBasically since the rates crisis you've seen trust in the major in the most important institutions that go up the polar you've seen trust collapse their various reasons for that cleanly\nThe single most important one is the sense that the crisis\nWas ruled on us by the political and financial establishments and that the way in which was resolved was unfair many people left behind those responsible was punished as quickly so you have that's basic sense that everybody's\nIn it for themselves anyway a sort of numbing belief that nobody is behaving well\nTrump has had a little impact as it has there is a loss of trust in Egypt and an unprepared this to believe actual\nEmpirical fact a lot of that's possibly does come from the rise of social media but there is a sense now that there is no particular reason to believe the established median rogue nations that in some ways it's almost paternalistic to think that\nSomebody like the New York times during the huge investigation is more trusted\nThan anybody else that's I think he's a big sperm\nYou experienced at the time didn't he wasn't even brothers collapsed essentially that with a light bulb moment for you and that's something you've written about in your one for the as the\n... yes I had this extraordinary experience while I was in New York covering the crisis those two blocks away from them instead of it it was a very exciting time by coincidence I happened to have a lot of money just landed in my city breaking out because I just sold in apartments in London\nI went to the bank to try to move money around to make sure that I didn't have money left in uninsured deposits and once I discovered was that many people from the wall Street's officers around me were doing the same thing that they were moving money around accounts to make sure that they have this much money as possible\nProtected by the governments in Deposit Insurance and the place was full of people and smart suits trying to a shovel and money around to protect states now that looked like a bank credit technically it wasn't it was actually taking that money that's at the right but it looks like a bank run\nAnd if we had tried publicizing this would have been a very scary moments at the time all I was thinking was if we publicize an image like this then we're going to get into trouble because this is going to look irresponsible it's going to look for\nThe things you've got to be very careful in the financial ... any bank even if it's very well run can get into trouble if there's a lot of confidence and you've got to be really really short of what you're doing before you say that there's a bank run\nSaid just because you didn't reporting at the time\nI did not report that the time it didn't particularly the recipients needs to stay\nOn ten years on because we have the anniversary of the crisis I thought it would be an interesting topic to talk about an ... by the sheer level of invective and the anger this erodes the opinion against the virus you know at least\nFor two one five to one against very powerful sense that the mainstream media can't be trusted if they're not going to tell us the whole truth\nTo people's stories as you withholding crucial information that they should have had access to if you being in that ride a responsible report\nYes precisely so the idea of the traditional media so she's like the F T where I was a viable venue science acting as a responsible ... of being your reliable source that you can go to for information is also dates at this point I think if this were to happen again ten years on\nIowa somebody else would have seen what was going on taking effect so and it would have been out there on social media um that she's ... now regarded as the norm as a baseline of acceptable behavior\nIt's not just the two thousand ... financial crisis says social media that is created this lack of trust and\nThat was the loss of belief in the financial establishment combined with the loss of belief in conventional media these days information gathering is tribal people read the information they're interested in and they don't\nRead from sources they don't care about and when you put the two together what you find is\nChiefly be dismissed because there is a sense that everything's through the financial world is corrupt anyway and you don't\nNeed to trust traditional media to tell you things\nAre kind of makes you wonder what would it take to budge someone's opinion on President Trump is something as big as it's serious allegation in an think globally recognized needs to have a lot in New York Times saying is stitching president is effectively\nA tax cheats adopt the implication of the newspaper whatever denial they're off\nIf that makes no impact well what\nI find it very hard to imagine actually make the famous comments about shooting somebody and Fifth Avenue and people would still vote for him he was found the right and yes\nIt's hard to see what it's which change opinion at this moment given that opinion is so polarized and people derive their information\nFrom particular associates I remember I sense out of the tweets Donald Trump is delighted to tell everybody had one of the stock market performances Sawyer since ... simply comparing how he had done competitor under Obama and Clinton and it's a done veteran germ drummer in Princeton and under Trump\nAnd I go to a bunch of replies say where did you get that from was that from MSNBC\nWhich is the most liberal cable news channel here and we're sorry yes yes so you can send out basic straightforward factual information about how much stock markets as recently as an will still be treated as I ... you go that's from somebody liberal\nBecause there is so much talk about a ... but it is it also suggested it was a sort of nearly and\nYes it's very difficult to talk about this in ways that I'm very very negative there is a lack of trust and without trust it's very difficult to society functions very difficult for finance ... and there is a lack of preparedness to believe anything that you don't really believe\nOf Bloomberg of course the real test for President Trump will come in November when the U.S holds midterm elections\nBut while there'd be no Egypt political repercussions to the New York times published its allegations against him earlier this month\nThe New York state tax department has confirmed it is looking into the claims and you'll see the officials have said they've joined the investigation to that the ... is a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush the\nBig issue is that this is a state and local level investigation and the president has no power to pardon at state and local level it's the New York state attorney general and the Manhattan prosecutor her going after the Trump entities in New York\nAnd at that level he cannot do anything so if he really is facing a serious investigation there he's going to need cash\nAnd so that's why I think there's a very good chance that he won't run again because what he really needs and wants to do is to launch what they're calling TNN which has the Trump produced network to take on C. N. N. and I wonder you know it's just why he's meeting with Kanye and you can see him beginning stages or\nAnd he's going to say look I Won the prize I did everything that I needed to do feed that done then there done that and I might have a much bigger more huge platform as he says which I think he'll be right about because\nActually having that kind of a media platform will be more powerful than the White House where he has genuine constraints\nBut if he's doing his own news network is that what's in the pot lie for him\nI mean if Fox News just on his side he's going to have it you know he'll through everything from reality t._v. too political talk shows and it will be outrageous was you can imagine but I think the key thing is the world of journalism is paying so much attention to the Mueller investigation which is actually yielded relatively ...\nNew York state penitentiary is not a joke I mean is it or not white collar presidents so that threat is a very real thing\nAnd as you say these state investigation wreck he has no say of the state if it was a federal investigation part ... is a federal investigation collapse and the way he needs to worry less about that and worry more about the tax investigate\nOh I think that ... that is right\nAnd I think it's also very interesting one of the things that Brett Kavanaugh had specialized and was the fact that the president can pardon almost anything at the federal level and now he's on the Supreme Court okay so now we know this is the situation but they\nAs a whole different thing\nThat the ... the Trump news network I stick with the dependable BBC but then I Would say that from me and today the producer Lawrence nice business daily is back again at the same time on Monday [noise]", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "12"}
