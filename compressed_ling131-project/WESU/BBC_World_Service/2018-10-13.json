change so if we go on on our trajectory would be protected might be an underestimate actually\nLast spring been from the Oxford Martin program on the future of food\nRenewables all the big weapon in the fight against global warming we're looking for any thoughts of electrical power that doesn't put the two into the atmosphere I think really far making a quarter of well generational ready and moving to a third by twenty twenty three according to the latest international Energy Agency research\nHarvard University's David Keith ... solar power and in a pair of widely debated papers last week found full with wind\nThey're just saying that by changing atmospheric behavior wind farms can add to global warming he took me through his logic\nShould do with the simplest thing in science which is conservation of energy and\nSome of the simplest way to think about wind turbines think about every winter buys being independent from every other stuff you know how hard the wind is blowing you can just\nThink of how much power I went to the next and figure that winter visor all independent of course they're not all at the end it and the and the atmosphere as one big heat edging it's driven by power from the sun and that power as always connected so if you take a lot of energy out of ...\nTake energy from the atmosphere venue gonna be cool to get them but that's not quite the argument from a a\nThat's a very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so of the energy that comes in from the sun only about a third of ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest is heat and the energy of evaporated water\nSo that direct consequence of that point three percent is almost irrelevant but it's indirect consequences huge ... of course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct just a patient at the energy and the winds that matters that's\nHardly important what matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heated momentum and that in turn can redistribute heated momentum and have some kind of climate consequence\nSo effectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the wind farm might be all said\nYes and they're now lots of observations of warming a wind farm so at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because there's more solar energy coming through the because you don't give a cooling effect of the ground from the wind taking heat from the soil what what is it it's\nA it's probably neither of those things if several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night wind turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere\nAnd especially at night when the atmosphere is quite stratified when you have warmer airline above cooler when you mix that up you tend to warm the surface there other impacts but that's the simplest\nSo you end up at night having an effect is that right then the biggest effect\nPreaching but that wouldn't be with publishing\nWell I mean the effects in the region where large wind farms are seem to be warming sort of nighttime warning of order a degree centigrade or a little bit more something like that but the issue really is\nHow to think about the benefits compared to the harm so when turbines are immensely better than coal and we have to be carbon Massey Energy system this is all about choices we make as we did carbon eyes\nI suppose what I'm saying is one when I'm On a global scale either I'm supposed to have a big event you'll modeling is the last numbers if wouldn't phones\nYeah but one wind farm doesn't have a big benefit either the right way to think about it is to think about the tradeoffs between benefits and costs that's not true for wind power is true for any kind of interesting\nSo one wind turbine does a very intimate test them all amount to reduce global climate change by making clean energy and so a single wind turbine very slightly reduced as climate change over the whole next century over the whole world that one wind turbine also makes a very slight direct climate change\nIt's just slightly dented the benefits of wind farms are watching you know it's all together\nI don't think it wipes it out altogether I mean if you're talking wind versus say current called generation which also has huge air pollution impacts\nAnd given the very long time scale of us have to in the atmosphere I don't think this is a reason to abandon when power but I think it's important that the community begin to take this research seriously and consider this as part of decisions about how we decriminalize\nSo there's been debate over\nDecades about what the energy or power density as a winter brown raised basically how much power you can get from a single square kilometer of land with winter buys and people have suggested it's a very large numbers tens or hundreds of megawatts per square kilometer we've now done with wonderful new public\nAnd we get a number it's more like half a watt per square meter and that's you know a factor of\nBetween a few and even ten times less than some important estimates by the U.S department of energy or the BCC and that means that you're generating given amount of power it takes more land than people thought with wind and that has more environmental consequences\nWill not important because I Know that you were very interested in some of the power and I believe that the ... ... square me to you can get from solar power a bigger than that\nYeah solar power is roughly ten times more watts per square meter and that sounds like a very abstract thing that you you know only them often would care about but the point here is about how much land\nHumans have to dedicate to the energy system which will you have environmental and social impacts\nNothing we do at the scale of modern energy is going to be in a free burning coal is probably the worst thing we can do we have to stop doing that but as we transition we have to think about the relative impacts say of wind or solar of nuclear power or what have you and the big important are finding I think that\nThe land footprint of solar is something like ten times smaller than a land footprint of win for the same generation and in addition wind has this climate impact and these climate impacts are I think not enough to say you should forget about wind power that but there are enough that we have to start paying attention to them\nHarvard's David Keith roughly feathers that with these new rules on wind power you can get a sense of how ruffled if you look at this time going on at Dickie climate that link to his papers by his books like via our Web page uh BBC World service don't call them\nThat like most artists they was happy to talk to us because he wants to publish starts his work the process of song goes something like this\nFind something I don't tell everyone else about say by publishing the details [noise]\nBefore the digital age publication was generally dumps\n[noise] but in the

then at the elevators no small company you know like you said if there's a ... they also they probably has a color\nThey are a big commercial ... that's right the other policy to this complaint is the American Chemical Society and not let the membership of academic chemists and research chemist\nThat's right yeah so the elevator big for profit company but you know the American Chemical Society does have subscription channels it requires me to pay to access content which is essentially its business model\nOn the other side of this is this organization called research gate\nYet reached that get you to essentially an academic social networking site allows academics to Shaq day scientific papers online basically that's the part of it the most of the complaints and\nThe complaint is against the article sharing practices of research case so what else did they and the American Chemical Society are alleging is that research Kate is not strong enough in his policies in allowing paywall content to be uploaded so it's actually they're saying that the use of the research gay or uploading\nScientific papers that Norman DVDs would have to pay to access\nSo public shows the American Chemical
