Istanbul that the British Government except that he was mud on orders that go to the very top of the Saudi state\nWe can suddenly take the first off of that sentence he was undoubtedly made that a president or the one has outlined today how it was planned and that is the question how far up the line did it go and the foreign secretary has made it absolutely clear that we'll appalled by this\nA clearer view about what other steps we might consider taking\nYou talk of the ... all the time the latest news reporting we have suggests that voted off have now been found this was a truly gruesome exercise of investigation but do you in the British Government believe that the Saudi Arabian\nGovernment is in any way cooperating satisfactorily with the Turkish investigation\nWell we've had some very I think unconvincing explanations which started with the Nile and which now admits ... uh the question is who was ... some lady the people who did this what pops solve\nA the Saudi Government or the issue is one of ... and who basically commanded it and said that is what I think has to be established a soon as opposed\nTo what you're suggesting there's some sort of mystery about it but there isn't really is the I mean we have seen the named individuals' they've been pictured by the Turkish government in various\nA surveillance cameras and other things but he was quote including people who are known to be close to crown prince song on we have reports that there was communication with the office all of\nA ... in Riyadh it is quite clear given the nature of the Saudi Government that authorization could only have come from a very very senior position\nWell that of course is uh the accusation you'll write this and they are you\nJust here to ... percent\nUh there's no doubt about who did it because the faces of that there's no doubt about the proximity uh to the government in the way you described um and so uh any further a station has to be proven and ... you know they just found the body parts it is that\nI I agree the murder of ... but this was all of a of a scale that also threatened international treaties with a ... grade nerve agent particularly of being used in Madrid Paris ... ...\nAnd investigations in the way that the ducks are in Danville and Ankara\nYes interesting use that phrase we were in the lead on script problem there's no question and I think that over many years the British\nGovernment on your particular department the foreign offices prided itself on its influence the degree of leverage it has in the international arena let me change probably because if I can talk to you about Brexit something which is of course taking up much of your time much of the government's time\nWould you agree with John Major form a leader to go potty former prime minister who shuttle Brexit\nMuch of the world will now perceive Britain values bricks Britain to be a middle sized middle ranking nation that is no longer stupid charged by its alliances I ate breakfast is doing very profound damage to Britain's ... place in the world\nI think there's a danger to let it nice and we've got to make sure that it doesn't\nAnd in order to make sure it doesn't but we do need to reach an agreement to the next few weeks with the new which is new surely beneficial and not mutually harmful\nAnd all those some voices in Iran's governing party a very critical of the prime minister\nMy view is you've got to be a hundred percent behind the otherwise the week and then the guy's taking physician parliamentary arithmetic is very tight and we'd go we have to back up all the way to the point where I Hope and what will probably be the last minute hits\nWe ended up with a deal which can determine our future relationship with the ... you and make sure that we do not suffer the consequences that such a major uh described\nOf old is is that the prime minister is being manipulated by the almost impossible pressures inside Iran policy if one if one looks at her positions on things like the Northern Ireland backstop which the British Government had signed up through this notion that they will always be a safety net whatever the states\nAnd on the Irish Republic will not have a hard border between them back guarantee offered by the British as long as I was last December now seems has been taken off the table because Theresa May ... get hit by the ... allies and the Democratic union is probably not\nA I think you'll ruin them or I didn't think that um she's a bean ducking waving I think a great quality is it to read them the is the unstoppable and she doesn't get pushed around now there's no doubt\nThat every waking day the prime minister takes a lot of incoming fought for many angles are mostly from those who want to re heartbreaks over breakfast on that deal a tool\nBut she doesn't touch and what she's doing is she saying very clearly that uh the union of the United kingdom the full countries of the u._k. must be held together and the the peace process behind a Northern Ireland must be interrupted by treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the United kingdom now she has stuck to that\nProblem we've all just to try and find\nA solution which square the circle between the principles of the ... and the principles of holding\nTogether at least ... square if I may interrupt just to because we are going to find Irish foreign minister Simon company said yesterday that will be no withdrawals agreement without the Irish ... ... and ... story so all of this\nShuffling of papers and on different positions for different people in the end it's quite simple\nTheresa May see a ... year position is here the bricks tears who appear to have a a means to stop Theresa May from from making any more concessions to Brussels based here there is no way of making this work\nI think that will be a way and not stable to analyze it on his time in caves and he's very smart\nAnd I'm very fair minded essentially has the same objective as we\nNorthern Ireland and the rest of the island of ... and ... sort of more than it is the ... but the the point to that kind of the plot is it doesn't distract them ... it's it's still a problem so you know people can argue amongst themselves and and adopt pollsters in positions that doesn't mean that the ones that come in any way to let the\nMorgue and a former cabinet minister said the other day this policy the Tory party all ... is now on to quote existential string friendships between colleagues are being ... be damaged\nBecause all these bitter arguments over a brick shit that language has become toxic including talk of\nThe Brexit fears of killing his own is for the prime minister carrying on new into a meeting so she could hang on a cell phone nice being found in her body was on a house is going on inside your party but I I think\nBriefings using disgusting language like that that just to be condemned to me I quite agree that some people if you like a sense of decency and decorum is getting out of control\nBut the point that your party given the atmosphere the toxic poisonous culture within it now over breakfast it cannot possibly deliver a cut hair in Britain deal\nBecause I think that in the next few weeks if the prime minister gets a deal and comes back to pull them with adult chemistry of all this will will change and we will have the votes in parliament which I actually believe would vote for a deal\nAnd I would I hang on this is interesting so your vision of a deal it's a deal that she's done with the end you're twenty seven year old telling me I can get through the British Parliament but it won't have the support surely up some of the people I've just referred to with the language that using so presumably you're believing you can peel off\nSomething members at least of the opposition Labour Party is that it\nNow I think we'll pillow for lots of those little making the noise against because I think\nPay check as all of us all a little bit\nYes ah that is my belief and I think we should then supported\nI don't see how your policy can survive that your former boss well yeah it's getting more chorus Jones and\nHe says ... is a kitten to a suicide vest being wrapped around the British nation you'll response to that was it's one of the most disgusting things that I put it in ... in politics you said this is the end of Boris Johnson if it isn't now I Will make sure which is late so I put it to you that if you and people like Boris Johnson who\nUsed to work for a war with each other even before this check his deal is put back on the table before parliament is the final deal with the Europe your policies finish that\nBecause at the thought is was bigger than the events that has to cope with in the case of ... as much a journalist as a as a politician says sometimes he uses the floor of language and what was happening was that he was clearly intending to get into ... with a wish to undermine the\nPrime minister on race you are listening to finishing off and\nAnd that's all if you you can solve or if it's a bar is back in ... in order to try and just get in to back off I had a political ... that is what happened and I think the prime minister or will be able to deliver this I think talk or by people a challenging a much exaggerated\nFinal four if you are wrong if parliament rejects the bill that threes and may brings back\nFor you want the best option then is it a change of during the ... on a different kind of bill is it a general election or is it up people's a so called people vote another referendum on Britain's relationship with the Europe including the possibility we actually stay in office\nBut I think you know tied to what they call the people say you need to act of parliament to make it possible that ain't going to happen at the moment but I think that if a deal to parliament and it ... it\nWhat does it would be we'd be done and it's a completely on them to energy about what's happened and that's why I wanted to happen which is why as I as one of the older members of parliament\nAppeal to my politics of stick together a top I'm having a guy that the prime minister all the time and to realize that you know if we get older is wrong we might end up with the luckiest breakfast oval ...\nLabour government led by Jeremy Corbyn which is like having Fidel Castro ... Downing Street\n... we have to weigh in that but I thank you very much for being on TALK very much\n[noise]\nDistribution of BBC World service in the U.S has supported by babble language after the teacher's real life conversations and a new language like Spanish Italian and Russia\nBabble ten to Fifteen minute lessons are available in the app store or on line and babble dot com and by progressive insurance protecting commercial vehicles and offering specialized coverage is designed to protect your business more progressive commercial dot com\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nTo hang on a second that you're saying that he's actually raised more money by saying he will not take any money from the corporate sector\n[noise] he'll take money from people who work for corporations but he won't have any of their political action committees contribute he doesn't want to serve in the Senate if it means that corporate pacts got him there\nAnd that kind of an appeal is very compelling for small dollar donors to see that their donations are not just important but that that'd be the only thing that can help them when\nDoes this reflect Ben ... American political culture a desperation to see somebody who is not taking money from the ...\nI think the facts because there has just been a function that it is very easy for a small number of people\nSmall dollar donors what they're saying is that it's possible that we can have a government backed is elected only by people making small donations even campaign finance advocates going back to the Nineteen sixties\nThey said that there is absolutely no way that they could win office or on small dollar donations that's changing a Bernie Sanders showed that it's possible to run for president by rejecting corporate pacts and superPACs and better O'Rourke is making a very big play\nTo try to win his Senate race and he's doing that in part not just by making his campaign power by small donations but then asking those donors to become volunteers to knock on doors make phone calls and turn people out to vote\nSo this is being mobilized obviously on the one hand by the Internet the fact is you couldn't have done this ten Twenty years ago because\nThe architect you wasn't there for people to just play comes and make a quick their nation but old so you're saying that the money is actually only part of the strategy here it's almost like you get buy in from people financially but at the same time he's getting buy in from them\nIn terms of boots on the streets\nThat's exactly right they're making an emotional investment to a campaign and because better or is asking people to build a movement with him he can then asked them to knock on doors to text their neighbors and ask them to vote for\nThe most remarkable thing that I think better or works campaign has done is they have ten different offices throughout the state of Texas that are officially run by the campaign but they've asked their supporters to set up their own officers and they have eight hundred and sixty two campaign offices run out of garages apartment\nFront lawn that artificial intake points for people to come and volunteer and help turn out the vote if not just about asking for money it's not just about having people involved in the system he's having his volunteers and his supporters\nThat's right what better was doing win or lose is showing that you can run a campaign very differently than anyone else has thought possible and I think the true test of better works I guess he will be how different democratic presidential candidates\nTried to emulate what he's doing mostly spending is thirty eight million plus on\nSo far he has spent thirty percent of his money just on digital expenditures that means running ads on Facebook on Google on recruiting other donors and supporters\nThat many it was a it was a similar tactic approach by the Trump campaign was it not\nYes the two best spenders right now on digital\nExpenses are Donald Trump and better at work when you have better spending so much of his money on investing in a digital program that is something that is very unique and the Democrats are frankly catching up on to where the Republicans were last cycle\nBetter at real because his car he losing including to the opinion polls by on a percentage points so do you think that as opposed to the extent that fundraising is a symptom of sentiment and in ... he asked them to think the poll or all\nThe polls that have been gotten so far in excess of all university found that Ted Cruz's ahead by eight what I think the equation is whether or not better work can turn out to voters that are not being picked up in the polls\nCan you reach voters that are not going to be picked up on in any traditionalist function of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that until November sticks and I think that Beto O'Rourke is making a good place to try to prove the polls wrong here\nWell the fact is that everyone not just the journalist and former Democratic fundraiser Michael Whitney all watching this Texas than it raised very closely indeed this year it could\nIs giving the Democrats' way of them and\nGet out and vote in the mid term\nInjury is our forties president here a tree trunk [noise]\nThe Republicans led by the president himself have been leading their own major efforts Donald Trump remains a big fundraising drawers events like this one and anyway it is important to stress that well Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been best has stoked from previous years\nWhich means that spending between the two parties over all may end up being fairly even so how might this translates into success at the polls does the money even matter that much Donald Trump offer all under spent Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but still one much\nAcademic research a recent us just that expensive TV advertising campaigns are not always that influential invoked is somehow should campaigns be focusing should they be spending an online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government illegal studies through his ways Leon Media Project he tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so the most candidates spend a lot of time raising a lot of money in order to be able to buy advertisements and to fund all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you are running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach older voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television but I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital ...\nI was a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very efficiently with digital media and so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because\nThat's where the the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nJust TV advertising they'll work it does work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent\nAnd have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently that poll numbers move in that direction so if you can out advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day the more likely that means you'll get more votes\nBut what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early in a campaign\nYou know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race all that much uh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spent so much money early and campaigns\nSo that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impact later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of that you're a viable campaign [noise]\nUm but at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage if the election is likely to be close if it's a fifty fifty race and you lose by half a percentage point and that's because you decided not to spend that last\nYou know half a million dollars on ads you're going to be you know you're you're going to regret regret it and so that's why campaigns do what they do\nSo we're all basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks but [noise] ah votes as being absolutely bullets with the TV sports wherever they may be\nAnd voters consistently say that they don't like these things but campaign\nTable and so voters in in competitive districts in states should expect to see a whole bunch of advertising online and on TV and on the radio or in the next in the next ten days\nProfessor of government Mike friends separate oil this also talks political advertising we've been discussing we do ... how much manipulation on line meant by trolls for example a line foreign actors\nMay have influenced the election that could be the subject for another business daily we shall see but regardless both parties including these midterms among the most important of our time it will become an ear on BBC will serve is of course but for now\nI'm at but not an end to this message see tomorrow [noise]\n", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "24"}
