coma for mining cruise Louis is the founder and CEO of the U.S based Planetree ... is one of the world's first and leading perspective mind\nThe last decade we've seen tremendous progress not just in the topic and environment around space mining but in the development of outer space in general\nWe now have rocket that we can reuse we've been to all the planets in the solar system we're finding moons and the other solar systems we've landed on comments brought back samples from asteroids rode around on their services\nAnd I think the big shift is we are passing a tipping point where there is more private money being invested\nIn space exploration and development than public money the public money certainly paved the way that as it almost always does and with those points of impact the exploration back from the first first explorer so to speak\nOr we can be the advantages to the opportunities and really start the industrialization of space and expanding human society too\nSpace so

wouldn't yeah water is very likely the catalyst to opening up the space age for for you and I water can in the form of aid to hydrogen and oxygen be split and made into rocket fuel\nIt's the people that rockets right on right now so the ability to take that rocket that guy from the surface of the earth to earth orbit\nAnd top it off and take it farther or make that supply chain of a lot easier and a scalable says like\nQuantity that we can't even imagine millions of people living and working in space instead of a half dozen I can get the\nIdea here 'cause there'll be a potential for the station in place for or gas station in space there will be popping spaceships will be great but I Do see a problem in the in the in the medium term ... because\nTalked about economics rockets are now going up and down from a\nBomb cheaper than they used to run I mean the cost of fuel as a proportion of a an eleven month SpaceX rocket kind of Sudan spaces is actually only a tiny fraction of the costs of the overall mission so he's he's a few really the deliverable everyone is waiting for\nAbsolutely what we will find over time it's a very cheap rockets are going to get extraordinarily efficient at going from the surface of the earth just into space into earth orbit\nAnd from that point we'll have a different type of vehicle your your taxi or you're a tug that never has to feel the weight of gravity never has to feel the force of the atmosphere it'll be permanent ... in Italy permanently in space and it'll it'll be that shuttle that takes you from where the rocket drop you off

that or or some kind of infrastructure before you can even begin to start arguing for the benefits of space mining\nWell this is what is the challenge and the business of space is the chicken and the egg yeah what is the theory of stepping stone that that the thing to get this going so you have to like you said make the economics of it\nIt don't happen to these economics are kind of the economics of large industrial projects a multibillion dollar project decades in length but a similarly speaking they have the opportunity for a hundreds of billions of not really in a in revenue in value creation and it\nIt's kind of thinking about we make computers so cheap probably never going to make money on computers\nAnd of course there's not a part of our lives that are not touched by computers today\nSo a space is kind of a an an the next version of\nThat quick question that if you you go you got your asteroid and your sights and do you go up and you land on into prospect and you come back and go yeah it's got all of the things we want to do I'm going to lose more besides but it hasn't gone by that and I'm just not going to be back for several decades\nA that is one of the challenges of working with asteroids as opposed to the moon or Mars and this is part of the economics of space mining we simulate challenges in remote activities in the tundra where the roads literally freeze over and you have to work with the season [noise]\nSo with asteroids one of the challenges is to work with the seasons of their orbits so if it weren't easy it would already be done and these are the things that we're exploring to find the next solution for how soon will this happen\nIt's happening now so you know you're going to have a ... thought into prospect on that particular restaurant in the first commercial resource exploration mission is probably still four or five years away it's a matter of the funding for doing these things NAFTA does billion dollar missions the commercial sector still need them\nYou which is the you know the first place in the solar system that will be the the source of the resources and do you think the finances yeah absolutely hundred billion dollar project or a dime a dozen around the world but uh five years away from knowing where the mine is and probably five years after that from starting the very first small scale money\nCritically wiki here on
