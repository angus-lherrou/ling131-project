World Service my gas today has become one of the world's leading public intellectuals who spoke as much of his attention on identity how we humans see ourselves and others\nThrough the complex prisoners of race gender religion class and nationality\nFor Kwame Anthony Appiah the drive to dig deep into such questions comes from a very personal place\nHe is the child of a so called mixed marriage his father was a lawyer and well connected politician in pre independence gone to\nHis mother was an English woman of our is the classic stall Kwame Anthony Appiah was a gifted student who went to Cambridge University and became a professor of philosophy on law at New York University He is a gay man who was married to his partner of more than two decades\nSo his own life is a fascinating example of how complex on multi led a sense of self can be\nAnd yet the way we humans define ourselves and define others often the tends to be focused on the vision we use race religion and the class to separate us from them increasingly in this young century the politics of identity seems to be fueling conflict and hate\nSo is there an antidote to this preoccupation with group on tribe well Kwame Anthony Appiah joins me now welcome to talk to the beer\nYou have to spend a great deal of your recent professional life thinking about identity and how each and every one of us labels ourselves\nSo let's start with a simple question how do you label you also\nA little bit on who I'm Talking to a taxi drivers are usually I explain that I'm off\nA gun and enough\nSort of national origin and to you when you describe where you're from and and the sort of mixed nuts if your identity although ... are you thinking that you're sending signals to go into lucky to er about about who you are\nYes I think I'm sending signals I think that sort of as it were weak signals from a faraway planet or something because because they don't tell you as much\nAs I think many people as human ah they they will so I I grew up and got on I thought it was going to end\nBut that doesn't tell you very much about how interested I Am in God or it doesn't tell you how much I Know about guys since I haven't lived after that he is and so on many people that would be more informative to know what their nationality is you know if it's at\nBut I end up pretty quickly in a conversation I think you move beyond the the stereotypes into into more detail and then it doesn't matter as much so that not all that helpful\nWould it be too simplistic to say that in in in all of your work on race religion and creed as you put it on gender and all the different ways that we can\nIdentify ourselves into identify ourselves and others your conclusion is that frankly we roll so complex and so unique that almost any label we apply it in some way or rather misleading\nI think that's right if you take all the big labels that you know the race religion nationality I'm even talk you know one of those there's so much diversity within them\nYou know men are all men are not the same man is very different from one another women are very different from one another or people in Britain are different from what a lot of people in London a different from one another and a million ways\nSo that being told the company to London it doesn't actually give you a huge grip on or anything are very important about them which doesn't mean that there are moments when being alone there isn't a hugely important that people um there are a mayoral election since ... if you're a London that when when the ...\nFrankly you can look beyond the shows have Europe to India where the current government uses nationalist and polarizing cultural messages\nShould ... three of the human condition is in ... in that pulled into ... toward a more universal list a more humane understanding compassionate humanity I Know how can you square that with what you see well\nUh I I guess because I'm looking at it over a longer horizon than just five or ten years or ten or Twenty years I'm thinking about how much things have improved in these respect\nOr in many ways over the last century also for example think about the massive improvement in the condition of waiting to people and many many countries over the last century look at the massive\nReduction in a racial\nOr discrimination in the law in the United states over the last hundred years look at the edge of the increasing coming together of Europe at the same at the moment of these moments of nationalism\nAnd put him back to that the one side which one has to do in Europe is way more unified in the United uh than it was in the in the nineteenth century\nSo uh or even in the middle eastern countries I think what did they say if you look over at low enough horizon\nYou can see the general tendency is in the direction that I Would regard as up\nOne area where I can see that you would find solace would be in the way in which certainly in the western world societies and cultures view a gender issue has been predict the sexuality I mean your your uh uh a known for very long time in out\nGay man you took advantage of America is changing the law so that you could Mario long term partner\nHow far can we go with the notion that human beings are now free to choose their identities in ways we never even thought or for not just in terms of of sexuality but even in terms of a basic gender where now there is a a very powerful movement to to change the way\nRing and society slowly appears to be moving to to accept them and new ways where does this end well\nI don't think he ends the ... there are two things at the report but where it doesn't that doesn't end with the disappearance of identity we are reforming our justice system but by not getting rid of gender altogether I ... I can ... I Believe that over the long haul into the remote future\nWe'll still have ... it'll be more complicated than the old simple binary system but there will be men and women and some people in between\nThere's the question is where the self\nIdentity and because the interestingly I I'm I'm lurching between different spheres but but I I'm mindful on ... not so long ago we spoke to a woman cold ritual does though who\nIs a white parent ... identified them indeed became an activist on behalf of the black community and lived her life was a black woman though when she was challenged about this because people realized eventually that she had two white parents it became an a fascinating and difficulty debate about who is to say\n... being black is and she said look I I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore to that extent I'm black\nI think she's a very good case to think about because you asked what's the relationship between self and and another I think you have to think of these things as a matter of a negotiation you can't simply declare the meaning of the euro and rice hold on their own race is a special category you need to\nIf you if you don't like where it's but you you need to persuade the well to change that is what trans people have done\nThe trans people have done what Rachel Dolezal didn't do which is they've created a movement to allow them to be what they want to be an artist and they've asked us to change the system I have I'm happy to respond affirmatively to that request and change the system I don't think it has any harm to me to buy masculinity\nIf racial do they'll have could have provided a could've made these arguments on the side of the people in began the thing and if you could have done it in a way to the little bit more straightforward because what she was actually doing she knew involved\nConcealing something that other people thought was important that she didn't think it was important and that's an interesting fact about that but unfortunately a black in America doesn't belong to her and so the only way can be changed in the direction that she well and I'm just I'm willing to listen to her arguments visiting it that way\nIs if she makes the argument create the movement and she can't do that on her and she has to do with other people have to persuade other people\nIn this interview and indeed in some of your writings you would have been very consistent saying it's not my job to\nFix the society is simply to understand and explain how societies work to my fellow citizens now I I get that but do you have ideas which you can share it with me as as to how to overcome the lies that currently under paying our identity\nI think the most important thing for us to overcome and to the extent that getting rid of the lies helps I'm In favor of that is is the the moments when identities leads to to hostility and hatred and division\nThat the thing that one's looking for for that I think some things can be said or but these are the things that are known to says like oh this one is so close yourself off people who live with people that divest identities tend to be less they get to and then people did that they don't allow yourself\nTo be channeled off into a world in which you've only are among white people literally among Catholics only among 'em straight people and so on open your eyes open your social experience to people of all the major kind and do things with them that are not about race or religion or or sexuality but there are up\nTogether with people because I think working together with people to divest identities makes the identity is less dangerous and then frankly if you have folks ideas about them as long as the full ride leading you to behave badly\nI'm not so worried about the people have false ideas about absolutely everything not just identity levels ideas about cooking and it and if it doesn't do much home I'm not too worried about\nA final thought that we have a a thing Kevin Rice or in the United kingdom David good hot who said that these days\nThe most important distinction and identity that that one can use when looking at people in western society between those he calls\nAnyways and the polls some ways now the anyways other highly educated usually metropolitan highly immobile people who are comfortable\nIn an open intellectual environment living pretty much anywhere in our own country or indeed in the world that would be you and then there's some ways I'm deeply rooted in people who are not so immobile whose fault persist as a small localized not so open\nAnd then they according to David good hot I'm much less interested in the kind of\nIdeals that you've just been painting with me\nI Am happy to live in a world with some whereas I just don't want them shaping the wealth of the rest of us in a way that makes us it very difficult for us today what we want to do so if my my favorite example this is the American example of the Amish in Pennsylvania\nThey sold themselves off they don't like to talking to strangers they don't like money they have like ... like lots of things that I think of as sort of inevitable buttons on well\nAnd they made a will to themselves I think they're entitled that I Believe I Believe that that that that freedom isn't their bones anybody else's freedom\nAt the end they don't do any harm to the rest of my garage into the well campaigning against the other day just live separately I don't mind that I think if you want to be somewhere like that that's fine but if you want to be the kind of somebody\nOdd from you I I I'm a live and let live kind of person I on the band the attraction of locality I remember the pleasure of of my grandmother's fingers religion that doesn't go to shed so it's a lovely place that I can imagine the perfect decent life\nOr living there are all the time mostly hanging out with people for mentioned that it's not the life that I've chosen and they sort of people who want to live that life I think that's fine but I don't think they should um ... shape a world in which what I wanted to do is impossible\nI mean we have to end the
