retailers pulling back from the sale of forums for example\nThere were a number of major sporting goods store is that so that they would no longer sell assault weapons so that was a very big deal we also saw among that list of a few dozen companies I mentioned that offer discounts\nAll but a few pulling their relationships um Delta Airlines and United Airlines told us they wouldn't no longer offer discounts to enter a members who wanted to fly down to the annual convention\nIs there any way of measuring the financial impact on yeah All right all these movies\nHard to know exactly how these companies pulling ties impacted the n._r._a. as finances we know that they are complaining of financial woes in court documents but it's hard to know exactly what that entails\nThey're spending far less candidates that we would have expected them to go out and for\nThat much does appear to be true reason filings in early October showed that the n._r._a. was spending less than two million dollars this year on political campaigns one tenth of a spending at the same stage of the twenty fourteen mid term elections\nWe didn't try exhaustively to speak to the end All right for the ... business daily from the b._b._c.\nThey wouldn't make a spokesperson available we'll play failed\nTo get any formal comment from most of those companies who withdrawal mess up off the n._r._a. but we did reach one kind of debates ... that was caught up in all of these protests David Letterman stores the chief executive of Memphis in equipment ...\nIt's a retailer based in Vancouver the price of the Parkland shooting in February was studying some products linked to a significant us weapons manufacturer vista out do group\nThere was a petition and to us that had some fifty thousand signatures on it and what we've already watching was the conversation on our our social media channels and there was some twenty thousand conversations that were happening at the time\nAnd it was evident that there was a lot of emotion um a lot of movement on this and we believe that we have to take action based on what we were seeing and what we're finding primary in our social media channels [noise]\nSo what did you do precisely\nSpoke to the vendors we reached out to industry partners and and granny trying to get a feel for this before making a rash decision [noise] the the vendors that were impacted were long canyon vendors ... whose ethics were posted two hours then says accent the holding company\nSo they were very real people um that I was in the alliance for us would have been impacted by\nSelling on your shall products made by this phone vista outdoor ... which was you would not studying firearms or ammunition yourself\nMr out during the manufacturer those things so you you basically cut him off as part of your offering to customers until they stopped manufacturing firearms and since then Mr outdoor I Believe has got rid of it so far on manufacturing business\nThey make up for sale I don't think it's been solved yet\nI'm just make an observation here we approached you but obviously we approached a very large number of U.S companies who found themselves goes up in this boycotts of um of the n._r._a. or and gun products in the wake of the Parkland shooting you were the only one who agreed to take part does that surprise you\nProbably not because as I said that we looked at this ... this was a social decision for us not a political idea ideological decision whereas I think in the U.S in his formal politicized\nDavid ... of NBC in Canada so how much have moves like this really hit the gun lobby at least in the pocket as mentioned the n._r._a. campaign spending has fallen dramatically this year but professor bulbs spit it doesn't think financial muscle is key to the n._r._a. influence anyway\nThe key thing to the ... political influence really hasn't been money\nSo much as it has been these Ellis loyalty of its base of gun owners and gun rights advocates who will attend the meeting vote based on the gun issue will make a phone call attended demonstration when most Americans stay home in two thousand Seventeen for example\nThe n._r._a. spent about five million dollars on political lobbying activities\nIn the context of American politics it's really not very much at all\nBe an array is fine and swimming alone despite its claims\nCycle they gave thirty one million dollars to Donald Trump that contributed over fifty million dollars total money they really didn't have money that could have come from Russian sources that's the dark allegation reported on in the American media in recent months and\nTheir difficulty is that their sources of funding or rather finite and there's a long term existential problem\nThat fewer and fewer Americans are interested in having guns the typical gun owner and America is an older white male and that generation is frankly dying off\nBack in the Nineteen sixties one household and to have at least one gun in it today it's under thirty percent of households and\nThere's an interesting phenomenon there even though fewer Americans own and have guns the average number of guns owned by gun owners has increased today the average gun owner owns more than eight\nSo let's hear from them rich and Mary Wilcox up to ... to gun owners they live in a rural area and the opening in New York state where they've seen a steady rise in local government restrictions on firearms and ammunitions sales\nThey let a reporter killed at the ... into the house to see some of the many weapons they keep\nThe first one is a three oh wait that would be for deer hunting bear New York state has quite a population of bears and are actually starting to get to be a problem 'cause there's too many of them\nMight pistols there that's a forty caliber and this one here with my great grandfather's guns purchased in Eighteen Ninety it's more of a buffalo gun for shooting buys in\nEach cell excited when he comes home and the deer and it's really neat what we can have for dinner as a result of that it's just amazing\nEspecially like venison with here it's very very low cholesterol because they're ...\nRemember the an array for Thirty years they support you a hunting accident or somebody breaks into your house and you shoot them\nYou know legal fees they just had somebody just recently just shot somebody in their home in the area that like a very very yeah they broke somebody broke into their house and I literally carry my pistol all the time so and it's loaded for this reason for that reason security\nWhat that does is by me having the gun and gives me a choice if I Need to protect myself or my wife or my family I can do that and if you look at your biggest crime rates in cities are in cities that don't have guns like Chicago has the highest murder rate in the country they have the toughest gun laws in the country\nTighter gun control is like you guys for how did you guys see that now\nI think it's a waste I mean they're really chasing the wrong rabbit on this thing it's not a gun problem\nIt's a mental health problem education problem it's society's problem I mean when I was a kid people brought their guns to school you go to school to be guns and hanging in the back windows of the car or the trucks that had shooting classes in school\nAnd nobody got shot like they did okay nothing it's it's more of a mental health thing it's more of a societal thing than a gun problem so you're going to outlaw guns and the only ones are going to have guns are outlaws they're making criminals out of everyday people\nI mean I don't have a problem with regulating guns and controlling who has them but you can't\nYou can't just blame blatantly said no nobody can have them ... because then you're going to end up with just bad guys having guns rich and Mary\nWilcox from a town called water for New York state well they may be a golf as all the new anti gun measures that they're saying but this could just be the tip of the legislative iceberg at least according to care Linda fink progress\nIs a credit card in mid term election next year\nThen it outside of Georgia and then to Lucy McBath\nWhose son Jordan Davis was shot and killed and Florida number of years ago and this year after Parkland she decided you know what if I Want a candidate who's going to support the type of gun reforms that I Do it should just be me and she is now the only one with the candidates like this across the country\nI think the environment and the United states is different this year than what we've seen in the past having voters energizing galvanize over something\nLike diamonds will help candidates at all levels I think what the facts all across the ballot\nSimilar to what a cool Skilling control is just one more issue affecting voters choices in the upcoming midterms in tomorrow's business daily we're going to be looking in more detail of what has been a record breaking year for us
