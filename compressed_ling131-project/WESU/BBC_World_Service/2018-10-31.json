I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think about our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context if you look in the Eighteen hundreds for example the early Eighteen hundreds that was a time with the birth rate in their states with about seven per woman it was an extraordinarily prolific birth rate compared to today and that\nReally made the contacts very different because immigration was not a huge really important part of\nPopulation change in the United states in that era\nIf you look at later you're us this was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skilled workers who could fuel the growth of the manufacturing sector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new body is if you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly urbanized economy\nThen the situation is quite different and it creates a new class stratification that entails new social programs and that also mean that we have different pressures and challenges when it comes to integrating folks who come from very low income very deprived background so I think that when you think about\nLarger global economic changes ray and not on editor of the national review conservative magazine in the U. S.\nCurbing immigration as he suggests would spell the end of the classic American narrative that is of the panelists immigrant who arrived he can you live on through hard work and determination goes on to prosper and thrive\nSo would that be a dramatic change to America's history of immigration after all the United states often described as homes the largest immigrant population in the world [noise]\nIt's a question I put to these uh chunky she's professor of history at Salem State University\nYou look at the history of immigration and how immigrants have been treated in the United states you see a big change happening after the civil war prior to the civil war citizenship was restricted to white people in the United states it was a racial citizenship and image\nGrants were welcome to that is white people were welcome to there were no restrictions on immigration at all\nBut the restrictions were placed on citizenship\nAnd there was in fact the importation of a huge non white working class people from Africa who were enslaved and brought here\nWho did the manual labor the agricultural labor but they were not eligible for citizenship and they were not considered immigrants so when we say this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narrative and this is connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens\nAnd people of color are workers to be exploited and not eligible to citizenship now after the civil war African Americans are granted citizenship\nCitizenship by birth is created and this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely racialized the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from becoming citizens so we have\nBut to prevent them from gaining citizenship by birth\nThat would imply that the American dream is a myth\nIt's a very racialized myth that is it's been a dream for white immigrants it's such a dream that was created for white immigrants and the people of color have always been excluded from\nThat in that sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than what happened previously\nNo it's not and I think that we make a mistake when we talk about the idea of the American dream and the myth of upward mobility that this is something that when we look over the nineteenth and twenty a centuries\nHave applied to primarily to European immigrants we look at the period of the late Nineteen ... early twentieth century of large European immigration where this suppose it American Dream was created\nThis was not a period of the American dream for Mexican immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for Chinese immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for immigrants from Africa now people of color have also accepted this mythology that is the idea that the United states has a country of opportunity\nThe American dream but if you look at how the economy functions today it is still heavily reliant on the exploited labor of people of color\nThe immigrants who are coming into the country today\nIt's a bifurcated immigration that is there is a very elite immigration of highly educated uh people in technology but the majority of immigrants do not fall into that category the majority of immigrants are poor\nLow educational levels and they are filling a very important role in the U.S service economy there are jobs for them\nBut there is not upward mobility for them\nThat other dean a period in American immigration history when the opportunities for say an Asian or African or a Latin American immigrant with the same as those for European know their house\nSucceeded in gaining upward mobility and are becoming very successful in the United states but if you look at it that historically those populations have been permanently marginal\nAnd play that you're on a different and the political spectrum to ... the editor of the national review who had from the other what do you make of his argument\nThat in order to safeguard democracy in America at the moment to allow the current population to adapt to change you call them and we'll needed is a cook on immigration
