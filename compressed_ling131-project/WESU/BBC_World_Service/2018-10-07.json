Copa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that the surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed a instill are probably headed into an Nino event as it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and debt usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but it woke up in a hurry and ...\nWar is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall added rage with scale full wins the Atlantic clinics But Kevin read Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change stigma and the model that the area where um there was a mostly to petition overland after impact in the dorm with fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the description I've had from friday also which is a great the likelihood of this kind of event ... these very specifically giving a number to the amount the strength of the event is being changed\nYeah so what we're doing a slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to her our approach it different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it made landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the heartache series how in the natural beauty and you could pinned down Pacific Ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that an estimated as part of pets\nArea and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast industrialization so that when we run these modified forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the ... temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that had on the atmosphere temperature as well as editor temperature changes that have on once during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific package ... that's a good way to greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a changing of the tea we actually have a pattern change of the F F T that come from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and for that that characterization that you just mentioned it's something that has actually included in the data\nAnd these patents have geographical variation can let's just look under the bonus of climate change so to speak because the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent the interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy this year while still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we take that somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there is a very large region in the Atlantic\nThat sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical\nHigh enough to form those storms is actually expanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier we're seeing storms turned into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nIs marginal changes to the Atlantic but potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater along they may have been implicated in many of the events that have mocked the past few months\nSea ice is declining rapidly melting foster most summers and recovering more poorly each winter\nJulian Streever of the national seminars state to center

to find large enough I close to set up an ice camp and also thick enough\nTo support many people out there doing their their field observations\nAnd also we were trying to deploy ... and you know we couldn't find many flow that were very thick so we're putting out these beliefs and ice that may be a meter thick and you're hoping that it was still survive\nAnd locations where we put some of our buoys out already went through that twenty centimeters of melt since we had deployed than which gets worrying that the ice gets too thin and ... out then we lose our data\nJulian through this poll
