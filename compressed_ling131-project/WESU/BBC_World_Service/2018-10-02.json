find is obviously politicians is about saving the planet but it's also back biting people money\nI'm what we find is that people and all that kind of the day they can't afford to take something along to a professional repair a\nI'm a scratched than to be told to compete retired so what we do is we do at least the assessment for free time and then maybe we say it is we're taking it to retire so we take out some of the expense and the person is going to the professional repair up knowing that it can be amended but are we in the ...\nOur daily lives is that the professional repair she'd become cheaper\nNow for many people repaired professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor\nAnd ... so we believe I Believe that uh the tax system should change and that label or should be taxed lower so that's\nA professional re fair to become more attractive in in more cases and that would enable professional repairs to run their business\nAnd um [noise]\nOn labor costs in different pulses of well so\nWhat you're talking about that might have a different impacts depending on where you are on the planet\nOne thing I wanted to talk about that I was you know for the solution to work at just of course rely on people going out of their way to get stuff from ended in the first place I'm for whatever reason a lot of people just do things like that as I found out when I paid a visit\nTo a landfill saw the other day how about some sort of\nWhat you want to come to the topic today I'm checking some topic for me to have [noise]\n... this is the golden Chevys broke yeah yeah he found the contact you break it but yeah\nI mean you say hardly broke and beyond repair rule I don't know if he's eight to ... holes in the back so\nHe's out at home and I wonder when someone could replace the missile POWs [noise]\nAnd my dad was hey I'm probably going to just I just think it's just easier to get rid of it so they might they might have been able to say is it is it the time as well I mean the time yeah oh yeah I've got two kids that have to run and I just called the public radio sometimes it's just not practical exactly [noise]\nPeople in terms of stuff yeah\nWhen you put a hold on ...\nMhm so ... to the bottom ... is that you can try but not really much point they're not willing to take it to patients clean around would cost a ridiculous amount of money it's a perfectly good that the Clinton and it just\nComes down to the fact that that's where it's perfect working older about twenty quit or in the right place or somewhere like that a parent was a real hair it ten times that much so you've got your your\nYour lungs and say we're going to put them in the well this is the full applause has been no I've already been out for and how to look in here we go\nWe should we be doing things to\nReuse things but it comes down to ... county is just wants to see did\nThan you can hardly blame people for buying the right to stuff especially if they knew it couldn't be generally cheaper than they would have gotten any desperate a joke\nSo there are a couple of issues the rise to wind up in a pound of people have good intentions when it comes to this sort of thing but like often gets in the way they're too busy I just don't have the time\nYeah obviously people are pretty busy day to day life\nBut ah there is a lady informed community of people around\nWho are very conscious about their environment that that saying that we get in some parts we get ... response because people want to do that bitch in ah in their surroundings and so that the things they are actually doing a lot of their thoughts so that things don't go to a landfill\nLatino I Wonder if you could kind of address some of the people here in this RIMPAC cafe kind of preaching to the compared to the hit for reasons because you know they're already on board with the environmental movement without ...\nHow'd you get the other people how did you ... the other people who as we heard from the people look at the tip of ... just to throw stuff or\nReally want to hang on to win that went into fresh is broken object that cannot be easily replaced by a cheap you time and we know that that's what happens when people come to the guy said they don't expect things to be read that\nThey come here and when they see that it can be done it really opens your eyes and I believe it opens your mind\nTowards a more sustainable despite the\nPolitical running show some time now his ...\nCafe in a holding just still still guiding the people that are fixing a coffee machine they pulled it ... it was a large shiny and into the workings of the device some final thoughts and from everybody ... Martina wasted started going to be ten Fifteen Years time\nWell I think that will be more repack I said because they'll they'll they'll be needed\nBut we also hope that the manufacture of realize that product shoot the terrible and that they should be a produce in a more sustainable way so that they can be repaired in a proper way maybe you might have a three D. prints are in in ... so you can print still ... to\nTo fix the things that you don't have the baseball strikes a way\nThat will be challenging but uh maybe in the future you'd you'd love that Christmas you\nOh yes I mean the future of preparing cafes his much around\nBringing people together and I think coming to retire cafe it does create a sense of community that togetherness it creates friendships slow people down for a little bit while they actually learn a little bit about more about that product somehow that can be amended\nSo I think it has a much wider road supply than simply connecting broken items with repair is hits it hits connecting people with each other\n\nThanks for everyone to most Tina I'm Patrick Harris but some\nThe ... cafe in action and making a video from ... in the best team\nWill tax will be back next week for most of the nation from around the world but for now I'm all for most a clause in house or a path and electronic say just so I'm now I'm going to ...

D. but the thing well if you stand was a pug though one it is perhaps as nothing compared to the brand advocacy adopted by the EU\nRaises issues lush has adopted an extraordinary range of campaigns promoting things like conservation animal welfare gay rights\nThings nothing to do with like ... most controversial they've attacked police operations ... office is tied to the G D activists in order to get inside campaign groups in Britain\nThanks [laughter]\n\nWell that campaign called by cops didn't stop and videos like this one the most I put up window displays and its doors with a mock up of a police officer in and out of uniform alongside the tagline paid to lie\nNot surprising like this has caused some outcry not just one of the police but Britain's home secretary the phone bank down on his campaign ethics right to Henry James admitted a bit of a mistake that but she said the campaigns will not about to stop\nObviously we took a huge amount of backlash which you know that a person of costs too often I'll stop off at the same time it caught me she talked about in the u._k. ... that it had never been talked about before so I guess that in some ways we just have to view the emotional impact on us as collateral damage to look good\nYou have all kinds of campaigns not just that one of the costs campaigns about animal testing you both campaigns have a phobia trends phobia fracking Fox hunting nuclear issues plastic packaging the list goes on how does that relates to selling golf product\nWill be trying not to ... just having passed products because all the states she said you just mentioned the things that we will cap I'm passionately ... before we became a company that made sense we level campaign as an activist before we came and went to a lot and that includes the\nThat we could use our shop fronts on our website to actually talk about the things that we were campaigning about not private lives so for us there's a huge ... on those issues it's not marketing thing\nOkay so this is all just heartfelt stuff it's not and I think to do you're saying with the commercial end of the business know how's it affected the commercial end of the business\nWhich that's a rule when he first started campaigning publicly that we would never on judge a campaign by its sales figures that we would never look to chew up at the same time because he would make you hesitate to ever to win again so that little was sacked and we largely stick to it at the\nEverybody on the right now how is it affects as you say oh I can\nTell you they don't want to because actually surprisingly it puts sales up\nWhen the campaign people came to you saying that sales were up this was during the spike ups campaign that was guessing all the negative publicity\n[noise] Ah yes yes during the spike up campaign and yet it wasn't on campaigns people it was actually a recount people came to us and you know may defend called and said you know don't worry sales are actually up you're not going to believe this you know and hang on in that is that because any news is good news\nI think it's because then you need is good news or I Would hope that what it was was a customer standing by us that they were really literally holding hands through it and saying you know it's okay with you we know what you do we know why you do it and we're going to keep shopping with you and read I care if you mess up\nAnd we don't care if you mess up sometimes\nI mean I I get what you're saying and I get the thing's a heartfelt and do you separate the two things I I suppose I'm Still slightly struggling to understand why you'd be bothered with even trying to sell soap or other products cosmetics if you're campaigns are served as Britain have absolutely nothing to do with that I mean why married or two in the first place\nI actually marry the two because we've built this huge brand we're on high streets around the world and it would be almost rude not to allow the people that are working on the issues we care about access to science facility that\nIt's allowed for for corporate buddies and ... to take a stand but he's more overtly controversial\nI Do think so yes I think that younger people coming up care about the things they care but they used to talking on line to other people who care about them and exchanging information and I think they won bronze to be counted that\nWould you like the Nike I mean like Nike and you and what you'll do would you like the other companies doing more this activist campaigning as as part of the brand promotion\nI'd like to see companies take a look at well see what's wrong do something about it and the supply chains do something about it in the way they interact with the world as well as\nIn that slick marketing I think it is more companies cat and actually you know walk the walk and a lot of us as consumers would be a lot happier say yes I'd like to see companies get involved\nHillary drones of lush here on business
