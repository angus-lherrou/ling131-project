World Service for me Stephen sack of Donald Trump did not create the deep divisions that we see within American society today\nAbout his presidency is exposing them with brutal clarity from the poisonous protests that followed his nomination of conservative judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nTo his tweets his outbursts on matters of race culture and the law the president has put himself on the front line of conflicts over gender race and values but they're putting severe strain on America's sense of shed collective destiny\nThose divisions will take political form in next month's midterm elections is just the two traditional policies Republicans and Democrats not Columbia South of each other in that big for congressional power\nBut perhaps a different sort of activism

individual the masses most in today's America no company control joins me now from Philadelphia Welcome to how to cook\nThank you for having me let me ask you this do you believe in the United in the United states of America that as a country where\nAll the citizens are equal under the law\nAnd share a sense of common purpose shared values do you believe in that\nYou're asking all that I Believe in the ideal of equality shared values equal citizens that yes of course as that is that part of a day occurrence\nNow however it's a matter of whether the values that we profess\nActually have any reflection in what's happening or in the United states one of the things that with a disturbing\nAbout the cabin I hearing is just watching um the institution that is so important in maintaining those ideals basically being a over override with\nPot politics with um impartial impartiality being rejected as a measurement of of a qualification for a judge\nSo those of us who are really concerned about the distance between the ideals and the reality of American society really distraught at this point over the direction that the country is going in\nBryant and it's interesting to me that you immediately point to the the sort of toxic persists around the appointment or the nomination for such an appointment of of judge Brett Kavanaugh to become a justice of the Supreme Court ruled costs around the world watch that\nPlay out in Washington DC and there is there for a temptation to see that the Trump presidency with the nomination a whole host of other things too\nHas innocence creates huge\nDivisions has sort of opened up wounds that the one before but but that can't be true kind of I mean he he's perhaps Neal brutally exposed them but the preexisting\nWell of course in the United states is a a country that's built on some tremendous a violation system of the very values that it's representative of so you know a slavery I'm a genocide\nA long standing patterns of segregation and this is very much part of American history the question is how the country takes up\nYou have to reach out beyond your own group whether it be women or whether it be African American you know to build a winning coalition you're going to go national and you've got to obviously you include men and you've got to include a a range of of ethnicity\nRoll back for a moment and just to just that you know as you mentioned you're familiar with my writing\nIn my writing the whole point\nOf intersection analogy is to talk about the kind of ... coalitions that are necessary in order to realize are a state of values and objective um there are many applications of intersection alley across any number of differences and cross any number\nOf forms and discrimination one of the points that I made and the New York times article that I wrote two weeks ago was to say that the failure of a coalition between anti racist and feminist was one of the factors that led to the elevation of Clarence Thomas\nAh over in as against the ah claims that were made by Anita Hill\nI'm what I argue there was that there was a common history of anti racism and feminism found in the fact that the very term\nSexual harassment and very knowledge meant that sexual harassment is in fact discrimination was largely step forward by African American women plaintiffs\nWho are experiencing discrimination when they when they were working there is a long history of African American women bringing gender into anti racism and bringing anti racism into feminist shoulders\nBut but but some African American activists women feminists and civil rights companies\nHave to the history of looks as you say the failure of times of of the white feminist to make common cause with the black ...\nI'm frankly some of them have enough I'm quoting one who ... who says I find myself at the end of my into into sexual feminist rude it's time to go back into survival mood\nDue to the dumpster fire him live Bora Bora feminist agenda and\nPoint is you know and I find this very interesting um folks who are concerned about too much group miss a respond to moments like these by showing that there are a few individuals who are at things differently of course we don't all think alike\nI'm so having a quote from someone who\nUm is exasperated by um the lack of allies chef of a white women it's not surprising I'm often frustrated by it as well in fact I'm only forty eight percent white women actually believe Dr Blasey Ford there is a far greater racial gap\nIn American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean a gender isn't significant that doesn't mean the patriarchy isn't working sure it doesn't mean that we don't need an intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same time I don't mind described as a problem\nI I get I get the intersection now the argument that you couldn't bring different groups of press people together to make common cold and that can make a very big difference I get but I guess what I'm\nI'm moving to orders are asking you how you reach out if you can reach out a tool to those particular groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be more than a majority of white women voted for Donald Trump\nIs there any way do you see that you can use your arguments new powers of persuasion to make inroads amongst those groups if we pulled and groups\nMany of us are I think one of the challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side of the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out across groups the idea that the civil rights legacy wasn't all\nOur our challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest that that we're all just separate groups and we're not really engaging in efforts to to reach across many of the differences I think in fact\nUh the last week opens up even more possibilities are every thing that we've been seeing things you asked that many women are particularly those that fifty three percent that in that in fact voted for Trump\nOr may be rethinking that but let's let's not you know see pie in the sky here race has always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for at\nHow do you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the president there do you feel about Iraq Obama because he's with the midterms coming up is going to the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this quote\nYou know this whole notion that sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women and it'll GDP Americans not as all known since I said I go votes from every demographic\nDo you see Obama or some body that you know Democrats need to\nListen to be mindful of because he had the right approach or do you think in retrospect Brock Obama actually Washington rather cool enough he he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American politics\nWell I think it's tough for president to actually change the structures of American politics um I have my disagreements a with a ... on on a range of issues some of them having to do with uh\nCreate any qualities um I had took issue with him for example on my brother's keeper it was a program that was a racial justice program but it excluded women and girls but that was a minor I'm sort of a difference of within a broader reality\nWe are country that shapes ourselves around certain values and I think he\nTried to perform that and it is true that he was able to win the support the votes of uh the white working class he was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania\nI'm In Michigan that were really important so it is true it is it possible to win votes and to create coalitions across race and class and he's in good reminder of the fact that this is an inevitable dimension of American politics\nAnd just the final thought on that as we go into elections who what we're in an election season or the Democrats are trying to create a winning progressive\nCoalition it is interesting isn't it when Ron Brown steam reflected on this with some figures from the Pew foundation recently said\nA ... democratic votes as you said a clearly divided he said Democrats must weigh the cultural liberal instincts are mostly secular wing of upscale white\nWith the often more traditional inclinations of African American and Latino support says that\nAgain in this world of of of sort of into sexuality and I'm I'm group based politics is he's a very complex a complex set of relationships and attitudes and values isn't it\nAnd I don't I make the complexity even greater I'm the most mobilize piece of the Democratic coalition is African American women\nThey're the ones that gave the vote that the victory to Roy Moore a when a U.S senator who was the first Democrat to the elected\nIn ... not only use black women as the whales in the best but how do we actually sat down and the driver's seat what are the agenda\nThat actually speak to them as we can figure that out will probably be able to figure out how to speak across the working class 'cause black women are disproportionately working class will probably be able to build those ties that at one point made the Democratic coalition a winning political global mobilize\nA coalition that's what we're looking for in this in this election will see\nWe will indeed so you can really Crenshaw thank you very much for joining me on hold to\n\nDistribution of BBC World service in the U.S has made possible by

first prototype networks because the the molten Web created back in the seventies he believes the molten Internet very structure as I grow even original design\nWe are taking an Internet that was set up for an earlier today when there was many fewer malicious\nStricter data about you I mean we're getting to a social crisis over the uh very Internet that is generated so much economic growth in the last several decades\nBut still people that are really\nPanic about soldiers at someone else's harvesting that data are particularly if they were getting a free service and Rita and if it's a social platform or something else\nThat they may not be concerned if they haven't had their identities stolen but if they have they are in one of the worst situations in their entire lives and getting out of it can take many years it's the worst possible thing that can happen and it can happen to absolutely anyone\nSo what is the onto that if there was this architectural weakness well you're\nSeeing people like Tim burners ... served timber nationally who invented the Web particles back in Nineteen Ninety who's spent many years now developing a much more deep centralized Web\nIt's fundamentally to put the control over the data about view that you generate in your hands period you have got to own your data and it others want to get that data from you\nYou may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person ones that are corporation wants her government wants that\nWe're a long way from that but I think the fact that someone as influential as timbers Lee has publicly not only develop these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it\nOr to economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have it\nSo the most simple level it is forcing Internet users regular citizens lead your eye to opt in to the data harvesting model that Facebook Google and everyone else is using rather than\nBe a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property negotiations all the time but I think\nIt's starting in medical data you know there's a huge societal gain as our bodies become digitally read out to the sharing of that data because you can only understand you relative to other humans\nBut right now you're in danger if you share your data from\nInsurance companies from your employer from all kinds of things\nSo it's a social good to protect the individual so that they will make a socially generous donation of their data because they're not afraid that there will be things that happen to them or that are bad in their future\nSo I think the European Union in some ways is further along than the United states but I I think the scale of the uh catastrophes that are happening on the net including the very attacks on the foundation of our democracy have open people up\nInternet pioneer and would be reform a very small now he's argument isn't just about identity theft and data harvesting there is another problem some reckon demonstrated by the emergence of so called information warfare fake news\nAnd that is the founder of scout AI it's a media company focused on the future of technology and she's been studying the way the both of them in ... the way we talk and debate on social networks\nI've done a lot of analysis especially at Twitter data not care and what we found it that generally if you're looking at a conversation on Twitter about a large cultural phenomenon so for example the Colin Kaepernick Nike controversy or a lot of the conversations around Robert Mueller that go on line\nOne tweet by Trump that was promoted by sixty percent pots but generally people\nThan yet of the people retreating what Donald Trump said we'll machines\nYes yeah it's important to keep that in mind when you're encountering what seemed to be really angry or division of comments on line is that there is a very good chance that they'll comments could be written or constructed with the deliver intent to anger you or to garner your support right and it happens on both the right and the left\nAnd the idea is to divide those two groups of people further and heart in ... by their beliefs are that it in order to change their behavior and specific way it\nIs extraordinary and then you just take a moment to think about what that means if you were to try and form Twitter or Facebook these platforms into a a physical community we'd be turned into a crowd of people\nSeventy percent which would be machines\nYou know it would be like walking around in your daily life and Seventy percent of people that you meet are real people right they looked like real people they talk like real people but they're actually just actors who are trying to change your perspective or beliefs about the world\nKind of like living in the Truman Show [laughter]\nIt is sold in the living dead might be another movie but I just people presumably done on the time that they still don't understand that I mean you and another political commentator out there having that conversation and I'm telling people these things but regular folks don't get that presumably cause us to talking to each other or at least they think\nWell yeah I mean when you observe the kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people respond to these people or box or algorithms whatever they might be\nAnd they'll retreat them they'll use their messaging they'll promote their messaging they'll get angry at them the way that you create news stories in today's media ecosystem it by creating a trending topic\nAnd so the ... century act out like the kindling or the spark that light the fire and then normal people get involved and it takes up steam and picked up steam and at that point\nStory then become mainstream news right through that then becomes an accepted story and it's all essentially been architect did by a group of fake accounts\nOn social media the mainstream news meter complicit in that eventually as everyone else\nI Would love to see a major media company out there and take a stand about reporting on Twitter controversies I think that'd be a very powerful statement to make other media company\nBut it hasn't yet not yet buried under the new the just the variety of owns two to fixing these problems one she reckons could be using encrypted technology like block trying to help verify people's identities on the Internet\nI think one of the reason that people are so excited about the idea of the block chain generally are very you know it creates the arc de centralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity\nUm with the ... pretty pretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into that and and get around that but the whole idea of the block chain is that every person has a node right and that ... percent right entity but all those notes are connected and every other note also has a copy of who that first note is so ...\nYeah there will be in a deep and lots of times it's not just from on high end it didn't it centralized\nBut it's also you can't delete actually a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different notes and therefore you can see oh this is the same at butler that has been talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did the interview over here and they hear the conversation or exchange that they have\nSo that is the future that is a potential future for one way in which we could at least improve the architecture these social social platforms absolutely yeah are you optimistic that this is going to that we have a way through because ultimately we will go to live with the Internet is not going to go away we caught on invented\nCan we I'm very optimistic I think we we live in a really interesting time for the Web where I think we've outgrown the architecture of the Internet but\nAnd Internet that actually built to do what it does today there are a lot of people out there that are very passionate about doing that so yes I Am absolutely optimistic about it\nAn optimistic berets Anderson who like Larry small the beginnings of change but neither of them expected to happen quickly\nNot just technology it's going to require major international country by country regulation of legal changes it's a bill of rights there's nothing more fundamental\nAnd it's going to take years if not decades to move in that direction but the solutions are beginning to be on the horizon\nInternet pioneer Larry small I guess we should stress that has one vision a point of view that he's putting forward that will be many no doubt from intimate ... who disagree over the design flaw old he's describing\nBut whatever size you settle the debate about the future of the net is vulnerabilities is clearly a cheap off to the public conversation now\nWhether the Internet changes will not then expect colds for an Internet three point O. to disappear that's it for today's edition of business that you can talk to Utah", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018",
