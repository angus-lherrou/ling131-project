them one hypothesis is that this happens because of how ... networks offer what's up for free without discounting\nThe Internet data so it's it's a cheap and readily available to and how is it being abused during the present in elections\nSo we found out that there are campaigns that are buying devices that can scrape people's numbers from Facebook\nAnd then use these numbers to our target them with lots of messages they can put people in in lots of groups and they can just send the message is individually about a candidate or when they put people in lots of groups one markets here who I spoke to was\nTold me he would put a person and a group\nAnd the group would have a name that is not related to candidates specifically like political debate and then people would start talking but there were would be to up people infiltrated from the campaign that will try to leave these people on and make them support the candidate\nAnd this is just a little fringe activity or is that an overload of this happening while we can't say for sure how many people are using this but in our report we thought that this has has been used by different candidates in Brazil and different parties

an easy answer that you can say that should be government regulation and then you effectively have\nState censorship of what's acceptable and what isn't or if you get the companies themselves to
