welcome ... good to have you here for the first time here's a taste of what's coming out [noise]\nCabbage and he\nKept on the in the region of of fifty chickens and has a mixed with his entire livelihoods\nOlder that in a moment but first on Wednesday Twitter released of false data dump ten million tweets a total of three hundred and sixty gigabytes of material relating to Russian and Iranian so cool to troll ...\nThese are attempts to use Twitter to sway public opinion around the world\nMost of the tweets came from Russia's Internet research agency which has been accused of trying to sow discord in the United states and intervene in the twenty sixteen election on behalf of Donald Trump\nNow twisted released this treasure trove of data as a tool for research is and journalists it gave it delves access to the think tank the Atlantic council whose digital forensic research that took a closer look the techniques employed by the trouble farms\nThat no matter who led the effort the lab told me what they found\nThe assumption that being that the ... the Russian trouble operation peak in twenty six to ... during the election and then in the Sunday Seventeen but actually the highest moment was late twenty ... twenty Fifteen\nAnd that's because the majority of the posts are actually in Russian and they were targeting the Russian opposition\nAnd late twenties all team was when that was really happening\nBut you then sore eye I presume the tactics\nDeveloped ... you could really see them learning how to use social media ... on the stump that contains was really quite boring it was a lot of shows from websites and it was a lot of studies stilted comment and then you can see the individual ... started getting more aggressive and more edgy I'm trying to be more funny\nOn them all they did that the more they were getting audience response and they also watching the real world I I get the feeling that they were obsessively watching the news channels\nAnd so when you called big event like um the the shooting in some other you know in California and December twenty Fifteen you could see the Russian trolls jumping in um most of them will be pushing the message that this is why Americans need guns and\nPete's on the debate did you get the idea that there was sort of controlling mastermind behind it or whether they will heading off in different different directions that was definitely some sort of editorial control going on um\nIt didn't seem to be very fast moving and particularly in the days you would see a time that that something would happen in the U.S let's say on ... on Monday\nOn Tuesday individual Russian trolls and start ... it and then on Wednesday they all come out with the same halftime and they do these massive\nBust of activity around ... hundreds of times in the day and you could you could imagine the editorial meeting which wins on Tuesday evenings I write lives tomorrow to see if you will have stuck in this is what you'll be posting obviously there was a lot of these activity\nShe used to have to and people are starting a computer science to ask them are all kinds of areas are actually crucial to the future march of the road will\nYou were asking that river any different questions un interrupting it like he might with the witness you weren't doing follow up\nYou are protecting the rights but with a lot smarter than it was\nWell course it broke both been programmed and fall on the new the new the question but\nIt it wasn't meant to be a that kind of session was that was trying to do was one demonstrated papers the program of young students out Middlesex University a really great university or the ... they had done that take an enormous amount of time but also showcase some of the work off we're both ...\nTalks about the ... or ... ... ... it did and um it's companion soldier in terms of a health care which is going to be a hugely important um with the Robert look for this revolution\nAre you giving a false idea of what a ... a professor at Oxford University who leads the AI or if it said uh aunts which I was a a a gimmick and get her to the wrong impression of a a\nLifestyle that tweets might have to say it was incredibly snooty we were trying to bring the community to millions of people the fact that you were talking about it being on the beach\nThe revolution in the same way that necessarily a policy makers might be and it's going to have a huge impact so we were showcasing the work of students\nI'm struggling potentially what can be done putting the little type stuff for what could happen in the future but also stressing that we need to meet all skills deficit because of all the way also taught is going to fundamentally change over the next ten twenty thirty is\nRobert ... and pay a Mona El ... how are you are listening to that um I don't know if you saw the ... in in us going to say it was quite amusing did you think it was a useful exercise\nI think that can time we had like major appearance of ... taking over that ... year Saudi Arabia gave a robust called sofia citizenship and yeah appearances I think it was too isn't it\nLike to thank the worldly have this technology and I think it's good to to do this to race people were and as we were going to another area but I don't know how useful politically and how he feels that testimony was\nSo excited when you and I both met pepper I thing happening here is oh well they're not that smart you'd go completely false impression of our clever those rebels would\nYeah I think I think you and I are around ... we'd probably see see through that well there's a big marketing campaign behind ... and and my general expenses that ... as sharp as you think that you know you think you just going to have a chat like we are and it's like I said\nYeah you don't get a good conversation with a ... you know\nLet's move on to the smartphone has revolutionized all kinds of industries but one businesses try to show that you can transform farming in developing countries with much simpler phones we fall is a social network for farmers in Kenya and Uganda with plans to expand elsewhere in Africa and Asia\nI spoke to ... founder and chief executive Kenny you and I'm often what kind of people used it\nAgainst their primary level we're targeting people here don't have those other ways of communicating with each other as so roughly speaking the world about a billion a small scale farmers are mostly in sub Saharan Africans East Asia who have no connection to the Internet and therefore a massive information gap of finding\nA information the knowledge and how to improve their farmer or a bottle of disease so we farm or we need all those farmers to be able to ask a question on anything to do with agriculture in just about any local language for free or ... or even off line so using a an SMS message\nSo that technology is very simple technology is SMS this does that ... well\nSo it's it's been on the front end at so and that's a message obviously a hundred and sixty ... at the very simple information format by I think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology that has to be behind the scenes in order to get get content people in such a simple format\nAs open a former U.S as the question ah for example an anathema we don't use machine learning and to understand everything that farmers trying to tell us you know what if they're in time if the question where are they order the farming\nAnd essentially use that analysis to match them to ... you know three or four people in our entire network that we think can answer that one individual question and getting up his content back to the original farmer\nNow you've you've got to a million members I think he just signed up a million the million member whoa what evidence do you have that he's making a difference to people [noise]\nSo ... million which it is always great milestone for us having to one point two million\nI'm I mean I think that the force than they get a indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it or even people who have been with his for two or three years since we launched um so uh by twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute content every month or which you know it in context is is probably New York seven or eight percent on Twitter\nAre we find it in the ... system to yours is not a social system it but by value for their businesses and people don't come back and keep using things for business unless they're getting some sort of value out of it so\nI think that's probably the primary indicator that would say uh we also obviously speak a lot to our farmers on the ground or we need to understand why they're using it and what sort of benefits they're seeing from it and we've got some you know many great stories of farmers have um you know literally had information it's helping save or their livelihoods and farms through before\nIt was an example of how it's been used a ... I mean the example\nI gave it that there's a chicken farmer that was using we farm in Kenya called called capital\nHe kept on the in the region of of fifty chickens hum as an entire livelihoods pay for his kids to go to school up at dinner and he finally table or on a disease was ... killed you know roughly half of them in the space of a couple of days or any questions about this on we farm and go get information back\nA which vaccines two years I did I just stopped into these spreading I managed to pay for the rest of east chickens um which is I mean not that it's the minds entire lively it and that's that's the kind of vital you know often seems to us fairly basic information but it incredibly fundamental to these farmers but that we found is able to to to provide\nA kind of you in from ... from uh mount an Osama from the ... Institute a special guest uh uh that wasn't one of those red now public\nA positive stories about social media or five years and so the guy and one of the social media was going to say the world that was it was a positive uses we've all that changed totally\nYeah a to tend to live in ... the year we celebrate in social media we thought it's getting to the world it in April people and a three carry genes to move to towards democracy to mobilize masses\nIt's where the voice of opposition but this was in ... near where government and regimes weren't involved in these platforms it was a platform only for act that's real people are very very few\nPeople didn't practical things like you have then yeah ...\nAnd the bad guys as we can call going there and propagating to to their own benefit so it's now a battle between two and the that the people people who want to have a voice and people who want to manipulate them\nSo this is why we are talking about the negative effect however we cannot forget that social media still can connect people together still have many many many positive effects but of course the propaganda against the highlight of the time\nI I mean ... very important um I and eighties eighties connecting people in positive ways as well or is it do you have a kind of overall view of whether we're getting more good than bad from it\n[noise] uh we're still getting good but we're getting back now and ... maybe ten years ago I Would have told you that we're getting all the good but now we're getting good and bad on the bad maybe can't take over if we couldn't control it's regulated and make sure it's it's under control maybe went down no\nOne very brief would use every climbing are you still positive about social media\nI think it gets that they kicking and right and you say that I think there's a lot of goods that comes out but it's not like to one another\nThat's all we got time for anything on the positive effects of my special guest Mona El soften the opposite ends of the Institute facts deserved climbing read over the stories of mine at BBC don't comb slashed technology and they get to join us again in the tech tent at the same time next week [noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.
