I Am I'm willing to talk about anything he wants to look good good here's a flavor what's coming up about fifty percent of children and shops the horn of Africa still aren't registered as being bullied by that fits best day\nJust about a billion people out there who don't exist basically our research found that video\nI'm ... and does not require at that extra energy that that streaming video does [noise]\nOrder that in a minute now over the past few years we've reported on this huge investments in virtual reality from the likes of phony Facebook's Oculus division at age ... see whether it's much praise divine system\nBut despite the billions of dollars spent on an overload of marketing sounds of their headsets approved well pretty disappointing things people may be wowed by the experience at first but the Simon wears off\nBut then you start up company from Finland aims to change perceptions with a high end headset promising human eye resolution and aimed at business uses\nThe company's ... and the team behind it at work together the Nokia my boss find business I go to Dan from one of the founders or who come to me\nSo what I'm seeing is and all the studios are incredibly realistic it is an eighties as if I'm there which is quite different from a lot of the reality scenarios lots of little models on the on the table or the mess of pain I can see through the ah the windows outside so how did you do this\nWe ah went to the studio and two two thousand chopped off the place in just two hours then a little bit of number crunching and the three D. model came out of it automatically and we made this that you can you can crouch around you can see all sorts of things underneath the table like everything is fully free they modeled in here\nFrom just moving down now I can see down to the buffet with is probably the right in front of me and this this is the paint spices on the bottom of a a little louder so of course\nThe whole here is that it's going to be incredibly easy to do any real rural training scenarios\nI'm now in the face of a jet again it's really realistic\nWhat this means in ... and stuff you can skip a lot of the physical full carpet simulators and start doing the training inside a VR now the thing about the areas that you can absolutely see each display each a tax walk into a nice place it's labeled switch every element on the plane is conveyed share accurately\nOr taken off the headset to to to to come from a or eighties incredibly realistic the virtual reality world as stumbled of that lately do you think that realism is going to make a difference\nOh yeah for sure I mean the reality is that we are off today has been really meant for gaming use cases they can you get two different worlds not for actor actual practical purposes of the industry's many companies have been trying to use the R for training\nAnd what are some of the suggestions of how we could provide the speech to light and teeth\nA couple of countries

interact with government services electronically and ... percent of citizens voted in the last election and is starting to ya electronically and these are things that we've been thinking about the u._k. for a very very long time in\nIndia that got odd ... which is what the foundation which they've now registered well over a billion people a biometric Lee into a into a large government base a base\nUm but on the lower level there's all sorts of solutions coming out which enabled both registrations in registrations at lower level as a company called element does have a phone based registration to whether they take\nBabies fingerprints and footprints in order to give them an initial biometric identity and there's a company called sim prince based in Cambridge\nWho use I bought a metric thing just cannot which they take ... to various places and again you use that to to register pass now we've heard stories of doctors giving patients to injections for something that I had one because they had no way of knowing that being in the week before but without having having any way of identifying them\nThose very very kind of basic problems an average creepy and then they can be life threatening\nThey can sense right well there are a number of different solutions and and uh ideas kind of vying for the mainstream if if you should say so recently had a well bank event\nThat tens of looking at to just lie down to taste there are people looking at block chain and centralized versus decentralized solutions um centralized solutions work well because you can control everything in one place and you can avoid duplicate identities and so on\nBut at the same time that our favorite political for hackers an odd how recently got tax or again to be an X. number of times recently got hacked\nAnd that's the system in India was over a billion people people register so\nAbsolutely there's concerns they're all\nUm you know some ideas about using cell phones for an identity is way you have your identity on your mobile phone only you hold it and then you can choose who you present that to when you're interacting with the service and that's the way we look at the icy we actually have it on your small five and so it's actually held by you rather than being held in a central place it can be hacked\nBut at the moment there's a number of different solutions that are vying for a time um but the centralized ones which is the most common at the moment all of the most vulnerable\nThat's Ken bank now what have you done to minimize your carbon footprint and use less energy costs out egg travel perhaps so made your home more energy efficient than maybe you should also consider giving up Netflix Amazon Prime video another on demand video services\n... video

account for about eight percent of global electricity demand\nAnd that's about three percent of carbon emissions which is roughly equivalent to the airline industry and because video streaming has such a large share more than sixty five percent of all Internet traffic um you could say that around three percent perhaps of global electricity demand\nGoes towards video streaming and supporting that but how does streaming\nVideo ... path energy use with good old fashioned broadcast TV critic praised is professor of computing sustainability at Bristol University\nI think we can definitively say that broadcast TV it's definitely more efficient than video on demand a but on the other hand video on demand is a more sophisticated service the broke us TV broke us TV effective providing the same for everyone\nAnd if you can provide the same for everyone then you just need one a system to ... cost effectively a video on demand you need to sort of point to point relationships with each individual who is consuming video any given time so inevitably is going to use more energy\nIt doesn't use as much or additional energy as maybe I had feared when I first started looking into the

Chris priest in Bristol says we shouldn't be too\nHard on myself I Would say it's not our job to feel guilty if the job of those who provide the services to engineer the services in such a way as to be as energy efficient as possible\n[noise] That's Chris priest of personal university a giant Wakefield um it's an extraordinary figures here uh about I mean which I'm only gradually become aware of just how much bandwidth is being used as a ... video and he'd been doing\nTo say I'm a company that don't pull 'em down to its management Tom fine for that report they sweep that looks exactly at how
