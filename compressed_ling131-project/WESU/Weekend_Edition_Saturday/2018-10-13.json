Miramar Beach Florida Joel thanks for being with us Hi Scott what is the situation seem like today well\nDo you mentioned there are lots of folks without power and the situation seems particularly dire in Panama City and some of the smaller towns in Bay county along the Gulf of Mexico\nThere in Panama City there's no water no power no gas most gas stations are still closed 'em and and as you head out of town to find the stations do have gas or very long lines\nMany folks have evacuated from this region but for those who stayed behind it's getting increasingly difficult just to find\nThe city about thirty seven thousand residents 'em before the storm on it's on the bay it's not directly on the Gulf of Mexico that's not a luxurious town I mean the houses are set pretty close together\nAnd right now it's like every block is is um almost like a scene from a disaster movie like their trees down there are wires in the street seems like every buildings to stay in some kind of damage\nOr either to the roof or to the wall I mean I saw a church that was missing two of its walls and and you could just be from the pews right out into the the blue sky outside um churches schools public buildings hospitals all of this at this day and a lot of damage a and I think it's starting to really dawned on folks to this is going to be a very long recovery\nRight now fourteen the debt strip fourteen people have been reported and confirmed but I gather nobody there are things such as that the final word\nUnfortunately no I mean I I think people do think that the death toll is likely

yesterday about the number of fatalities here's what he said\nWhat we have is a lot of people missing I Want to be very careful about numbers because are they missing because their loved ones can't contact them or are they missing because they were you know perished in the store\nAnd when you said loved ones are missing or can contact them it's a it's true that cell phones are not working very well not only in Panama City but all over the county so it remains really difficult to communicate and find relatives who may have stayed behind in the storm\nBut still you do get the feeling that the number of fatalities is going to go up and maybe way up when we start to get more information from the waterfront communities or you know to the south and east of Panama City places like Springfield

which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life is all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and\nMost of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person and I think it has not effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out there's some are about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nIt hurt reading the report because I was reading about these parasites that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety\n... anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about than what I think it was the early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was a thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ...\nAnd a church or face\n[noise] I think that's a difficult\nThing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teaching of the Catholic Church\nMan did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh who has their own story to do no I Do not fortunately\nNothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with\nDo you think the church cared more about itself as an institution and less about the people who had been harmed\nIt certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse seeing bishops been people whose names are plastered up on church building\nBack in my area hearing that they spent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for\nThe heartbreaking abused there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more\nInterested in preserving their own good name\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with because of the Catholic Church is is all I ever was involved and growing up so recently over the past few months\nI'm moving to a new area of starting a new a new part of my life and times the breaking of abuse new stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God I still have a faith and I just much less of

and like most Americans you just said\nCity and she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life\nI think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now but that right only practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the terror that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nWell um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't really think so to the outside world your mother or a progression of voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black women were dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know and I was around on it and she started to uh with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police why people would be even a harsher\nAnd those beatings just I think started to get progressive we worse\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town from her partner also started to get progressive worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing to us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother debating the\nI'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cause just traumatic thing but I Will say\nThe layers of particular kinds of abused really personal and structural\nI think let me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big it luckily I was a big athletic it so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em\nEnding eventually I started to start as a way of attempting to hot and the tempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and there's sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushed my body and pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know it had lots of running as police as I get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be OK lead people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how did that enter your life\nMan I'm by the time and my body broke my body literally wrote from overused and wrote from not asleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me I'm sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I've made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of it\nPerpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much to Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make\nWe are unable to cheap right and especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through\nMy gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win the white told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I would I go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home and that's why we're feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood my mother\nOr anybody else in my family experienced in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling both as my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now why do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother's death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer read at one teacher at my mother and not love me enough to instill\nA practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment\nAll coming full
