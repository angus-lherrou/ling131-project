last night in Kansas will hear more about that elsewhere the show but let's begin this hour with Molly ball she's a political analyst and time magazine's national political correspondent he Molly Hi uh so the Republicans and the president are trying to portray the Democrats are sort of a weapon I think the me too movement for political gain\nAnd on the left many see the Republican Party now as the party of sexual assault supporters with Roy Moore in Alabama President Trump on tape saying he\nHas sexually assaulted women and now Kathy not sitting Supreme Court justice where does this leave the country like a week ago when a Senator Jeff flake made his extraordinary stand a stalling the nomination for a week in order to let the FBI investigate what he said was did is ripping our country apart\nAnd that is really how it has felt that ... the whole episode has been sort of an ice pick into our nations rise wounds if that's not to ... an analogy I you thought you know I think people were already angry but the outpouring of anger that you saw\nMotion all they are for so many people as you said on on on both sides uh uh uh left that was already a quite exercised particularly ... particularly women\nAnd I on the on the right you know you had Republicans who might have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans were on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish\nAnd this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the\nPresident yet the midterm elections are less than a month away and President Trump has this is a victory to brag about along with the lowest unemployment numbers and fifty years of for weeks we've been hearing a predictions of a blue wave but our polling shows that the gap is now clothing is the wind up the president's back now and the Republicans do\nI think I have no idea frankly [laughter] didn't close to an election it's\nIt's hard to tell what it is to ignore and what his noise whether you're talking about polling are just sort of the national sentiment all the signs have been pointing in the direction of a very strong year for the Democrats you do have Republican seeing this as a potential\nA last minute surge for them uh but it is still a month away and that is frankly still a lot of time for things to move around\nA ... and the trajectory is still\nRemarkably as you said a those statistics are very good for the party in power usually a president with this kind of economic strength\nIs pulling quite high and yet the president is quite unpopular and that has rubbed off on the Republican Party and we have seen Republicans are really struggling to regain the upper hand and uh and do well in his life\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from universal pictures presenting the new film first men from Damien should now director of la la land and whiplash and

confirmation fight is now over but as NPR's Scott Detrow reports from Capitol Hill it will lightly it will likely linger over Congress and American politics for very long time as senator stood\nAt their desks and formally voted on cabin on vice president Mike Pence presided protester after protesters stood up and yelled raw and visceral messages stir mentioned [noise]\nCircles who's been seen some of it having a confirmation a Senate taking on one of its most important and historic responsibilities running smack into hyper partisanship as well as a cultural reckoning with sexual assault\nBefore the vote majority leader Mitch McConnell and minority leader Chuck Schumer sounded like they were in agreement road that led up\nHere has been bitter angry and partisan\nVote to confirm drug Scott ... is a vote to end this worry dark chapter in the Senate ... through\nBoth parties leave the confirmation fight outraged aggrieved but for very different reasons Republicans it's talk character assassination old unproven allegations designed to destroy Kavanaugh's reputation when the grams diatribe during the hearing on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations sum this up that\nI Would never do to them what you've done to this guy this is the most ethical damn I've been in politics\nLike New York's Kirsten Gillibrand soft Ford's claim Kavanaugh sexually assaulted\nPort harassment or assault\nWe allow women experience the trauma that can to a man promotion it will not only diminish the watershed moment at the title change we are as it will bring shame and this body of court\nBut in the end Republican after Republican concluded what Nebraska Deb Fischer did\nI appreciate professor for their testimony\nI Believe she has experienced a traumatic event that no woman should have to endure there is no evidence though\nThat judge Kavanaugh was the perpetrator\nThe Senate checked off a lot of other legislative business as a confirmation fight play out an even pass them sweeping bipartisan governing bells but while they differ on the root cause what became a toxic confirmation fight lawmakers from both parties are worried about its lasting damage\nRepublican Lisa Murkowski spoke to that if she explained why she was the lone Republican opposing cabin on the legislative\nBranch [noise] we have an obligation moral obligation\nTo do better than this right now both parties are ceding with anger just before the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh Schumer urged Democrats to channel that outrage into next month's election vote\nIf you believe Dr Ford\nAnd other brave women who came forward\nAnd you want to vindicate their sacrifice\nAre seeing a boost to McConnell told the Washington Post the whole thing was a great political gift thinking what he called the mob going after Kavanaugh for energizing Republicans for the first time this cycle\nThere's about a month left to election day the big question now is which party voters will still be angry about the confirmation when they're casting ballots Scott Detrow NPR News\nI and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina Hi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a nonpartisan body um how do you think he will be received by new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up hills suck it up they'll suck it up\nAnd they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court [noise] and\nIf you want to get anything done if you want to do with the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work\nLet me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan we're print them on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan that\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial and neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we left that\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it is now also tend to it all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinion\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future ...\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether the employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on fact covers gay and lesbian employees\nJust as Kevin over the place to Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the court swing vote a when Kennedy announced his retirement June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court new world look\nLike I'm closely contested cases you will see a court that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for the environment for the ability of the federal government to regulate\nFor the way the power is allocated in the federal government whether the president has more and more power or not\nNPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg thank you need us to find much thank you\nMy\nName's\nNicole child was born into a Korean immigrant family and then adopted by a white couple when she was an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence how it was attributed to God or to state you know if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um\nThe mythology of our family and how it came to be\nBecause the story was all I knew and it was so important to all of us as an adult ... did start to ask questions in a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she has her parents didn't really talk about race\nWe've been told at the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race with a relevant the word that the judge used with a simulate she chose was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you were of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nA so then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that different what what are the challenges you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents first of all I wouldn't have occurred\nTo me just say this is racism even um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like things on chance\nAnd beyond that you know there was this additional layer of separation between my experience as a Korean American and my parents experience as white America and\nI really remember feeling as though I Can't tell them like it will hurt them I have to protect them from this knowledge and if I tell them they might not understand anyway because they're white\n\nTrials later with these headlines President Trump is calling Brett Kavanaugh's

there who were devastated feeling devastated by this result and President Trump said that he didn't think there were many women like that\nI think that's it [noise]\nI feel we're in many ways Raul\nA lot of women voters from\nThat to an echo of something that he said at a rally last week in Mississippi a rally where he turned on Christine Blasey Ford and and really went after her and attacked her for her lapses in memory and Trump said on the plane yesterday that he believed that turn that\nRally really helped push Brett Kavanaugh over the finish line\nAnd that's something that's being echoed and talking points to cost the Republican spectrum ticket to the rally on this your first Trump rally and we've heard so much about how important the Supreme Court is to rank and file Republicans
