Navarro\nThe midterms are less than a month's away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate the house and many will also choose governors\nOver the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the GOP is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica highly live so Ken Democrats cut into the ... edge among governors\nThey haven't really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more deep\nAnd it's incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty Twenty one there will be a sense that that will effect redistricting how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and\nThey want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states who they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats and so it's a good sign for Democrats the math is really for them\nWhat states are you watching heading into this last month of the campaign I mean where they're really tight races\nThere's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I think some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida is always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American mayor from Tallahassee\nWell you have a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa it's going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and and that's the state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful uprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss up but then Democrats have real chance to flip them places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican system polarizing nominees for instance Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and terrorists playing an important role in places like Iowa to to where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nThat they expect to lose seats than you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans in how many of their incumbent and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip it said in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that's sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New

like Mexico beach looks now they're just homes wiped clean from their slabs\nAnd then all of the associated\nDestructive miss that kind of turns a once lush area into a desert just\nStripped clean wiped clean of any sign of or many signs of human habitation and construction no trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of a an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson and a charismatic ... out of this\nA lot of support and pockets of Florida you know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\n[noise] well we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally\nRisk out was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he's been kind of all over well both physically and these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four\nThere is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it appears so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is an executive albeit\nOf the city of Tallahassee the mayor but it was pretty hard it was hit yeah a ... Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right in the uh the the county of Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power last\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent run the census for his leadership during a storm hurricane her me this time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seeing a visibly\nIn in one case actually chainsaw in trees\nHe was not perceived as someone who is just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone to capitalize on the on the media moment and and trying to be doing the best for Floridians in it and I got that remains to be seen a what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are there going to be pulled that are going to be looking at this\nOh sure we just have to wait until they go back in the field again under stand up like the entire panels your meals impossible right now because you can't get a hold of you know in a sense of the people\nThat political market Bhutto joining us from Florida this morning thanks so much thank you\nTomorrow on MORNING edition after a big win on the Supreme Court Republicans and conservatives seemed to be at the height of their political power but will that\nChange after November tuned in to MORNING EDITION to hear what's at stake for the GOP and their majorities in Congress you can ask 'em you can listen by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your member station by name\nHere's the chain of department stores has been a part of American culture for a hundred and twenty five years the commercials from my childhood that hurdle\nRight out more [laughter] [noise] [laughter]\n\nI won't be able to get that out of my head now but the auto center hardware appliance and clothing store is approaching\nThe end of its long slow decline Sears Holdings the company that owns the years and I should say Kmart need to pay back a hundred and thirty four million dollars of debt by tomorrow or faced bankruptcy Jerry Hancock fears fan and historian and he joins us now thanks for being on the program\nNo problem thanks for having me how are you feeling about this moment as I said years it's been struggling for a while but tomorrow's deadline looks serious and reports are that\nYeah I was listening to the commercial you were just playing and it brought back memories for me as well I mean I think that's really a big part of the the staying power or is it it's sort of nostalgic you know for older generations\nI mean I grew up in the seventies and Sears was still you know a gargantuan at that point a lot of people would say that that was sort of their pinnacle or the sixties and seventies the post World War two era but if you talk to some of the retirees and folks who used to work for ... years\n[noise] every Saturday Night from him while they um [noise]\n\nI'm joy ... motor with these headlines Saudi Arabia is threatening to retaliate after President Trump warned of a severe punishment of Saudi Arabia is found to have been involved in the disappearance of journalist ...\nThe government issued a statement today after the Saudis stock market plunged drop warned of consequences that had an interview with CBS is sixty minutes\nMany among the crowd packed into St Peter's Square today we're from El Salvador they traveled around watched Pope Francis canonize was plain archbishop Oscar Romero Romero was proclaimed as St alongside pope Paul was fixed and several others\nAnd Somalia is marking the first anniversary of the deadliest terrorist attack in the country's history of bombing in the center of Mogadishu that killed nearly six hundred people a year ago\nOn trial Snyder NPR News from Culver City\nCalifornia [noise]\n\n\nDeparture NPR comes from this station and from indeed used by over three million businesses for hiring where employers can post jobs and do you square questions to build their shortlist of preferred candidate learn more and indeed dot com slash higher\nFrom American Jewish World Service working together for more than Thirty years to build them or just an equitable world learn more at age eight W.
