the suspicious packages Santa critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and takes the ...\nAre we getting it getting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us\nHow are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing twist all\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric think also about the way the caravan of migrants being discussed\nSchachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty six team presidential campaign that were in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations\nThe kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election now we came back from that precipice trained the presidential campaign but now here we're at that precipice again\nAnd it has some little line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo piece position on health care\n[noise] definitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election with a hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act\nSo we've now seen three instances in which elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric\nThere is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders uh we've had moments of turmoil and thinking of you know white supremacist from the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise] what's that this moment apart and you have you\n[noise] the phenomena are we seeing posts twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls for major U.S corporations we have product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since the ... this is a very different phenomena it's like a virus in our society\nThat is different and new [noise]\nKnow I'm you've actually researched how language informed social discussions and perceptions are in the context of immigration ... so you are looking at how the way we discuss certain groups to weigh this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect\nOn how we as individuals view an entire group of people absolutely\nYeah so in in one recent study with Renee floors to the\nThe theology at the University of Chicago we found that white American overwhelmingly the undocumented immigrants with criminality and of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite but when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about\nThe many criminals and terrorists and rape is coming from Mexico and Central America\nIt's not hard to get what is driving the stereotype\nI think one of the most interesting things that your study shows is the people who are anti Trump in general also absorb this language and associated undocumented immigrants with criminality\nYeah we were really surprised by that finding um and we actually we we hypothesized we would find something different that you know we have we are living in these um echo chamber of whoever can remain very different news and media and we thought that that will be reflected in that type of ideas and stereotypes that that a liberal versus conservative held and yet\nPM as we go down the rabbit hole of an eccentric musical tastes together only on W E s U Middletown pay the point why after\n\nI Know around with these headlines a forty six year old man is in custody facing twenty nine charges after a mass shooting at a synagogue yesterday eleven people were killed and six others were wounded including for police officers that starts back reportedly had no criminal record that had posted anti Semitic posts on

Navarro we're watching a press conference and is about to start in Pittsburgh this morning\nEleven people are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city people are injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it as a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning\nHighly though oh we're waiting to hear from officials to uh what do we know so far about the victims well let me know eleven\nPeople were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed at the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals and memorial services\nSo what do we know about the motive for this crime\nWell it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media\nAnd he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the death of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the mode of how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened\nWell authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifle we're told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were that you've been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\n[noise] put this into context for us there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how do you fit into this awful pattern\nRate I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil um eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an active hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America\nAt a rate unprecedented in decades yeah\nWe heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh\nThe cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicle\nUh lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun you know laying flowers memorial\nI'm just at the edge of the there's sort of a ... a a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner on and you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people are\nGrappling as they as they do it and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding\nYeah but I didn't mention there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a ... of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want to save and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and and so uh that's just one small thing that community is doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise ah throughout the community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThe tragedy that's happened again and again around the country um had happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it yeah I I\nThink we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\nYeah ... incredibly moving in ... um what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accepted violence as a normal part of American Life\nUm something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the son of God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks\nWorth noting that the death penalty is still on the books in in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there have been mass shootings in recent years think of taxes that actively carry out that the sentences but nonetheless the president is it calling for that to be more of the conversation\nAnd obviously President Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate\nCrime right and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that the heat that essentially that this was a you know stick thing to do until he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA ... of course you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there\nWell I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise] well I think\nIn these situations and and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this than\nIn any case it seems like a there's a there's a search for why after the a lot of shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes with law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for a crime so they can prosecute and investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere is also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nAnd in this case there are as we've said indications that suggests that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant a motive\nThat told us something about why this might have happened again that's still under investigation but um it is being investigated ad that as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference gets started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why this happens and also we'd like to know more about about the victims soon\nWe're going to bring in ... or Mara Liasson now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the terms um and a lot of people are looking at this and feeling very on edge wondering if this is really um you know connected to the elections Mara good morning\nIt's MORNING [noise] so uh\nNow I'm living their lives and we're going to offer our most heartfelt condolences and prayers to the victims of yesterday's senseless acts of hatred and violence to the families and friends and to Pittsburgh Jewish community and to the larger community of Pittsburgh\nThe Jewish community of Pittsburgh is one that we as Pittsburgh this treasure it's an important part of the cultural and social identity of Pittsburgh and so this was an attack upon our neighbors and upon our friends and one that we felt very deeply\nThe fact that this attack took place during a worship service makes it even more heinous a place of worship is a sacred place it's a place of peace in a place of grace it's a place where community comes together to celebrate that that they hold most dear and most sacred\nMorning I'm a doctor car William's on the

this\nWeekend edition from NPR News I'm Luke ... this morning we've been talking about the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw\nHe just stack is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida could mourning mourning the [noise] All right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front well\nWe expect they opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces and then we expect that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will it seemed to be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and I put the nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his van and there's no sign yet that any other help\nAre we getting a picture of how he became this extreme\n[noise] yeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests but he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and body building and nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he is we lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale in Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year\nIt's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I began making all these attacks\nAgainst David hog one of the students who survived and became\nOh I didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros the financier who's been in the news so much lately in in ... in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you've spoken with coworkers including one who was in that than\nYet\nDeborah gr Reagan was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nWould start talking less and less and less Hitler\nWe should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre we think it's a much thank you living in\nThese last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity and politics weed and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identity and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by a nickel Hannah Jones she covers race to the New York times magazine welcome to the program\nThank you for having me so\nWe often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely meant and their race at all\nOh you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class voters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for white voters\nWhat happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and that voters of color or somehow the only ones who engaged in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so\nI have treated frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of that statement\nAnd that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also just that accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nThe political implications of not being specific when we talk about my people\nWell I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue\nAnd in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so fight and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race\nHouse another way politicians may not explicitly say why it but are voting it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world to something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut white voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not\nActually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows when\nWe were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is that most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair\nSo how did those two things then said when you're trying to discuss some of these racial um divisions in this country\nOne I Would clearly argue we're all biased\nI think the way that we covered the election showed that biased to be very glaring clear\nBecause we were ignoring literally where voters on the ground were saying right ... voters on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's boss adopt to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt\nAnd we were like no no they don't know what they're talking about it it's it's economic anxiety so that's biased", "show_name":
