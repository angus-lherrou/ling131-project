hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty feet I'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years and the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul\nDozens are dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is reporter Jennifer ... she is in Kabul thanks for being with us get to be here live\nSo were people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence keep them away\nYou know the fight threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we really only seen numbers from the big cities in the rural areas where people are most at threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by policemen he detonated his ex\nIn center outside bit of ... city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the outskirts of Kabul a brought his armed men in he's a candidate and he tried to prevent\nOther people from getting to the polling stations so not by far the cleanest elections the Afghan government announced they arrested a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs though this time around is the number of women running right over four hundred what will just mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight states uh in the parliament for each province\nAre but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament\nHas been a frustration many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that has held Afghanistan back and it was really interesting just the election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates and make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghan trying to change things and just\nBriefly what dignified of the vote was held after so very long it's always important to remind people that this is a country in conflict to conflict at the United states is involved in\nIt is and there was a lot of controversy about whether the votes should be held at all\nBut Afghan officials were adamant and international officials were adamant that they were going for with this vote and I think today they might be happy with their decision\nMore than three million of eight point eight million registered voters coming out there trying to show that the that Afghanistan is making progress as a battle insurgents around the country the Taliban or resurgent Islamic state was against the vote and yet still Afghans came out\n\n\nDeparture NPR kind of trend station and from the library of Congress with a ...\nMore at one eight hundred three

columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that's my mommy is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy price or ... or the development of this story playing out in the middle east is proving to be a loyalty tested the king demolish any opposition in the region\nPlumbing governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or many of the issue a statement supporting a boat so Saudi Arabia and the un Kingsolver and of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissidents [noise]\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion on may in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nAnd trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east an American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very calculated in terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think leverage is possible particularly with the Saudis and I said that they played it\nAnd people in prison and many of them are are journalists as well and activists than others and so there clearly not a the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending or you know uh this one ... and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price uh from the Saudis which has yet to be determined ugly\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why exposed Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they are facing an impending economic crisis\nThey have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated that\nUh they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange the native investment that he'd investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so that doesn't want to go to the IMF it's very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\nI and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to impose sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more better thing actor in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much thank you on September twenty six twenty four teams students from the teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer buses their ultimate destination\nAnd we are presumed killed in and around the town of ... although there remains have never been found their deaths were very asleep blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups in the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I hadn't done this a published an exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the event was\nA fabrication in these officials better son the Mexican government said that the army and the fact that I Believe they didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything and beat you up he's just do what I have seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official better showing you sound like it's not true its ally [noise]\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked these students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the ... not just where not about what was happening that night every mean looked so they knew the federal government and the police not just the\nEven more I had reports all the ... report that proves that the army and if it up well he's white chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean the I was before that that [noise]\nSo the federal police and the army was chasing the students how the students killed [noise]\nWere waiting for them than they do then decide to move that to Boston where they were transport dating inside to this CD\nTo be able to take the more bus mhm they'll get the was take more buses to go to that brought this to Mexico City so they went to both the station\nThey do do that you both us and when the students were trying to Cape ... be spy buses ... when the army the police then when you see by police and the staples east is that the shoot\n\nThey they're all of that day of of that back way to Boston from these two buses disappeared or they're forty three students\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students on this must have disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police\nAnd the army get involved in this\nThese last I think the most difficult part of my investigation cause I'm In the students were traveling in five bucks that's why they've got a good watch just to\nFill the to Boston where exactly that to Boston is that the army and they said that police it back to money for eight\nSeems Steve ... before I mean these two both this was the last days where the students were traveling from the school to why why so when I was able to have found is that indeed do both\nHarrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students have even now for the army and if it that I Believe they knew it\nSo these students were almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know this was that really tragic I see that they didn't know\nHow do you know that heroin was hitting on that bus [noise]\nI was able to connect with ... in both on drugs locked I was able to conduct with one person that works for him and west these uh informant and inside the cartels that explained made this ... [noise]\nDo we know who ordered the crime I mean there's been over a hundred arrests in this case do we know who actually said you know targeted these students in order to this to happen\nAccording would my investigation that there's a responsible these crime wise that twenty seven battalion anyone\nIn particular the coat on their dad received a phone call from the rubble are\nOrdinary him you have to rescue my drugs I pay you for the you have I don't know I don't why do you have to do I want my drugs back\nThis was a show for you right here at Seventy eighty to eighty eight point why now than middle [noise]\n\nUm trials later what these headlines President Trump says the we'll be talking soon was Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman speaking last night after a campaign rally in Nevada Trump said he needs to learn more about the killing of Saudi journalist ... Germany and France are calling Saudi Arabia's explanation incomplete\nAuthorities in Georgia or in the middle of a manhunt they're searching for one of the suspects and yesterday the shooting death of a police officer during when that ... second suspect is in custody\nThere was also no grand prize winner in last night's Powerball drawing on trial Snyder NPR News from Washington [noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from pro quest who's literature on line premium features works from the eighth century to the present day and makes minority authors works discover all along with the western canon at libraries or ... dot com\nAnd from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed a financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement more at alliance for lifetime income dot org\n[noise] this weekend edition from NPR News I'm ... and it's time to play the part though [noise]\nJoining us as always is Will Shortz puzzle editor of the New York times and weekend edition is puzzle master good morning well you're burning Lulu your back from LA I'm back from LA I'm so go ahead and remind this is last week's challenge\nYou have to take the seven let her last name of a famous woman dropped the letter E. add an eye on an F\nAnd you can rearrange the result to get a word that famously described this woman who issues and what's the word we answer is Steinem as in Gloria Steinem and she was a feminist and how cool is that her name has all those letters\nVery cool um we had four hundred and thirty eight responses and the winner is dead pan of China of metal is New York congratulations and welcome to the program\nSince I Can't really with is a dream [laughter]\nThis was this wonderful\nI I also heard you have a large collection of books as well\nYes um I collect Sherlock Holmes pets dishes and novels and stories about a Conan Doyle um have roughly a just check this morning I have about a thousand now\nWow what draws me to Sherlock Holmes um\nThe the analytical thinking the way that he's able to you know analyze a problem from very little information\nWell um I Hope you'll be able to analyze the question to the title um are you ready to play I'm reading All right well take it away [noise]\nAlright Dan I'm going to give you two words\nThink of a word that can follow my first one and pre said my second one in each case to complete a familiar two word phrase\nAnd the answer will rhyme with one of the two words for example if I said male and order you would say male as in snail mail and mail order and mail rhymes with smell and the rhyme can be for either the first or the second we're\nNumber one is legal and by the Y.\nO. reason she can't get a hint\nThis when the answer here rhymes with legal legal blanket blind guy\nAll I can think of beagles and it's not right\nOr just take just take off the constant as at the start of legal eagle eagle eagle eagle eyes it okay you're often running number two is health and their BA our\nHealth care and it's it healthcare care bear fat F a T and burglar cat burglar [laughter]\nThat's it hype and team the AM\nPipe dream\nThat's it pork the O R K and shop S.

Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and purely local concerns and I think something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule\nI'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his productions of a red wave of what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have\nSaid they're just gonna maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two state to really important in twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases is purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads are the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if the situation would reverse what Republicans be hammering the same issue\nI I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves\nSo Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads so let's look at\nConnecticut a Democrat there have majorities in both chambers but there's slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip and one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that didn't as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yet but taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about uh how a democratic tax increases\nHave changed a lot of uh Connecticut residents away that's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere's something pivotal at stake here though on other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll\nBe able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks are going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nRead Wilson national

Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized it we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nUse identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use our drafting for example use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but I think that we can overhear during the day and we can\nBring identities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best still matters in the world whether in her man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take 'em too seriously and many political complex I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say maybe that the most important thing for them as they should be able to get our kids health care even\nSo you have to balance it out\nToo well I think Anna in politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talked about it without either alienating or collapsing\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly\nGasoline [laughter] I I think you can easily go wrong hair meanwhile the things that the president is currently during is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that leads down the terrible road because once you've created as a racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians around the world and and you know all through the ... century they're drawing people together or through making them feel ashamed of hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now\nThe labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means that you lose the sense that they're not election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order they should run the country\nCan send to you I mean I'm I'm hearing a a real concern that identity politics routed it had been lesson I ... and it certainly\nI think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know countries today is is that where more divided around identities than we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come to reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nThere's no coming together ballooning [laughter]\nLosing to the other side\nBut in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to a certain identity because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nHere by the question is whether you can do that with what your cold Rodney recognizing identity\nAnd I think your time I think you could do for example more about the actual policies
