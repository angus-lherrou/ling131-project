I'm Scott Simon we're waiting for the Senate to vote but Brett Kavanaugh looks to be headed to the U.S Supreme Court\nJudging from official announcements and from a procedural vote yesterday Senate Republicans have secured the votes they need to confirm it that is expected to demand a conservative majority on the court\nNPR's Ron Elving joined just run thanks so much for being with us good money by now we can both named conservative justices Souter Stevens Blackmon Kennedy who issued who joined a liberal and progressive is on the court but uh this confirmation that Brett Kavanaugh could have impact for generations could\nYes we assumed the current line up to five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents do named Bush now to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members were alumni of the federalist society who it's been which has been a growing forest on the court for years and a swelling presence on the federal bench that it's lower levels and with the Trump Administration and White House counsel Don McGahn or they have truly come into their own [noise]\n... what do we need to know about the federalist society expects\nEighties it was a pushback by students in Google's legal scholars are people who are convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy of a few justices with big ideas about social and political justice\nMembers of the society of indicated a desire to revisit some of the landmark decisions of the past two generations\nAsking the question of whether or not the basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody's interpretation of the constitution and let's underscore there's nothing remotely secretive about this right\nNot a secret society at all and they've been quite public about their campaign and about their influence within the Republican Party\nAnd about their desire to revisit things like the privacy concept in roe versus Wade that legalized abortion or even the one person one vote concept that required state legislative districts to have equal population\nUm if Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation\nIs the the the combination of of decades of organizing um are Republicans energized get out to the polls about a month from now or do many feel mission accomplished\nThere could be both a feeling of accomplishment and a feeling of opportunity to press further and some resentment over the confirmation process and some of the accusations that were raised in the way they were raised against Brett Kavanaugh\nBut Mitt terms are more often driven by anger than satisfaction and right now polls show a lot of women and younger voters are unhappy with Kavanaugh and even many Republican women are unhappy with their party and that could also be a big factor in the midterms I'm\nNow it's interesting to me you point to anger and that certainly reflected in in the surveys you mentioned unemployment is at a three point seven percent or\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from universal pictures presenting the new film

Supreme Court\nBut the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school begging the colonel columnist for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views [laughter] which we welcome entry and George is making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian bus before now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] or was that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nDon't think so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like\nUm I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with the as it than look to possible\nThat they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote you know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all information out there you want to first of all next\nLook we did our job and we can't corroborate this did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh um some people say that's actually pretty normal and people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and then it had both of them had testified at length and\nYou know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of that because she was well she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she had told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen ... should\nPeople they basically issued his cooperation were her therapist notes which seemed to say look she talked about this other not with Kevin ... name in two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapist notes to the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen but\nMe ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's energy from Christian busting Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses swears to portray a judge now the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime\nIt's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage\nHow difficult crime because you know some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to can than you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible on and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in that neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy being called a rape is twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews for Republicans kept saying presumed innocent ... ah until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrent [noise]\nUm but also you know a Supreme courts see it as a very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth [noise]\nUm it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it's it's way worse than what ... making the hurdles thanks so much thank you [noise]\nOoh\nTrump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from\nThousands of pages of financial documents the president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations is Dilma Brian he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott\nTo news though I think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth for about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family to keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inherited in gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars it was transferred and instead they they paid around fifty million or so ...\nWhen when Donald Trump has said over the years I've built with I built myself\nHow how does that stack up well that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans\nAnd loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches I think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that\nThe times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is the president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever\nThat maybe people are going over the story now can recognize is distinctly\nIllegal yeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used and appraiser who actually low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company it was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending an equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nSo it most they may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president the most about what I think really will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks down this idea that he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps and he he earned his living on his own\nRather than being someone who was born on third base and said he hit a triple which is essentially the story he's been putting out there for a long time\nIt's W. we ask you\n\nA trial later what these headlines President Trump has another campaign rally on his scheduled this weekend that you do in
