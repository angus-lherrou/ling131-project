distinguished scholar at the Wilson Center a contributing writer for the New Yorker Robin thanks so much for being with us great to be with you Scott and let's begin to the crown prince is it possible he would lose power over the crucial view fare\nWell they're four different options one is that he stays in power that the international furor eventually settled down and uh he managed to kind of orchestrate his ability to stay\nOn the throne um he is a de facto leader in Saudi Arabia because his father is age to nailing the second scenario is that he is replaces crown prince and there is precedent for that\nUh over the last three years to other crown princes have been pushed aside in part to make room for him there's a third option or that his powers a weekend that the king of points\nOthers in the royal family did to assume some of the roles that uh MVSA has managed to accumulate in his office over the last a year and a half and the fourth is that there's a kind of physical challenges that was to king Feisal back in Nineteen Seventy five [noise]\n... oldest son was photographed\nI'm shortly after he'd be allowed to travel to the u._s. I Would go according to reports she's arrived there is it possible someone told him pose with the prince and you can get outta here\nAbsolutely uh there's no question the royal family had banned him from traveling since his father had left the kingdom to go into exile\nAnd there had to be a lot of behind the scene maneuvering including a request specifically by the United states and secretary of state Pompeo to allow him to leave the country and joined his brothers in the United states three of a ... sons are American citizens and I gather the fourth son was not\nA head of the ... was in

alleged tape of\nI'm Jamal his last moments and what happened to him inside the Saudi consulate in this temple I think this is going to be a pivotal moment for the Trump Administration it has to make a very hard call what to do about an ally that has been pivotal\nIn three of a President Trump's five most important foreign policy goals\nAnd those are well the first one is obviously this elusive Arab Israeli peace plan that President Trump originally said was not going to be as difficult as everyone thought and it has been repeatedly delayed it was scheduled to be rolled out this fall or the second is the Iran\nAnd squeezing Iran either a change its behavior or change the regime\nAnd the third is kind of terrorism in this age of ISIS\nRobin Wright who is a distinguished scholar at the

the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem beaten joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me on\nWhy wasn't Internet research agency interested in whether football players took her new you're not during the plane of the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like health care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what\nNational anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just\nPeople that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency\nWell what we found was these tweets had gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls bring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA failing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that break down wonder how that influenced the conversation\n... short it it wasn't directed at ... certain result just to just share things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord and this is in some ways just the perfect\nDo what you're doing you want something to go

interesting notes that the ... and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitor new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations and they're continuing to weigh in on controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charged moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue

church bombings in this week although thankfully no one time\nOh that we have a particular role or handling all that stuff\nThat's your job and we know that what our audience wants is for us to make them feel a little better and if that takes a ignoring the bad stuff in focusing on the goofy them will do that if there is something goofy about the bad stuff will highlight that\nAll I can say is

second president the second president was Bill Clinton who appeared hosts presidency that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job in the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions that are inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually a very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case to but they might also have those opinions but now they apply them to a human being I Love bill Curtis yeah how could you not and I missed Carl
