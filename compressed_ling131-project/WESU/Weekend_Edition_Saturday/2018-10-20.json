your experience does the Saudi explanation of how Mr ... showed you died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation or that or was promised to secretary of state or a ... when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and Riyadh were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancelled that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies I first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior\nWell uh to to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which\nBy the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership or in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society's\nWell yes the exports of a democracy to foreign countries on to\nA point of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries that are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet\nThis administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept a Saturday explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a\nPresident of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it does not the only factor we have other interests are and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of\nRage there practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments of that would have real leverage over the Saudis\nThe president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen top two weeks is not acceptable even colder thank you thank you\nSo during for profit is it new you probably remember Hector mercenaries from grade

joins us in our studios thanks so much for being with us thank you wire us retired special forces which is what you're talking about your investigation such demand\nFor the last Seventeen years\nFeels special forces and other parts of the U.S government have expelled\nAt this modern style of warfare at a this sort of counter terrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and uh we don't often like to use the word assassination but that is what it is\nBut your investigation uncovered\nWorks in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in eight and twenty fifty [noise]\nThese special forces or an unsealed veterans Navy SEAL veterans'\nDay deployed on a mission to kill\nThe leader of the eight and branch of al Islam and all those lies I write is very important political party in Yemen to this llamas party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group and unless the UAE e as we writes hired this company to kill this local political leader the\nLA and Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us report now you you should just in the story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was a reservist and he was a seal reservist he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically he had a ... a top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know and\nI guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal the Jewish citizens couldn't do that there are laws that govern whether the U.S whether us individuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nAre you seeing how Americans have served in the French uh I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces and these are numbers on a lot a\nLot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during world ... short\nRight now and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries but I I don't know that there was uh\nTaliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that has all this is a buzzfeed\nStory not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an anecdote or a trend\nRight it's just an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend\nHere are the only ones who've done this or the other countries to try it [noise] um are there other Americans other than the ones and the other American people to leave you've uncovered yeah right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm gonna keep on looking at it and I've had the honor\nOf interviewing several X. special forces over the years who are working as Secret Service agents or running for office why would they want to continue to risk their lives and do this kind of work well\nThere's several reasons one is a there's a lot of money involved but they also argue they believe this is part of the war on terror but their argument is look the way he is close to the United states the UAE he's doing U.S policy the ... the U.S has not spoken out against the war in Yemen we fuel airplanes we sell them bombs we saw them guns we train them we can do to train them\nTheir arguments they're doing what the you know basically the U.S U.S foreign policy anyway\nSo they've they suggest you which patriotism yes this era must an investigative reporter for buzzfeed thanks so much for being with us thank you so much\n\nOn trial Snyder with these

opioid crisis is that the face of addiction can be just about any face an obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week\nIt included a photo of smiling face of metal to blend in there with her toddler son eight and it was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo showed a good day for Maddie but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and production ... high school party\nA drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody up or some metal and Lynch in near died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age\nHer sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary in joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks\nMy sister\nWas beautiful and bright he loved to thing she wanted to be an actress and starring Broadway musicals and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with those spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate based painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it [noise] you really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get silver and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then it's often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nIf you're drug ... more than one program I go over to ...\nYeah she tried many [noise]\nWhat made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share ... addiction\nDefine the way she lived and to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry out for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that the death stop happening the president daughter treated her obituary so\nLet's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate painkiller\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about Matty with her son in her ... in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for\nYeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWell through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a video of Matty hanging up on the ... ... just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about his obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and that's kind of huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now\nAnd I think we'll have
