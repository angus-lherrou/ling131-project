reconnection as what cat needed people living upon this fund peacefully for thousands of years it's only been in the industrial revolution really revolution and the past two hundred years that we've really gone downhill and change things for the worst for ourselves as humanity and so if we can take\nTime to reconnect with the sacredness we can change the course of our future that to just like all this other stuff that too has been prophesied that we have a choice to take one or two paths\nRight now we have our foot down one foot down the wrong path we can pull that foot back\nIt's just a a an awakening and awareness amongst people to\nTake that next step and not fall into that trap of capitalism and\nDe colonize our minds it's really hard it's hard to do you call and as your mind but if you potentially you know practice it every single day there's books that have been written by native scholars an author's around the colonization it can be done and we just have to do it as individuals and not sit back and say\nSomebody else will fix the climate crisis our government will save us um it's God's will because that's using religion which is not smart to do either we have to take tests\nOr mental network top ... just to transition out which is one place that to people who want to support the work that I ... and does all can also make donations to tell us about just transition\nIt's not\nNew thing um it's become a kind of a buzz word as of late um it really started like labor unions people working within on unions were\nSeeing that that people were getting sick and dying on the job they were seeing that workers were having problems with the way that some of these industries were operating I'm with the way they're also fuel industries to actually fossil fuel industry is because of the poisons and the toxins and the chemicals that are used inadvertently as a result of that\nEspecially these extreme extraction processes are seeing now tar sands extraction fracking I'm uranium development event and so [noise] as native people we've talked about for thousands of years locking lightly upon them and um this transition is more of a\nModern day spin the twenty first century how do we\nSave ourselves essentially and so it's a transition away from the fossil fuel economy it is stopping now any new\nDevelopments moratoriums bad\nTo stop the development that we already know has caused too much carbon in the atmosphere\nToo much methane in the atmosphere all of these missions are natural cycles nitrogen carbon math and these are all natural cycles they're being thrown out of whack and not a balanced by us putting way too much digging it out of the earth extracting it and so the judge transition principles talk about how each community has\nA say in a way in which them forward because it's going to be different for everybody no matter where you are for example I'm from Newtown North Dakota for the Fort Brussels reservation you know I'm a man that had the recall moment and we were farming\nDrought resistant there has to uh we don't need pesticides pesticide resistant these sheets that we still have that are in danger of disappearing because of my time to because of GMOs because of you know what people perceive as cool\nOrange yellow corn they think it's the only thing no we have so many varieties\nThat's just one example of bringing back a transition we're looking at ... development throughout the state of North Dakota we have all of this beautiful flat land that we can um\nDeveloped hemp and use over twenty five thousand uses that are so much more beneficial to our environment and our society and wind small scale distributed when nothing corporate nothing large scale use what you have in your community to bring back the jobs for the workers to not\nHim asking later men which is what happened to native people you know our warrior status was was stripped from us and and men were defeated and we were told now you're going to do this and we were told now you're going to do you're going to become cattle and you're going to come ranchers now people are attacking us for eating beef you know and it's like\nWhat are we you know we keep being told by another society this is what we do and so it's like okay how do we regain our blood memory use what we have in the land and a good way where we are that to adjust transition maids\nGo away from the fossil fuel industry and pick up those gifts that are given to us by nature and use them in a good way like we have for thousands of years prior to this without pipelines without oil without ... without gas we survived and manage not to kill the planet\nI'm not saying go back you know to the stone age I'm not saying you know be dramatic and extreme but we do have to look at the action that we have to take now\nThat we had to take yesterday and not just sit idly by and wait for somebody else to do it the the phrase you used earlier walk\nIt's not just as individuals because unfortunately too much emphasis is usually just based on personal responsibility right but we're talking about policy makers that make decisions for our cities are built and how\nOur roads were built in health um vehicles function et cetera to walk likely upon the earth is such a good guiding principle did not truly points towards the solar and wind energy over\nThe constructive um fossil fuels that are so damaging to the earth boots on the exception process and then of course in the actual consumption ... to ... to this particular just transition program does\nIt I'm focused on native communities are there specific places where the transition program that people can help to fund is actually being implemented\nYeah right now we have three places have the Fort versus reservation which is right in the middle of the block and fracking boom right now in North Dakota\nTaking those steps away from digging out and and and extracting from the earth and moving forward we had the crow reservation in Montana that's working on the center pool project I'm working on a transition where there's already a whole community and plays a a bit further\nA developed than what we're working on at Fort Worth old and then we had the United nations in Louisiana in the south that are working on seed saver exchanges are\nFood banks working on medicine levels of gardens that are being put together with our Monique virgin is her name that helping us there\nAnd I'm Peggy Barry hill it's helping us and crow and then we're leading up to charge in Fort personal because it has to be the people from their own communities they know their communities best\nBut I did want to comment on something you said about you know how the onus is always put on the individual and yes and so tired of the industry saying it's supply and demand a turn off your water when you brush your teeth well they simultaneously not only use but\nWhen they know we're in a climate crisis why I Would love to drive a Tesla if I could afford it or you know or something where I can plug in my own car from my own solar panel solar panels can be made from ash and bone\nWe know that there are technologies that we don't have to use precious minerals why isn't that being done it all comes back to money\nThat's the bottom line of these industries they don't want to lose money why are they allowed to make some cuts we know how bad Styrofoam is for the environment all these things that they put the people on they shouldn't even be allowed to put them on the shelves and and people attacked me all the time what do you drive does your vehicle run on unicorn farts I had\nOne guy said he cracked\nMe up I think you have a good point but no you know it's a hybrid and they worked really hard and paid like ten years to be able to afford this hybrid vehicle and I am trying the best they can where's my ability to get something that I Know it's not going to harm my children\nFor the most part I Try to walk but living in Montana North Dakota you're not walking many places in the winter especially with kids I have a five year old so we garden\nI teach er about where to get water where to get medicines where to get our traditional foods 'cause they're they're in the ground we have all kinds of berries and turnips and ground ... and ... and water places she knows how to garden that five years old she's planted all her own seats this year and we had a huge garden those are the kinds of things that we're gonna have\nTo get back to its humanity whether we want to or not because I think that's what if one day you go to your tap and turn it on and nothing comes out\nWhat if you go to a grocery store and there's nothing on the shelves are you going to know what to do it do not during the day scenario it's just thinking about the natural order of how we take care of ourselves and what sovereignty truly means you can't truly be sovereign or take care of yourself if you can even feed yourself we've got fired into that\nIs in place and working the these sound like um they are really great model for that could be replicated elsewhere ... so these are the are they self sustaining are these can you give us a little bit more detail about any one of them so that people can picture them and then\nOffer that they've given to date Georgia trade affiliate it would take five years to bring our union Detroit workers they're up to the current wage standards of other hotel workers in Detroit and twenty Eighteen which is absolutely unacceptable when you're talking about the richest hotel company in the entire world\nSo let's talk about Mary ... you were saying if the richest\nHotel company in the entire world if you do a quick search on it you can see the the hotel that's expanding internationally they want to build and build dozens of new hotels and the ... the un and other nations um\nIs also very profitable hotel in it and and it's not just hotels I understand that the ... named bill to own share a ten I'm Still still how\nA vast or how does this particular um company a compared to the rest of the industry\nWell that's a that's one of the key reasons why we've reached the point that we have in this\nRight now Mary out is so big that they're actually worse double the value of health in international hotels\nThey had a recent merger would start would which credit ... megahertz held company and through that they inherited a at the old star would property many many chair union workers as the first time bargaining with us and many of those hotels and some merger I don't think that they were quite prepared for\nThe ah organization and worker power that you know your co workers have and they're having to really grapple with that the first time now\nAre these old separate contracts or they're single contract how does it work um I mean these are the places that the hotel workers aren't strike that we're talking about our debt it remind me out hotel but it's about two dozen right\nRight and the way that we negotiate contracts on you know you're very democratic a bottom up worker led union we don't have national contracts with any of our employers even national and international employer like health and hide or marry I so\nTime taking a on the merits there now the only exception would be if they were the Marriott Hotel who happened to have not had a contract with expired then they couldn't go out on strike but for the vast majority of the of these strikes it every single union Marriott Hotel out on strike right now\nSo um it's been several days now how how has this impacted the hotels I mean I'm thinking of\nThe hotels in law who and mowing the tourism is a huge industry the workers are obviously sacrificing a lot to be out on strike\nBut I imagine that it's hurting the hotel industry that's often just because there is a very large city where are the depend tremendously on um you know those conventions that bring in people industry representative Mary out hotels how how is Mary up being impacted by the strike\nA bank absolutely crippled by the strike in these cities we've had a many many businesses actually pull out their convention business because of the fact that people do not like ...\nA worker picket line they support these workers they understand what the issues are our affiliates and all of these cities have been working with the public and community groups and businesses for many months now to get ahead of the issue warning them that could escalate and what we've seen is that the actual operation the hotel has been ground to a standstill\nWe've had ... come to us and tell us on every single city strike lines that ... is unable to provide the basic services that they need to keep the\nHotel running that means that restaurants are either fully closed inside that hotel\nOr only offering partial service get have no housekeeping hotel services and most of the hotel rooms and she's are not being cleaned and in many of the hotels are there are not front desk workers\nThere is nobody carrier bags up there's certainly no room dining so that uh the experience of ... in a hotel that under strike it absolutely abysmal and because of that we encourage anybody traveling\nRight I'm really glad you brought that up a fair hotel dot org it's also an app you can get on your phone or it's a Web site as well a A R D ... hotel the hotels that a recommended on here are all union hotel\nThat's right they're all you could represent union hotels you know here's the biggest took over for union in North America Soviet this out but it's very convenient and I'll help you find a hotel where workers are treated Ferran ... condition but also where you can experience really cutting edge serve it\nLike you know your workers always provide and that's because in these hotels are the permanent workers are not on strike they're not in dispute there are there and ready to serve you\nIf you go to a hotel that under strike you will not be able to get service you will not have a good experience\nAnd of course that the whole point of a strike the whole point of the strike it used to use the bargaining power of people collectively to take on a very powerful institution that generally how all the power except when workers unite together to say\nOh we're not gonna take it I Want to ask you to um ... explain a little bit more of the the I I think very interesting slogan one job should be enough\nThis is what people are what are workers are putting on their times as they marched 'em why is that important to stress\nIt's hard to stress because over the past year really we've been working very closely and every single city would merit hotel workers to find out the most central issues worry that we needed a drop in bargaining and we found across the board in every single view that's on strike\nAnd more cities that can strike at any time is that too many full time workers that Mary I have to work multiple full time jobs just to pay the bills even though I'm area of the biggest hotel company in the world\nThey're not acting like the leader in the industry that they should be and wages and all of these studies have not kept up with the increasing costs of living workers in Detroit can afford to live in Detroit because of their Mariette pay that you can you didn't from\nTwo hour commute over the border every day because Mary octane San Diego is so far below where it needs to be for workers to make ends meet so what we're trying to really impressed upon the world is that in the public sector or star in the private sector\nA hotel workers are no longer willing to work multiple fulltime jobs just to make ends meet in the rock responsibility of the largest hotel company in the world to provide one job that's enough for workers to live with dignity and support their families on and that's what one drugs should be enough is all about\n... [noise] and it seems to be of course um something that could apply to workers everywhere in the so called gig economy now that seems to be so favored by\nYou know the technocrats a veteran of parts of our society um if Mary does give and um if you know because it kept pulled up forever\nI'm against thousands of workers funding from if it does give in what impact could that have across the entire hotel industry for all hotel workers even those who may not be union members or may not be working at a ... hotel\nWill give in and when they do it's going to have an incredible impact across the hospitality industry is was the largest multi city hotel worker strike guy in American history\nAnd what we're going to see is that uh like you know you're always does\nWe're going to change the working conditions and changed the pay and benefits\nFor all of our members who are striking but they're actually going to be able to raise the standards for non union workers to one of the reasons why unite Sherry such an incredible union is that when we organize higher standards in a city\nThose standards applied to the non union hotels as well so it's helping all workers whether they're organized or not I can tell you when we negotiate with smaller brand like health in in high it\nOr even both the cartels they point to marry and they say that Mary out if they do not pay the wage standards were asking for\nA new smaller chains can't be ... to ...\nIs the standard that Mary I it's kind of a ripple effect across the industry and we're going to finally be able to transform these jobs into living wage jobs for all workers union and not married and not\nLooking to ordinary people do I mean obviously if they have traveled plans that involve one of the affected Marriott Hotel they can choose de fer hotel Pierre Hotel dot org I'm and refused to cross the picket line but beyond that I understand on your website there's inability to sign a pledge\nThat tray recall the one job pledge if you go to our website we're asking everybody who traveled to sign the pledge to not cross\nThe picket line and the author respect the women hotel workers inside of their\nUh what this does it send a message to Mariette that tourists are going to end with workers and all those shows the workers that the public is with them we also in addition to that and people will never cross the picket line\nWhere encourage anybody who lives in a strikes that he might have had disturbances to their nightly routine because of the twenty four hour picket lines are running to address that directly to marry I ah this fight isn't going to be over until marry out give us the uh the contract that we deserve a need and the city\nSo we would encourage members of the public who wants to how to reach out to marry in each of these cities until the general manager at hotels under strict to settle immediately\nDid try 'em as you said the largest ah you know said in large a strike in the country or across all of these cities in us history that they offer um\nEncouragement for people in other industries that are union members I mean we have teachers that have been striking in cities around the country over the past couple of years um we have a we have a point here in the country today where union unfortunately union power is not as strong as it used to be\nBut you can only push workers so hard and I'm and I'm Wondering if you think that does seem the power of seven thousand seven ...", "show_name": "Alternative Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "11"}
