and that's because those corporation who are are in the military industry uh seem to have this control over our elected representatives\nSo oh speaking of polls there are constant polls being done off the electorate on you know it's ... after twenty sixteen people have gotten\nPolls the party could quite easily to lead from what is popular right so I understand that in the autopsy report uh the one year later it helps you report\nThere are some very basic things\nThat polls show would be popular among a a majority of Americans Medicare for all as one of them are and you know several other issues that Fifteen dollars an hour minimum wage is set up a can you give us a sense of what the whole issue got that you think the Democratic party we can listen to\nAnd create quite easily a winning\nPlatform well one is a free public college education so what the proposal put forward by mainstream Democrats right now or in the Senate is a a proposal to a subsidized\nCommunity colleges and then to we used college debt by um by of formulaic way of doing it and it and instead of just thanks republic college education that grab people's attention that's what people want I mean\nPeople

interesting issue President Trump\nPublished quite recently um slamming the Democrats a proposal for Medicare for all which is one indication that this is now with serious issues\nUm Democrats just eight eight to ten years ago and didn't want to touch the issue of Medicare fraud or single payer health care with a ten foot pole\nHappy come I'm of a distance on that on is that because the grassroots pressure\nOh absolutely it was three years ago that they didn't want to touch and the Democrats and now even Obama who didn't even get the single payer advocates to the table and he was a ... a negotiating the Affordable CARE Act\nNow he's in favor of Medicare for all and every all of the people who are being talked about as presidential candidates are saying Medicare for all and a lot of our congressional representative ah candidates are saying that uh care for all of this this is a new development\nAnd it caused a grass roots pressure yeah better believe that ...\nSo ... to ... do you see the leaders of the party taking a leadership on to the should we know that there was the formation of the Medicare pool called cooking brand new cookbook which a lot of progressive Democrats prominence Dr Paul and others are joined up but it's just something that the party as a whole you think it's ... it's\nA weight behind it would make sense to given that it seems like it is a winning issue but you can actually putting its weight behind\nThe Democratic party a leadership is not putting its weight behind any progress of\nA a a policy or or program so\nGoing to be our push or the craft food flesh and so what's been going on in people\nA ... here in New Mexico we formed a progressive caucus called the ... progressive caucus on the share of that\nRight now ah and and this and and now we've got to then vote in a\nProgressive a DNC members\nAnd once we can do that then we can continue to put pressure on the party and and with the candidates are coming up from the grassroots have candidates from all over the country of women of color or in in um\nA all over the country coming up in New Mexico uh we have a two women of color\nI'm a Native American um candidate for the U.S Congress step fallen and our um uh\nImmigrant candidate for U.S Congress also so she started a small and I'm so although there's a push from the bottom but that's the only way that uh the Democratic party has\nBeen changing that has changed because it's so tied up with money right now and there there are members of the sea and see who are actually felt tense for the party and the the the the\nUh continues to support a mainstream Democrat against progressive Democrats in\nUm in districts all over the country so I feel and ... and ... and ...\nAll of us you know ride up to the top as we are doing that ah it's gonna be really hard to rational way though a back up that corporate funding like for example a you know there was a movement within the\nB and C just than the acceptance of ...\nThen under the leadership of ... the ban was reverse\nSo now we're back to where we started and it's that thing while on money uh in\nThe dmc so those kind of things just kept it we just have to keep pushing a and no you're not the leadership is not letting go of it a monetary\nCorporate bay very easily so it's fine to and it's just that we're we're making some and in relative or just one\nDo you want to talk to you about voter turnout as we head into the mid term elections who's going to be critical issue we have\nA pretty concerted voter suppression effort led by Republican state or forties all over the country um and voters of color in particular who have been you know reliable democratic voters often unfortunately getting taken for granted but perhaps some of these\nNew candidates of color that are running in the midterms will I'm inspired voters of color to make it to the pose the question is um what are the get out the vote effort to light that the Democratic party has led and um are they going to be able to fire enough people to come out to the polls in just a few weeks\nWell um yeah I I'm looking at this list of a of of aggressive a\nCandidate who are are likely to take seats in the U.S Congress a a ... or ... or ... in New York ... Omar Minnesota rush that are we in Minnesota I ... in Massachusetts\nAnd um their agenda uh and the reason they're likely to rent it or they um are talking about military budget cuts so that we can apply\nHe um\nThis is the way that also a young people can be a attracted to the polls also um because young people have a more of a tendency to I'm just say they're not for capitalism and that that more\nI didn't become a gun shoot for the love of two\nNovel heroes like the great whisper don't mean are\nResponding dean Madeline right Ken and all the way you know gray ... well\nIn many many more ... characters stories greeted for your enjoyment mhm were grateful to have a home on W E s U Middletown\nListened to not make junction on Tuesdays at three thirty AM thank you for taking a ride and then ... junction trolley with all your journeys bring you back to be home\n[laughter] mhm\nOh you're from\nKPFK but at the radio this is rising up what's going on and on your host on on equal ... you can watch this program on free speech TV I'm listening to it up with a guy radio stations and affiliates nationwide on may twenty fifth Nineteen sixty three the New York times published\nOne of the times of few black writers chronicled his secret and inclusive meeting that are if you had asked James Baldwin a great writer and that's a U.S to convene attending the meeting were about a dozen prominent African American intellectuals an artist\nIncluding Lena Horne and Lorraine Hansberry all of whom gave RFK perhaps more than he bargained for\nWell Kennedy apparently walked out of the meeting angry and defensive it came to be a defining moment for his evolution on the issue of race in America\nTell a story of that meeting and everything it represented fifty years after our of gays assassination as Michael Eric Dyson you know a new book\nProfessor dice and a prominent public intellectual author of the New York times best seller tears we cannot stop in a university professor of sociology at Georgetown University and a contributing opinion writer for the New York times and contributing editor for the New Republic and ESPN the undefeated\nAnd he joins me to discuss his new book it's called what truth found like RFK James Baldwin and our unfinished conversation about race in America will come to the program a professor Dyson\n... so first what was it about this particular story that makes it so relevant today that made you want to try to get at what it was that happened it happened fifty more than fifty years ago\nIt was very fifty five years ago well [noise] I Want it to 'em digging into the story because I think it's offered to many parallels between what's going on a now\nAnd what was going on then I'm here was a prominent white politician the liberal one trying to engage black people about serious issues especially the urban centers of them of the north and how they were expressing black rage and how black people were uh in escalating fashion\nAnd increasingly attracted to figures like Malcolm X or the black\nTease that out and look at how black lives matter or is appealing to so many African American people especially younger people in light of the fact that there's been a spike in um police crimes against a unarmed black people and\nThat traditional civil rights organizations may not have been on the ground as are eagerly or as readily to address these issues and therefore you know a new group of leaders rose up\nIn the face of a opposition as oppression so you know back in sixty three fifty five years ago or these artists and activists got together with the ... of what the attorney general to discuss what was going on and I wanted to see\nIf we couldn't tease out you know Jesse Williams in our own day\nUm you know the ... the makers of get out in our own day a Black Panther and our all day and some of the people who have been critical a to F as artists to our own advance\nAnd see if a similar kind of reference a point of similar kinds of responses similar kind of meeting if not physically at least metaphorically\nUh takes place when you know politicians and activists an artist meat\n[noise] and finally I wanted to talk about how some of the same issues racial oppression a occurred white politicians who are not ready to hear the truth\nFrom black people I'm black artist meeting with a you know high ranking widely officials think about Kanye meeting with a Donald Trump and the like so I'm trying to tease that kind of stuff out and look at the parallels and see if we can learn something from them\nThat was interesting is just a the moment that you bring up in your book is in a moment between north and south or between the racist south and the anti Christ north it's between\nTwo of these issues I ended up with African American intellectual um envy elites within the African American Community Survey kind of a cultural\nContext today right absolutely right ah this is no died in the wool or reactionary racist right winger from you know the confederacy\nThis is a ... a northern seaboard white liberal who was a sense of bleak committed to the same issues interests and politics as those black people who met with him and yet there was an enormous clash of Bobby kennedy was interested in hearing from them but only so much in from such a one direction\nHe didn't want to hear the rage the pain the anger the trauma the bitterness that they were expressing end experiencing he didn't necessarily wants to grapple with some of the consternation that those black people felt any quite frankly I thought that they should be more grateful\nFor what he and his brother had done but black people who were gathered at that meeting including a besides Baldwin Harry Belafonte Lena Horne Lorraine Hansberry\nA in others Clarence Jones the great lawyer for\nUm Martin Luther king junior and James Baldwin\nTogether they understood that this was a serious and sustained issue that black people had to address that the white politicians at the here about black rage about black outrage about black frustration at the slow pace\nOf racial progress especially when the Kennedys especially Jack Kennedy John F. Kennedy the brother of Bobby kennedy was so a deliberate and track\nStalling on racial progress on the one hand he promised black people that he would do something about civil rights legislation though he was slow\nThe up to date on the other hand he's putting racist on the bench and he's promising southern governors that he won't use federal power to intervene\nDid up being the whipping boy a for their anger and rage and rightfully so because he didn't really understand until that meeting the depths of the\nThe black rage that was besieging these communities and to provide the brunt of the of that rage even as it was expressed among black people who were elites these weren't black people who are lumping ... with the exception of drones Smith\nOr in many ways the lynchpin and the core of that meeting as a a member of court Congress of racial equality\nAnd a freedom rider who was the most decorated along with John Lewis of all of those Freedom Riders for having endured so much physical assault\nAnd pain in his body so you know these were black athletes who are nevertheless full of rage\nThey were expressing the rage of masses of black people in America\nBobby kennedy as a white liberal got pissed got upset got angry at that and at the end of that meeting he actually recruit a sick the FBI on them he got the ... many of the people they are gathered and if they had not been started he started them\nAnd then eventually that led to the\nOf surveillance of Martin Luther king junior under his signature line 'em down\nAnd said you're right right wow is right that the white politician the liberal white politician the liberal white attorney general of the United states is the one who okayed the wiretapping of Martin Luther king junior\nOr supposedly to discover if there were a communist I'm president says that had infiltrated\nHis organization but really J Edgar Hoover had a program of domestic of surveillance\nThat's intended to intimidate and to discourage a black organizations among many others [noise] excuse me that had been separated and coins held pro a program later on so yeah then when he calmed down by", "show_name": "Alternative Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "18"}
