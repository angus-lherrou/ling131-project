J.\nAinge whether it'd be a worker protections in Mexico would be implement it and and how or if there would be real binding enforcement so these are you know nice are positive step their cognitive steps to address some of these very important labor issue there's real concern\nTo make sure that how are we going to make sure that\nSo those are the elements whether or not the use\nOf worker protection issues are actually enforceable whether you know whether they get\nThe same level of protection inside a new trade deal as commercial interest debt or whether it is going to be in the prior an actor sort of a U.S died world where there there are different on the side but actually\nIn practical terms really know labor cases under trade agreements have been effective and it's been very very hard to make sure that you get the same level of forcible\nDisciplines for labor and for the environment for other public interest protection as exist for something like\nPharmaceutical packaged wary of the country doesn't\nGuarantee that pharmaceutical found that people want than we can bring a trade dispute and enforce it through hair penalty so that's the real important difference and what we're really waiting to see that still ... it isn't finished and I think there are they're\nHopeful signs but those hopeful signs really require real enforceable a binding\nA measure of inside the trade agreements to make sure that they can actually have that cheap that are needed to make sure that the worst labor practices are eradicated and not go\nPatrick ... on this pharmaceutical Patton what impact Tom Ridge the deal have\nIf things don't change dramatically on um access to life saving medication and drugs um you know we hear stories of some American here in the United states are traveling to Canada just to be able to you know by their diabetes medication could this new deal have any impact on\nA prices and access to drugs access to a generic versions of drugs\nSo it imposes a ten year a patent monopoly on biologic stuck on a ...\nAnswer so the U.S has a twelve year patent it\nAnd our law Canada has eight year patents and Mexico as five you're putting on Mexico and Canada it would increase the monopoly panicked and jump would likely raise prices for drugs are up\nFor some drugs in all countries and so this'll be a real huge access to medicines issue it's important to remember that the TPP had eight\nYear biologic patent apple pay protection so this is more than a a occurred under the Trans Pacific partnership which are reimposed at that point in part because of these are central medicine can protect them and this is even more a more stringent\nMhm [noise] so um let's now talk about um\nThe environmental issues um there were there have been concerns um especially with the draft of the TPP about environmental issues and\nI'm a polluting industries a ... and of course given the way in which we've seen extreme a climate events over the last couple of years we know that this is an important issue also the deregulation of\nShort term pollution and polluting industry in the U.S has under the Trump has been extremely disturbing does it do you have any impact on um environmental issues\nSo again I think that the key issue here is the extent to which there are real forcible measures with cheap to make sure that the trading partners and the global commerce doesn't exacerbate climate change and other environmental problems at the border and\nA everywhere really and I I think it's important to recognize it still doesn't even recognize that climate change is an issue that the uh global trade and good to have contributed significantly to climate change in terms of truck traffic and and and vote for Nader boat traffic\nMetal protections are considerably weaker and none of that of eliminated in that bird or\nThere are very significant deregulatory measures that are cooked into the chat there is a brand new chapter called the good regulatory practice chapter which sets standards for what a good regulation is which really focuses on the cost to business\nBut diminishes in many respects the benefits of a regulation and also\nMandates that countries have a regular look back at how regulation\nWork with an eye towards a modifying or even repealing regulations and and uh\nAnd ... these are binding provisions this falls under the enforceable provisions if a country as a lax in allowing these kinda G regulatory measure to be put into place that uh countries can be challenged under a trade dispute and be\nUsed again Harris penalties if they don't open up their regulatory process to deregulation even has the language\nThat lets a interested parties which is really polluting industries a file to uh have regulations modified or repealed and it uses example such as if they're overly burdensome so here we know where the contacts in the shape of their argument is and that is\nRegulations have very little benefit they have a lot of cost and that we shouldn't be worried about whether or not we're protecting the environment or consumers from dangerous product or a dangerous food but instead should focus on what the cost of business says and that's exactly the wrong way to go\n... so I'm On that aspect of it this deal is a step backward teams like on ... um what do you make us to claim that this is not an after every book it's a brand new deal or is that just ...\nWell I think it's more a charming\nBut he's been on on pharmaceutical pans on food safety all crammed into the existing after tax there are some steps forward on and there's still\nHope on the labor measures where there could be some improvements I Am skeptical that this administration that's going to deliver real\nA real tangible enforceable benefits but there's still hope and people are working very hard to ensure that they're spread really reduced the outsourcing of us jobs to Mexico we've lost upwards of a million jobs in\nThousands upon thousands of doctors relocated to Mexico to take advantage of lower wages poor work conditions low environmental standards enrolling not backward is vitally important uh but whether that actually comes to pass\nWe don't know because the details are still not worked out and said that even the most ... people are really keeping a jaundiced eye on that and trying to make sure because if it isn't binding if there aren't real enforceable provisions were real cheap damn it is just window dressing and we need\nWe need to make sure that anything that does purport to protect the environment or for worse\nFor her as a real enforcement in the deal that is the scene of protection that the corporate interests get to make sure that when other countries run afoul of their commitments on on the environment on labor standards that they face the same sort of penalties that they would basically ran afoul of the kind of\nRules of the road for corporations that are that deal\nPatrick ... we are given the impression that it was real government representatives from all three countries creed representatives sat down together and hashed out\nBut as far as you can tell how much influence did corporate America did businesses and industries have on how this deal has played out I imagine if they had any access to eight for probably outside access compared to any access that ...\nThe the reason we we went for chicken is because a lot of people are as William ... rather than I did\nWe're leaving very sort of signature traces like\nUh the radiation from nuclear tests or plastic um doesn't nearby twenty fifty there'll be more plastic in the sea than fish and these are considered to be the signs all of you know human habitation of the planet and the destruction that we're reading\nAnd what we want to do is shift the discussion away from thinking about ... of just humans being responsible for this\nAnd shifting the discussion really to understand that there's not a human being human the causes of the catastrophic changes in states shift in uh in in ... it's all humans doing that it's capitalism\nAnd nothing exemplifies but it's more than chicken or ... now that uh twelve billion chickens alive but not for long uh every year humans go through about fifty billion chickens so you can imagine that one of the other signature traces of our times will be a chicken bones trillions of chicken bones\nAre now the the way that we tell the story of chicken is not that you know chicken has magically become the world's most popular but\nThe only reason that this bug gala gala domestic as is is as popular as it is because all of the seven cheap things seven strategies the capitalism has adopted an strategies that are sort of running out on the ... don't go on forever and what we're suggesting in this book is that\nActually the chicken mcnuggets is all Gary for um a very substantial ... states shift and the way that the planet works on a sign of a a really a very big crisis and capitalism\n... well you point out a very crucial concept in your book which I think it's a it's a good place to go next which is that this idea\nThat human beings talked for it from ... chair what's important to as an underlying assumption for the state of cheap things that we were above nature ... period\nAnd how did it how does that sort of under paying a lot of the economic system today\nWell I mean it's a a an idea that that emerges sort of a most fully at the end of a futile ism in Europe\nUm and by the time Columbus ah discovered is in ... uh the the new world um it's an idea is that ah there's already flourishing the ideas that\nAre on the one hand you have nature and then and it's very interesting that the on the other hand the opposite of nature on the capitalism in society right into the ah no other human civilization is quite ordered the world and the way the the capitalist\nSocieties have where on the one hand you have people are and people constant in very particular way is right I'm a ... it's it's the the the the cloth of society um isn't a dozen like often include women to start off with it certainly doesn't include\nOr indigenous people people of color or an under the European off the Arctic I'm certainly people of color and an often women are are\nOutside of society and in important ways are and that that dividing line of nature on the one hand which can be exploited in news and on the other hand society where\nThe economy functions not buying ... he's a line and wildlife ... in in the ... the beginning of ... what we call the loan fifteenth century\nSo it begins round about then at the the the ... the birthplace of capitalism this isn't to say that oh this is why do you have the exploited nature they have um but no society has really organized itself on the premise that your ... there was this sort of binary between\nHumans it's not the only one out of nature on the other than that signature move um of of of the molten capitalism but we live with today\nSo let's talk about this concept of keeping us as well I'm In a cheap things that are um we're all I can win today attracted to the idea of cheap because we can afford them we many of us are struggling and the global economy and so if we can cheaply provides\nIs cheap and its value in um less than it should be says how do you explain why did you choose to use this train the term to use the world economy um and use that as a ... chance to get a world economy\nWill the reasons it to to go to this idea where she is ready to points to\nBoth the the active requirements for capitalism to uh suppress the costs and the value of certain kinds of things are in order for capitalism to flourish\nUm but also two points to the finished you to to point to the fact that this stuff is running out you can't suppress the value of nature and of ... and the human being you know human lives under labor or without\nPeople organizing and striking back and without a long term cost in terms of the the natural world long term consequences in terms of uh the way that the Web of life um is able to sustain will not sustain us\nAnd so that's ... that's what the what word cheap is doing here um it's pointing out that\nA ... a ... that while this may appear like a bond and um it's it's certainly isn't but he's also pointing to the fact that the ... when when capitalism was born um there were crises in a range of things but there was a climate crisis in the mold and Europe a that was the black death as well um\nAnd these systemic crises\nAre pushed a ... it's actually over to the end the feudal ism and bust something new and that that new thing was capitalism\nAnd what we're doing is both drawing on on history to be able to points to how these crises\nAre made capitalism today but also how it is that the cause of capitalism strategy of cheapening things were heading to another crisis or ... something to be concerned about because it's not ... they're nothing inevitable about what follows capitalism is going to be grazing glorious I mean it could just be\nAnd here in the U.S of course starting next tend to um\nSo the seven cheap paintings or that you you look at it in your book nature money work care food energy and lived let's look at money just like the idea of separating humans from nature\nHad was a requirement for capitalism the idea of getting people to use money ask our in the world is not something that was considered very normal or acceptable right so um how did the money and use the money historically laying the groundwork for where we are today\nWell I mean it's again civilizations have been using things to exchange with for a while you know you feel you'll you'll ... economy that use calorie shells 'em and you know I mean in in prison you can use cigarettes but but\nWhat's what's important I think about the argument we're making it it's not just money\nIt's cheap money it's money but it's a made available through ... through the banks and governments guaranteeing that for the capitalist that money is available cheaply uh and uh so I mean let's let's go back to the chicken nugget\nAre the only reason that we can have cheap chicken um is because in the United states\nEvery KFC is considered a as a as a franchise a small business and you can get loans up to two million dollars from the federal government under written 'em and uh available at the confessional right\nThen of course the industry itself gets um you know cheap ah input or for that chicken to the tune of one of the ... billion dollars a year or so the cheap most of the money is important it's not merely the uh they're all long chains of exploitation that stretch from Peru in the silver mines and the\nUh the fifteenth century um or you know do all the way to uh to Europe it's not just\nThe lists need a and you know right now with goals were interest rates are is almost as low as they can possibly go\nOn with an economic stool and the way or the ... you know that there's no gas left in the times the um you know for homeless or to the old the ... of the interest rates the rates that is required to stimulate the economy again so that's why the cheating us up on the low interest rate or is important the capitalist but also why does that were\nOn the precipice because you know when interest rates to zero what else do the\nRight I mean so it went from a money being a concrete thing or the idea of currency being a concrete thing to also in a way it becoming an abstraction I mean government can print more money um to deal with things like inflation they can essentially create the money out of thin air\nAnd and then the ... you know they use the taxpayer money uh and decide to use it in a way that that doesn't necessarily benefit at all of these things cheap and money\nAnd also fosters on capitalism\nLet's talk about um labor labor so important today um we most ... you know many of us can have iPhones because of cheap Chinese labor or the U.S economy was built on slave labor um and and and you know became the basis for the U.S becoming a world superpower today\nAnd I think this is one of those concepts that easier to grasp for that capitalism requires cheap labor right", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Alternative Radio", "city": "Middletown", "day": "04"}
