production comparing Canada and minutes Twain are showing the full off of Venice played on oil production um I'm not sure if not something that you have a you know have a critique of but to me it also seems as though\nIt shouldn't be our men are measure up to six that's been economy shouldn't be linked to fossil fuel production should\nThe fossil fuel is its own history its own story\nIt's an economy Venezuela that's overwhelmingly dependent on one particular product recall that mono culture namely oil at the airport it rises and all with the oil industry and the money that that makes available to a country look to measure socialism\nBy what happened over recent years in one country would be about as a meaningful as to measure how capitalism\nIs doing by seeking a poor country in Latin America or even poorer one in Africa for another poor one in some other part of the world this is childish\nIf you're going to allow new way to assist them you're gonna have to look at the parts of it that are not doing well by all means the parts of it that are doing well and you actually do the same for the system you're comparing in order to make anything that passes a minimum muster as honest\nEvaluation the council of economic uh\nThe president on what's happening to the American economy so that the president can make appropriate suggestions to Congress on what to do to avoid the next capitalist down to\nWriting reports on subjects of capitalism versus socialism is something they would never signed up to do and which they have almost never done in their history that I'm aware up so this is a departure nicely released a couple of weeks before the election in hopes of\nPandering to the same political base that trying to get out of all\nIt was done slap dash by incompetent people in our shot a crude way it's a shame and embarrassment\nA for a country to produce this kind of junk [noise] it it does take you back to the worst times of the Cold War and it's been nice\nContaminants in terms of anything\nAre proposing to be an argument with evidence and I won't even go into the other things there's a vast literature on comparing economic system\nIs a course in the university at both undergraduate and graduate levels anyone who does that I've I've done it can give the government a reading list with many of the books and articles that are mostly use\nNone of which appear in the bibliography of this report leading one to believe since it's easy just to list them that they weren't even able to come up with a flaws herbal list of books and articles to justify\nWhat looks like a couple of folks on too much coffee a bang out over a weekend only is a shoddy piece or\nRichard do you I think it really hit the nail on the head about the issue of foul the pandering to the Republican base because the big part um\nAnd the report the weekly cost of owning an operating a pickup truck by country showing somehow that the U.S is superior to Denmark Norway Sweden and Finland because it's so much easier to own a pickup truck in the U.S I I thought this was my most favorite laughable part of the report\nThat's just it just shows you since there are literally sixteen metrics that exist in the literature to compare economic systems that they could have huge they found a metric I'd never seen used before\nThat's because they had to search long and hard to find the table that makes the United states look\nIn some way better than other countries because of that so hard to do and let me\nUnderscore this by talking about one more aspect of the record it's top heavy an overloaded with references\nTo medicine and medical insurance and health insurance and it's clear as many have pointed out that part of this document is to try to under caught the interests of large numbers of Americans in health care and their disappointment in the Trump a GOP government's attitude towards it\nThey want you to believe that having a single payer health system\nIt kind of governmental health insurance will cost you more money I find this again mind boggling lead disarm is here is the basic facts they never face up to and are afraid to deal with if you compare the United states\nNot only with other rich industrialized countries but with virtually most countries in the world\nHere other two facts you need to know why the overwhelming majority of them have a national insurance guarantee single\nIn the way of providing public universal subsidized health care and the second fact is that the amount of money per\nSpent on health care in the United states is much higher than it is in every one of those other countries in other words our fragmented capitalist\nHealth care system makes it more costly for us then the other health care systems make for their people and when you ask you that\nThat the outcomes that health outcomes in other countries are better for example many of these countries that I Am a nationalized health system live longer than we do now in the hospital ... days per year than American\nWho hadn't seen any of those charts compared to those charges to an\nExtent this crazy number that somebody pulled out of there at that if we had a single payer system it would cost every American seven thousand dollars\nJust isn't just an argument this is so close to the political propaganda that it really doesn't deserve the paper it's printed on dishes BS of the worst political variety\nNow Richard out Bernie Sanders and other proponents of Medicare fraud but very happy that the report inadvertently made it for Medicare for a long\nWinded singled out to the wait time for ... years seeking health care I'll compared to the U.S wait times uh to wait times for seniors and other nations on showed how the wait times for seniors in the U.S with so much lower than say\nAustralia New Zealand fans that are where there are socialized health care system out of course the news here in the U.S Medicare which is a socialist a program essentially but mixed\nOh I think I'll go back to my mentor or from before\nThis looks like something cooked up by tired\nOr people who had drunk too much coffee and I stayed up too late\nOver the last weekend when they had to end this thing again\nTo whoever barriers were and so they couldn't take the time or they care\nTo avoid neither the shoddy or incompetent argument Haitian nor the choice of examples that end up making a better case against them that they made a case for what they were trying to say\nHere's the impression I think it would lead\nPeople who know anything about socialism will laugh at this report people who don't know anything at all or against it may feel somewhat are encouraged that the government is validating their point of view\nBut any honest human being and I assume most Americans are that takes a look at this will walk away and shake their hand\nNot so much at the substance of this report cause very much substance in it\nBut at a shoddy in competed in rocks sided a world that is a evidence here makes you frightened if that's the kind of research that goes into their foreign trade war\nOr there was a girl from a nuclear treaties if this is a kind of reasoning that John Bolton and people like that are using that in this country is an even worse shape than most of us already find it to be a\nTo the uh op ed that Trump supposedly wrote in USA Today a few weeks ago about ... ... ... the dangers that it poses um is now part of it sounds like this\nI'm ... and um and others um publishing news articles now pointing out the radical nature of the Medicare for all system also sort of suggesting that those who are proponents of Medicare fraud don't know the endgame don't know the details ... again leading American down a path to\nFrom KPFK Pacifica Radio this is rising up with ... you can watch the program on free speech TV and listen to it up with typical radio stations and affiliates nationwide\nA new report called running on hate found widespread Islamophobia in the election campaigns of two thousand Eighteen\nThe report which was commissioned by the group Muslim advocates found about eating campaign run by almost exclusively Republican candidates that have engaged in anti Muslim rhetoric and messaging the report's authors say it's ... attempt to make sense of this wave of anti Muslim conspiracy theorists\nBy documenting their campaigns their messages there when I'm there last us\nIt also dive deep and original public opinion research to understand the narrow sliver of the electorate these candidates hope to influence\nMuch of the Islamic phobic rhetoric echoes president Donald Trump language\nThe quite the reports disturbing findings there is a record number of Muslim Americans running for office this year\nMy guest is Scott and he is a public advocacy director of Muslim advocates welcome to the program Scott knowledge or should be with you so uh what was it that the report set out to do um I it seems as though it's sort of part um\nResearch into what these campaigns are and part opinion survey\nYeah that's exactly right and you know to be clear with you you know you know that you know your your programs on a documenting civil rights struggle to American Muslims in many communities and and you know very well and your listeners know very well that aren't you most women tax a tax on ma discrimination has been\nAdvocate a have a really well done a good job documenting the connection between anti Muslim rhetoric and the discrimination and hate crimes and mosque attacks that we're seeing and you know I work at Muslim advocates where national civil rights were Muslims and\nYou know as you can imagine we never take for granted or assume that our days are going to be easy because these attacks are happening on a weekly or monthly basis and we have to talk\nUm but we knew that responding isn't enough in this climate we can't just wait for more bad things to happen so that we can respond to them we we want it to prevent these things happening to begin with\nAnd the place where that starts the political rhetoric it starts with looking at the rhetoric that Donald Trump used in the campaign but also all of the leading candidate that we've found didn't Trump who have been trying to run on his messaging his anti Muslim\nMessaging anti anti Middle Eastern anti Arab messaging and a ... and so we really want it to document it\nUh analyze it so we understood exactly what was being that we want to take very seriously but we also\nWant it to confirm suspicion that we had which is that we knew\nThat this rhetoric spread nationwide we eat we see a day to day and we also need to do that a lot of these candidates were losing like we could we could we look at a lot of a candidate even credible one they seem to be losing\nAnd we felt like it was very important that the conventional wisdom that we hear day in and day out which is that it's popular\nWhich is an astonishing to make that we make a is wrong\nAnd so we set out to document that so we were very thorough the fifty one page report I didn't we didn't plan to write a fifty one page report but we we ... it could have been a hundred pages that if there were so many there were so many lessons that we learned or just by mapping these candidates analyzing their rhetoric and then go into voters and doing opinion\nCampaigns that are happening right now did you look at campaign that are are being run by candidates all of whom are basically going to face their tests on November So vague that depicted the mid term election\n[noise] oh well we all we included the twenty Seventeen ... elections as well there was a few special election in twenty Seventeen\nOr ... and then state wide elections in New Jersey and Virginia uh she'll be included then we really want it to ... every candidate I don't care if it was a special election between now and then or the twenty Eighteen so it includes all of them\nAre the the vast majority of them have lost so then that's the good news we saw this and the twenty Seventeen campaigns for sure but also in the special election in even GOP primaries in twenty eight teams that\nAre the vast majority of these candidates will lose and there was another conventional wisdom out there uh or assumption that to me which is that a lot of the candidates are sort of\nOn the fringe or that these candidates are ... are but the ... the report ... made very very clear that that's not the case\nThere is a very credible mainstream potentially winning candidates who are using anti Muslim conspiracy to ... vote 'em and most of them are losing too\nSo the candidate that you found engaging in this or what you call ... anti Muslim conspiracy theorists theory I think a range from ... to national races is that correct\nYeah that's correct lease on anti Muslim candidates and every region of the country or in every in every type of jurisdiction be an urban or rural be at progressive or conservative\nAnd we found them at every level of office so we found these are in school boards and planning border local planning board races we found him in mayoral races city council races but we also see them at the congressional and gubernatorial level as well so\nI mean there's some [noise] you know they're not just sort of cleanly demonizing Muslims they're doing that through\nFalse narrative well they're doing both and it it's really important to understand how ah the demonizing Muslims in the villa find Muslims that we need to be just threw it worked for example\nA which we've seen some instance that uh works together to tell a story that's very very troubling ah there are some anti Muslim or think tanks in organizations and some elected officials who for years have been\nSort of reading a ... a very grand conspiracy theory about Muslims in America\nOr the theory goes\nThat Islam is not a religion at all in fact the violent political ideology and that there is a a conspiracy between Muslims and non Muslim allies to take over the United states government\nAnd to replace the constitution with ... and then they'll do this through non violent or violent you\nThat the conspiracy and when you took when you take a look at all of the rhetoric that being said and you can look at Donald Trump's rhetoric he he he very clearly sided um he really told that story through his rhetoric um but that's also was the other candidates are doing to\nSo a lot of these candidates and whether they know whether or not are are perpetuating this very particular conspiracy theory and so we see this in some ways you know one of the most anti Muslim campaigns we've seen a this election is is being run into fifty a congressional district of California there's a candidate name Duncan Hunter\nAnd he's facing off against an opponent who's of a Palestinian\nA district or a non Muslim he's a he's a Protestant and he he's running ads and claiming\nUm he's saying that Muslims are infiltrating the schools in San Diego which is where the congressional district is based uh he's uh he's saying that uh is on the in the ... not a religion\nAnd this\nType of dory in one way or another is being told all over the country and particular\nRace by the way is a Duncan Hunter against a mark ... pot in a jar a Palestinian Christian also so Scott how does so I'm the anti Muslim rhetoric is I'm\nA ... you know if it's when there is an actual Muslim candidate a two rival um it takes on a and even a greater urgency or or greater threatening aspect to it which is interesting because as I mentioned there are a\nThere's a record number of Muslim candidates running for office this year\nWhich unfortunately sounds like the Islamophobia um used as a part of their conspiracy theories look they're taking over\nCorrect yeah the you know the ... the ah I Do doctors by you drop you off or you ... it was a governor candidate in Michigan or American Muslim\nOr a doctor I Believe that came in second or third place in the in the Democratic primary that really became a second place and he has been a sort of the public enemy number one\nUh for many of these candidates are saying he's a Muslim Brotherhood conspiracy theorists and even when even in races where there isn't an opposition for example are there that we will have the first two Muslim congresswoman women coming up in the upcoming uh\nA congressional term or out of Minnesota and Michigan and those those those are the candidates are running unopposed and in their actions there are a right wing anti Muslim activist and organizations", "show_name": "Alternative Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "25"}
