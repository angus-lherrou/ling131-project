Wang is working to what I wondered what she's going to find [noise]\nShe opens the door to her mind [noise] inside tens of thousands of one recurring around in different books [noise]\nShe pays into one then another and slugging it dawned on him [noise] what she's seen could help children with disabilities anything condition known to us [noise] aging [noise]\nDiseases related to aging kill a hundred thousand people every day\nBut a growing number of scientists say it doesn't have to be this way [noise]\nI was in the past few years were such that carried on multiple experiments challenging what we thought we knew about my extent [noise] billions of dollars are being spent all over the world in ethics to extend on line\nAnd this week we bring you some of the world's leading was sent it to tell me what they found [noise]\nYou'll find that will make wind discovered with her one\nAnd one scientist was dusty aging process in a town\nAs we answer a question that own if you had probably ... [noise]\nHow long can we live [noise]\nPark one\nIt's all in this case\n[noise]\nHaving a tremendous development in life expectancy we have doubled our lifetime in a very short period and we should really be happy to it we were born right on the spot in history\nIf you had enough of tracing ill people he now runs the Danish aging with that sentiment while he's trying to tell people getting out of the first place [noise]\n\nWe all know what age ... from the outside what is actually due to all parties\nWell it's accumulation of damage from the molecular level that don't spread to the\nCells and tissues and organs and through the whole organism makes kind of all the hits that we get all the time on the molecules and then when we can't keep up with the repairing than a staging\nStops and when does it all began when do we start to decline that is in the mid thirties this thought that time says she sat in the ... yeah now do you stop Oh thanks for the good news [laughter]\nSorry and that more bad news once we don't want to go downhill we go downhill fast\nIt's twice as dangerous being forced you to compare to thirty five then again it's twice as dangerous as being forty nine compared to forty two and so on so your risk of death is increasing eleven twelve percent every year and\nThen their mortality risk levels off around one hundred one hundred and five where the yearly risk of dying is about fifty sixty percent so if you really optimistic tired then you could say that they've never get any worse than fifty fifty\nAnd when you're thinking about these on that the lump tactic and team when you age as your molecules tissues and organs get tired and damaged his is set to go to a whole range of diseases\nDisease cancer raw images to Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's disease a lung bases all the ...\nStudy show actually they are like additional Oregon on to us\nBecause they can't even friends how while away they have and all of a show how wow we're we found to different medications\nAnd sometimes they make us sick but on the other hand they also play back in Puerto Rico to keep us\nYou do an experiment and what she needed was an animal with a short life span she tries to particular kind of one\nThey only live about two to three awake so that makes them wander from all of a tough subject yeah\n[noise]\nShe wanted to find out what would happen if you go to the ones micro biology wouldn't live longer\n[noise]\nShe chose one of the kinds of bacteria that lives inside one gun tweaked it seems to make different varieties and then sent them to get ... groups of one [noise]\n\nA few weeks later she went to see the one [noise] expecting them all to be dead now they've reached the end of the lifespan [noise]\nI was so excited because when we find him feel cases animal I'm not that they're still alive when we checked them I Would jumping up down because he just totally unexpected and how long does some of the blissful\nAbout fifty percent longer fifty percent yeah\nSuch extraordinary so you had most of the ones who are living for three weeks and there were some that lift fool four and a half four and half yes I'm with that much more than you would have expected\nYes I think scientists sometimes\nWe do research it's kinda like Campbell and [laughter] we have some crazy idea than you know we we did find a way to protect them but you never know whether your idea is ride around and those moments when you find that rates out that the\nMoment and so they went on to test other things would have different ... give worms will Tony a longer life with a better quality of life and that final days\nSo they are way way way can look at how well they have when they're older they called worm when that getting older\n[noise] she could have video of some of these elderly one [noise] and she's right you can tell their own wild younger one's regular energetically around and the older ones move loaning the skin hiking as they go [noise]\nI don't think they showed ... that it can tell that body stretch it it's not an ad out like end as they used to be\nThe ones with the new like right by a little tiny Rickles around will quickly and their old age\nThat they would like to go to these two [noise] main one is now carrying out test a month to the weather changing them like ... extend satellites and so as a chump that one day don't just might be able to prescribe pills which do the same for us [noise]\nSome of my colleagues say okay you know I think people can they've ... they had ... a profound Ali I think why jak for me is already can number [noise] so how long can relive full [noise]\nTo be cut about ... to ... get us to a hundred and Seventy five [noise]\nAnd how it different micro biome could get a fifty percent more time on us\nTo face the conventions or a bounce addressing the symptoms of aging not to ... [noise] well then if we can go straight to the tools [noise]\nTime for a final expert witness [noise]\nHeart for\nFighting you're so why do\n\nYou wouldn't believe the number of people I have had got in touch with me\nThat's known hiring is professor of molecular genetics at the University of Exeter in the u._k. scientist whose work on aging is because a lot of people like scientists before now it's a little bit of a holy grail actually and\nI Want to begin with the building blocks of our bodies of cells\nSo basically the organs might have different type of tissue your tissues are made of different types of cells now cells get told that some cells and say you live or your kidneys whatever will be dividing to repay some cells to kind of dynamic I didn't want to know the more time to sell divides the great to its chance of becoming what we would call ... and\nAnd this comes from the ... and what kind of scary which means to grow old and that's exactly what happened to these sounds they've grown old income to the end of that life cycle but instead of dying they hung around I'm putting in a destructive ...\nThey can actually communicate with the cells ran them so it's in essence Sal will basically throw out to a bunch of chemicals which affect all of the cells rhyme them ... it's almost like a self sang a I'm an old south and you guys have been around here about ... ton of I have so you must be able to say you should be thinking about ... as well\nWow so it's almost sort of contaminating them with with age\nExactly so it's basically sending a message which can drive the cells around it didn't just messing\nThat'd be grow older more and more of a self becomes innocent until up ... is overwhelmed\n\nWith any did they make the cells around them aged ... to these innocent sounds still functioning as they should which is thought to be one of the things that lead to diseases like dementia ... the type two diabetes\n\nTo protect the highways wants to know whether she could get the stone just don't behaving like old style the hate more like young one\nHappened that was I had a new is that true in my lap and she was finding a faith and we have some old south and I had some chemicals\nAnd she suggested ... percent ship it some of these chemicals on these skin cells and see what happened\nAbout a week after she came in with the dishes cells and showed it to me and when you ...\nWe have a particular die that we can put on a fellow coaches the tens blue if that's in essence so when I was expecting to see is that the cells would be so blue and still looking old and she went they went blue and they had gone back to looking more like young south\nTo professor Harry said oh no you've got the wrong south these young sales go through it again and that and she did and she did it again yeah and and and then we'll have the same thing again she ... about me and I still I wasn't convinced because we were not truly ... scientists and yeah they were taught to\nBasically throw rocks that you're right there and if it failed at that it's probably ...\nHow many broke city search uh probably about nine [laughter] she did it about nine times and finally I kind of look to to ask them to actually maybe you're onto something here\nShe done something that no one thought possible\nShe'd effectively ... to ... thousand ten minutes young south\nAnd they did wind blowing Harry just now getting phone calls from scientists and invested from all over the well at the last experiment this reverse aging and humans cells they think a discovery could be this secret to a much longer life\nWhen it comes to a lifespan think law in a hurry to be the most ambitious of all our expert witnesses that\nHave human beings I think we have enough trouble maximum lifespan so actually what I Want this research to end up in either\nNew generation of empty degenerative drugs were still the way off yet but in the future for things like dementia and cardiovascular disease\nWhat I'm hoping is that this will allow us one treatment which will address several of those that want to say that people would have died at age will then go on to live than not to look at life\nStyle how long can we live we know the answer is at least a hundred and twenty two someone's already gal that song from what we've cut that they got lucky to ride with the discovery of an expert witnesses alone one day we may be able to ...\nHow many years could all of this title when if we go by Tahir bell mixed prediction if you're a millennia like me born in Nineteen eighty one you should be able to get to a hundred and Seventy five by the time we get ten and Twenty one sixteen who knows what else would be posted on [noise]\n\nThe inquiry was presented by me had an American but she's my best to take a sentence and if you want to listen to more episodes do down at a ... there were hundreds of other additions that such the b._b._c. the inquiry\nDistribution of the b._b._c.
