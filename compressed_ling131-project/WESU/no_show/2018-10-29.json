N. dot org\nNow before we went before we came in here today are are the the hosts who came on before\nThat they said be extra Jewish today\nYeah and at first I actually I was a little bit taken aback I was like yeah I was like well I was like well yeah today and finally there for\nFor the jurors yeah but I feel like we just we did the extra Jewish thing just than reading the yeah\nI feel like we do this claim and the people were like lip and here's this you're going to get the job so you know it's not going to be this this and that that is strictly ... yeah [laughter] uh and that's a good thing you know specificity is dumping I look for their ears I\nI just got paid two things before we kinda really dive into the meat of today's program\nDiverse than ah than I Am a little uncomfortable right now physically I Can't yeah it's hot it's really I Can't get the microphone to like stay high enough to my hunched over yeah and you know for our listeners\nWe rotate out and as you probably have guessed it's not a bunch of people in different studios we rotate out of names today in Studio and it kind of smells funny in here and do you think it was\nThem I don't know I don't know one thing I'll say or is that one of the host before us are used\nTo have very long hair [laughter] and say that the anything to do it might have something to do and I came in today and you never had a child and he he has a very short hair now which was very striking just see it looks good and I think that it may have I think that the shop may have released\nSome stout over matter something that I learned early years or you might remember after the belly button issue similar variety yeah and once you dig a little bit the whole new level during as I had a shrimp ... just released a crack okay All right well we've got a lot to talk about today um\nBut er er phone just came off the hook and that's a funny thing\nOr the phone and coming off the hook and we'd like to say because you know we haven't really gotten that many callers that season yet you can call us a on that phone there's often a six zero six eight five seven seven zero zero\nYeah we're talking a lot of things if you want to join the conversation whether you're in your car your at your home or at work or you're\nYeah no without a doubt but but you know the vegetarian community can do a better job in a PR department yeah in kind of ... idea [laughter] instead it's like a you know the thing instead of being like look you're a part of an ecosystem right we we consume just like other animals consumer all part of this big community hasn't it\nWell it's not negative reinforcement of negative like rub off All right so but no I'm saying is we need positive reinforcement vegetarians need to\nDo it was more now you're going on [laughter] they're ... they're like I mean today but this is the big amount of I'm now a vegetarian now you're yeah so I knew I had ...\nVeggie omelet you did tell me that yeah I thought you know you got and I always I said I'm having a veggie omelet and I was hoping you'd ask\nI don't know because I sometimes get the veggie I'm a because it seems like an addiction with pizza too and I I never figured this out it's like you can either get like a meat lava has all the meat and crap on it or you can get the veggie which the vegetables I Want both on the sometimes I'll get the veggie and I'll be like a vegetarian pizza through some\nBank [laughter]\nBecause it because I\nLike just because I Want to eat meat doesn't mean I Want to be like truly disgusting no of course I'm not sure what happened is British just knocked the phone offered attacking the phone I was just a beard [laughter]\nIf you called and during that time sorry ah ah\nWhat do you do you have thoughts people again eight six zero six five it's not going to have him come home and they didn't call I Know but but often in in seasons past we've had people call on\nYeah we have I don't really understand like the gives I think ... where one hour later than we were last yeah but anyway a positive reinforcement they always show these videos of cows getting slaughtered and and baby she's getting stabbed in the face I'm saying we need to show videos of like\nHappy she of yeah of like well here's what I was doing the other day I\nWas in South Carolina or North Carolina or a week ago we had was named habits fall break and I was down there to hiking and camping and it was really lovely but on the highway there was a billboard from pita\n[laughter] it was a picture of a of a chicken yeah and chicken is also the food that like\nIt's like hard to to be like you know to look like a you know poor check and you know why because they look so stupid [laughter] said that the picture of the chicken and it says something like this is Rita she shouldn't have to die every year already just got thing you have it\nHas like rather than going out of the time like munching on ... which I don't know or fried chicken ...\nAnd I was like oh [laughter] it's a bad angle because you know everyone ... cows if they're like this is Betsy ever and be like oh\nNo no they don't really about using like your ... your dirty it sounds like somebody's been taught masturbating or something and like doing I've been very weird while they're doing that which is fine you know but yeah and it was like oh what a dirty the gusting have it you know or smoking or something [laughter]\nIt was very striking and I ... I ... and most people drive by that and they chuckle\nYeah if I was smoking a cigarette and someone came up to me and said do dirty disgusting I'd be like mind your own business yeah but if someone came up to me and said hey I really am worried about your health so here's an idea that I Would be affected\nSo ah smoking how has it been curbed in like the United\nStates a lot of it is just education right than the right side for you this kind of positive reinforcement then the other thing is taxes or I mean we come from New York and when they don't like something the taxes they tax it when it's bad for you know a soda it's big soda I'd have to dream big that or they weren't even tax they were just banned\nBut then they were taxed more heavily because the ban ended up people didn't like the bad but you know your tax bigger at very highly it was and what ... what do you think about that you know I think it's effective like I got to be an effective way of curbing meat consumption just making it more expensive can at least I don't like\nThere's yeah higher tax yeah yeah I Know it works\nOr and I think the the but here's the central issue with that when they raise the taxes on cigarettes people who are already hooked don't quit they just take a bigger monetary laws but people who aren't hooked are much less likely to get into it\nSo you're saying is the whole world is we're all hooked and we're all hooked me yeah but you know what I I think unlike I think needed not addictive\nI figured I Know we are it's one of the thing that but it's an American thing\nThat I have the lifestyle that you desire right right but want to eat meat it's their favorites it's their favorite ...\nMy favorite thing I Love meat I eat meat every day but what I'm saying is like if I had to pay more for that luxury knowing in combination with education like educational initiatives ... thing like here's why it's important to reduce meat consumption may be right supposed to get rid of it and it was tax more\nI think that would incentivize made to not eat meat I personally have this little problem with the psychological thing if I don't eat meat with a meal like a dinner meal I can do is lunch or breakfast but did with dinner it's really um\nI I don't feel full like my head doesn't go well you know fall\nEven if I Am really fallen I've had all my nutrients and so I Will eat and eat meat and then I get really really to fall and I ended up having to live rounds\nWhenever I've had a vegetarian dinner it's kind of put me into a food company yeah you know made up for probably about what you're saying about paying more for meat you get a Caesar salad add chicken four dollars I yeah you know what I mean\nWhat what what are you saying that I'm saying you already have to pay more for me\nBecause it's either [laughter] it doesn't necessarily come with me although I Will say you know what I view budding restaurant or something if you're studying Caesar salads without some sort of protein in it yeah\nOn you know and you know you go to you go to a nicer place in the gut artful with it by having like a big piece of lettuce and like a big piece of cheese\nYeah ours is like everything chopped whatever however you do it offered protein that comes with it and here's a you know where you can do you have like a like a six dollar is his daughter ten dollars is out of either twelve dollars Jesus out whatever it is\nAnd then you can say if you gotta wait out the chicken that will be eight bucks you know the other way around right discounts but right you can't do winning yeah exactly you're winning yeah I mean it's so that's an interesting thing is I mean the opposite of tax and I'm not sure we maybe we give tax breaks to people [laughter] it was made\n[laughter] we get subsidized them\nYeah oh well this is interesting stuff about what else we got\nAll right so I when I was in line to get my my vegetarian omelet today\nI was a I was I was standing in the in the cafe it was kind of empty\nAnd I was waiting for my food for my number to be called a big big space right there's like five people in the room but everyone spread out\nAnd I you know I asked my peripheral vision I feel these two guys come up and stand next to me and in my head I'm like oh you must know them and they're standing next to me to surprise me and start a conversation look over I don't know the guys and they are the two of them are standing next to me like we are trio\nAnd I realized that\nThey weren't trying to mess with me they weren't even really aware of me but that's the problem with text based on the Internet driven you know they were about my size but it's like spatial awareness has just yeah clients so heavily people or people have no idea what's going on around them they came up and sit next to me and it made me uncomfortable and then one of them there\nAnd and uh I was getting almost like a month ago and this guy in line was a standing with basically chin on that you know like ... a lot I Do like how much I don't really care for the ...\nBut this guy that basically had a chance on my shoulder ordering omelet and it was uh\nThat I don't get it like I don't want to be close to you but I I can only imagine that the feeling is mutual like I'd never walking up to them like you know what that that random stranger looks like a person has been very close to and I'm like no I'd like to hear motorcycle doesn't say okay the segue into something you can see it at home listeners [noise]\nUm but Britain like saving their hasn't cut his finger nails and\nLike a God Knows how long like three weeks and I there's like three things I got to say about this All right the first is just\nVisually okay you're also looking at the shorter hand this is the longer yeah show me the longer to bring it out here yeah\nSo here's the thing a lot a lot of people who have dirty your finger on it in terms of long fingernails like just aren't taking care of them are and so there are also dirty yeah yours are strikingly clean and it's more off putting that if they were really dirty and long such roots\nBetter you know I mean if I'm not taking care of them they clean themselves\nUh-huh yeah yeah anyway they're pointed it they they look very manicured and it's like that's fine if you just want to have long fingernails and then there's this weird like a [laughter] thing like we're we're Britain in the hands of very hairy\nAnd any of these fingers and then these fingernails that are very clean and long off putting but let me tell you that you are because it has to do with both finger fingernail and people are getting too close to your standing too close to you\nYou ever ah cleave to meet before no you mean like brought a cleaver up over your head and shopped at their own I guess you're a vegetarian now see I don't have the opportunity but er I've never leave me before either\nOkay something about this to break that we just tired you want to do it I Know it just brought into my mind are going to be like what would it be like to cleave like at a lamb\nShrank I've also never shops would and I feel like it's a similar\nJob in order to get things on ... you never know when you're going to need a job but yeah I mean rarely probably but I'm just not for now [laughter] yeah I mean I don't think anyone really has\nYep you're on what you also teaches a work ethic that's important you know you you got to stay focused its physical\nI really enjoy jogging would actually\nI was a I was acting in a student film ones now and the director made me I'm taking an axe to a tree I didn't know what I was doing he was playing a lumberjack and he wanted to get a shot at me chopping down a tree\nKind of go I'd probably killed the tree well yeah I mean I I think that\nEven if you get it in one spot in the bar comes off I think he killed the whole tri\nNot know that you know yeah trees live out in the wild I used to turn the good things I or a fall where are we just got back from our fall breaking\nUm when I went camping you like camping\nYeah I didn't want something like that\nYeah it's a lot of fun I'm Sorry I was down in North Carolina or with my girlfriend or hiking into the these woods in kind of a cold afternoon but so bright it's in North Carolina so it's probably fifty degrees\nC motley ... or one of those fires started logs that you just have to light and then the fire starts we're planning on putting on what on how that [noise]\nSo we hike in front of the three miles to the campsite get cancer and count picking up a breed like getting getting a little bit windy ...\nSo we can put up a bear bad because there's a lot of bears in that region in the end the bag catches the bear well no this is a common common misconception about the bear back\nThe bag becomes to their God at the bears the that bad guy a freight got it no it's actually said that your food doesn't get eaten right very um every time we try and like the fire by this point it's really blowing like the wind is going and we can't even start to sell starting fire lock\nDown there and you know China president it's about seven pm to because that's when this\nStart worrying a little bit like it's really windy it's really cool so where do we can do for like Thirteen hours until we can walk out of here uh enjoy Google or like you know my my cell phone service\nLike Google what the weather is supposed to be like this mountain which is by the way you know something you should do before you go camping generally like high wind advisory [laughter] get out [laughter]\nUm when the next Seventy miles per hour and it was a horrifying night but what I can right now with confidence it that just taking a little bit of bark off of a tree is not going to kill it\n'cause trees were flying all over the place we got\nIt got it and they were alive yeah ... yeah well anyway that's my only experience chopping wood and that's probably the closest I've ever gotten the cleaning meat also yeah I I was I was a was your time on break\nIt was good I had a couple of mishaps to be honest yeah to be honest and a couple of mishaps or they may want well there are connected the mishaps connected\nOkay well give me half of okay so uh I'm going ah I'm Out on the town with a friend and we've heard of a party a gathering going on at someone's this was back in New York City by the way a gathering at someone's house and we were not directly invited but we're like yeah we know the guy it'll be fun it'd be something to do\nActually we didn't say it'd be fun we weren't sure it was going to be fun we had doubts about how much will be fun we thought were not doing anything we're bored out of our minds let's go do let's go let's go to the place so we we tax the guy and he ... he bites us over\nAnd we're not we're feeling kinda weird about it and then a friend of ours who doesn't know the guy says can I come and we stay on the one that I feel like we just ask to be invited our you know I don't want to be home by asking someone else so here's a here's what I said I said why don't you\nI told my other friend why don't you meet us by the party\nAnd will go up and once we get comfortable and the first couple of minutes we'll casually asked if you can come\nYou can tax and no\nNo he had no agency just wanted to hang out with that she didn't even care about the party so he goes to a bar nearby and then we go up to the party\nThe doorman states on the second floor doorman tells us where to go we knock on the door no one answers but we start listening in you know it sounds like there's like five people in there\nAnd me and my friend or just any other than that we're looking at each other we're not going to get no one hears that are knocked we hear that there's like five voices and then we just decided to leave\nYeah that makes me and I got up and left with no one knew even knew we were there but we were there but no one at the party and so then we we go down that is the first mishap and then we go down meeting with our friend at the bar you with that and we're there we're having a good\nTime and uh this random woman not a you know not in her mind it all sort of out of her mind [laughter]\nIt's a funny way of saying it I Know that in a rather not in their mind or what did you get a handicap parking spot no real crime and but she did have a service dog [noise] I think down would probably be able to get a handicap parking spot issue I don't think\nI don't know if it was actually with a trivia dog and she comes over she as she points at our friend and she goes I'm going to do with your friend and she sits down next to him and we don't know this we don't know this woman and then she starts dot and then she starts I'm\nMean talking another woman at the bar a woman who's on a computer she points it means you go to your girlfriend over there it's on a computer at a bar is a little a little weird to be on there can ya ... my girlfriend ... was she your girlfriend now that I mean\nI Wonder if that means you said your girlfriend over there and I never met either of them I was the question my girlfriend and then she just\nBeing mean and and talking means stuff about other people at the bar and the and the staffer comes over and he says it's just a dog a little pug with her and he yeah he says is that a service dog and she goes yes it is that it's none of your business\n[laughter] [laughter] well I Am the amount of ... what is your [laughter] where are you are both [laughter] and so she shows\nThem like a picture of the license and he doesn't buy it he goes okay could finish your drink but then you've got to get outta here\nWhat would those the name of the marriage\nBut I it was an Irish bar but I don't I don't know the name my friend who invited me just add Irish bar and it was like nearby like there's an Irish part you can't miss it so I don't know what the name was probably something go flying and O'Malley I don't know something like that was in midtown that so yeah I Know and then she goes I'm and she points to me this woman who's yelling and screaming and being lawful\nShe goes you don't know how to comb your hair you got to go to John\nI'm age she's making a good point I had to say are saying this woman was\nNot in her mind now or out of it but er the woman shouldn't have been on the computer in the bar and I agree I don't really know how they are and I agree that you shouldn't have been our computer bar but I also didn't care yeah it's also like much like we're talking about above vegetarian\nPeople don't really like to be told\nThat the you know something negative about themselves right you know like this and how it should be banned negative I similar situation actually two years ago on St Patrick's Day okay um I was with my friend Bailey can ski and we're at a bar while you're just saying the names yeah you know honestly I think it makes it ... when when people tell me stories\nAnd they use for a man I'm like Oh thank you you really brought me in here yeah because otherwise you're kind of like trying to figure out how to identify this person you're like my friend you know they actually\nWill situation this is not social this I I actually had a little bit of journalism\nOr well yeah so anyway in journalism I Would give the full name to [laughter] make 'em anyway by the way your your crotch has been like floating ... closer to my me of the conversation going on you can like kind of feel your legs\nYeah right [laughter] oh ah very the goose is here also are going to a class on your stories stories and that kind of yeah All right and all this started where we're at this bar\nIn Brooklyn New York Dick and we're having a drink there\nAnd this woman at the bar next to us\nKind of talking to the to the bartender but also she's on a date with somebody as being very loud and like\nYou know kind of making fun of other patrons in the bar yeah which is the funny thing to do his small state yeah other people get here but we're coming to the left of her so we didn't you know receive her either yet or\nAll of a sudden she turns around and you

S. U. at them\n[noise]\nAnd your community there are children that play kick ball basketball football and it's being and other games outside after school when you ... down\nThe road act like it's a race track you put these kids interests for injury or worse and we have seen it happen to one of our friends\nWhenever I ... into the street and I would advise Yahoo is going to factor out when you're driving a residential area tease the aware and alert this has been a message from the ... middle town the thousand\n[noise]\nA gentleman and we're back so let's start waste any time we're going to get right into the world of sports a hot off depress the\nRed Sox won the world series for the one over the LA Dodgers they wanted in LA or that their fourth title and\nGosh I I uh what was the two thousand and four so fourteen years may have had another one in their can't uh\nActually think it's for titles for title to two thousand for the city of Boston has had eleven titles in the past Seventeen years and I believe overall they have thirty seven championships from their professional sports\nThirty seven there are cities that don't have five there are cities that don't have five in\nBoston's got thirty seven I forgot whether it's twenty seven thirty seven regardless there's still cities that have no titles\nThe patriots are vying for when every year the red Sox has made it happen so I'm sure\nI'm sure it's going to be um a long offseason for LA I I Do want to stay on the red Sox and to me the most impressive part about this entire run yeah they had a hundred and eight when we'll get back to the MVP of the American league Steve Pearce winds every piece of the world\nSeries ... most impressed me is that they didn't lose on the road in the playoffs if you remember correctly when they play the Yankees won both games in the Bronx to advance and if you remember correctly\nAbroad not that every race yet even though he was the pre season favorite to win it I think he's still kind of adjusting he's kind of look more like LeBron the past few games\nWill see how he continues to develop and the other thing too is right now if you ever you peel word was was handed out that they go to Steph Curry goes Steph Curry now we'll see if he can continue to stay Hadiya thirty five points tonight he's fifty one the other night it's unbelievable\nAnd uh and he you know he just ah\nDoesn't stop he's ... he's he's incredible you keep guard um your kid garden 'cause all the ... rules and he could shoot the lights out from forty feet forty feet a kid with count the forty feet and there's been shooting from it\nHe's shooting circus shot she's making everybody look silly but the game is geared towards him short but at the end of the day\nHe he still got to put the ball in the back and he's doing a terrific job he'd be the MVP right now crazy crazy thing is is Kevin ... a monster numbers to the other night I think yeah forty five or forty one or forty to whatever\nAnd you know what to me once deaf numbers die down it's going to be extremely hard for anybody from that team to win MVP because that seems so good and to me Katie and step they cancel each other out in terms of MVP\nYou know so it it's all it's all mushy and ... and all I'm mixed up and jumbled up right now will get obviously get clarity the season goes on and and you know knock on wood barring barring any injury\nUm which could shake up a number of things\nBut the landscape of basketball right now is very very good except unless you're the Houston Rockets who are trying to give up for the first round picks for Jimmy Butler which is to me the the craziest thing I've ever heard because probably three of those four picks are going to be lottery picks\nFor a guy that has a really proven anything in terms of winning not as great I'd never questioned Jimmy bottlers toughness\nHe is a true tough guy but at the end of the day he didn't want anything and it's a simple Jimmy ... there needs to change that\nIn order in order to make themselves more marketable him more trusted him\nDown the road so we're a really take a break I got more and more sports believe me I promise we're not we're going to hit hit the nail right on the head with the NFL\nComing up next and ... and then you know everybody's favorite segment we're going to go all in\nOr we're going to fold what are we going to do tonight\nI don't know you got to stick around and find out you're listening to the classroom sports edition I'm DJ goose\n\nAnd your community and their children that play\nEgg legacy racetrack you put these kids interests for injury or worse and we have seen it happen to one of our friends\nWherever our first date we bought into the street and I would advise our who's going too far to stop when you're driving a residential area piece the aware and alert this has been a message from the view from Middletown so\n[noise]\nSo have you with what\nHe does a man\nIn the day is that\nLike that\n[noise] do you get tired of ads that they you know how to [noise]\nWill be less damage than\nBe the day\nMaintain his name but\nBe that you\nThe baby they knew me I think will you and me I look at you know I think\nI Need my\nBaby is we're not that bad\nIt was a gentleman and we're back again you isn't it a DJ goose\nOn W. S. U. Middletown eight point one F. M. this in the classroom sports addition I Want to give a quick shout out thanks thank you\nTo all who made the record fairs success you are a huge part of W. S. U. and would W. S. U. does so we thank you for that I also want to take my listeners right now I Want to applaud you actually you can give you a nice a\nRound of applause for being up to late for being up this late in staying staying with me through my crazy not being able to talk and and ah\nAll my all my ... that I shoot out into the Mike so I I appreciate all of you\nAnd uh and you are listening to the classroom\nSo I\nI touched on this last time I was on and\nWant to I Want to come back to a little bit if you will recall if not you can email me and I will send you the video\nI spoke about cycling Barclay and I said he's putting up stats on a garbage football team what does that do that is absolutely nothing it's just filling up the statute and and and again if he was a self described make them look selfish and and make them look bad\nBut he's not he's not selfish guy at all anybody that talks to him knows that or anybody that watches him\nKnow that in and knows how humble he is and how well he carries himself\nNow if you're sitting at home I Need you to do a little research for me\nLook on ESPN and look at all the articles about cycling Barclay look at the dates and tell me how many have occurred in the last two to three weeks 'cause you answers minimal\nDancers minimal and I know that because that followed the giants are exclusively and ... and I'm a big fan and and I I Love my team and and I follow them all the time\nSo don't don't question me about how much I follow my team but this is what I'm saying the man went for over a hundred scrimmage yards today\nAnybody talking about it anybody talking about it\nAnd he might have several listeners talking about it on anybody and I'm just casually talking about they want\nNo because they care that the team's going at seven his that's don't matter anymore it's man could rush for twenty five hundred yards and if the giants are three and Thirteen is not going to look great it's not going to look great it was really really really bad on him\nNow not on him not on him\nBut nobody's gonna care about it would you\nWould you if a team that better you really going to care while you're running back to the same thing with the same thing with ah the next guy want to touch on oh del ... junior\nThe star of the New York football giants the best player on the New York giants\nAnd\nHe's on pace to have a hundred and twenty receptions on the year he's on pace to have his third most receiving yards at over a thousand I Believe it's somewhere\nAgain who's talking about it no everybody in their mother is worried about oh ... who\nWho do do do screaming at anybody today there or do you know scream at the uh the kicking it today do\nThey're scheduled one fought toughest in the country every single year\nAnd they're under feeder right now and you know what they deserve to be number three because they nobody better than them a and clubs and has proven to be more consistent bought Notre Dame is getting their\nNames coming and if they stay on to feed it they're going to be in the playoff no no questions asked\nAnd they their role in it it's dog because they moved away for granted when Bush\nOr the quarterback using New Jersey native\nSo that that that hit me at home a little bit but you know what they've been playing really great ball and I'm sure he's happy first team and uh and he wants to go with the national championship and if that means you've got to sit you guys sit down and be ready just in case of injury\nThen then so be it and he he's the type of player that he'll do anything for the team he'll do absolutely anything for the football team and ... and those are the kind of guys you on your program\nYou know not guys are going to sit there and and and stopped their heads all the time and\nAnd just cry and wine so Alabama number one hundred number to Notre Dame and number three climbing up on Clemens' in feels a little bit for now I'm going to go at LSU who don't polish Georgia\nOkay oh she was about fourteen they play Bamako this week so one of those teams you're going to probably balance stay here because the problem is is banned I haven't played anybody they don't play anybody that that that's good\nSo their strength discussion was pretty horrible so I I think the winner this game probably propels the number one name in my eyes at least in the goose rank the winner of that game goes to number one if\nSee if I was uses they'll jump into the number for if they continue to win or maybe they speaking of bamboo loses is Michigan which I'm horrible\nA lot of Jersey guys there I won't go down the list but there's a lot of Jersey guys there too\nAnd they're playing great football they lost to Notre Dame in South bend doping a year a really tough environment\nTo be honest with you ... wrong place wrong time for that football team to try and grow up and and introduced a new start in shape patterns and\nIt it was tough but um I think I I think it made them tough overall okay that they've been really impressive they walked up on Michigan State a couple of weeks ago\nAnd uh they're headed in just a big match ups against Penn State and Ohio State and the year obviously that's the greatest rivalry in college football\nBut right now there are number five and and their role in okay because I Believe they have to go to them\nAnd Ohio state's got a lot of holes right now especially after a loss Nick poster who decided to a rest stop for the pros you know that in Ohio State ... ... they're not really real Peters at this point but\nWe'll we'll have to see so so to quickly recap the goose drank before we before we move on Alabama number one comfortably unless they lose you know then you never know clubs that or to Notre Dame at three LSU if for Michigan is five I really can't really don't have time\nTo dive into what would be after that and in terms of what conference and\nAnd whatever those are the five but it seems right now in college football and it's that simple okay and and I need to be more results before that changes so All right uh we're gonna move on\nMy devils five two and one call point Mary New Jersey native he's a dog so far he's for Thirteen points are already he's got eight goals I mean it goes in eight games no math guy but that's one go again that's pretty good\nOkay and then and then for for the locals the Bruins are six three into a Patrice birds wrong leading the way it's sixteen points already both teams playing playing really well and that's good news for both locals and myself\nAs heads and I'm a giant I'm a Mets fan I get associated as a Knicks fan\nSo believe me anything that goes right with the devils is a fantastic science and I'll take it okay even the giants stink the giants thank max thank the Nick think then that think\nOkay the New Jersey jak was aren't even that great okay\nSo I knew something good going in my life okay and the\nDevils are providing that right now so we're going to take a little bit of break we're going to come back with some all in her full and and wrap up a little bit I'm DJ goose used in a W E s U Middletown ... point one F and\n[noise]\nThey Jimmy

and again the same again\nI'll tell us a lot of ... and the way to stop ... thinking [noise]\nShe has just announced that there will be a Senate confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh to take a seat at the Supreme Court September for um so what is the judicial code of ethics\nSo unlike other federal judges the Supreme Court justices right now I have no code of conduct um and that opens the door to conflicts of interest and misconduct on some of the most important positions in our government\nAll government officials need to have high ethical standards and the Supreme Court justices need to make sure that they're not thought of or seen as above the law\nIn five hundred dollars a day on one could argue there should be held in a higher standard given that they are the you know the most important in coordination\nSo we need to make sure that there are written and strict standards that would remove potential conflicts of interest making sure the judges obey the law and sort of the American people and we should have that be the same transparent standards that applies to all federal judges from across the Supreme Court and other federal judiciary\nNow um there's also the issue of Citizens United and we touched on it a little bit but this of course you've got Supreme Court decision\nThat opened the door for um unaccountable money centrally corporation wealthy Americans right now have announced science say their free speech caught a you know it is worth much more than our free speech because they\nGet to spend a money that is not easily trade 'em through a super PACs and other means um what do you what do you call on congressional candidate to do about the issue of Citizens United because\nIt seems as though says the nation's highest court has spoken unless you get Congress to legislatively overt turn this there isn't much we can do\nThat's exactly what we're asking if candidates will do\nOn resolutions instructing Congress to do just that to pass a constitutional amendment\nThat would overturn Citizens United and allow commonsense regulation of political spending\nWe think it's time that Congress or listens and we're asking what candidates will do in order to rebalance our system to allow individuals to have more influence and reduce the power of an accountable and significant big money\nOr in the in our elections a\nCongress has the power to pass a constitutional amendment that would effectively overturned Citizens United and that's an opportunity to actually strengthen democracy and it's not just Citizens United it's been a series of Supreme Court decisions dating back to Nineteen Seventy Sixers luckily viva lay how\nThat have paved the way for money and speech to be intertwined\nWe believe that there is a good solution that a Congress and there are some potential bills that Congress has a considered in the past we could actually pass a constitutional amendment that would reform the problem and bring balanced back to our political system when it comes to spending and elections\nAnd just the um how are the candidates who just simply refused to answer this questionnaire um I suppose it's going to take grassroots pressure from people saying if you want to vote the very least you have to respond to them\nSo we've had we've had a number of excellent responses so far and we've had 'em over a about a hundred and fifty responses to our questionnaire already and that includes um a over a hundred Democrats over a dozen Republicans and a number of independent third party candidates\nSo we're actually seeing that democracy is clearly on the ballot and in the minds of candidates\nThat are running for Congress\nWill take additional communication from their voters takes citizen\nAbout two years ago and over the course of that campaign in and talking to one of the campaign directors of a house or represents a representative who is in the house was income but um we verify every uh answer that comes into our survey and as we call to make a verification call\nThe campaign manager said Jesse you know I have to tell you we get dozens of these surveys we get them from all different kinds of issues and yours is the only one we filled out asked why and she said because we've got so many damn phone calls from activists [laughter]\nSo we know that that's what it takes and that's what will make sure that candidates know how important it is that their voters are calling them\nAnd websites you've given was democracy twenty Eighteen dot org I'm willing to that from our website as well no what state level representatives these there\nAre any I'm trying to a state level of representatives to address some of these questions because these are issues that get read\nI state level and we've talked my Jimmy men doing\nSo that's correct we do have a number of state level questionnaires that will be different each state has slightly different um state based laws and there are um different questions that are more pertinent to the state level candidates ... governors um attorney general secretary of state where state legislature\nWe will be adding a number of states starting later in August them through September to be able to find out when your state is listed and you can uh go to democracy twenty Eighteen dot org\nAnd at the bottom of the site and you can sign up for email alerts from common cause or you can check back later\nRight now we have a set of states that are questionnaires are being filled out in Oregon and in Colorado and we'll be expanding to a number of other states over the course of August and into September to check back often to see if they're both more congressional candidates a state primaries wrapped up\nHow did it on the record but in a way doesn't it also signals the candidate that these are the issues that voters they're interested in so it's a conversation a two way conversation\nThat's right and we're looking forward to candidates discussing their plans to strengthen democracy if they're elected and something we think candidate should run on should discuss more and should have\nBetter and clear answers for their voters to the top of mind for voters across the country\nWe're seeing a very powerful response just from the list a of activists that are already connected with common cause and we're starting to see more people come in and use the Web site or whoever we're finding out about it or for the first time and saying this is vitally important to me as a voter to know what new my\nElected representative will do to protect them striking democracy it's only in a kennel it's\nAbsolutely should be paying attention to\nNow on the um back to the issue of from Butte and writes the tree started out saying that becomes a really huge question not just around what we want to see from our candidates going into the election but I shall participation in the election does it make sense of peace in the\nBut he was the New York times recently that showed or maybe it was Associated Press that showed um [noise]\nThat the Trump administration's Justice Department has taken a very different approach to protecting election integrity on voting rights in particular the rights of individuals to vote than the Obama administration did whereas the Obama administration be backwards challenged\nCertain date you know I'm requirements harsh voter id requirements and\nUm the decisions to purge the voter rolls under Trump we're seeing a very different direction um isn't this a critical issue that even goes beyond what candidates St ...\nFor stand what's happening with voting rights in this country and what can be done to make sure that all eligible voters can cast a vote\nThe first starts with a restoring the protections of the voting rights act many of the challenges to voters and restrictions on voting that have happened over the last few years has come when the Supreme Court wrongly a took a took out key sections of the voting rights at and ruled unconstitutional\nWe can restore those through an act of Congress and so one of the key questions and our questionnaire is will your elected representative to Congress support restoration of the voting rights act to prevent the states and localities from passing discriminate or it's discriminatory voting laws that includes things like\nA unduly a onerous voter id ah restrictions the purging voters unnecessarily from the voting rules like we've seen in Ohio and other places or roll back so\nOn the state level common cause has been fighting a statewide campaigns to protect these all these laws like in Marion County Indiana we recently won the\nUh the ability to actually expand early voting locations I'm In that county in Indiana there are clear solutions that Congress can and\nAnd enact that will not only protect but expand the rights of individuals to to vote and proved that we are a country that both um focuses and a group that allows people to have the most fundamental right in a democracy which is the right to vote\nRight um and then there's also the issue of same day voter registration that appears Anya questionnaire um and it's remarkable um how difficult it is in this country to vote and yet you know I mean we don't get a day out it's not down on the weekend day uh\n\nThis is Greg from ... cosmos and you're listening to W E s you\nLook at

the issues that some of these allegations would be involved in in terms of making outreach to our Congress persons and senators and so forth\nYes what we're one of the things we're going to do is organized allegations to meet with our\nUS Senators and Congress people from Connecticut and in the meantime people could make called in supportive piece at two o two\nTwo to four three one two one is that congressional switch for they will connect you to your senators and Congress people one of the things that were urging people to do is to ask a Congress people to support the hold the line at that's L. Y. N. E.\nLong held the line act both on the house and Senate side to cut funding for new forms of nuclear weapons one of the things is that last week President Trump broke the agreement with the Russians called I. N. F. agreement controls medium size and small size nuclear weapons\nThis is a major step backwards and makes the world and much more dangerous place and you also increases the likelihood that\nInterest nuclear weapons we need to urge Congress people to cut the funding for this these weapons these nuclear weapons are are designed to go underneath the radar and will destabilize the whole situation between the U.S and Russia and make nuclear war much more likely\nOne of the things on the eye and after that I've read about is that in Nineteen eighty seven Ronald Reagan not known as the peace Nick signed an agreement\nWith the premier of Soviet Union at that time\nMr Gorbachev and the issue was about these intermediate\nMissiles that were being put into place and the issue of course wise that both sides knew that there was a ten minute flying time between Russia and the button and the actual detonation of comic weapon this gave very little time to either side to figure out whether this was a flock of geese\nThat disrupted a radar system where there have been bitter malfunction and die out\nAnd one of their sophisticated systems and why are we now at this point in time\nSo adamant on leaving disagreement which has been working for quite a few years\nThis is an extremely dangerous development there's a major push\nTo develop these new forms of nuclear weapons which would make the world a much more dangerous place\nWe should be reducing nuclear weapons and reducing the threat of nuclear nuclear war not increasing it ... the issue you refer to as the issue of nuclear weapons on hair trigger alert where there's very little time to determine if something is a cork\nIn the system or an actual attack in Nineteen Ninety five the Russians thought they were under attack it turned out to be a weather satellite but the nuclear briefcase was open and there's been other close calls as well\nSo why do you think that the INS treaty is being eliminated as it ...\nRecently that the F thirty five can now be a nuclear weapon carrier specifically a bunker busting type of weapon so would this be part of a first strike scenario you go in you destroy the retaliatory ability of Russia or some other country\nYes I mean the American people are being left in the dark on this\nAh there's been very little discussion about issues around first strike capability the modernization of nuclear weapons the new forms of nuclear weapons that are being developed they've pretty much kept us out of the mainstream media and out of the mainstream discussion\nThe American people were more aware of what was going on in terms of the development\nPossible development of the first strike capability and the danger involved with this there would be an outcry\nBut they keep just out of the mass media they keep just out and then keep the side of the mainstream discussion\nCertainly it's day most American people would be interested in peace cause a nuclear war could ruin your entire week right\nYeah they're they're keeping the American people in the dark on this there there's there's very little discussion about what they're doing\nAnother part of it is the ... on our military budget which just this past and I noticed that both political parties particularly or in Connecticut the Connecticut delegations seems to be on board for producing three nuclear submarine each year instead of one what is this all about\nAbout dependency on the war economy it's about dependency on the military industrial complex we should be moving towards peace conversion\nAnd figuring out ways to employ people in other ways other than parents for the unsinkable if we invest in green infrastructure in renewable energy and energy efficiency in schools and health care\nThese types of things will create many more jobs than the president a military\nSTO complex you got about eight thousand jobs but if you spend on anything out education transportation new energy systems whatever two to three times in other words sixteen to twenty four thousand jobs why isn't this being taken seriously\nBecause again there's no discussion about peace conversion options and the mass media and in the mainstream discussion issues like this do not get discussed so\nWhat we're really talking about is that the United states economy is addicted to war right\nYes it's a serious addiction to war yes I Would agree with that\nAnd that kind of tendency an economics in other words military industrial complex supplies those jobs but these jobs are not sustainable and in the long term there really short changing the American people 'cause they're not getting the most jobs for the amount of money that is being spent\nSo what kind of conversion proposals you think might appear out of this peace conference or a future peace conference and how would that\nOperate how would that change the game as it were\nWorld there was an attempt by the state of Connecticut to at least look into peace conversion there was something called the futures commission number of years ago and there's been a number of studies that as you point out the fact that many more jobs could be created if you invest in\nIn public transportation for instance or renewable energy or education education schools health care any of these areas\nThis has been quite a controversy across the world and it brings up issues about our relationship with Saudi Arabia and we could also talk about the war in Yemen\nWhat's going on is that the U.S has been providing military aid to the Saudis\nAnd to the United Arab Emirates and the involving a in a horrible war in Yemen which is turning into a humanitarian catastrophe it's really a war against the civilian population of Yemen\nThey lack all sorts of basic medical supplies food is a humanitarian crisis that has been ignored by the U.S media there is a house resolution one thirty eight which I wear a treat for the call Congress in support of [noise]\nWith this horrible war and perhaps and\nOne of the things that has bothered me over the years 'cause I was talking about this for five years ago and I declared with this secret war on the air and actually had interviewed several people there were two reporters a woman from the London times that we're so merrily thrown out of the country\nBecause they were reporting the atrocities that were going on even that it's been almost like a total news blackout about this war and the other issue of course is that now because of this\nIncident there's some talk in Congress about pulling out of Yemen do you think this is serious or is it just a public relations\nI don't know there has been several efforts in the Senate led by Bernie Sanders supported by our our our Senator Chris Murphy in support of what they call the war Powers Act to cut the military aid to the Saudis\nAnd cut our involvement with this horrible war in Yemen you came pretty close to passing a I think it was six votes short about number of months ago\nYou know now that the house version house resolution or one thirty eight and we should support that a call our Congress people to support that\nWere kind of coming to the end of our first program maybe show you could again reiterate about this important conference tell people about it how can they contact you is there an email or write a telephone number where they can contact you for further information\nGive me a call at eight six so five six one Eighteen Ninety seven call at eight six o five six one Eighteen Ninety seven\nPerhaps we could organize car pool to the conference or if you

W E s U Middletown ... now and fame [noise]\n\nWill ... radio Joyner host resembles his top leaders from a good move about\nFarming and our global future [noise] roost Audrey [noise] rubber getting healthy fled [noise]\nNo here's host Theresa Marquez\nHello and welcome to roots doc radio I'm Teresa Marquez and I'm here today with Denise O'Brian\nDenise has many many things that we can say about her but for first she's the founder of women food an ad network um she has been quoted as saying my life has been devoted to raising women's voices in agriculture\nAnd she definitely doing that Denise worked in agriculture along before she cofounded the women who'd an ad network\nWhich I think we all called W. fan in Nineteen Ninety seven and she's farmed in topless Iowa for thirty seven years with her husband Larry Harris who operated the essay farm called rolling acres\nDenise was born and raised and even went to college in Iowa and knows a heck of a lot about Iowa agriculture so we're very excited to talk with you today Denise welcome\nThank you Teresa I'm Glad to be here yeah I Am in such a ... all the great work you've done and a huge thank you for\nIowa you must know Iowa in and out having been born raised went to college there lived all your life they're having you\nYes I I left for a while I left for a number of years and never actually thought I Would come back I left\nAs a senior in high school and um came back after college in traveling in that in and uh I came back for a family event went to a local bar met my husband or my future husband\nAnd um came back here and and\nAnd met this guy in the bar that said I Want to be an organic farmer and I thought wow that's really political and and besides the fact that he was handsome and on and just said the best smiling and that office situation I've ever made in my life and that was forty two years ago\nWell congratulations on that is just a lovely to here I think that it would be super if you could give us some insight into what\nSo you know and then it was the women who left the farm to get jobs to put groceries on the table to put food on the table which was kind of ironic in truth countries\nAnd have medical insurance\nRight and they didn't have that and and you're absolutely right so so you know women food and agriculture was formed I'm Out of wanting to amplify women's voices in this and\nAnd I think they ... you know we've done that successfully over the years and this week on ... um this next week from today actually is the um [noise] a conference in Des Moines Iowa with\nWomen food and agriculture are and your conference so we've gone from having maybe at an annual conference four or five when it first started to over two hundred now so it's really grown\nUp and moving from Iowa yet that those\nDeaths I remember one time listening I'm too I was in a a group of farmers 'em and you know someone on that to a woman are you a farmer and if it did occur to her that she had never stood up and said yes I'm a farmer and she looked up and said you're darned cute [laughter]\nYeah but do you deal with the first time I ever thought of herself like that\nThe farmers are just as hard working and they just have a huge room and eat and their husbands and knowledge to them as well and you're seeing a lot of that from yes the the farmer the men farmers now acknowledging [laughter] yeah I don't know how I Do this without my wife you know then you know look at our our current situation in Iowa\nWhat do you think that the women could bring to the politics there do women have a special voice in politics\nRight one thing that I observed a number of years ago and and W. fan has moved forward with is is that women own around fifty percent of the land of\nThe rent typical farmland in Iowa but in many other states we own that land because our our husbands die younger\nThan we do or we live longer than they do and um we inherit land in our families and so WFAN started a program in the late nineties called women carrying for the land and and it was bringing women together about and talking about\nTheir dreams about their land and when we first started doing this women would go\nWell no one ever asked me what my dreams were you know and and and that we have picked people draw pictures and we'd have these learning circles and and we continue with that now nationwide and I say we because I still feel like this ownership to it but the staff does these\nPrograms around the country teaching women about natural resource and conservation and it's mostly women's dreams to have\nNatural resources conservation measures on their farm and to have families on the farm and it's the exact opposite of what's happening so I used to drive down\nThe road and think wow if women had decision making power about their land this landscape would look different and I ... it it's happening slowly but surely but as women but\nAnd one is above her strip or a waterway they wouldn't read from me not understanding that land was so precious\nThat they had the power to put those in their lease and they that if\nA tenant didn't want to do that she could go to the waiting list women just didn't realize that that land was so precious\nIn order to farm and as the as people got bigger and bigger as farms got bigger and bigger so so women are learning that potential and and empowering themselves in these learning circles\nThat that that they can they can have that power to determine what their limb looks like and I think one of the things we always used to talk about and it's still\nIt's still exist today is that men\nCan go to the elevator they can go to the cafe they can go to the bar and talk about farming and women don't have those options women when they\nShow up at church meetings or you know school meetings and that it's\nAlways about others than themselves and so there's no place for them to go to say well would you charge for rent on your age or you know or what did you do with this you know with this intense rain what are you thinking about doing um you know conservation wise and that so this um women and\nCaring for the land has has\nEnabled women to come together to talk about those things and then to demand the changes on their on their land it's happening slowly slowly but it's happening and then women who are now your culture actually always also has\nTalked about political where you first asked me I'm a program called plate to politics and al ... who is the current um staffers and is just returning from Michigan doing a a a a plate to politics like a precursor to really getting into\nGetting trained to run for political office and women are showing up to these because they're very\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're just joining us You're listening to talk radio I'm ... and I'm so delighted to be talking with the nice O'Brian today from Iowa and founder of women's food an ad network that you're talking about some of our some of the program and I'm also about what it's like to be a woman in in agriculture as well as\nPotentially in politics is Denise is running for the Iowa house district number Twenty one\nI'm Denise so interesting to think about ten women be more bold and seeing what they want they want to me one time that if you thought it was hard to be a teenager be a farmer in Iowa and think differently than your neighbor\n[laughter] yes I saw through and that's what I really admired about my husband and as we've grown older it's like wow you really did take a different path and and it was really brave of gamma courageous do that and for his parents to support him to do to\nTo support us to do that because the guys that live in the neighborhood several of them um\nWell the school bus with Larry and he determined to go a different path and so peer pressure didn't\nPush him into you know the the you know the path of agribusiness and and and and that's\nAnd and yeah the women have a different aspect of looking at the land and we have a a maybe a a deeper sense of the whole in order to get along and to move forward we need to work together and we need to find balance and I ... I find that women are that way and that women\nBecause we've been invisible I think sometimes can step forward and do things in increments and not so showy and get things done on us incremental basis rather than a outright splash to have this all done does that make\nSense it sure does but I'm just kind of laughing to myself because you know how you started that out because we are invisible and I think for the first time maybe I Know I'm In especially thinking about up a hash tag me to that because we're invisible maybe that could advantage to odd though I I like the way you do that that's that's\nPretty good how can our listeners I'll learn more about the women food and Agnew network um what is your website\n[noise] it's a WFAN dot ORG\nIn some of the programs that you talked about just so interesting in and out of assuming they're like women carrying for the land and so on hum it would be that website mhm um\nYeah fat and plates of politics\nIn the play the politics of so so great to have that resource thank you I'm as we talked about women's role I'm just curious there's a couple of things that you always hear about Iowa and I know some of it's truly true\nAnd that is that there's a lot of water pollution there's a lot of environmental problems there because of so many of the confinement and feedlot operation that we heard about from John I heard that they're you know super weeds are getting out of control they're now going to increase um pesticides or by almost two hundred percent um yes and we are are\nAbsolutely confident that that's causing reproduction problem cancer and even have a genetic\nOr politics than in water coming together in Iowa\nAnd well that you hit on a real hot spot for things and that's another reason I'm running for the you know the house of representatives\nIn Iowa was that that we have an insurance company here in Iowa called the farm bureau and they ... yeah and uh\n[laughter] they own the legislature and um so\nI Would really like to work to break the talents of of the farm bureau on our legislature because they determine the way that I was going and so that was what helped um get rid of\nIn a while they end [noise]\n\nJones in for something different in sports talk radio tired of being taught that craving solid intellectual discourse well we can't guarantee that but we can guarantee you won't hear the same old tired takes that those other shows tried upon off on you\nAnd there'll be no gravelly voice weirdos telling you what you should think around here either just random using on almost every sport under the sun will chime in on whatever whenever this is what sports and beyond W E s U Middletown\nHowdy sports fans this is your host evening with with sports and beyond hey we've got a great show for you today um\nThree main topics we're going to cover what sports of course we're going to cover some ah items in sports numerology which I think you'll find fascinating and then the third topic on the agenda is who's famous in sports and why I'm\nBut before we get to sports we're going to go a little bit off topic here um just for a few minutes the er at the beginning of the show\nI Want to speak about a a little bit not much but uh just to\nRemind you that we've had kind of a a horrible week and before I go into that I Want to say that the views expressed on this program or the views of the individual broadcaster and do not necessarily reflect the view of Wesleyan University or the W E S U management\nIt'd be hard pressed to say that to argue that as a nation we are not all that and by the events of last week [noise]\nUm I wanted to name a Thirteen people\nI went to a vigil last night uh over just to actually you could probably if you have a pretty good arm you know if you've got a good right fielder arm like Roberto Clemente had you could throw a baseball from the parking lot here over to the uh south green next to the synagogue\nWhere there was a vigil for the uh eleven victims and the a tree of life a synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh but they also made mention of two others\nWho were killed this week I'm you know\nUh those two were given much less media coverage and it's not the media's fault [noise] um I think if you were to ask a mainstream media what they would have liked to have covered this past week it would've been the guy on the plane that groped a woman and then said Trump made me do it [noise]\nBut uh unfortunately there was a lot worse going on and so I just wanted to\nUh spend a few moments here really quickly uh giving names or to the ah to people from Pittsburgh or the eleven people from Pittsburgh and the two people from Louisville, Kentucky and I'll begin with the two from Louisville\nI'm Marie Ballard a was sixty nine years old he was a husband father grandfather son brother uncle and friend he was a member of St Bartholomew Catholic Church and the Newberg tennis association\nOf a an interesting and very ironic piece of information came out about um Mr style or does that uh his daughter\nThe other person was sixty seven year old Dickey Jones\nUm\nYour member of a she'll be she was buried Saturday at the church and living God and uh\nHer nephew said she was a wonderful woman and\nHad not I mean bone in her body her family also said that they had buried Jones brother just two weeks ago um Jones mother was recently moved into a nursing home and she was and and Vicki was the one who ... visited or when the brother died\nThey said they thought it best not to tell Jones mother\nAbout that death um\nBecause it might upset her uh greatly and now someone is going to have to go in because Vicki Joneses and showing up anymore and tell the mother that she's lost both her children those are the two from Louisville, Kentucky\n\nOn to Pittsburgh and I don't mean to\nA or\nB a minimal lies any of these people by giving them a number\nOf but I'm going to um count off as I talk about them\nAnd I'll give their name and age and hopefully find a little tidbit to say about them a number one is Joyce Feinberg Seventy five years old um\nShe was a magnificently carrying generous and thoughtful human being her co worker said she never forgot anyone's birthday she was always available for whatever one might need she was also very intellectual [noise] but also people could just open up to her in a very easy way\nWhen the news of the shooting broke Saturday line hurt\nKnowing she would probably have been in the morning service I said tell me your okay tell me your okay line art said\nWhen her best friend didn't respond after several hours she began fearing the worst I just can't say how terribly sad I Am that this person is in in the world anymore\nNumber two would be Richard Godfrey D a age sixty five [noise]\nAnd Godspeed fell in love in the late Nineteen seventies and it was with a practicing Catholic pay the Raj co was a fellow dental student at the University of Pittsburgh in Nineteen eighty the year he graduated they married\nOr they built a successful dental practice together both volunteered at Catholic charities free dental clinic and also counsels seem to be married couples at St asked the nastiest parish a Catholic Church near their home they just celebrated their\nThirty eight wedding anniversary\n[noise] number three is rose mal under age Ninety seven years ago Mel injure used to come to the synagogue with her sister Sylvia now deceased\nThe sisters were usually the ones preparing breakfast for the congregants\nHuh I'm\nChuck diamond the former rabbi a diamond sixty three has no boundaries for years he said he and mail and your son went through kindergarten in high school together I feel a part of me died in that building\nNumber for Jerry ... aged sixty six at the end of every service we say cottage the Jewish mourners prayer jury would always insist on\nDo you at the University of Pittsburgh who was in the same congregation and met Jerry ... medical school thirty five years ago\n\nA number five and six were brothers Cecil and David Rosenthal aged fifty nine and fifty four respectively\nUm\nThese two were fixtures at the synagogue attending services nearly every Saturday for much of their lives they're going to tree of life since they were young boys said the former rabbi truck diamond\n\nNumber Seventy seven and eight or were a married couple Bernice and Sylvan Simon ages eighty four in eighty six respectively\nHeather Graham\nThirty nine said she and her boyfriend used to shovel snow for the Simons they were older so we want it to be sure they would be okay and not have to worry about shoveling Graham said she said Bernice often baked cranberry orange bread\nAnd gave it to them with I think you know\n\nNumber nine is Daniel Stein aged Seventy one\nWhen Steph in hall lost his father in September he expected to do [noise]\nThe grim work of cleaning out the older man's Florida condo alone and moving his mother's things up to Pittsburgh alone\nBut then his Seventy one year old uncle Daniel Stein offered to join him for days the two men worked side by side impact of the condo it was emblematic ... said of Stein's generosity and kindness\n[noise]\n[noise] um the ... you know there's only out of these seven scores are the only one that's really unlikely with a twenty five and it is a a twenty five twenty six it's unlikely that if either teams if if they eat it that the bills would score twenty five\nOn a bike to touch down so [laughter] I'm there you have it if you're gonna watch uh the Monday Night football I don't but if you do\nA more power to ya and enjoy it and placed origami uh look for the bills or will look for either team to score eleven points and the other teams for twenty five or or\nTwenty six twenty nine thirty one and we'll report back next week whether or not we got to score gummy that's unfair\nOkay good now the other another ah\nNumerology sports numerology issue here we have is the uh super sports equinox which happened this weekend\nAnd the\nFirst thing you might say is ah Steve what what is the super uh sports equinox\nWell or as you know uh [noise] uh\nAs soon as a real baseball fans such as a Yankee fans just don't care about any other sport except baseball and only on no other team except the Yankees as soon as the Yankees were eliminated they were counting the days until spring training or maybe until when pitchers and catchers report spring training so um\nThere's this gap were\nCertain sports don't play\nBut there's also a little period of time in the fall when the fall colors are out and it's really pretty um that uh the four major U.S sports the NFL the NBA the NHL and M. L. be all play\nAt least one game on the same day\n\nAnd uh that's called the super sports equal\nLate October early ah now it's more likely to happen early November although uh this year it happened twice in an October uh last year it happened twice in October\nUm\nAnd then in two thousand Fifteen through two thousand one and only happen one two three four five times and they were all on November [noise] and uh we'll talk about the one in two thousand and one in just a second\n[noise] [noise] but [noise]\nThe deal is um you have the four leagues\nAnd uh uh the the interesting thing about them all playing all the ... the ... playing games in the same day is if your city has representatives and all four leagues and they're all playing on the same day and then in the case of this past Sunday [noise]\nIf your city has teams and all poor leagues and they all play on the same day at home\nAnd that happened in LA yesterday\nAnd so what they had was\nUm\nRams played the Packers they won twenty nine twenty seven\nThe sharks San jose sharks came in and a beat the Anaheim Ducks four to three\nThe clippers beat the wizards one thirty six one all for their the LA Clippers the red socks of course won the world series beating the Dodgers square five to one and the LA kings making it five teams not for because to NHL teams played\nLA kings beat the New York rangers\nTime it was one city that had happened to was Phoenix, Arizona on November fourth two thousand and one which is approaching something like Eighteen years ago\nThe cardinals Arizona Cardinals the Phoenix Suns the coyotes I don't know what they're called ... or in the Arizona Diamondbacks all played on the same day three of the four teams loss but the diamond backs one game seven of the world series\nSo uh that was kinda cool\nBut at that time the coyotes were visiting the Carolina Hurricanes so not all the games happening in Arizona\nI'm\nNow the interesting thing about this um\nIs and if you've ever a bent a um\nUm\nWell you haven't uh not knowledge maybe one or two listeners have a spent some time with me\nRunning around doing errands or are trying to catch a I've gone out a on a friday night where I Want to see three different bands and they're in three different cities [noise]\nAnd so I time it and and you know a map quest it out so that I can get to all three are checking you know who's taking breaks at what our and and then using that for travel time to see the next ban and you know cetera et cetera et cetera I Do that kind of stuff and so [noise] they mapped out for you\nHow you could have seen all five games on Sunday\nAnd I'm just going to this is from\nFive thirty eight dot com where else would something like this come from the kings a game starts first at twelve thirty PM\nSouth and make it to the LA Colosseum and time to catch the rams Packers kick off at one twenty five [noise]\nUnfortunately you could only catch a few minutes of that game before having to embark on a thirty five minute drive down the one ten south to the dub hubs center in Carson where you'd miss the\nBeginning of the galaxy dynamo match which starts at one thirty but at least you get to see the second half of action after that match ends hop in the car for about thirty five minutes on\nNinety One east to reach Anaheim hottest under were you have time to pick up the double double before seeing the start of the ducks sharks at five o'clock but no dillydally after that you'll need to quickly get back in the car and drive an hour up to five north to Chavez Ravine for game five of the world series\nAnd since it started to five Fifteen you will be arriving with most of the Dodger fans well after six PM\nFinally at some point you'll drive Fifteen more minutes from Dodger Stadium back down to the one ten south the staples center were days were the day started to for the clippers wizards which tipped off at\nSix thirty and that's how you\nDo it I'm not easy but it can be done and uh what we didn't\nFigure out it would have been if I'd had time I would have gone off and checked what the ticket prices for all these games were although uh I don't know if I could get a reasonable ticket price for ah the world series game five and then also what the parking\nFees would have been to give you an idea of how much you'd have to spend to do that but that would have been fine with it not I mean\nKnow people there are people that actually try\nSomething like that and see games in every park and uh it's a you know a real um you know you end up having to sleep at the airport and whatnot and and uh um it gets really complicated ah with the schedules to do it but it can be done\nAnd this was just you can do this all in one day you can see four major league teams five actually with the to a hockey teams\nAnd a lot of fun just a lot of money to do it oh okay that's it for sports numerology let's get to watch sports okay\n\nAnd as you know or maybe you don't know uh most of

know the red Sox play the Dodgers this week for the past week for the world series a Red Sox won it um\nYou know um\nThere's because Boston plays in New York a lot of games and you get to know the Boston names the players [noise]\nYeah I didn't know the line up completely the MVP peers I didn't remember him a ... other players like a ... a JD Martinez very ah you know a\nSale the picture you know they they were you know but in my mind as players on the team um\nUm I kinda could conjure up a image of what they look like I wouldn't say they're my favorite players or anything but um I knew who they were the Dodgers on the other hand I couldn't recall too many people other than Clayton crew Shaw\nOr the pitcher who's a you know been big for them\nSeason and last season to season before that and the season before that\nNo off in the postseason so\nI'm with that in mind I'm\nMr Kevin Draper of the New York times uh wrote a piece about of\nThat there aren't any famous baseball players right now and uh he said you know with the Dodgers in Red Sox facing up to many people even sports fans might struggle to name a single player on the field I wouldn't say it was that bad I mean movie Wilson\nUm is vying for MVP I think he won the ... title so\nI'm Clayton curve shows one of the best pitchers in baseball sale might get the Cy Young I mean you know these people are you know they've got to give dance a little more credit and that but it's worse than we think\nI'm the percentage of Americans who said baseball's their favorite sport is at a low\nAnd dig this our own Connecticut

about him now he has one point five million followers that sounds like a lot to me I mean um well it's one tenth the size of the lottery which was one point six billion dollars but still\nIf I had if I had one point\nFive hundred followers I'd be ecstatic I don't have that [noise] so uh but LeBron James says forty four million\nFollowers and so what's the deal between white as LeBron James have so many flowers followers and Mike Trout who was a superstar of of enormous proportions he is the LeBron James uh baseball really\nWhy does he have only one point five million followers well there is\nSome some uh a\nReason and ah I looked into both of them a little bit and um first of all looking into Mike Trout\nUm\nHe's um got an obsession with the weather and this is a or a quote from\n\nA gym can tour I Believe yeah Jim can Torre who is a\nA a you know a\nHuge meteorologist I guess he says I've been talking to Mike Trout all week he's so excited about this storm and this is from back

I don't actually know that much about cheese even though I Pretend that I Do but it's really really good\nSo speaking of cheese go up what is co op was I'm here at Wesleyan would you like to but not for everyone uh yeah so okay um [noise] the wetlands ... is this\nLike option that we have at our school um for students where it's like um if oh there are a lot of different relationships that we have with um farmers and um [noise]\nTofu and say ten makers and coffee roasters I don't know what the words are for the people who make those thing right yeah dairy people thing um but um they have a relation to a lot of different suppliers um and there's like lots of different there's like lots of students who work um in those relationships\nAnd um the to the dining services plan that we have at Wesleyan [noise]\nUm we have a set up so that students at the beginning of the semester can like sign up to be a part of how many calls as they want you can be a produce dairy Sophia coffee there's a lot um and then they pay the dining services and then they have been turned pay the pirates\nUm so I guess I mean that's like kind of how it works and it's like just a really really really cool thing that we have as just like as an opportunity at the school and so um\nInstead of just buying food on campus or getting groceries at the grocery store west shots um that\nThe food weekly yeah that's\nSo amazing I personally am trying cup out for the first time this year and it's been\nA black and I'm so happy that I did it right now I get I you guys have heard me talk about this before on the show but [laughter] um I have a bread co-op cheese co op um my roommate had the produce co-op and we have preserved co op\nAnd I can make an egg sandwich in the morning with all local ingredients from\nJust my new plan and it's really amazing and ten out of ten would recommend if you are with me in student\nUm so what are some of that um places that use torture food from and what is your relationship like um with your suppliers I'm just from students to farmers students Baker things like that yeah um\nOkay so I actually don't have a relationship with either of the farms that we get our cheese from which is maybe like not embarrassing but like less cool um [laughter] it's okay and yeah so so basically\nI'm Still at the kinds of for the kinds of um co-op that exist um each within that like themselves everyone um had individual doses with suppliers so ... called we only have two suppliers [noise]\nUm and that's what we've historically had ... um and they're four of us and so the people are usually in charge of like emailing them and talking to them um and the two farm that we saw from our belt taint farm\nAnd Kato corner from I'm In a corner from like pretty famous and a big deal and in this region of Connecticut um and they've WON Awards with their cheeses they have no money they think they have like twenty varieties [noise] um\nAnd I mean mostly it's we email them actually I mean it happened just this week with art was the chief cop is that we have\nPersonally um and we haven't heard back from them about like what kinds of cheese we would have available for Columbus secret to that kind of how that works be like email them and they say we have this to use and it's just much a pound [noise]\nUm we had heard from them and then um when when mark who works but Kato corner from finally got back in touch he was like here's my phone number I don't want this ever happen again you know now that has a phone number and I guess we'll be in touch on the um over the phone but but yeah I mean basically\nUm year to year\nUsually whoever runs club runs it for that year and then um we like pass it down and so everyone who runs she's called right now is new and that's the case for most of the co op their produce and um\nEggs and tofu and all those things and though we have like a document that was passed on to us to like you're all things that you do when you run to the club um\nBut we had to you know reach out to them to mark and someone from Belgium farm also that person has changed has been a few different people um and be like hey these are our name we go to the new people that are going to be in touch with you so it's not the most intimate\nGotcha cool um\nSo what is your responsibility as she's co op or whatever leader I'll call you have a son captain yeah I really don't [laughter] do you do you do and then also um you were talking about oh they'll tell you there's this type of tea so is it typically just like one type of cheese a week\nOr is there are multiple types of cheese a week um so yeah just in ... and what formed the cheese inter yeah intuitively\nIn [laughter] and can you give me some what form does 'cause he's entered with me and I love that um [noise] I Want to make a joke about like it's just guys but I'm my ability to go for it she quick joke it's not very good\nBut okay for things were so I'm not so much responsibility actually it's kind of wild because\nI happen to use damaging students under um and it's also like when people they used in on campus really what they're talking about it usually is um the dining hall that as we only have one real dining hall on campus\nUm but there's a huge um like a mazer rooms and I'm a lot of stuff that goes on underneath the building in the basement\nThat I feel like so it's like not responsibility maybe a privilege but I get to like go and wander around and that without any couldn't do it all honestly I can wander into like the dish room where they like ... all of the main parts for everything you've cooked and I can wander into the kitchen um person who's cooking the dining hall and I can like\nGo to the offices and the storage room and all these things with no questions asked with like I think it really awesome and I am like very much trying to be responsible and feel and feel as though I I like deserve to be to be seen that way but it is I mean it it was pretty arbitrary so\nUm I think in certain in terms of responsibility it's like\nWe have certain supplies have knives that we cut the cheese with because they come in giant cheese and we all that are usually like\nTwenty five or thirty pounds you have to carry who'll tell us how cool that is yeah it's very very cool I'm obsessed with that I wrote an email at the beginning of the semester being like when they cut the cheese which comes on wheels very beautiful and very moving [laughter] and I really like feel I still feel that way\nUm co op at least for cheese we often have extra people just like don't come in and pick up their genes which to me I'm like\nI don't even I don't know how sad like just I I Can't express it more more intensely but like that baffled me like I think I think if that was the one thing I had to do before I graduated like explain why people don't get their ... or ... or like willing to not get their cheese I wouldn't be able to do it [noise] um\nSomeone emailed me recently and said that like her group she she's the only person in her like among people that she lived with he was getting co op that is getting she is co op which is doable like means that she paid for all of it and she's the only person eating it but she can't ever come to pick up caught because of the time that we give it out and she just haven't gotten it yet\nI find quality part of the you\nKnow if you haven't been getting it and I was honestly so scandal I I was like but you could just ask anyone to pick it up for you\nYou're just emailing me now and it's been four week where have you been doing [laughter] um but I Want to shame or so it's complicated um but yeah when we have extra which we always do um we take them for ourselves first and then when it's absurd because like I Can't be bringing home more than\nThree things are blue cheese um then we get them to everyone else he runs cop and then I'm usually by that time were out um although sometimes it goes to food rescue like we had to be actually did have a lot of extra blue cheese last time we had to stop you should have called me I'm going to give me a number [laughter] oh yeah\nYeah I ... when I got no um I mean that's why I've been having cheese cheese or my house because I had\nLike I really just have like four or five different kinds of art in Jesus um for my friend came over and we wanted a snack and I was like well you want to make a cheaper and then we did emulate tried all of them and\nPretended that we knew about how they were different which we didn't you know\nThat's the that's the problem to have it yeah you're going to have a problem having too much artist and she also at the top of the list the motives fake it the more you take it you're like you're going to get there you're going to be just like ... the ... I really agree I really really great um\nI'm taking I'm a state like sometimes I'm taking or about how like there's like a certain kind of memory that you get when you know the the tiny differences between different kinds of things in terms of their senses like it's like you know how the ... have like a very understanding and they can like they can the taste of wine and know exactly like\nWhat year it maybe is primarily whether it's nutty which actually maybe maybe mind isn't not he maybe that's treat 'em\nBut I always kind of thought it was like it's like when you're a music critic and you just say like\nAdjective that it makes me feel and they pretended that is like\nI don't know just start using like not even more in creamy grasp the hint hint hint well they do get a corner which is the place that we get most parties as from and I don't actually think I explain this earlier but\nReally I think you I mean how many children have per week and meet I created a survey I'm for like whatever the teachers are available to this week and they're like eight or nine Jesus this week and that's pretty standard um and for each of the tea those\nThere's like a long description that they write in on their website it'll be than taking than to everyone that like kind of describe that she's in terms of like\nHow long it eats and how the rind and bees and like whether it's stinky and what it's kind of in the dial up so I like like in like imitate that\nUm and be like yeah it is just a member of a young the Swiss style\nBut I really I mean but it's like I Want to talk about in terms of how I feel about it too so I don't know\nYou should watch you should watch the cheese expert video from like there's a video of the ... and it's like\nTwenty four hour not called the ... you know it's like ... like cheese expert ... cheese and they will like expensive and chief\nGeez huh it's pretty it's pretty interesting\nI just have to say that I really appreciate the descriptions of the cheese that I get on the survey and I feel like it's a lot more accessible and I love that it's like it's the funky fresh lightly smelly but really amazing that\nYou you do this no no no I'm saying is that they're written by the farm oh wow it's like I don't even yeah I mean it it makes the whole it really opens the entire process they may really make\nCough seemed kind of like we're not just like paying some like little sum of money to get like whatever scrap gee it's people like pay and then they got these like fancy cheeses with fancy description um but I just copy and paste them so I don't know at least you're honest yeah I Try 'em\nTalking about cheese is fun and she just said I'm so real quick we ought to play the game we always like the un it's called fresh ride in coming into season basically fresh what's the best in the late ... what's the worst thing you ate and coming into season what something you look forward to eating in the future\nIs it like best worst ever\nCould be but ideally from this we\nFlashed this month if you don't I can never think of the worst thing that I don't know if you have something to do it you know it can but if you have something that sticks out or just something that you were like wow that was so good or any just whatever whatever that means to you wait so\nSo I Am I the only one playing are you going to we'll play to play with when he wanted me to go first of all I can get in the mid ...
