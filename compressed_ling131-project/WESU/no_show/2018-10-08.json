[noise]\nSo just to see it on associates scholar at the center for world indigenous studies her book with rocks and on borrowed keep those entitled older we'll Indian died often twenty other myth\nAbout Native Americans welcome to the show Gina thank you [laughter] thanks so much for joining us so where are you know as the book I couldn't decide on which of these missed due to the next to discuss there's\nThere's too many of them for us to discuss uh in the course of the the interview so I picked out some that I think I just read the persistent and pernicious myth than\n... and then some that I hadn't really even thought about\nUm as being mythical I'm One of them which is the one that's been in the news is this um Washington a team football team that use adds his name may horrifically derogatory term for Native American\nBut the team owner Dan Snyder maintains that aid is intended\nTo honor Native American how do you take apart that\n[laughter] yeah that's it's kind of a tough one and the people have been tried to do that for you know over Twenty years starting with Suzanne shown Harjo and her project at the more you start Institute and um\nYou know with this particular one I think the place to start is by understanding that the term Redskins really goes back to the history of when the United states has was collecting bounties for Indian heads right and that that happens\nUm you know well before the foundation of the United states going back to the colonies I'm In you know the British colonies\nAn extended well into the ... the nineteenth century in California\nAnd that's you know fairly\nOr you know they say sometimes skins um and the reason that it was you know skins with because practically speaking to hunt a person and\n... and carry their head around was way too cumbersome are very heavy\nAnd and so what they did was they adopted the practice of scalp it as a way to collect the sound is to lighten up the look I Know it's crazy to to talk about this is such normalized terms but but this was the practical reality of of um health and sell it was so so\nThey would carry around these um these scalp ... skins these Redskins instead of hats\nAnd so for native people that's that's what that invokes for us which obviously was he's\nActually stepped back from minutes before we talk about some of the other method to discuss the issue of language and stuff I mean there's just\nHonestly just nodding off um education in the general non native public in the United states to understand the complexity of the various communities um and so that's what language in terms of um\nIndigenous communities are very complex and very ... varied um there's indigenous communities in Hawaii and Alaska in California I'm multiple communities and in various states\nHow do we talk about them I Know like for example an indigenous Canadian have adopted the term first nation in Australia ... communities have refer have been referred to refer to themselves of that original um me in the United states have we really ever read up on a term\nThat even the wrong question to ask\n[laughter] um well no because there's you know we developed where we devoted an entire chapter to that very concept um about\nThe chapter titled that you know Indians can't agree on what to be called on and and that's not really true um but I understand that it's really sort of a perception\nIn the non native communities and it's been the topic of conversation for decades\nBut um you know we have the terms that really originate out of a sense of political correctness which really come out of the the post civil rights era\nWhen native concerns and issues really start to become more visible in the social landscape of the country so the term Native Americans emerges is to in order to distinguish between you know native\nPeople Indians and non Indians before that we were just Indians right I mean I I like I and Roxanne are both old enough\nTo have grown up in the era where we were just called Indians and\nYou know that's how my ancestors knew themselves after\nThe European on and so for some people that's stuff that has you know as\nA negative connotation um maybe for younger people um for me personally I'm used to it I it doesn't bother me\nUm I don't like the term Native American because it is\nHighlight the American part of being native\nAs so I'm like that's the central lives as um the\nReality of being an American citizen and personally um that doesn't work for me I'm a ... and the same with American Indians again it is it's centralized as the concept of Being American\nBut we send indigenous peoples for far longer obviously than\nAssociating them their own national names and they should be in my case I'm call bill um but you know we have over five hundred tried\nIn the United states that are federally recognized and\nThat means that the vast majority of them are really unknown to the general American public who\nIs really the average citizen probably\nCan only name maybe a\nHandful or or ten or so native nations you know the most popular ones like Cherokees have\nYou know even ladies and sue\nAnd maybe a couple of others but that leaves the vast majority which are really unrecognized by the average American so um so if I say on call bill people\nWould look at me and not know what the heck I'm Talking about and to break it down even further the in my case the call bill Confederate a tried is a is a confederation of twelve different bands nations and\nMy lineage within that is called the night so that's even more confusing so that's that's why there's you know so much a confusion about about how do we how do we talk about tribes and nations and even the word tribe has a whole a problematic association\nUm that is linked to the concept of inferiority of indigenous people\nBut I Want us to argue that to what we as American article only known indigenous American needed to do more than anything else to educate ourselves about\nThe uh you know myriad rich communities that exist today that have not been all wiped out despite what our textbooks out might imply look about 'em or something that I hadn't really realized what the math and that is\nIn North American continent became populated originally I'm you know the theory of the ... trade migration um that some scientists have put forward as an explanation for how these land became originally populated why is that um ...\nWell it's a mess because it's only a theory I mean you know we some ... ... it's one of those things where you know if you tell a story over and over and over again enough\nTimes it becomes truth right despite the fact that it really is only ever been a series there has never been any um substantial evidence like archaeological evidence to demonstrate that\nIt was really only an explanation and\nI'm as years go by with\nWith more archaeological evidence that emerges from\nPlaces very far away like South America for example it it does spells it breaks down that that theory as being\nUm really on viable of for example if we write about in the book they're finding evidence um you know like human remains in South America that the carbon dates for twenty two thousand years\nSo that really it it sort of troubles the whole bearing street theory\nUm got there was a story that came out a couple of a few weeks ago um that further eroded that theory and so I'm was we talk about in the book\nUm science is not immune to politics and that's what this comes down to you have a ... century of of anthropologists and other kinds of scientists who adhere to the series in the interests of\nAnd direct connection to the mile much more in the book for ticket ... thanks giving and as we

I kind of wanted to mention the essay 'cause I thought it would be a good introduction I'm too you know the idea of of being a millennial ... I I'm always worried that millennials don't know how to cook what can we do to get these millennials out their cooking\nThat's a tough nut to crack I I don't have a I don't have the answer if I had the answer I Would run around I'm\nSpending my life on that but I don't um I feel like um we do to like to cook and spread that\nI'm joy with other people by helping teach them by sharing meals with them I always like to encourage my friends who don't cook a lot to learn how to make\nTheir favorite very favorite thing to eat and make it better than anybody else can um 'cause that's the thing you're most likely to cook and then if you can get some confidence in the kitchen um you might be in spreading your wings so\nI Do feel like a C I say as a really good um way to challenge yourself um but it does require that you cook a lot of meals at home [noise]\nUm is food events the way to reach people I'm not I'm not sure um I think flavor is the way I think I think learning how to make delicious flavorful food seems like like the best way to ...\nJust rama noodles that you make 'em you\nKind of gotten fired didn't even Japan to do a noodle lose until maybe you could talk about the kind of fun that you've had I'm spending noodles done to lose in in what it what what it was like [laughter]\nYeah so um [noise] this is this ... based in Portland and we do fresh organic Iran and noodles uh we use\nWheat and also a whole grain local barley flour and um [noise] so you know it's hard to get those are pretty familiar to a lot of people they if\nThey bought a really cheap packs for um [noise] but a fresh noodle is a little bit less familiar and I'm In is Scott just an amazing texture to it because it's a fresh noodle\nAnd I think because we're using this whole grain barley it's got a lot of flavor so you know part of our\nUm part of a thing that we need to do is give it to people a chance to taste it and also imagine ways to use it beyond the you know Roman soup um\nAnd in Japan they do eat Robin in the summer it's a dish called ... it's like a really delicious me so sesame cold noodle salad um\nBut separately they have something called ... and it means like flowing so mad noodles and it's this water slide that people build to shoot so men noodle sound summoned for those who aren't familiar is a very thin wheat\nNoodle and it's typically eaten cold it can be eaten hot but and it you know it would be something they would sort of an ice cubes in the summer like really refreshing\nSummer evening dinner and they they shoot it down a cold water\nOr slides and then people catch them with their chopsticks it's a good way for kids\nReally good practice um and you can go to restaurants and have it\nYou can do at your own home kids who are in school and so I had thought oh man we should do that with our new to our Raman noodles and um they're gonna be easier to catch cars are bigger which is good and they're great cold which people do think about very often we could set it up at the farmer's market where we have a boost 'em and really get people to interact with\nThe noodles and so the farmers market corn farmers market um was totally excited about it and they offered to um you know five I teach them all the different vendors at the market and set up a station and I said I'd make a bunch of stuff and we split my friend on a split a ten foot bamboo\nPole piece by quite large around and half and we built\nA twenty foot long water aside\nFrom it and you know send water down it and for several hours at the farmer's market we sat down our immune rama noodles and kids and adults like Koch them and don't worry listeners we made sure it was sanitary we're very careful\nAnd then make attach their noodles and take their bowl of noodles and ... sauce and tons of veterans from the farmer's market and and eat noodles they're so that was something that we did\nAs a way to get the word but also in kids and give people some new ideas about how to use ... [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] you know I I Am so curious too about the Asian nation of America and I know that you've looked into it a lot and certainly we know that there's ... ... ...\nLove the food like you how much you loved Roman wanted you to make a real Japanese Roman certainly they play the healthiest people in the world are in Japan and I wondered if you might comment on that\n[noise] yeah I mean I think that there is still a lot of room for delicious um\nFood from across Asia to enter more into the U.S market um an inch grocery stores I feel like as a fresh noodle\nIn you know stores in Oregon and Washington I see how few other fresh noodles are there and that you know a lot of the items that I Love to eat are an Asian markets but they're not necessarily in other stores\nRight here on W E s you hey it's homegrown you want some [noise]\n\nJones in for something different and sports talk radio tired of being talked at\nCravings solid intellectual discourse\nWell we can't guarantee that\nBut we can guarantee you won't hear the same old tired takes that those other shows tried upon off on you and there'll be no gravelly voice weirdos telling you what you should think around here either just random using on almost every sport under the sun was shining in on whatever whenever this is what sports\nAnd beyond W E s U Middletown or good afternoon sports fans\nAre your host Steve asked with what sports and beyond\nA we've got an action packed show for you today\nAre going to get right into it very quickly with some I'm a baseball I'm using them will go right into west sports and then we have a great interview with uh the west Wesleyan tennis coach Mike fried and his assistant Ben Shapiro\nUm and that's a an inside that interview I won't tell you exactly where but I'm coach fried actually breaks down collegiate scoring in team tennis and uh you will be amazed\nShow first baseball I Want to start off with a\nInteresting item I found\nOn um ESPN a description of ... [noise] uh this is by Peter Keating\n[noise] um and it says a last November ... role to three hundred game in the PBA\nOr so [laughter] we're dealing with a very interesting person and move the bats um and then the article goes on to describe\nHow the red Sox have changed their approach with their new manager Alex Cora and of course they're facing the Yankees later tonight tied not at at one game each in a best of five series\nUh with the uh\nThe manager of the Yankees is also a risky manager a baboon\nUm the red Sox ranked fourth in the American league in walks but scored just four point five four point eight five runs for game six best in the A. L. back in two thousand Seventeen\nHe was basically because they're a hundred and sixty eight home runs rank dead last in the league and if you recall or this year or the Yankees that a new record for team home runs in one season almost a hundred better I think to sixty seven is their number\nSo one hundred home runs better than the red Sox did last year\nOr the owner of the red Sox John Henry trace the clubs power drop to passivity and by traced it back\nI Want to\nHere that Boston has been saturated with that heads for years but saber metrics insights about plate discipline didn't do the organization any good until this year [noise]\nBoston better swung it just sixty two percent of pitches in the strikes on last year last season the lowest percentage of any\nMajor league baseball team according to fan graphs so if you think about it if a thirty eight percent of the pictures that are in the strikes on of all of them are called strikes that's a lot of pictures to be taking 'em\nAnd if you look at the John Carlos ... approach to the ...\nIt's a strikes are that are pitched to him in fact I think most pitchers just decided to throw it right down the middle every time he comes up to the plate to get into getting behind an account [noise]\nUm so what they did about this and I'm a Alex Cora got on it with his new patting coach shut Tim hires [noise]\nWas um decided that that to have these guys ready to do damage early in the count and that's not\nA easy to say the least\nIdeally apt to swing hard but only at pictures that you can actually hit so it's better known as disciplined aggression which is the title of this article by Peter King of the power of discipline aggression\nA Red Sox have swung at the first pitch only Twenty one percent of their two thousand Seventeen plate appearances\nAre versus the league average of twenty eight percent so that is ah\nThe league average is thirty three percent higher than what the Red Sox for doing this season they're up to twenty seven percent which is just within a ... percent of the league average so they've uh\nThey're swinging more at first pitches [noise] which I'm probably if John Carlos Stanton was on their team he either despite his fifty nine home runs last year\nHe'd either be told to start swing at first pitches or he'd be benched\nUm overall Boston ... sixty eight percent of strikes this season jumping up to eleven ties and baseball\nAnd a wall swinging hardly get any more bad pitches and while maintaining a high contact the rate of eighty percent which is second in ...\nWhich is to swing it strikes in swing often not wait to get behind in the cow [noise]\nUm games are on right now he's you hadn't noticed\nYeah the Astros in Cleveland or in the late innings and\n\nThat game is tied in a seven\n\nI just got tied 'em so that could go into extra innings and um\nThose runs that have been scored of all for runs too too is the score had been scored singly indifferent innings\nUm I Want to point out because I'm\nAs Colorado was going down in flames\nA earlier this week uh there was a um [noise]\nJeeze how shall I put this ... um\nThe announcers pointed out that\nThe Iraqis had only scored in one of the twenty eight innings that they played against the Dodgers and why twenty eight well who was nine inning games you'd expect him to only\nNot scoring twenty seven innings but ah they tied a one game with she runs in the ninth inning only to be beaten the tenth inning so [noise] I did a little digging on all the post season or stuff that's been going on including the um non\nPost season postseason games game one sixty three's\nA four divisional champs a that a Milwaukee\nA what I did a\nWas a look deep and see in all the games have been played since games one sixty three last October first\nAnd today who was not scoring and amazingly all the teams that aren't scoring are losing [noise] and you say well that's pretty obvious but I'm Talking about\nHow many innings ... out of in other words if one team scores into different innings and the other's team scores in three innings\nOr the team that scoring in more different innings is likely to be the winner and in this in the case of postseason play has been the winter in every single game and these these have been close a\nYou know a Boston lost\nTo the Yankees while not scoring and seven of the nine innings Yankees didn't score and six of the nine innings the day before the Yankees scored in six of the nine innings but they lost when Boston\nScored didn't score in six of eight innings so they actually they both scored in three innings\nBut a Boston scored more runs so um\nIt's an interesting thing to to a track is how many scoreless innings\nUm can be put up because uh those are innings you just didn't make any progress towards a win and what I find interesting is um it probably means that some of these teams that are in the postseason have some very very good pictures\n\nWith that uh will just point out that the before my show ends today uh the LA Atlanta game\nDay since may ... you can choose to\nI'm interviewing the tennis coach at Wesleyan a coach Mike fried at his assistant coach Ben\nOr work backwards from your\nChange your ear because it's been pretty illustrious or\nA you started you picked up is kind of like a an interim coach and then became the head coach almost immediately\nUh actually I'm even prior to to\nDiving is an interim coach or was partially involved as a volunteer assistant coach um\nAnd that's how I got I got my foot in the door and came to um start working even a little bit with the teams here and\nI'm kinda fall in love with the school in the ... than the processes\nI'm kind of how you describe them in\nA while I noticed that the back in uh I don't know what's your first full season two thousand Thirteen fourteen you were\nHonored by your coaching ... coach of the year that must be pretty exciting for ya\nBeginners luck [laughter] well\nThat's the way to put it but you know as I look through the years\nIt seems like I don't think you pulled the a double whammy yet but you know\nLast year the women had their best year ever the year before that and the men had their best year ever you keep setting the bar higher and higher and um\nAnd I wonder how you know\nI mean you've had to ... years and this year it looks like it's going to be another really good year for the women and maybe a pretty good here for the men as well um\nYou know what do you attribute that to say just good recruiting or is it word of mouth from the the players are hearing you just lost a huge strong\nWhich is probably a\nSeven hard um while while we mentioned her she had\nA phenomenal college career right\nSingles champ what four times first first in history right and a\nKnow she's doing now she graduated um I've actually texting back and forth with her as we speak right now she's\nShe lost a tough three set battle to a girl is ranked about three hundred and fifty in the world I'm\nIn her\n... month or so in fact I'm\nFunctional faster so it is possible for division three players to move up a intend to the pro ranks I think\nShe is you know\nGoing to be the poster child for that may be I think that that this guy named ... who actually played college attendance that Davis adults us University in Minnesota that went on to be stopped tend toward their top top down in the world in del ...\nAnd he in fact you're forced to travel but I'm new to this um you know one of the very short list\nAlready very successful professional tennis post coming in and the three system\nThat reminds me Ben are you were involved in coaching I'm Sammy last year\nJay sharing right yeah yeah and she graduated and she was pretty much nationally ranked or four years you're wasn't she yeah do you know what she's doing\nA I Believe for Clinton was also to to kind of base herself in the U.S and\nCoach while also kind of pursuing a professional\nCareer I I don't think that there's quite an extensive a a network of\nSquash tournaments not like you can make a lot of money at it\nKnow [laughter]\nBut um I think that definitely definitely her plan and and that's what she's pursuing [noise]\nFrom the reason I was gonna ask you this was to find out she like\nType a fulltime job I was going to grad school or what not and I want to get back to your full time job before you started coaching which raised a ten years or as a a\nA trigger an asset manager on Wall street\nI I got to think that you play tennis while you're doing that or maybe a did you like\nI'm just let me ask as just tennis\nTennis rank the weight golf does ... as as a a as a businessman sport\nYeah I think a lot of ways it does I mean you know the the combination of being um\nYou know look there's still some remnants and and\nVery very happily you know\nIt's expanded well beyond you know it's cliched roots as a as a country club kind of sport you know tennis and golf um\nBut at the same time you know with the two sports have similarities and the sense that there to support that you can play\nWell into later life and that you know you have people playing in their eighties and nineties\nRecreationally and sometimes even competitively in both those sports and so um the relationships and the ability to kind of you know use that across social borders and and you know corporate networking is clearly a a real thing yeah well in the case of of of golf\nOr you can\nUse plenty of time for talking between child [laughter] you know and and uh and plenty of privacy you know I'm In tennis usually have that that time in the locker room after the match or or maybe you know you decide to\nExtend the day go out for lunch or dinner or whatever and the same thing with racket ball um I play racket ball when I was in business and ah [noise]\nAh found that you know people that wanted to play racket ball with me\nAlso want to sell quip into my company [laughter] so uh you\nKnow you have to kind of balance that and and and use that time wisely but uh\nSince coaching now and have a I got to think that you've had a pure game so to speak or to to be an effective coaches I'm sure you have to go out there and show them what what you want them to do at times and and be very demonstrative about that\nThey're at and both you guys were cutting the guys like rank number one in college I mean ... on your team a seat at what do you call that one seat\nA\nYeah I mean I think we both work and difference being Benz was within the last several decades [laughter]\n\nOkay um\nI as I was reading through your your a vial online\nFor those of you listening we're listening to W. E. S. U. F. M. dot O. R. G. uh that's you're in Middletown it's the voice of was leaning in the middle town community\nAnd I urge you to go up to athletics at Wesleyan\nA dot edu that isn't the exact a URL for it but if you go to Wesleyan dot edu you'll find somewhere to click on athletics\nAnd then all the sports are there there's profiles of players and coaches there's the schedules that tells you what's going to be televised on the Internet\nIt's it's a they don't televise much time do\nWe actually you know with the new court project that was completed last year um we have cameras on of course and actually live stream every home match right and that way too soon in a from a foreign see what's going on\nSo why look on line I don't want I only see these big tournaments here they're everywhere I don't mean I I haven't noticed home matches all that much but you do have ... the\nMajority of our whole matches up all of our dual matches in the spring so far just tournaments and we're in the process we can hopefully next year will begin to host some of these settlements um but for the most part our goal matches or in the spring and therefore a whole matches or exclusively in the spring and I'm\n... now we can stream them all\nGreat that's great news um if you don't know what we're talking about here when you go onto the schedule and you pick a date and hopefully it'll be the date that it actually is like today's day and you look these for sport and you say oh well I Want to go see it\nPer se but on the Internet and you can watch that free of charge and um\nI Wish they would figure out a way to put that on a who stands TV screen some of the games\n... you know like I bring that up with a D maybe agar that up [noise]\nSo I Want to talk to just jump rope review Cuba and we don't want to\nIgnore you over here um\nYou have and I know this from my experience of meeting you in a deal is peak horses are you\nAre a\nPre top notch academia from what I understand [noise]\nI remember in the writing class that we were in\nI can remember what you wrote about and it's well over a year in the past right I can remember your topic about writing about a\nA tennis players and uh\nThe feelings that came up for you or do you see that in any of the new freshman\nThis year yeah absolutely I think every\nEvery crop of freshmen there's going to be some similarities and some differences and\nUh yeah I mean I wrote about kind of the charges adjusted adjusting to a new environment and that's [noise] you know every year you see that um\nYou know and it's always different\nYou know our freshman that are coming from as far away Hong Kong or Norway is going to be a little bit different than the experience of\nBecause obviously there was familiar ... bad they brought together a little bit in high school and junior kennel 'em and they worked they want to play with each other and now they're you know they've won the two towers they play together including the ... and on their way to you know to the national you know the last what the heck we can't bring about now\nI see yeah so let's talk about that for the men too because um\nYou got a Oregonian\nOr on your team think I'm and I'm from Portland was oh\nSo I'm I'm always rooting for him um\nAnd you match them up with swing right now yes and uh they're not doing too bad\nI thought to myself okay so you want to have if I'm uh\nHere's separated by grade level pickup partner yeah because you're going to both graduated the same time they're going to do for years to play together if your freshman itself is is that the ... you have with Sweeney and single men if they sit together they stay together for three years\nI Wish I could claim that level of uh advance thinking um although it's it's a\nYou know it it's the\nOr is it like do you see them\nAnd say the first and second players are going to be the partners and the third and fourth yeah second part is\nYou know the nature of doubles is such that it's very different from singles and it's ... it's mildly unusual that the best singles players are also the vegetables players and vice versa so or picked at the beginning of each year you know with the with with the roster that we have\nIs to try and find you know the best complimentary skill set right on the ... and you know the next level that do complementary personality so obviously that was a lot about chemistry\nUm personality wise and energy levels on the tennis court and we start by you know putting together the teams we think might jealous of the best and more than not you know before we get to the spring season we're doing multiple variations of mystery and matching to try and find the best kind of\nYou to write I just kind of almost like\nIn baseball finding the right line of you know\nA lack of you just just written a story\nYou this morning about the um\nThe the cubs and uh the and the Joe ... is the manager of the cats\nYelling about how they are right right right right exactly yeah it's free does a predisposition\nTowards changing the the the roster changing the wind up on a on a regular basis and the pros and cons to that and\nYeah it's very similar and we don't do a whole lot of movement wants to single line up you know kind of dabble she fell through competition\nWe don't move too much of that around but yeah we spend\nNow um she got tennis which is a fall and spring season\nThe two thousand Eighteen thousand writing season it's all you want to I went on line\nA job for the rankings the check 'em because I I\nFirst I think what I did was I went to the wrong rank I I think I went to the top ranking which was like October yes I didn't realize because\nYou know most people think and the top is the most recent\nYet and it's not you got to go down to the bottom of the rings I took October ... who you were a third and the women and I go he says they were ranked is\nThat you know you get like downplaying hung\nAround down as a\nThen I finally figured it out that yeah it's a it's a\nFull school years and I think crew has that as well\nAs maybe cross country has both a tragedy deal I can feel maybe as yet but they're really only as far as I Know in in ... but I think two or three in that way or that have multiple\nThe squash doesn't play till the spring winter winter weather you\nUm let's see what else they have on tap your\nRecovery where you just you know where's you just now\nTalked a little bit of a a Bush and Henderson I guess it was Bush in ... uh that was injured yet slightly injured [noise]\nUm oh yeah\nA little I checked after the first true I mean you guys had this year\nAnd to see\nBecause it does seem\nThat one as well so yeah yeah yeah and I I check in and go [noise]\nWhat's up with a scoring scoring as wrong\nSo explain to me why\nCollegiate women's tennis and isn't just division three or is it all divisions that has this um\nWas it one full set of\nFact by six singles matches\nAnd that was matches are competing just to an Eighteen pro se so is the first team to eight\nAnd then the singles matches or two out of three sets\nSometimes and tournament format that condensed it doubles can be shrunk down to just the single six games that\nDivision one tennis is played where ... is just a single six games that sometimes in fact turn on the up and no wide scoring as opposed to regular scoring sometimes instead of playing with a third that if they're split that that that was called to protect breaker\nAnd then the primary difference between there was one of those ... that is the same format\nIn terms of three levels fall but pick singles and division one of those three levels matches or collectively worth one point\nThe sticks singles matches or each worth one point for a total of seven point\nA to the team running federal and the seven points is the team winner and a division three the three levels matches counts that probably\nFor at one point each\nAnd then the six singles that's one point for pull up nine possible points so the team that won five of the nine points when so it's a little bit more of an emphasis on doubles and division three tests as opposed to it was more\nUm glazed over [laughter] I think that's what people say no no no it's it's more common you know you still when you watch when you watch tennis on TV and\nI I follow\nGolf because they actually do golf now and then\nUm I was in a league and every other week we had some kind\nWeird [laughter]\nThe game you're playing you know single angle bongo\nWhite and blue like how does that mean you know poker night dice clay you know\nThen I go for ... to ... the writer commercials oh God I got to find you know and so I guess what\nI'd probably take that little piece and I'll make a robot out of that\nJust for for tennis and you can play it\nWe scorched as usual I made it way more complicated than it actually is to me well I I think to\nThe point is you know you're going to ... and and they play\nBest out of three ... show\nAnd it's in it and it sets are six games\nKnow Wimbledon is actually the last uh\nLast tournament I think that there's still put through to ... really yeah\nBut everywhere else is two or three although aren't aren't a lot of eating grand plans now playing super breakfast for the third set in doubles grand plans are plentiful there playing with that but the main tour events which makes up the bulk of the year yet she said it was for a new ad scoring in a stupor breaker so you know match\nWaste or the singles and then yeah yeah it's pretty quick\nAnd then the urgency that is always kind of tinkering and and and talking about\nChanging format to try and shorten matches a little bit that's the reason was won matches one from\nRegular sworn to no ads corn for making person to six games that the bubbles\nNo I'm not sure if it's the to\nMake it more spectator friendly but you know there's definitely been a an interest at the entry level I Level and the ita level to to make\nDo matches a little bit more acceptable and therefore you know shortening them from you know they can be\nFive six long from fall right yeah yeah 'cause you get in long points to have more points you can have three hour some of those matches into our levels matches and when\nShow um she did you win the little three this year yet\nYou know the window those two months to come up and strength yeah that's how much is it a adverse loans both in the spring and the you know the the Boston in the curse of ness cat tennis is and they can quote me on this too but I think again five\nOr six of eleven net ... tunes on both men and women thought All right from the top twelve in the country\nStrengthening were squash and I'm not mistaken\nYeah like it's like the powerhouse of of of these sports is right here

I'm\nFor this time just because it's been a lot of news about how women\nI'm Around recently which I'm sure you've heard of some kind of depressing news but before I say that let me say that the views expressed in this program or the views of the individual broadcaster do not necessarily reflect the views of Wesleyan University or the W E S U management further more uh you're listening to double\nAnd remember that we're having our record fair I'm On the fourteenth sets this Sunday yeah that's this Sunday eleven AM to for piano back I'm hauling Wesleyan campus um there'll be a promo about that at the end of the episode in case you want to know more\nBut now let's get to the politics so as I'm sure a lot of you are aware I'm\nBrett Kavanaugh Scott sworn in to the Supreme Court this week um because basically they'll go to like one one or two Congress people which struck um again this is my youth you don't have to have it but if you're like me and you're listening and this and you're like wow I'm really upset about this what can I Do because\nIt's really easy to feel powerless in the system right now especially the Democrat because ah the Democratic leaders are a lot less effective at pushing what they want than the Republican leaders are\nSo I made a little list of what you can do now after a capping off has been confirmed oh and let me just a acknowledged that today is somewhat significant\nUm as it is a national indigenous peoples today [noise] um and because we're going to be talking about women and sexual violence in the whole episode by the way\nThey trigger warning for a sexual violence and talk about that [noise]\nUm but I feel like we can't not talk about it um but as long as we're talking about that I should acknowledge the fact that sexual and said states is twice as likely among indigenous women as it is among other um [noise] I don't want to yeah among other ethnic group um\nAnd one in three women a foot in three indigenous I'm an American Indian women will be actually a tall assaulted or\nSomeone will attempt to sexually assault them in their lifetime higher than any other group [noise] I'm In the reason for that is because of ongoing similar colonialism and ongoing subtler patriarchy um because kind of because it is mostly white men um\nSo um yeah I just want to acknowledge that indefinitely as we're talking about all of the issues that affect women um all these issues affect\nPoor women and women of color and trans women um\nAnd other you know a more than they affect kind of upper class white women which is what I Am and what a lot of the people whose voices are loudest in this movement or we need to remember who's actually at the front and\nSo it was that being said what what can you do now so the first big thing um would have talked about before is definitely voting so our system of choosing Supreme Court justice is very strange that they are there for life [noise]\nUm so the only really way to get rid of capping off is to teach him and we can impeach him because we he lied under oath and Clarence Thomas I'm also sexual predator also lied under oath\nSo if we can flip the house and Senate um we could basically impeach them and we can maybe even teach the the guy in the oval office who also has lied under oath who is also a sexual predator [noise] so but we can't do that must be flip\nThe congressman said it which means you have to go out and vote listener if you are a resident of Connecticut go out and vote if you are living in Connecticut right now in a resident of somewhere else go out and vote\nAnd if you're like oh I Can't because I have worked on Tuesday I Can't get to the polls or I don't feel like I have the proper ID and go to head start dot org um you can go to rock the boat dot com you can go to vote dot org those are great resources you can look up the league of women voters\nBut also if getting to the actual polling place to the main problem absentee vote you can go to the tea vote on I mean that's the name of the website has a more complicated you are out that the officials voting for Connecticut and get an absentee ballot you have to get her quest for an absentee ballot I'm printing mine out today\nOffer Massachusetts um you mail it out and then\nYou can get an absentee ballot and send that and and so that's actually the easy\nPolling place on Wesleyan University campus um I'm sure there are other local polling places on the actual day I'm In November So definitely please please go out there and vote get educated on the issues get educated on the candidates\nThis is so important [noise] um and if you and if you already are planning on voting and he's very set in your absentee ballot 'cause you're\nYou know on on top of your game or if you can't vote because of your age or documented\nAnd you can still try to make more of a difference at the polls in November suspect um by encouraging turnout I'm with family and friends just talk about it make it\nMake it an or make it weird to not vote Middletown actually has a really good turnout to keep that up and if you're someone who tournaments and you don't live in Middletown\nPlease please vote and encourage your other family and friends to you and it doesn't have to be a super formal thing but just talking about it made me aware making it an issue will really help and letting people know that even if they can't make it to the polls on the day us because\nIt can be really hard that there are still other option um if you can get to a library you can access a printer and print out your absentee ballot I Know that at Wesleyan University there are people who handout um\nSo I think a lot of this people are going to travel state lines especially people with means but a lot of women are just going to order these pills on line which is technically illegal but very hard to prove or just get them over the counter again this is\nStill terrible it's still much safer to um go to a clinic but if there are no clinics people are going to resort to what\nUm they want to resort to and it's better to know that these options are out there than to resort to something incredibly dangerous or desperate like doing something very physical to yourself as opposed to taking these pills um we also have to fight against crisis pregnancy center which are places that are look\nLike they are abortion clinic and they are actually not there to kind of trick women and to not getting abortions 'em and they were recently protected by a Supreme Court ruling and continue to be\nDishonest and there's nothing wrong I think what's centers were there for women who don't want abortions who want to talk about their options but there is something wrong about lying and trying to trick people um to fight against them in your own communities I [noise]\nUnfortunately I Know there's one in my home town but that is not helpful to you guys um but if you look up a narrow Connecticut they have a whole piece on crisis pregnancy centers what they are why they're bad which ones are around you and how you can fight against them so that's an incredibly important part of the fight\nI'm also fight also we're talking about abortion rights nationwide being taken away but in a lot of individual states abortion rights\nPretty much had been taken away and that there are several states where there's huge states geographically where there's only one clinics that people have to take entire days or weeks off work people have to go on a plane on and in that case a lot of women it's not worth it [noise] um some of those women just don't get abortions on\nAnti Muslim in order mail order drugs and some of those women\nOr drive the entire way but what we need to do is not just focus on this right on this refusal writes in the future but the places in America in the United states\nWhere it's almost impossible to get an abortion now and fight for those uh those spaces as well um it's about also involves donating to Planned Parenthood to neighbor all which is the national\nOh God I don't remember it stand for and it's an A R A L [noise] um and also not just donating to Planned Parenthood in general are narrow in general or I think local organizing is very important\nBut local abortion rights you're are much more secure than abortion rights in Wyoming or in the Dakotas or in Mississippi so if you can donate it to the Planned Parenthood funds of those dates\n'em or the ... the state for other reproductive rights organization is going to actually be even more effective that's going to help women on the ground now um you can also at a Connecticut and they really can become a clinic escort um which helps women\nOr go to and from the clinic um\nTo avoid being harassed by anti abortion\nI'm grateful for all the people who help out\nOn if you had an abortion or and you feel comfortable and you feel safe doing this I Want to predict with that but just sharing your story and getting rid of the stigma I think really helps um a lot of people realize that this the thing that is not a monstrous thing that is not\nA disgusting or shameful thing but this was just a medical procedure that a lot of women and non women um have until I think this during those stories and even if you don't have one of those stories to fight against that kind of stigma is incredibly powerful\nI'm an even working for an abortion providing office like narrowly Planned Parenthood in like being there plumber writing their Web sites a lot of people are scared to work for a place like a Planned Parenthood because they're scared of the pushback but um\nThat can actually be a lot of help to to kind of offer the services and finally just continue to vote so locally so come vote on the helm level that's what's going to affect local clinics but on the state level 'cause that's what's going to affect state laws and vote on the national level because that's the only way we're going to get rid of the some of these people\nSo [laughter] those are hopefully helpful tips I Hope that made you feel a little less terrible about the current political state um [noise] so that's what I have I Hope you appreciate it and I hope you get you get fired up and you take action to protect\nWomen but also all people All right we're going to sign up with another ... as long as the queen from her album electric lady a hope you enjoy your night\n\n[noise] [laughter]\nI can say about that\nThen say and then they can be and then they let\nDown and we just gang\nThe fact that they be like\nThen we
