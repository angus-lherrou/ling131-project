Eighteen fifty to him it wasn't Eighteen fifty two there wasn't a war that's not a piece of paper and that's your nose\nBut that doesn't explain why there was a pencil of it\nYou know students here on campus I been taking a lot of classes so I'm told I did see them wearing backpacks I presume there's textbook inside them and not Iraq I don't know\nMaybe there's candy inside them who knows but I assume their textbooks inside of them and what that means they're taking lots of classes of course he's classes or courses are can be various some can be easier than others some can be hard and so I'm going to\nBe happening or but\nSome fascinating courses here on campus and we'd like to tell you more about them but I don't have the program of courses in front of me right now so I'll just have to see if I can remember a few of them we'll see if I can remember them\nI Believe there was a um well there was a you know of course there are a lot of our classes here on campus\nBut er and one of them is\nWhere all they do a draw a bath in fact they just draw bath tub and various shapes sizes and um my first question was do the bath tub wear trousers or are they new to\n'em because of course this could be quite a quite a sight to see if they are in fact Newt Baptist hubs on display\nBut ah the programs are not the guy the nuts but it has to find this so I'll have to use them for the

it and they will even teach you the proper way to spend the professor in fact is a piece of that\nHe um he should know and um he has many years of experience and it is a fascinating chorus and I believe seats are filling up south so you may want to apply that if it doesn't already filled\nI'm of course you probably should not never mind\nAnother chorus I was absolutely I'm In ... indulging in fascinating and it was a variety was a class\nOn\nWhat was that again now I gotta get I don't have the book in front of me so I have to remember the exact title of the the vernacular the course I Believe it was\nUm it was an introduction to window sill I'm now of course people need introductions to window sills you can't just uh you know meet at a party or social\nAt Wesleyan fair weather back

hand\nWashing and running into his skin he opened his eyes as you mentioned was a great wing of the equal pouring wet lightness over him some kind of adopted them some kind of blessing he thought everything is going to be All right ed\nKnowing that it was so close to I think back in the break was sleep\n[noise] good evening to W. yet you point one Middletown this is mixed media um did you pick in the city\nDigital magnanimous and what was that a passage from back that image that was from Tula by Toni Morrison and do you want to give it splashes context before we moved on from wash\nSo we use that that context with little little chunk to introduce a theme for tonight which is\nSweeping mhm talking about sleeping while some people probably are asleep but not are loyal listenership who we hope to see a spike in tonight [laughter] due to a new advertising tactics um magnanimous how many hours of sleep you get\nFour and a half okay so I asked that because I kind of knew\n[laughter] because we are ... are category to shutter and are you having their belief [laughter] no I didn't hear you're going to sweep but you just mentioned something about having trouble yeah sweet so I imagine it was something of that in that realm I'm I'm curious you know I feel like if we're going to be talking about sleep tonight it must be getting the colors um\nI I I feel like we could introduce to before we get into you know where else were picking passages and images from for the evening um what how would you describe your logic around sleep or switch roll\nRight now right now in my life I feel\nDetached from sleep I Won it lasts a do it last\nBut also I feel like I also need it less because I'm a little lamb or I Know deep down that I Need it but there have been periods in my life and especially where I've been stressed out where I was just desired and now like more than anything I just cannot wait to go to sleep\nBut recently I get no sleep but there's so much going on and wearing around inside that I almost like it it's like less of a priority than it ever has been\nSo you feel like you're operating you're operating like almost at a higher level when they're getting less sleep\nOr I'm operating a higher level or fat or getting and getting less sleep\nBe more high functioning maybe I'm entering the phase where like five hours the\nTo me where I feel angry at my style really if I could do if I could stay up more I Wish\nCan you rephrase that [laughter] not because of all I Know that you're going to move on and it was it I I'm just when I Would like to yeah I'm just curious um if I like in the scenario is if I had any control\nI wished that I I could stay asleep that's my goal gut feeling on I'm reading I Wish that I could you ought to come to this but you know I actually have like really frustrating moments when I'm reading a book and I'm reading the same\nThree to like do it you're listening to the judge and like you got to read you a hundred like what's wrong with you but you know\nWhen you're watching book that you set up all my reading or some of some of 'em every whoa\nI I have to get back to you okay I Do remember I remember a lot of time in high school yeah staying up all night reading books totally um especially if they're like devastating or something you know he's like can't get out of it\nDoesn't really interest me 'cause I feel like now that we started out talking about college but there's something about high school where the big steel lower\nIf you pull in a letter because there's so many of\nThem are still many of all your days if that makes sense so many of the interactions you have it's like\nThese little chunks that are repeating\nFive days a week just all the time you know whereas in college you feel like you're getting like this sort of concentrated chunk and each day is sort of ... specific thing but night school is like a tiny variation learning yeah yeah yeah it's kind of nice to have that day when you're like oh I did some doing you know that made this red repetitive\nYeah life feel a little like that on your hands and whether it was even nicer if it's not academic right\nShort shrift to uh like like sculpture and in those mediums of murder [laughter] just for you\nI I had stayed up till it was final of my uh senior year falls senior year of high school\nAnd a fall semester and I had stayed up until I had woken up at eight and I started writing the ten page singles based paper that I had to write for history about architecture started at eight I finished at midnight\nNo that's not

this is Alice bottom altogether house bomb reviews directly I okay\nSo we're we just listened to about like six songs off of the new name album that was released about two weeks ago our location totally it was called room twenty five those were\nYou know six important track some of our favorite I don't know the continuity of or the story I guess about right felt like kind of what she wanted to get like the the main like a narrative she want to drive home we're kind of represented in that song individuals I think yeah at the at least what we take away from it um\nYeah so we are we listen to self followed by ... read the midnight and then a switch to ... and with you and then no damage to the final track of the album a few drinks and I don't\nKnow I thought that was really cool and just because it was I mean it's it's her name first\nWondering song at the beginning and then about like halfway through she starts wrapping interest like about\nI don't know that every life passing by and just a bunch of stuff yeah it was we were saying that as well as we were listening in the in the studio here but uh she she had the dinner fields absolutely yeah um what'd you think of the job ...\nWell I mean I I have a like a big big city for a NO NAME I think ever since a telephone came out I've just been ridiculous fan that really made that summer for me\nAnd the fall is not disappointment\nUm it's a super political album in some ways this very introspective I'm In her last album telephone she'd she'd talked a lot about herself and kind of like looking at her flaws in her strengths and her family\nUm but this one kind of goes a little further than that and kind of looks at the uh the communities I guess as well as the uh the systems that she's in a kind of how they've\nAh affected her and who she is you see that a lot\nWith a you know ... just some of the things she says she talks a lot about are\nThe ways in which hip hop is right now and what it takes to kind of be a superstar she's kind of found this uncanny start 'em in or doing something that no one's doing theory or spoken word type of a rap but I mean she just kinda tries to do something different and it's very fun to see she does this every time\nYou know she's been doing something different you know as we said earlier on the show if you weren't tuning in but one of her big influences the poetry that she read as a kid um parents owned a bookstore so I think she was she didn't love reading and the kid according to that same interview that you were referencing earlier but like\nA yeah exactly but er I don't know I guess it's the poetry definitely has an effect on songwriting and when you listen to know names lyrics so sort of a set in in in weird rhythmic patterns and and the I'm too pretty complex um and like sing song in a way so it's like an obvious that\nUp next we're going to play a song I think it was it was the first one I heard with NO NAME on it um it was by chance the rapper I don't know was it the first song you heard as well I'd imagine if one of the first\nEnlisted man I mean he was the biggest person I had heard her with right where I just I used to like before I knew who he was before she had it for for somebody to be like oh you know that the girl was on a bunch of kids size\nYeah but in in a bunch of like to read it didn't really know who she was yet but the damage issues yet but she was coming up soon I'm as we see yeah I I agree with everything you said ultimately with the album for sure and\nI liked it a overall it was good I thought it was pretty good he is but um [noise] we'll check out some of her other stuff\nYou yeah I uh your your buddy last\n\nMinute you know [noise] when I'm when I'm Tommy Tommy I'm

this group of people that we just made named all kind of take a very heavy lake so be type of uh influence in all their production so\nYeah I definitely see what you're saying there are allowing this\nOne is almost kind of reminiscent of her her's too\nNo I agree um it's sort of more like rhythmically like interesting and a lot of kind of stuff I think but you know more a little more alert deep then yeah that's true that's true and kind of introspective yeah that's fair in whatever way you know whatever and it's tough\nIt's been it has been very tough out here a rough couple of years from a man's um yeah I mean he's been doing fine but I mean I guess I'm just trying to deal with it yet [laughter] he's been doing just fine maybe that's the problem I have no idea what ever\nUm so yeah tonight we're featuring a mostly room twenty five or NO NAME new album or you want to dance\nThat's at all so you're just going to have to wing it yeah random and I'm thinking that\nLast week to maybe should be consistent thing but uh yeah so I mean I'd say that for me\nThis album is it better than telephone her last album I agree I don't know I'd just the shock value of that one really got to me and like it it kind of I just sit there every song and like constantly my life a little bit you know um stuff like this one I'd give it a given about an eight point too that's my that's pretty high man that's pretty dramatic but All right\nWhat did what did you get telephone or what would you give what what did you leave the executives hot okay cool cool cool that's good to know\nJust for to get my bearings ... um yeah I Would I mean this was really good I think it was the first actual out I think telephone was like a mixtape or whatever kind of self released or whatever like something something like that no it's cool like totally valid but I think it was and it was like a studio album and you can kinda tell that it's like\nA much more tweaked and like she thought about it and like yeah I Would give it like\nA seven five I think okay I thought you were given a more praise but not I mean it was really good album I just like I definitely got telephone was better and I don't think this was like the outcome of the year and I feel like\nWhere I feel like giving how I don't know ... different scoring yeah [laughter] that's all is where we're at the um yeah so what are we gonna so up next we have a church liquor store buy a\n... debut album bucket list projects and the teacher you know name of course and then off of no names I'm guessing mix tape now a telephone we're going to

[noise]\nRight we have been um loaded into before Trump especially loaded into his sense of full security dot\nThe ear off overt racism racial resentment by whites against people of color is ... that was a thing of the past\nThe just the history books and then of course the shock of Trump's rise um brought that old back and now we see the ... forces never went away they were on some ... they've come out into the open they've been emboldened 'em and\nMy introduction to the idea\nThat a majority minority country meaning a majority a country that will very soon be a majority people of color in states like California or old ready whites are a minority or they're not a plurality I should say\nOr the ... of the nation that do you being set up to have largely white rule but it doesn't have to be this way how do did you screwed the past year and a half under Trump rules\nWhich has turned out to be worse than any of us could have imagined how did you fight cynicism\n[noise] yeah I mean I think a big part of why I was moved to write this book is that immediately after the election I feel like we were just sort of inundated with a lot of of narratives and in headlines and a lot of news stories are all about how we have never been more divided as a country\nAh and obviously there had been as you mentioned this resurgence of really blatant racism but you know obviously that that kind of racism is is a you know institutional it runs team and the fact is that we right now are\nAre much more divided than ever there was a small contingent of extremists that much it's true\nBut I think it's being blown out of proportion because the media is perpetuating this this story that we've never been more divided I and and what I came to discover after doing a lot of research and a lot of writing a lot of interviewing is that there is a divide that's occurring right now but the divide is not between uh\nYou know the majority of Americans are defined as between American but the larger divide at play right now but it's more important is the divide between what the majority of Americans want\nAnd what a handful of extremist in power\nAre offering um and so I think into this into this cabinet power we're seeing we're starting to see some really encouraging thing which is with me\nAnd what's interesting to me is that neither people who are ... there there are campaigning unapologetically a about um who they are or how their identity impacted their experience with America\nAnd how and and how they're going to address really straightforward issues that uh the majority of Americans are concerned about whether it's access to health care education a really basic things that the majority of Americans can get behind and yet what we still see what you're so frustrating ah in this\nOngoing reaction in the media that oh my God what an upset that these people are winning it totally unexpected\nAnd in reality I think it's the least surprising thing in the world we're just seeing people who are finally speaking to a the needs and desires majority of Americans ...\nWell you brought up Andrew Gillum in Florida he um is the first to black nominee for governor eat an of a major party in Florida history the day after he won that primary race to the pool and\nRon dissented went on the media and said things like he was an articulate spokesperson which is sort of a backhanded racist complement\nAnd then I went this far as paying the last thing we need to do is to monkey ... up by trying to embrace the socialist agenda which huge tax increases on bankrupting the state by for a white man to the monkey this up about ...\nA black man you touch a treat for word\nUm read the term\nThat uh it seems as though Trump and his fellow Americans because not just Trump um are ... are using racism as their major\nAnd only platform campaign platform V. offer scapegoating people of color or white minority rule white supremacy versus\nIt seems like such a last gasp effort and a lot of ways uh the reality is as he mentioned that the direction this country is going in is a that we are increasingly a majority of a brown people immigrants\nAnd you know ... I feel like what we're seeing is the sort of last gasp of of people's grasping at this at this power\nAt holding on the edge of this minority tried to hold on to power\nAnd in reality when you look at the breakdown of Americans there there are ... thirty one to thirty two percent of Americans are white male ah so when you look at the constitution of of of who makes up America here we're talking about\nA round people immigrants queer people and then if you also include a white progressive allies we already are the majority so you know while I find this rate that dog whistling extremely problematic and disturbing\nI also feel like to be preoccupied with the notion that these people are are are going to have the power\nAnd and will inevitably continue to have the power is just simply not true what we need to do is continue to support candidates run for office also uh who who are\nSpeaking to the majority of Americans who are getting out the vote you know I think one of the\nOne of the best interviews I saw a\nAlexandria Ocasio Cortez after um her victory was uh on the late ... show and he he addressed it was like well how did you do it you know like the numbers the breakdown it had used so far behind how did you do it and she very matter of fact we said well you know when people talk about\nUh getting out the vote generally when polls are run\nWhat happens is they're pulling more light the likely voters right\nAnd she was like what we did is we just got out the vote among people who don't typically come out and vote and I\nThrough um headlines and you know circulated on Facebook and everywhere else ah go there a marker up with definitely going to happen I mean I think we saw in the presidential election uh that that clearly polls are failing us and the reason is that uh there's a large contingent of Americans who are not\nComing out to vote that we need to reach out to 'em and I feel like that that's that's where a lot of our focus\nNeeds to be now one of the president shall candidates who did um generate\nA incredible excitement among those people who don't ordinarily will vote is of course we're rock Obama and you also write in your book um\nThe marginalized majority how did you let Obama elections serve as a bomb and this was a really important part of the discussion of course because there's a reason why Trump was able to win the electoral college scraping through a win win he should have\nBasically been at the very bottom of the ... he shouldn't have even one of the Republican nomination and then he should have won the electoral college but Democrats and the establishment Democrats um beer a big part of the blame don't they because they have\nSimply been complacent and not really um prioritize the interest of a majority of Americans who are struggling with all those Americans or white or non white\nAbsolutely and I think I think what we're seeing now is uh that Americans are the majority of Americans what they want is just categorically far to the left\nOf what that was meant Democrats and Republicans an and I'm saying Democrats because that's important you know we're talking about how they're failing repeatedly to address uh\nWhat what sort of Americans want and so they they need to recognize that um that that in order to win which there's never been a larger opportunity than now to really cultivate voters to really um\nAnd literally to just eat straightforward truth we're seeing time and again and different ... elections that that is what is winning um so I I really hope that they they take him any that they don't the fact that the voters will will force them to a\nNew show in your book subtitle is claiming our power any post truth America I Want to address that issue of the post truth America because Trump\nUm if there's one thing he skill flat it's manipulating media coverage manipulating the narrative setting the agenda [noise] um so that would be what he wants to be discussed we'd be discussed\nUm and um he claims of fake news even as he has become the president to a few more lives than any other president in history\nUnfortunately are quite effective so all of these issues coming up\nUh that that Americans can have clarity over in terms of a common agenda et cetera\nCan still very easily fall prey to this scourge of really fake news right um and that's a big battle the battle over what reality itself is um which is how is new but of course it's an old battle because authoritarian regimes have always huge propaganda to make their case\n[laughter] and maybe even more so ...\nI have I Know and I don't think\n[noise]\nHi welcome to foods blues radio where we help you think beyond your plate I'm Melinda Hamel garden a registered dietitian\nAnd investigative nutritionist on a mission to connect the dots between food health and agriculture and find food truth\nAnd I am delighted today to welcome my guest ms Andrea Curtis\nIs an award winning writer and editor she's the author of multiple best selling books for adults and children I'm going to focus on one in particular for children that is sitting on my desk right now it's titled eat this\nHow fast food marketing gets you to buy junk and how to fight back\nWelcome this Curtis it's a pleasure to have you here thanks for having Linda\nWell you've done some very interesting work you've written a lot about women's health neighborhoods change\nYou have one multiple award for your writing you also have a program called word play where you help children with creative writing for grades six students there in Toronto and I love that you are\nBringing the world of creative writing and marketing and food system and media literacy and food literacy to an audience that is truly\nIn dire need for this kind of information so let me just ask you how did you come to the topic of food marketing and media literacy what made you write this book\nI think it probably started when I\nIt's the book travel the world looking at lunch boxes and trays and all the food that kids eat around the world for lunch and\nAs I researched it I began to realize how much marketing played a role in even those\nSchool lunches I was shocked for instance when I heard there were school cafeterias that had branded food yeah and restaurants within the school building and so it just made me realize how pervasive it is\nAnd I have two kids of my own and started looking at it\nAt their experience as well and realizing how much marketing they see in their daily lives\nSo I Love this topic of media literacy and marketing and raising children's awareness and I will tell our listeners but what's for lunch how school children eat around the world is another terrific book if we have time to touch on that we will\nBut in my particular experience I think your children are younger than mine how old are your boys\nThat are known Nineteen and fourteen\nSo mine are in their thirties and I remember when my son went to kindergarten I remember seeing a Pepsi calendar in the kindergarten classroom and I was shocked I thought what is she doing in the classroom you know and I ...\nI had a similar experience with my eldest when he was in kindergarten teacher wanted to do this project with the kids they're four and five\nTo do with sort of pre literacy project tell them that words appear all the time in their everyday lives and she asked them to identify symbols and words that they recognized and they did posters that lines the\nThe hallway of the school and I would say eighty five two Ninety five percent of the logos and words that they knew were fast food\nAnd even younger recognize these logos they can sing the jingles they know the spokes characters this is ubiquitous and you need to really important questions about that\nWell I Love the way you connect what is marketed to children and helping them raise awareness about the different techniques that are used\nBut you also connected to how is this particular food product not only affecting your health problems it's acting the planet because what I find and perhaps you do too is that children are almost universally in love with nature and it's\nTrue and I think set by helping them make the connection between how marketers want them to purchase foods that may not be in their best interest but certainly not in the best interest of the planet I think it might be a really good hook to help them say hey stop I don't want to buy into this\nAbsolutely I mean we've seen this with the straws campaign right now it's it's something that that people really see you know for better or for worse this has become of the\nTalk in the last little while around getting straws at of restaurants and it's a small thing perhaps but I think it's sort of people see it they they understand that that the waste involved really maybe can actually make a change in their daily lives\nRight well because I'm a dietitian much as my work focused on preventing childhood obesity and\nIt was a problem [noise] Thirty years ago when I was early in my practice and it is still a problem growing globally because of the marketing of fast food [noise] and I remember\nThinking at some point later in my career that\nWe really weren't getting very far telling kids to eat more vegetables and get more exercise that we really needed to\nWinding too and what is the age range that you would like for children to be exposed to this information\nThe book is written at a level where it would hopefully appeal to kids about nine to twelve\nMhm I've seen um teachers using it with older kids using it sort of as a bouncing off point\nFor bigger discussions more complex and depth discussions\nIt's very visual so my hope is that even younger kids will be engaged in it I think you're right that the the environment is a great way to get kids thinking about these issues\nI also think and this is how I wrote the book very much is that I don't think kids want to be do\nYou think if you talk to them about the kinds of strategies and techniques that marketers are using and essentially ruling them into doing something that is not in their best interest\nI think kids really respond to that\nThat's not fair [laughter] right I had\nOne teacher and I'd love to tell you a boat to what she's done with the book in her class but one of the things that she told me that the kids were shocked that\nProfit drives\nThese restaurants it's such an obvious thing when as an adult we know that\nBut these kids were shocked that marketers and corporations would tell them something that was either not entirely true or was glossed over the truth and try to convince them to do something that was actually unhealthy and not good for them or the world\nThey were surprised which I find kind of astonishing but also it's exciting because if kids can be given the tools and given the strategies and have those conversations and maybe real change can happen\nYeah I Hope so\nAnd I don't think children there is so vulnerable they want fairness\nAnd for them to see how they are being duped by people who simply want to make a profit off of them\nI think that is a great way to get them interested in the whole topic of media and marketing media literacy so do you go through some of the strategies that you expose and this book that kids might not be aware of\nYeah sure one of the things I think about when I talk about this is\nMy book is trying to give some broad strokes guidelines about how marketing works with fast food and beverage is but it's definitely not the definitive word on this writing this book\nI was constantly having to update it took a number of years as many books do and I found I was having to call the publisher we can't leave out poke him on go when a couple of summers ago nobody was talking about anything else\nSo the strategies change all the time this is one of the reasons marketing is so effective\nBecause marketers are really smart and changes all the time it's incredibly responsive\nBut I think in broad strokes I look at about ten different strategies that marketers use and some of them are older ones that have a new twist and some of them are new would you like me to sort of runs\nThrough though yeah let's not do that I'm sure sure so the first one is product placement and this is something that people are really\nFamiliar with its products appear and TV and movies and the companies paid for them to show up and it it looks like the character the actor is just drinking a soda athletic horse so to company paid for it to have it there\nAnd it's everywhere one of the newer places that it turns up is video games no NBA two K. which is a game that my own kids played\nEating a certain way but we're modeling something oh then we're teaching something else and she was not the reaction to her from the principal was not positive though there's a lot of peer pressure which in the schools to go along\nAnd but I think you hit the nail on the head it's the crux of this is that if in a part of our curriculum is to talk of boat to nutrition and and how to eat\nIn health fully and how to live helpfully and then we we have these mixed messages with the teachers night or whatever other fundraising initiatives that are associated with fast food marketing it it's it's really a very confusing story to kids\nRight yeah and and it goes back to that justice Pete like how is this fair or how was this making sense if you're telling me one thing\nBut were practicing something else I I Would think that for children's logical mind they would think that that was wrong ... well you have a resource list as well as strategies you know it's not like oh\nThese are all these negative things that are going on with regard to marketing and our kids\nBut you've got some great strategies for how to push back\nAs well as organizations that provide alternatives for example the center for science in the public interest for years\nHas provider alternative fundraising alternatives to the doughnuts and fast food things like you know selling plan selling seeds having some sort of service that you're providing where the school gets money but you're not treating children's house\nRight well I mean my whole thinking around this and in all my writing about food is that it's about a ... a food environment that we need to challenge and we need to do that and not just by saying no to marketing but by creating positive\nPlaces and environments where we can see what an alternative might look like I've been involved\nOld transformative it it can be for a child's relationship to what they eat the kids you know would never look at kale are\nBegging the teachers that they let them have more kale\nWhen we offer alternatives and really start to\nBuild and a different kind of food environment that's when we can see real change and it's partly it's about offering healthy options like there there's a a bit of a a move in Canada are trying to at least to have salad bars in school\nAnd they're they're seeing some really great uptake on that when it's sold to the kids in a really smart way school gardens of course can do that as well and and I think that talking to kids about\nThe media that they see is that another part of altering that who'd environment\nYeah well I Want to recommend not only the book but all so you've got a link to curriculum so for parents and teachers and anyone who was working with kids maybe three or four H. program or after school by a daycare setting\nI Know that you mentioned that the book was designed for students maybe you know nine to twelve\nBut I think that it's also perfect for teachers of children of all ages just to start planting seed about how they as teachers have been manipulated in the classroom to do things that aren't in the best interest of their kids\nYeah I think that's absolutely true and\nI Love to see teachers talking about this with kids I actually when I looked around at the media literacy literacy resources there weren't very many about food\nHe is and what creating media is with kids because\nThey know way more about this than we do you know there you are the ones getting bombarded even more than adults I think with these messages and given an opportunity hits really can break it down and understand\nRight and as much as children's lives are being dominated by digital media and you mentioned the YouTube\nI think that one of the important points you make in this book about media literacy is it's not just about taking media end it's also having the power to create media and I don't think that in any other time in history have we been better able to create our own media\nAbsolutely um this teacher that I mentioned earlier had the kids\nCreate their own marketing campaign for\nFruits and vegetables and she she actually offered the fruits and vegetables to them in ground paper bags and they had to choose them and they were kind of unusual for the for these kids there was a papaya in and in ... mushroom and you know\nHer purple potatoes and they had to create a campaign and they just did incredible stuff and really embrace\nTurning this on its head using the strategies they'd learned to promote healthy\nWell you know it's interesting I think one of the situations that parents get in as\nWe know what's best for our kids are we'd like to think we do and when we want to make a change like if we want to say\nYou know you're not going to be engaged with this particular video game where you were not going to have this particular item in the home there's also a concern that their kids will be labeled as being different and because kids as a math have been so bought up and what\nAnd to be able to turn this on their head and not be seen as outcasts\nYeah absolutely well I have a thought quite a lot in the last little while that we're actually going\nTo be in ten Fifteen maybe Twenty years we're going to be talking about fast food and sugary drinks in the same way we now talk about ...\n... um it may be too late for my own kids in that regard but I don't think you're going to be an outcast in twenty you're talking about this it's\nJust the evidence is mounting that crisis is clear and I think that people can't help but the come aware that that this\nIs food environment is is harming us\nAbsolutely we're gonna have to close on that note\nUnfortunately our time is up but I Want to thank our listeners for joining us I Want to remind everyone that flew through the radio is produced by Dan ... studios beautiful downtown Colombia\nAnd most of all I Want to thank my guest\nIs Andrea Curtis her website is W. W. W. dot Andrea Kurdish kids dot C. A. will provide a link to that a link to her book that we've been talking about\nIt is essentially a tool kit to fight fast food marketing to kids titled eat this how fast food marketing gets you to buy junk and how to fight back\nMitt Curtis thank you so much for this book your work and for being my guess\nYou point one ... W E s U Middletown\n[noise]\nOoh\nWe should say you're a\nA one no one\n...\nWhy God mommy [noise]\nBe in\nA no [noise]\nThink so um [noise]\nThey're ... and\n... yeah there\nIs such an\nObvious to bring about it and\nA lot stronger\nWe going to say\nAbout that no\nNo I'm fine\nWe want medication assisted recovery because that's what patients want that's what payers want\nAndy these entirely possible now\nEspecially for opioids specially for alcohol where there's a risk of overdose\nAnd a risk for ... it is a fact for medications or if the safest way and the most reliable way to protect the patient and reduced the presenting simply the substance use\nEven when medications are\nI Would advocate driving up getting insulin driving off as a treatment for diabetes you need to change your lifestyle you need to change your diet and we need to change your exercise and you need to self monitor and get the help of your family\nThat's what good addiction treatment does too it helps you change your lifestyle recognized triggers for relapse and be protected waste the medication while you're doing that\nTime I I wanted a just focus for a moment on another element of the important work that you've done on addiction\nAnd that's a developing tools for those clinicians who are engaged in working with patients on treating addiction to them to come to mind are the addiction to verity index or the ASA\nAnd the treatment services review the kids are ... are really quite widely used now in clinical settings\nSo maybe if you take a ... a little it's at four in the sudden there'd be special treatment domain and if it is what would you recommend in the primary care domain\nSo these instruments have a purpose they are not\nTo screen to see if there's presumptive evidence of a problem in fact it's now clear that you can get a presumptive idea of whether an individual adolescent or adult may have a substance ... problem with as few ask questions and it\nStill not widely enough years and the next thing you want to do is diagnose\nWhether there is a loss of control over their substance use that can be done with a diagnostic interview okay\nNow you've got a diagnosis next question is what are we going to do to prevent that picture and how you're a pair of yourself as a clinician and how you're going to prepare the patient to understand\nDo it in the context of the problems that may have preceded may have resulted from the substance ... typical life scenarios medical conditions\nEmployment legal family and psychiatric problems at the end of the forty minute interview a clinician and the patient bought a better understand how they got into this substance abuse problem and what other problems has to be addressed\nI foolishly thought\nThat the person with the worst substance use problem would also have the worst financial worst legal as well in the first sort of surprising finding\nIsn't that isn't true at all I think about it you know celebrities who have no problem with their employment and they've got an enormous substance use problem because we're ready to fail a building or another group ... addicted physicians who have\nAre often very serious rates of substance use but no other problems\nMeanwhile you can have an unemployed pregnant teenage girl who has a rather modest cocaine problem but he's going to be an awful lot more difficult to treat them very seriously addicted physician\nThe addiction severity index was designed to pair\nTreatment providers to address the often complex inter related problems that occur second thing was designed to do was to establish a baseline to ... what did these patients look like when they walk through the door to your treatment facility how bad are things recently in the last month\nSo that later you could reassess the patient and you could compare to see whether they're spending proved\nMost patients who enter substance abuse\nBetter they improve relative to wherever they were when they come in the door patients who get tailor treatments do better and again these are things that have been found with a search so his guided\nFits sinking I suppose uh to take it off simply focusing on substance use and begin to think about the whole package\nAnd it has led away from Trump dramatic care to more individualized tailored personalized\nTreatments as are now typical for other chronic illnesses\nWe're speaking today with Thomas McClellan founder of the treatment research Institute dedicated to science driven reform of treatment in policy and substance abuse time I was listening to you sort of walk through those numbers about\nThe size of the opioid crisis in America and we always keep our eye on what's happening in Washington in terms of how they're allocated money for this and also the policies that they're implementing President Obama and his former drug czar adopted her pretty aggressive approach\nIt seems to two thousand Seventeen things has slowed down tell us what's happening there in your prescription for what policy should be implemented\nI'm dismayed by federal policy towards addiction and fairness I don't think the Obama administration got it right either I think we moved further towards a view that addiction is a public health problem that it's best to draft with prevention\nEarly intervention and treatment\nAnd moved away from addiction is a criminal problem and needs to be punished and now I see you don't want any other way I'm trying to take a cold blooded what's going to work approach and the truth is that top national policies\nThe body needs

rights\nWhether immigrant workers documented or undocumented seek to hold crooked and exploit Tate of bosses accountable for wage theft\nAnd pay that are below the prevailing wage or we're just too many hours for too little pay and benefits\nAnd are subject to abusive treatment to their percentage such as sexual harassment or want the freedom to push for decent jobs and organize unions without risking arrest\nThey deserve legal protections\nNow with Trump threatening to bring a rain of lawlessness to American cities the most precarious workers are subjected to more militarized an extensive workplace raids mass arrests family separation and extradited deportations\nThen there is the all too familiar story of scapegoating immigrant workers and deliberately putting them against American workers as big corporations cut wages that they speak to reap bigger benefits\nThey replace one set of workers with another from other regions to other countries or by automating work\nMeanwhile the IAU paying bonuses continue to rise while workers' wages fall when yours scrambling to find work or getting beat out of a job by someone willing to work for less there's the lord to an anti immigrant that but\n... talked but it's safe fair workplace regardless of immigration status he's cheat to social inclusion promoting economic fairness and helping community exercise the right they do have\nA specially those without a say in who gets elected to office\nMigrants seeking asylum and immigrant workers aren't pulling the strings are are rigged economy\nWas making the decisions that cause economic hardship can be more likely founded mar a Lago not at the border\nIf we don't focus on holding the ultra rich and greedy corporations accountable workers will continue losing\nAll the rates in the world will not help native born en documented workers with job security this false notion that we are in competition with immigrants limits on ability to see each other even when the collateral damage as children\nAt this moment wealthy corporations and billionaires not immigrant children and their parents are sacrificing workers for profit\nWhich would see this as a warning when people do so do you ... the forcing kids to sleep in kennels becomes acceptable\nThe value of life for everybody goes down\nAs sort of scapegoating children mothers and fathers wish you reconnect with our humanity and demand change from the truth source of our hardship and how to control corporate class\nLet's be clear we have found the culprit and that's not our fellow workers and certainly not children can and I\nFelt the need to stay there sweeping long overdue in Justine what our thoughts are on the horrifying attacks on immigrant sisters and brothers immigrant workers\nAnd with that two of the people who work are Jewish play who labor in the field in support of workers the working class\nAnd Ken long director UCLA labor center and director of the UCLA labor's center and founding president of the Egypt to think American labor alliance\nAnd I think you both so much for joining us and why don't we begin with can't long and maybe you can give us the lay of the line now if you will on what immigrant undocumented workers in particular are are facing\n... thank you so much for having me on the show and for\nHighlighting this critical issue or there are currently eleven million undocumented immigrants living within the United states\nThey play a critical role in many parts of our economy or they plant and pick the fruits and vegetables that we eat every day or they care for our young for elderly they are an dispensable part of a mini manufacturing\nAnd service industries across the country um but because of their status\nAs undocumented immigrants they are subject to a extreme abuse and exploitation many people talk about how our immigration system is broken well in fact it's working for those who are reaping the benefits of exploiting immigrant workers\nAnd it's also worth seeing for those who are trying to use this as an issue to\nDivide workers along their common interests and so uh what we see today is that there is amazing organizing that's taking place among immigrant workers all across the country some of the very strongest union organizing campaigns and worker center organizing\nCampaigns are being led by immigrant workers in spite of uh these very harsh conditions are but they cannot win this fight alone and it's really critical that other people I'm In the community in unions in a faith\n... executive director of the national day labor organizing network which is one of the groups to one we ask you who are the workers that you represent what to do and what are the obstacles Missy please both in terms of the employers and in terms of the government denies\nSure well thank you for having a you know\nThe neighbors are people who defy the odds every single day and they offer the only thing that they will say that is their labor\nThey do it you know standing on on sidewalks a defining police officers security guard unscrupulous employers a white supremacist organizations\nAnd individuals that come in and harassed and every single day and despite a all of\nThese obstacles that they face a ... there there are waiting for an employer who's willing to offer them a day or you know a day at work\nAnd they are ready to do whatever a job or is available are down ... when the day they were not organized when they are not when they having comes together could decide what their minimum wage she's going to be when they are are isolated from each other\nThat's when unscrupulous employers come in and take advantage of their circumstances\nAnd uh you know they oftentimes oftentimes hire\nFor one two three days oftentimes weeks and then the ... where the problem is that the employer will pay perhaps at the end of the month in the entire at the end of the month will come and tell them hey wait for your time today I'm nothing check up and you pay a at the time and they never shut up\nSo he was on what the abuses that um that workers\nSafety risks that people face and a employed most employers say by even though on the ... and ... as opposed to provide the a personal protection protective equipment gear\nAnd um that doesn't happen so a workers are forced to work and they're very a dangerous\nConditions these are some of the abuses but also while folks are waiting the they face violence and they faced persecution by\nA local police officers\nUm you know the the um in terms of the immigration debate or any or something the pressure of all the the uh the federal government has the exclusive austerity ... university and blow up in the last decade that are for you as a dean purse or\nTo some police departments\nIn in some things in the name of the way that in some other places in the in the\nFull blown a participation in all ... of course many in immigration law enforcement so um you would see oftentimes a police officers comment and interrogating workers about their documents\nAnd again I mean I Do all that the uncertainty that people leave every single a day you know\nWe are going to get back to when folks are coming to New York um but I I Want to just to move back first tech into a a ask Ken long or some of his thoughts on this and of course Pablo as well it recently as recently as a Wednesday\nThere were a number of raids in Thirteen different locations that we know that were conducted by a ice officials serve warrants on through the different locations eleven in Nebraska for example interested roughly a hundred and thirty people now the rains come of courses\nWho hire undocumented workers your thoughts on what can be done about that or do you know of canned Juan actions that are being taken by organized groups of laborers in conjunction with community\nOr to stop these ever more militarized an aggressive raids on people who are trying to survive and maintain their families\nUm ISIS playing a horrible role in many communities throughout the country and terrorizing immigrants in a rating workplaces where we have a immigrants who are contributing to our economy or working or\nAre helping to produce the wealth in this country and yet a in a very populated political move the current administration is going after work places to wreck havoc within these communities to a strip families from there I'm\nA parent from the um wage earners in their families and to plunge immigrant families further into poverty\nA so these raids are doing nothing to ah improve the lives of anyone there doing nothing to improve our economy but there were a way of uh targeting a immigrants and I'm a\nString of more division and fear um what I see happening throughout the country is that uh there is a tremendous outrage and there's a new sanctuary movement that many um faith communities are embracing there are\nPeople all across the country or expressing outrage at families being torn apart at the border and children being held in cages or when the administration tried to implement their Muslim ban we had thousands of people rallying to ah airports across the country\nAh so ah the reality is that uh the vast majority of people in this country do not support the current administration's a vicious attacks on immigrants and it's important at this critical time to stand with immigrant families to stand with immigrant youth and to push back at these very um\nA racially motivated and politically motivated attacks\nThere actually any specific legislation we don't have that much we have a minute or two left that is being proposed and then of course ... although we want to find out when you folks are coming to New York so that we can build support\nBut fortunately given the current political climate in Congress no progressive immigration legislation has a chance moving forward the November midterm elections are critical it's very important that people get out to the polls and that we can hopefully\nA unseat the a Republican majorities in uh the uh house and Congress because\nUm there are a major obstacle in any hope of a passing a progressive immigration reform\nPablo Alvarado when are we going to see you folks in New York I Know there's something planned tell us about that yes I'm\nA desert TPS holder among them or they laborers among\nOur neighbors are more Denmark construction workers they are members of like ... the ... member so if you're either union members have worked a member of worker centers the labor that must be workers for PBS holders are working in all the different things that you can think off I include in the field so there's a bunch of ah\nThere's a a group of about twenty holders who are in the box going\nUh he's twenty three is that separation of twenty three hundred kids with the U.S Mexico border created such a a you money tiring immoral prices for the for the country there's a matching what will happen when when the TPS that is and and and then two hundred and Seventy five thousand\nUh kids are separated from their moms and that that's what they're sending the country there are also been in the country for over Twenty years they've paid back to the ball and everything that they'd be an actor and that they should be\nIn a package citizenship not enough to you and then the third thing which is very important is that ah obviously these on the expression seeing things from east to disseminate fear\nAcross the board they want to make sure that immigrants a\nFew government a police institution cetera\nOr you know and they won also American you're immigrants should be an agenda of fear that these in these stations spread and so they understand that the only folks that can actually we moved up here it's actually the people that the effect that they in fact the communities themselves or they're going to I Would like\nWe have about ten seconds pleased\nWith that data
