foods it's still a little stomach churning I found and I'm not really like squeamish or you know and I'm not really like shying away from the whole\nThose shows they drowned awkward moment and the lives of you know like twelve year old Thirteen year old kids going through puberty there's something about it I really [laughter] really grants or ... years from you but do you like\nIt [laughter] um I think that it's occasionally funny but I'm\nLike in contrast with Bo jak I think that the the jokes and bow jak project sorry what is ...\nA um show about a washed up\nCelebrity horse he's starting to\nCome [noise] um I think that in contrast with that show you know bow jak\nThe joke for me always land not and that they make me laugh all the time but that I understand why they went there\nUm appreciate them and also they have the edge to them that either side or or smart whereas in big mouth they're always like going at you know a hundred and ten percent\nUm and you know the extra ten percent on top of that I Wish that\nLeft it in um I appreciate the show last there's right lead rent a craft to it\nIn more just like let's throw all these things hoped that nine out of ten hit and a call it a day I'll tell you I mean I've just never been a fan of like a Nick ...\nOh really where you didn't like they're opening their opening segment of the independent spirit or it's not really

are Swedish meat balls I Know so tell me about that that's what I'm really curious though\nThey've been sitting in the freezer if someone really smart bought those I keep meat balls and put them in the freezer with the notion that there might be used over the course of the semester anyway ... true [laughter] um\nI had made about the and then I really feel like it's you know I'm going to make dinner for myself it's going to be half hearted and a little sad but I'd like there might be but I mean why is that the I think that the make pasta with sausages pasta and saw like\nAnd that that that are coming in Ashley oh aha that both the first song which was skipping and we had to you know not play and the second song both over four minutes\nI don't know I mean you've got to prove yourself to

was long winded and a little a self serving or self indulgent uh-huh uh didn't feel like you had to feel like it's going anywhere by minute walk\nYou're pasta with Kim meatballs and it was awful\nLike a mix just wasn't working yeah because of the relative speed and and not rare on re Ernest of being greedy and where did you aboard the mission\nAnd try and elevate or ... or move parallel where would you just continue\nObviously we know that didn't happen because it was tasty continue to eat at us I'm ...

supporters we are\nPart of a you know family we our mothers we our fathers we we you know we are ten school where she shares we are scientists where lawyers and therefore the perception\nThat trans people are just a individual that don't bring any value to society we actually turning things around and we're showing than that no that trans people are individuals that are making contributions to society\nThat trans people actually have a precedent in everyday life that we navigate assistance and society and that would bring a lot of contributions and our friends are our life that people that we are fighting to get their discrimination against vulnerable people\nWe show up together and we bring one message that you cannot attack one of us because when you do that you pack all of us\n... do you think that is the Republican led the level attacks on the rights of transgender people\nTo simply use the bathroom has backfired because it felt like the news the state level fights that happen in various states around the country over the past couple of years resulted in a written down backlash\nNot just from the transgender community but as you were saying from people who are you calling themselves allies of the community which which in turn led to the Obama ad ...\nAnd I think I can say is that we have learned nah our work is Trent individual in those who are supporting our most

Jagger it's a pleasure to have you\nI think it's much Melinde as an honor to be with you\n[noise] well I always like to ask people how did they come to where they are today how was it that you came to work for breast cancer action\nWell I was running a different nonprofit and the ... year old and up with the time that I was having that career too many of my loved ones were being diagnosed with breast cancer and I found my developing almost do lay expertise in breast cancer\nI certainly never expected to work for about ... organization\nAnd raising awareness and to me the issues felt much more serious than that\nBut when I found breast cancer action I thought this is the organization for me this is an independent watchdog that is a horrible ... democracy holding the powerful accountable holding corporations accountable for their role in the breast cancer epidemic evaluating new treatments\nNew devices through a patient centered lens and providing independent information to people affected by breast cancer and then also working to stop the epidemic four star where it start\nBy really looking at the city now make root causes of the disease so it really has been an honor to be addressed interaction for more than seven years now and credible team that we have here\nI could not agree with you more regarding this whole pink ribbon campaign and this movement that is so focused on treatment and anyone who has either had breast cancer or a loved one that has had breast cancer knows about the pink ribbon campaigns we've been asked to contribute dollars\nWe do want to be treated and cured when and if the diseases present but wouldn't it be better to look at this disease as well as every other disease plaguing our nation\nThrough a more public health model or lens where we said let's go up river and find out what are the contributing factors to breast cancer and why is it that certain pockets of our population\nThe underserved populations for example don't have the same outcome as women who have access to\nHealth care earlier on better diagnostics et cetera so let's talk about the fracking issue because I think there's a huge I have been interested in fracking wastewater for example in how it's been ...\nTo irrigate crops\nYes so our founders when they first called\nWomen to come together in Nineteen Ninety we're interested in the root causes of the epidemic they wanted better answers when they wanted assurances that their daughters and granddaughters wouldn't get the disease\nAnd stopping breast cancer where it starts has been part of our origin story although I Do want to add certainly as you note we need more effective less toxic treatments because too many women continue to die from breast cancer despite all the awareness yeah and when you look at the chemicals that are\nIncreasing our risk of breast cancer there's some concern but those same chemicals may also interfere with the treatment breast cancer is a hormone driven disease the most common treatment target the hormones and when you look at fracking there's more than seven hundred chemicals\nThat are pumped deep underground under high pressure millions of gallons of these toxic chemicals are are pumped into the earth\nAn order of them are carcinogenic and about thirty percent of them are hormone disruptor such as I noted as it is another a pathway to breast cancer\nSo he's got these chemicals that are pumped underground some of them can contaminate water supplies underground and then as you note a lot of that water comes right back up as waste water and now you may have added these\nHeavy metals or other naturally occurring chemicals that have now been released through the process of fracking\nWell there's no safe way to dispose of this waste water and it really is a conundrum for the industry that sometimes the water is put into evaporation pets and here in California it's we're the only state in the nation that allowed unwind evaporation pets to dispose\nIn California where we have a water shortage issues that's happened in other states as well the industry and the gun to sell this water back to water district and so what we see in California is that Siobhan and other companies will do some really\nBasic sort of cleansing so though in the oil off the water they run that waste water it's called produced water through walnut shells which is supposed to absorb the oil and then they sell it back to the water districts which direct route\nThat waste water that produced water with clean fresh water so diluting it but not eating it further and they sell that to farmers this means that even organic farmer served by those water districts don't have the option for\nAny other water if they're buying water from the water district every farmer in that district that's their source of water other than you know kind of private wells were or other private sources and there's real concern about the exposures for farm workers who are on the hotlines\nWorking with the agriculture as well of course about possible contamination for our food sources\nSo it's another example of do first ask questions later and breast cancer actually been working with our partners to haul on Governor Brown\nTo stop this process there was a state funded study an independent scientists looked at this and recommended stopping this practice unfortunately it does three years later it still continuing and so we have an active campaign will part of the browns last chance coalition\nCalling on California's Governor Brown to\nTake action before he leaves office not only is California major oil producing state\nIt's our most populous state ended\nThat in the country\nMhm exactly so I live in the mid west and I know that if I go to my grocery store and I want to buy say organic anything\nThere will be some maybe vegetables that are bought locally from local farmers but I Would say the vast majority in supermarkets\nCome from California and I wanted to try to figure out okay I Want to know the farm where this produce comes from I Want to know if that's one of the farms that accepts this process water\nI mean you can spend days trying to figure out where the water comes from our their farms in California that have voluntarily said we're not going to accept the fracking wastewater here we are going to give it a fancy name for medical it processed water\nBut are there any farms in California that have said no we're not accepting that even if we go ahead and dilute it with fresh water\nWell let me be clear not every water district is you put this water good um so it's certainly not that every farm is forced to use that but I think to put the burden on\nFarmers and especially with the burden on consumers us along ... okay and whenever we shift in my mind whenever we shift the burden to consumers to try to protect themselves and their families who basically\nWithin ourselves responsible for her cancer was on was creating this impossible task where each of us now become expert in hock psychology epidemiology biology\nYeah and it's to get a lot of work like\nAnd I think one of the things that the English is broken interaction is that we really knew that information to push for a larger systemic change so that everyone no matter what your purchasing power no matter what your access to information that\nI think probably one of the most offending campaigns and certainly the asteroid Seneca was that the ... pesticide that was the one that was produced so I think that's right and I also know that Monsanto had a table at an event where there was action for\nProduct where we know that that's a probable human carcinogens so the contrast between what we think what that pretty pink ribbon and really what that product stands for we need to be aware of those inconsistencies but the one that probably was one of the most offensive was\nThe Baker Hughes pink drill bit for the cure and those were drill bits that were used in fracking is that correct\nYes I'm so glad that you highlighted the there are so many examples so Baker Hughes painted a hundred\nReal but he could not just any pain but the trademark Komen paint common as the world's largest breast cancer charity says when she come and they ... around the world\nIn in the shipping containers that contains mammography screening brochures or\nThe or their words for the rednecks in the field who were then supposedly going to take these brochures back to the women in our lives and for a they produced all these videos and promotional materials and\nIn exchange for this they were giving Coleman and one hundred thousand dollar donation [laughter] so you can imagine\nHow much more it costs to produce the videos to paint the robots to ship them compared to the donation that they were actually making so together with our partners we were able to deliver\nAn extraordinary number of patients to come and calling them to cut ties with the oil and gas industry other examples that might be of interest to your listeners out or what the\n... campaign calling up the previous partnership between comment in Kentucky Fried chicken right or selling

research based\nMost recently a piece of research came out here out of Colorado in the university there that shows that people retain the gains they make even six months later and continue to use the skills that they were taught\nWe do have other plans where looking towards putting part of it on line so people can both do part of the work in their comfort of their own home\nOn when people interact together and share their own stories were looking at a teen version and we're excited that about one point four million people have taken the course\nSo it's been you know a major success and we're very lucky at the national council that our board has invested heavily in this\nAnd believes it's their obligation to make sure we have an educated public I think that's part of the demand we're seeing and now of course we have to make it as easy for them to get help 'em and that's that's the big hurdle now\nOr speaking today with Linda Rosenberg president and CEO of the national\nCouncil for behavioral health when I was thinking as you were talking about the collaborative care of the dark with resources in his office\nThat the national council has long advocated for betting behave her whole services in primary care settings and we had Tom McClellan the c._e._o. treatment research Institute who talk to us about the vital approach\nTo managing chronic nature of substance use disorder longer include integrated into primary care\nAnd I wonder if you could just talk about your research and advocacy in this area about netting behavioral health in primary care\n... is um difficult you know it's a major change mental illness was always the purview of the state state hospitals were far away in rural areas very often it was not seen as part of general health care\nSo you know when the national council got involved in this and began to think that this isn't right and many people are getting care and when they're getting care in primary care isn't as good as it could be because the practitioners aren't trained and they have many other things\nThey're attending to and I think we're seeing it slowly happened the unfortunate thing is people use the word integration like that\nKnow mental health money and merge did with general health care money and given it to you know a managed care company that's now responsible for so called integrated care\nThe problem is it doesn't really integrate care on the ground and the kind of collaborative care you slow first of all you've got to have a team approach\nYou have to have psychiatric consultation available you have to know how to build for it and Medicare now has a code for collaborative care but all of insurance has not caught up yet so this is going to be a journey but we can't take off foot off the gas pedal\nWill lend emerged just referenced our interview with a doctor ... and he had brought up another stunning statistic that very few health professionals have had any kind of formal training in addiction medicine in particular\nOur research and education which is our whites ministers too often gets request to help train stuff in primary care organization to be better prepared to address substance use disorder specifically in of course ... disorders in ... primary care settings\nWhat the council take on this er\nRecommendation I Know we've seen some progress about additional training for physicians and nurse practitioners behavioral health people around opioid use disorder but what are you recommending needs to be done around the shift in general in education and training miles for health professionals\nYeah we for a number of years have actually been doing training in primary care around effort you know the screening and brief intervention and treatment\nWhich is evidence based trying to help primary care practices do that screening and do those brief interventions I'm Tom is of course you know a brilliant guy in totally right we're getting some attention to this in medical schools and certainly psychiatric residents\nOr social workers and very little attention has been given to what can we do with social work curriculum so that it does include the treatment of addictive disorders you know alcohol is still the number one killer and we shouldn't forget that\nWe had been involved the number of years ago in curriculum change in schools with social work around integrated care and I think now it's time to turn our attention really too addictive disorders you know we need to be a learning field right\nUm we have over ... what's the research telling us how how do we train people and then how do we change the practices\nWhether it's in primary care or even specialty care um you know what has to change in a work flows to be able to incorporate these kinds of screenings and then where do they send people who need specialty care do we have enough resources so\nThis is you know an evolution that we're all part of\nLinda you've talked about your goal and that in an ideal world there will be a\nMental health clinic in every neighborhood and you just sort of waxed eloquently about the change process as they need to go on and practices education that we need and uh and then we need to send people who are who have problems maybe to specialist and it was uh thinking about the\nConversations that we've had with Peter yellow the who was the president of the American tele medicine association talking about his early work in Australia using tele medicine to address the gaps and behavioral health services are crossed rural or a little resources areas\nAnd I'm Wondering you and you talked earlier about a tell a psychiatry or I'm Wondering what you see this emerging tech based uh intervention uh uh doing in terms of transforming access\nSometimes in her inner cities people do not have access to the specialty care they need so we're we're ... a ... a behavioral health enter into your larger model that ultimately will end up with these mental health clinics as many neighborhoods or a portal in every neighborhood\nIs yes totally agreed um you know I I don't even think that people don't have access I think where you know raising generations now that want things on demand right I'm waiting for an Amazon package as we talk I just ordered yesterday\nAnd becoming a drone or is it just becomes ... maybe I don't really care as long as it gets here right I'm\nI'm into being on demand and I like doing things from the comfort of my home and\nSo I think even for the most serious disorders I was just on the ... on a call with Emory University and they're looking at\nConnecting people who are in the emergency room to community based care and we got into a major discussion about texting people and uh you know I'm emailing them and chatting over Skype all of the things that that state cannot do based on regulations\nBunch all things that eventually we will do you know innovation is always comes before regulate regulatory change\nI think there will be a mix we call it at the national council high tech and high touch\nFor the last ten years at our big annual conference we've had a technology track I must talk to two or three people who are you know backed by invest your money who have different kinds of technologies that their um introducing I don't know if any a profitable yet\nUm because again you know who's going to pay for it and how it's going to be paid for 'em\nKnow I'm via Skype like device and I do think those things are going to be integrated in all of health care and specifically in mental health and addiction scare\nWell that is wonderful and you know do you want to give a shout out to a veteran affairs during understand his a completed more than two point five million telehealth visit for mental health

um\n[noise]\nTelling me a little bit about the last year of your life\nYears this is called exit right it is called exit okay because I wanted to um [noise]\nI wanted to start off this episode with\nA question um what would be your uh entrance song if it played every time you walk into a room or exit song actually whoa every time that you presumably walk out of a room walk yeah walk out of room slush I mean the question was\nGrade freshman year of high school creative writing classes 'cause it's like a regular and I loved though really great question though is actually a good\nQuestion yeah um for me it or we think questions like this little amazing always require such\nThought yes they do [laughter] maybe it will come back to yeah I Would yeah well let's think um I liked the idea of it being a band song like the band oh that's awesome yeah maybe like [laughter]\nHonestly maybe the way but but that's really like one that is one entrance of mine right I feel like another oh you know what no I Know\nUm I Would say the waiting by angels and oh yeah good one good one yeah but that's also an exit obviously for me what about you\n[noise] um well in ninth grade creative writing class it what did you say it on nightmare hippie girl by back [laughter] which I feel like every girl of a certain age who doesn't fit in a\nSort of adults is there and um um it's sunny and yeah um I I Love the line she's the science of herself um and on and all of Cato rotting on the shelf\nUm yeah we should yeah it's a great so we we we use it can be done because [noise] um maybe for our exit yeah ... yeah um yeah so I'm so last year of my life do you have a specific questions or\n[noise] um yeah I Do um\nHow about a I mean we could start off by just maybe telling me\n... and within a year moments of transitioning yeah I'm transitions have always been really hard for me just as a person um [noise] and I've been told that many times and I think it's true but I don't actually know what it means\nLike I don't know when I'm feeling uneasy during a transition I just\nGlobally feel uneasy and maybe I feel globally uneasy more so when I'm transitioning from one thing to another but um yeah I guess I have according to my mom and\nOther people I have trouble with the transitions\nUm and I had to take a pretty big I made a pretty big transition\nUm last year um when I decided to not go back to school for the spring semester\nUm of what what has been my senior year oh sorry fault not All right um yeah it's actually really funny I only this is my first or no my only my second fall semester ever was when I was kind of crazy and I've had like yeah\nMany more spring semesters um [noise]\nAnd the first full semester that it's going well which is great\nFame really yeah amazing it's a very different feeling it is it really is it's\nUm so yeah um [noise] I decided to make the\nTransition I'm kind of during the summer of not this past summer but the summer before I'm almost a little more than a year ago um [noise] it based on sort of a feeling that I got that was an instinct I suppose\nThat was sort of um brewing throughout the entire year\nActually we're a lot of signs during the school year that\nI sort of ignored or had to ignore honestly because I was here and at school and you know dealing with a day to day classes and\nStuff like that but I was really shut off from everything\nUm and every time I went home I felt like I had nothing exciting to tell my parents about or like just told my friends about like they'd be like how's school and I'd be like oh it's okay like it's good I'm doing this thing and then maybe I talk about something\nThat I was doing was like not that much passion and it would just be like oh yeah\nYeah and they're like are you excited what are you going to do for your these are like what approving projects you have ... and it just felt like\nI wasn't getting\nOut of it and it also had a lot to do with like my insecurities around um being in class and like\nFeeling that other people were more intelligent or like had their um gave oh [laughter] I guess or just like had their thing\nUm all the time and I feel like I felt like I really didn't and um that's a really hard feelings because for me it was like all consuming and I just like took the shame and the ... of that and I thought that there was something wrong with me\n[noise] but um that's why taking any sort of break is really ... um ... hard for me because I I'm I feel like I'm wasting time yeah I was\nNot correct but it is [noise] what yeah what I struggle with I also like on that note I really resonate with that really resonated with me but um when I when I may decide to make a big decision in my life or like am overwhelmed or unhappy with my current state of been\nHe and I have so many tabs open like study abroad in\nA one of the service for example oh I'm going to pick up my Spanish again this is great or you know oh maybe I'll go back to LA oh maybe I'll go and you know a live with this person in Berlin for like it is and and I guess so lost in\nIn in those upset and it's almost like I've lived my entire experience already based like in my head like\nTelling the story like oh yeah you're going to go to ... it can be great and you're going to learn Spanish you know to take this cousin just got to live\nAnd you're going to see like things that you've always wanted to see and you're going to come back in the foot and saying it it's just like I I've already lived to that in my head and it's not even an option I mean yeah I decided to not do that but like\nI've already lived about in my head I'm and I'm so up in like fantasy land all the time [noise] yeah\nI find that definitely I'm just having computers are having my phone come true thing just really allowed me to like live and move [noise] escapist imaginary things without actually\nDoing it yeah and it also isolates you further isolate me\nI'm from the rest of the world and from people\nWho honestly maybe have more of an outsider's perspective and maybe have some reason to knock into my head [laughter] and like you know who can give me a reality check\nUm [noise] yeah and I'm also sort of uncomfortable with just drifting in general like you said about ... to like and I think that that's been something from day one partially though\nBig knowledge that this is something that I'm very privileged to have\n'em but it sort of been drilled into each day one up like\nImportant job of finding a job important of figuring out where you're just steady boards of internships are part of like getting into college and now that's over like being in college and then next stages work and like I'm just so uncomfortable with\nNot having a plan for things because the one I don't have a plan for things generally\nThat make me feel like\nDepressed or like I'm wasting time yeah so like what you were saying about break like what can a break look like we we don't feel like we're wasting time it's on a vacation like I don't know I've never had a non stressful each before\nEither [laughter]\nI I was in a like I ...
