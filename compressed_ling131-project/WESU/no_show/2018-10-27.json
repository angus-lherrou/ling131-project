have are a\nVery special that our friends the studio be ... hey\nI'm really excited to have you and we're really excited to hear you perform some song today um and first we're in an interview you exciting yeah very exciting I'm how's your day to\nBut it's been good yeah it's a rainy one I walked all the way to the gym to find out that it was close\nOh I heard about that too bad because it yeah it's\nA long walk yeah it was cold and rainy all the way their\nCall is closed to walk all the way back\nYeah very rough I'm Sorry to hear that um what what are you expecting out of this interview ... how are you feeling about it [laughter] are you nervous right off the bat you you've been on the radio before\nYeah I'm I'm I'm feeling I'm feeling okay okay yeah that's good I'm cool well\nI guess we should uh I don't know how do you want to start this Luke oh gosh putting me on the spot where we can have some basic questions like how you got into like I guess clearly as good acoustic guitar yeah tell us about your musical background\nSo I started with piano [noise] um I didn't practice the piano very much and then I quit the piano and then I saw my brother's guitar in our house and I was like mom can you please have guitar lessons\nAnd after the whole like not practicing the piano thing she wasn't she wasn't sure she was skeptical yeah very skeptical that I Would practically guitar but I did so here I Am a gray\nOr now yeah and and at what age was that\nUm that was sixth grade\nThen it was like a giant guitar and so you had guitar lessons for your whole life and then mhm what my whole\nLife [laughter] ... yeah um [laughter]\nWell what do you like you do you think that do you think that you\nYou could have taught yourself the stuff like that you learned in your guitar lessons or do you think that that really help you because yeah I don't know\nUh like versus like going on YouTube yeah yeah yeah 'cause like I play 'cause the car but I've never taken lessons and I just like go on YouTube and like play songs I'm I like so I'll be curious to see like what you see the differences are I feel like my guitar teacher was also like\nMy therapist [laughter] so like I Would have like my Sunday lesson and there's just something like really nice about going to it and like just the right and we wouldn't even play guitar the whole time and we'd be able to talk over the songs I was writing so I think that really helped and there was a place for me to record songs as well\nUm yeah did how did um yeah it sounds like buttons like really help you with your writing like that you're a teacher like taught you how to write songs right um\nDid teach me how to write songs I just kind of would come randomly with a bunch of songs it'd be like what do you think of fees\nAnd like what kind of feedback would you get that he'd always say like tell me the story behind the story and then we'd like whoa [laughter]\nThat was like his catchphrase and then we can talk to like each part of the song um and I think that would help writing than I Would understand what I was thinking when I was writing it\n... and so like now when you're writing a song like how how do you like you go into it like with a with a kind of story and like try to like put that into into music or is there a different kind of process yeah usually there is\nAnd then the song either\nKind of figures that out for me which is pretty neat yeah\nThat's pretty cool and again good go ahead\nYou guys actually you guys like work with each other right I'd rather well yeah we we are planning to yeah to yeah sure we had we had a session planned than we were both busy so a bummer but ah yeah we're yeah you could say that we certainly colleagues in the music or co workers yeah\nUm yeah we're we're both looking forward to it um\nIt was just like an acoustic that or is there anything other levels you want to add to it like what is the plan\nI think eventually there are things that I Want to add to them I guess right now most of my music is just straight acoustic and then some doubling\nOr I Love acoustic so yeah they were on Tuesday [laughter] um and uh the uh the listeners at who might not know that you are from from Maine and uh you know not not a lot of people here at Wesleyan for me and um\n[laughter] you think that [laughter] you think that gives\nYou a a a unique angle it's the it's the next to the uh the music scene here and like do you think that like big for me to influence like your music taste and you know what what you produce in any way\nActually people are really searching for main artists most who's the most famous may yeah see you stayed with me auntie Kendrick does she come from Maine is from Portland Maine oh my God we expect that I Know like that's it's like Stephen King and her pig [laughter]\nThose are two very different very different vibes [laughter]\nDid you ever do any performances at home yeah we had a lot of like open\nSo that's fun you said your brother had a guitar is your is your family like a musical one is everyone kind of interested in music or my family they're definitely interested in music my brother used to play doesn't any more\nUm and then my other brother\nHe like has the ear for music like because he or something and just plays or will he doesn't actually play music but like when I play a song he has all these really good suggestions for me so it was a gift\nYeah definitely like in tune with music but don't necessarily play\n[laughter] sure um\nAnd uh I don't know what what kind of what kind of stuff where you are listening to\nYou and your you know getting into his guitar and like what kind of what kind of stuff that you've been listening to you know and that influences what you've been writing\nI was a huge beetles fan the first song I learned to play with yellow submarine oh\nI'm so um but I I\nI Do have to say that Taylor Swift [laughter] definitely [laughter] definitely up there as embarrassing as it is\nOh no I'm I'm On the train all the way yeah so that was when I was younger that was definitely you know 'cause she was having her her big hits you know you belong with me all those are all those anthems oh my gosh right as I live ballad yeah right as I was learning to play so that definitely you know and\nShe is like really called people out in middle school like that's what my song is where I was just called like you annoy me was one of those [laughter] and now is the whole ... thing that's [laughter]\nYeah I Hope we hear that one [laughter]\nNo one will ever get that we read some throwback [laughter]\nUm yeah that's that's cool I had a I don't know the question\nBut I'm a I don't remember\nDon't know like well yeah and do what what have you been listening to recently I

dad's learning guitar right now and I think like the way that he wants to play the ... how you play so just\nOh you guys can jammed together so you know you know excited to give you these yeah zero I'm\nOK well or should we do should we do another do it All right let me sing All right\n\nWe do we have anything to ah to know like oh there's no but thanks to everyone who made the first things that we raised about two thousand dollars in one day which is\nWhat the state needs because of the patients it's a relied than listeners support and it won't survivor that was for support so thanks revenue shut up that's right and bought some stuff still paying off the new trend ... if if people to know this summer on our trans when I got hit by lightning and it got like fried so and we have to buy a new one which is a lot of money\nAnd actually the pledge drive as is coming up soon so please\nI'm alright the\nWe are you ready ready and waiting I write this song is called beach house\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nIt's not how the beach how does one in ... do it\nIn the ...\nThe ... how the beach helped run in the budget cuts which I Do think I Would throw your shoes then then you know how the water is cold bowl because you\nReally don't like it on the go on the the call [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] and if I had to be held that was John McCain our law duck know tightly out and see and I'd rather\nBe all those go home and here you can play by the the eastern coal and by the the cold so\nDo your job\nTo me and then there's the ... the the the the the the thing\nIs that how does how does one thing that you can do to solve the corn they one of the one you think oh you can these\nSo called old cold water on the the calls dominate the co so\nMe\nToo [noise] [noise]\nI'll be like the man made made some kind of trade ties it better that way like they did they made some kind and train me I'll pay\nA [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou know you don't\n\nWow [laughter] do I need a ... ... only my reaction yeah those were vertically or like the limited concentrate line because I can relate [laughter] yeah um what what what's that about [laughter]\nThat like I Love with that [laughter]\nUm that's a good question I think so I think my brother bought a bunch of like of that concentrate\nBecause there is a really good deal on in our freezer like really thought of it I think is on the brain um\n[laughter] the brain and\nYeah but I I wrote that one right when I write when I got to Wes ... yeah\nI don't I think the I think not it's not really about beach [laughter]\nYeah but they got the yeah [laughter]\nWhat just\nTell us about your mind when you when you're writing that that's that's what I was [laughter]\nI'm like you said about the the main artists I think coming from like a a public\nSchool in Maine I was actually a little a little shocked coming to us there's a lot of people from San fear schools than mine and so I think that's kind of where that comes from I see okay okay\nUm one thing I was thinking about wall\nYou were singing this was like how do you you said yeah you can do a lot of uh Taylor Swift while you were you know growing up and stuff and I'm like I was wondering like do you\nDo you try to like model your voice after like a particular person intentionally how how did you like develop valley how'd you how'd you come in thinking this way about that which sounds very good\n[laughter] I'm In chorus in sixth seventh and eighth grade and I I was just too pretty convinced that I just had a terrible for it so I think I I didn't really because I didn't get any of the\nSolo and then I was in the seventh grade play and I was chat and my whole song got caught and I don't think that that was just like a coincidence you know what I mean so I think [laughter]\nSo I think I was to try and like I wasn't trying to make it sound like any\nThing is that makes sense because I was like it it is what it is and then it just I think by just singing more it got better\nCouldn't have been that bad though yeah they are now I appreciate that [laughter] we've all we've all we've all\nFire yeah none of hot all of us can be an advanced choir no true drought for\nAny seeing parts in middle school\nWill now to state shy but I doubt but you know I wasn't course though and because I was always tall I was always in the back so I Would just hide behind people and just like mouth the\nLyrics seen them Jeremy what about you yeah do you remember ... worth and I've never actually heard you saying yeah I'm not good for the new ... no no I think you'd be a good actor for\nMe maybe maybe acting but no no please\nI think if you guys if your band ... puts on another show you should do some background vocals or something like\nThat I agree harmonies yeah no I don't think so okay well we tried [laughter]\nI'm\nAll right have a question about regarding up on the court progression when you're writing songs are you like you have like a corporation in your head as you are writing the lyrics are you kind of like what is your process of\nSays sometimes it's like it's kind of fifty fifty so sometimes I like playing one song and then like that I'm that I'm writing and then I think oh I could actually also use this like with the lyric and then it's kind of happens and I change the current around a little bit\nAnd then sometimes I'll just like here lyrics in my head and then trying to figure out which courts would be best for them cool cool there's no real\n[laughter] no I said there's no methods I was curious as like I don't really written a song laboratories curious to see like how to\nThe lyrics and of course come together to make one thing [laughter] try sometime Luke maybe [laughter] maybe I'm\nAll right do you have two more songs I Do that's all right All right um are you ready are you ready for a third Oh yes All right we're already when you are\nRight this song is called attached\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter]\nI Know it's temporary but can we just Britain and you'll be around things have you ah do you can hold my and both get to know each of the family and
