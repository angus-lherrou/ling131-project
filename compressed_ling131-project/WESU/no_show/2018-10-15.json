it\n[laughter] cool the uh the sound that was listening to this stuff on the way in tonight and\nLloyd sound you mix with a little bit of pop sensibility\nYeah yeah absolutely I mean a lot of that ah that kind of late sixties early seventies or you know art rock is a huge influence for all of us\nSo I can I can do that for sure how did how did you guys get together um so uh\nWell ray the drummer in our band I've known a for\nI mean at least a decade now we were in the school of rock together the original school rocks that the uh the movie with Jack Black was based off of 'em so uh and that was in New Jersey and every week we would go and played smoke on the water and you know all those classic rock songs and then uh\nWe eventually became part of the all star program and we and we ended up touring with crazy people like um I mean a John Anderson from yet as as a who's now a a very close friend of mine from all this turning that we did when we were when when when when we were younger um\nSo yeah so I've known rate for ages and we've done we we kind of had a strange childhood [laughter] plane plane rock and roll and and and and progressive rock than we were Fifteen sixteen years old the you know John and John wedding and Adrian blue and kind of these amazing\nMusicians um [noise]\nAnd then ... the a lead singer and songwriter uh we met just through some mutual friends in in Providence and uh\nI've always been an average with what she did with her previous band a low at them and I'm just kind of a super fans and when I met her I was a little nervous and [laughter] you know like hey I really I really like what you do can we maybe we could just music sometimes she's like yeah well\n[laughter] I like I like a student notes as possible that's kind of what she\nTold me [laughter] like\nAll right I thought OK okay I'll change a little bit for you you know we can make this work and and you know here we are four years later\nAnd I notice here to you guys played a deeply Bonner rule which yeah\nThat was shortly after first record came out I mean it was kind of insane that we uh have that opportunity um yeah love to do it again\n[laughter] did you notice after that like a an increase in sales\n[noise] um I don't know about that but we've we've definitely had a lot of people over the years to come up to us in just like yeah we saw your bottom of the main thing I was an amazing set like wow that's crazy I I guess we didn't realize how many people saw that that show\nPlan and she yeah absolutely I notice here in your bio what it said you would work you guys worked with a cello\nA challenge [laughter] absolutely that's Robin rides ex she was um you know standing member of arc iris she's the one of my favorite team and the whole world um she uh she's actually currently I'm teaching music in Kabul, Afghanistan while kind of following a different path but uh\nShe was very much and take real to the beginning of our band and instead of the some aspect of our band and and the super arranged you know an approach that we take all of our of our sons\nThe first track or we just played Dylan in may tell us about that one\nI don't mean it was kind of a it was bombed forget I forget what kind of um [noise] maybe think of this but I don't know maybe my friend had just gone to see Neil Young or Bob Dylan or one of those I think it was Bob Dylan specifically and and she was like\nIt was terrible [laughter] um [laughter] uh and and that most of the people that were were there to just say that they saw Bob\nDylan unconscious it was more to you know and at that point it's almost like\nWrote a song based off of that idea where you know your your idols almost become this this object where you sort of a\nIdolized and I'll just go to see a lot even enjoy the music or to appreciate it but more to just say if you saw it and you know\nCame to me [noise]\n[noise]\nNew music from arc Irish will actually that one was uh rework when ... ... an older saw that one was money norms for that if you can see on the phone we have ... Miller keyboard and sample is for the band\nEither oh are you are [laughter] but last one not money gnomes that was up your first record and you are reinterpreted\nThat's right yeah um [noise] I think um it was something that we were really excited about doing and um you know as as a band are always changing and kind of\nEvolving and and growing and and I think we were we got really into sampling and and into electronics and an election decides years we got you know we've got a ...\nAnd ... yeah and they can hear it yes that's what I was hearing that's like yeah they had it yeah 'cause I did have a sort of seventies feel to it\nYeah absolutely and um and that was after we did the reworking of letting them are in it inspired us\nWhich was a blue wee wee reimagining blue in the same way that we re imagined around music uh um yeah so we kind of changed a lot of the cords I'm the melody always stayed the same and and just see what the answer to that but everything around that would change time signatures\nUm we used a lot of looping and sequences\nAnd um it was kind of a wild project but uh we've always enjoyed reimagining songs and making them you know completely different beast\nWhenever a keyboard player breaks out the movie the art I mean I hate to turn\n[laughter] back saw\nRick Wakeman and he had all these core eggs and all the ... the digital things but he ... he had um a mini move and he had an art string insoluble and yet when he started playing them like heads turn the sound out of these things so much\nSo much better with the analog than to digital I yeah I mean you could just explain I bet you there's some kind of science behind it\nYeah well I don't know it ... whenever I I like the ... getting into a good sound system that's just like it's earth shattering and in this everybody looks at me their health started smiling and I'm like it's not me it's the instrument [laughter] thing just sounds awesome\nIt's like you sound like the sound waves are more curved instead of uh in in in you know jagged peaks\nExactly I don't know it's probably like vinyl versus MP three or something is probably the same similar science\n... what do you well what do you use for equipment\nWhat do I use on ... on stage you mean yes um so I I use a ... a mug synthesizer and um I have a couple of other keyboards I have a a role and work just like a general workstation where I can do all my sampling into\nCurious um and I and I try to do a kind of emulate a lot of um [noise] like like distorted electric guitar like I've played through a fender deluxe to ban\nUm just to you know a kind of feel that sound I mean got jobs the arts are singer also plays guitar but ah you know\nSometimes it sounds good when you've got a really distorted [noise]\nA kind of you know a lot of words are electric piano on through an app sounds that sounds pretty massive bills the room\nFilled the room and you know it's nice crunchy to be worked\nOut a to Z yes the tubes [laughter] oh remember them [laughter] but I think people are so bad\nIf you want me to look into that [laughter] yeah [laughter] All right let's uh let's cue open to the tune looked oh here we go let's go with the uh the title track of the record\nIcon ego they see that ark Irish we're speaking with Zach Miller keyboard as in samples of the band there'll be appearing in New haven tomorrow night and which wishing to another track\n[noise]\n\nMan and\n\nThey saw the\n\n\n\n... oh You're welcome this ... this is fun I I don't get to do interviews very often in a\nYou know when I Do it's a great experience [noise] oh I'm Glad to be part of it\nOh man what about the weather it when my son was too but\nYeah All right cool right jak Miller thank you very much are Irish tomorrow night in New haven caffeine nine three show I think you're welcomed this is turn it from the ... like on a ... do [noise]\n\n[noise]\nHello this is telling me the ... and you're listening to W.

this idea of of being on the Strait of Gibraltar as as a ...\nThey are in here on the state of the Strait of Gibraltar what I've done a leak is thinking of a very interesting kind of intro track to an album that seems to be quite quite fascinating um and my my my partner fear a genome was actually kind of talking about how Nina transcends\nUm language and so many different ways and I think that's\nReally true considering just\nThe way in which Nina was an international icon um and in in some ways even more celebrated in countries such as Sweden um and parts of Africa like Liberia\n'em and were was embrace their um later in life when when America at all but throwing her out um and and\nThey claimed her as as a radical gone insane and and really just had no place for her um she did find a lot of fame and money I'm In Africa and then also in Europe\nSo interesting to think about their and interesting to think about that kind of different memory and and and perhaps different um different kind of status that and you know might have 'em in Europe\nAnd despite that still though that that translation of of this\nOf this this radical black female subjectivity this this kind of ... just on on and articulate a bowl or the interacted with about Yelp of her voice is going to be there no matter what and it is going to be speaking to block suffering speaking to\nOppression

making\nWhat's your back problem in that it is a problem I have a problematic ... nearby yeah your back and say in some some pretty unfriendly thing\nAnd you know what you know what's making my ... my policy look even worse right now is the fact that I'm very disappointed in how much lower my chair is than yours that have you heard about him or in this moment yes I Can't get this chair to raise

giving them so little of the essence of of what of what goes on now that they're not that very much goes on at all to be very honest but I mean what are you what what do we do so we were these were these two guys where we can we come in here and talk for an eye for an hour like we don't we barely even play music is pretty obnoxious\nHere we're we're we're well you know what let me tell you what I think he's a noxious people who do play music on the radio now with the radio no no no the radio for challenge we come in here every week and it sounds like you then I think you know what you should do but you we come in here\nThe morning to go do I have a radio show today and then I go [noise] yeah I Do what ... what ... what am I going to do on it how 'bout talk to to to breath you know it involves teamwork involved effort and brain charisma\nYou know so [laughter] start late July ... ... you know how to after our guy but I but but I think that's what it's about it's not just about talking about\nComing up here and making an effort to make our own stuff on the air and not just playing music and they joke and play music or I mean you\nKnow that but I really just feel like uh not any joke and get on the radio and talk for an hour and make it good and I think that we are we are any Joe\nSo\nI don't know I feel like they're trying to build them it's like a federal court order to\nGet people imagined that you're listening to the radio you're driving through your your home town or a town that you happen to be driving through and you've got the radio on and you're listening to music and maybe you're hearing some stuff that is new to you and you're enjoying it and you're just sort of you know listening to whatever's on eighty eight point when Middletown\nWhich is where you are by their way up to New York\nOr and then all of a sudden the music stops and and and two guys go in their early ... on their heads off yeah to to nobody really I mean we're not looking at if you if you're listening we're not looking you in the I this is not a conversation\nWhere many of the thing I Want to know what you know what breath I think that that is where you are wrong because

people\nAnd you know what I Do when I Want to do that what do you call someone yeah called eight six zero six eight five seven seven zero zero if you are listening you're driving around you want to call into the show express them you know that they are\nIt wasn't bad it wasn't a bad thing at all I think maybe it was just like\nTension you know like speaks type ... live yeah exactly yeah\nLike talk about something that I'm a medical condition that I've been suffering from\nOh that's right yeah well it's always so they can give it a little ... little ...\nI mean they give a little background and then and then we're going to have a dramatic reading of a of a note I brought to a doctor's office one I'm\nSo [laughter] Britain was getting up and didn't and now the reason for it because they want to break up the program and do you have the right but I but then I was like oh my God if there's somebody on the whole way that he's going a knife on\nDon't worry there's not I don't ... no no I'm going down [laughter]\n[noise] yeah I was like no other way when we when we have a show where\nWe are really struggling financially and\nAre we bring on tap we bring on Johnny Depp yeah and he's like the we bring in like started sort of spice up\nThe show and yeah I listen to ... yeah yeah I don't want to bring Johnny Depp on the show one phone call the way I Know I Know I Know said Britain whenever you know I Know I'm always one phone call away [noise]\nYeah I don't want him on the way and then I said really any kids okay is that okay a phone call on a bus ride\nWell not even I mean like we'd have to set it out but I don't want anyway so the pointed this summer I mean\nI woke up one morning and I had very dry lips\nAnd now British is leaking his lips minor live very dry and I'm Sorry I see this may be a terrible story to tell because if you have dry lives at all this has got to make them feel drier historically\nSo let me told me earlier about his about what he's about to tell you about he is very dry lips and it's a problem and then I my lips started to feel very dry and I said do you have any ah give each chopsticks\nYou did you brought up this little cap of ... and I looked inside and there was nothing there was nothing there and I was like I I Can't take from this and he's like no I Need it and\nI Need it no no no no that wasn't I Can't\nBut anyway then I was like okay well I'll just use the chap stick in my car on the ride a station and I wrote down here and I didn't I did\nFor yeah yeah I Lived I almost reminded you but then I was struggling because you were mad at me earlier for telling you about dry I Would ask you if you told me yeah I ... I really should be okay so anyway\n[noise] if you've ever had dry let's you know or you are ... you know how it knowing the dry let thing could be and and it was going on for weeks I was trying all those kind of stuff and nothing was really working and they were like really really dry\nAnd so finally I had to go to the doctor\nAnd I wanted to make sure when I got to the doctor that I like you know had a list of all the things I wanted to talk about because sometimes they go to the doctor and they like take my temperature and I immediately I'm like okay well that would that I did the doctor\nUm but that that is like I Need to make sure to go over\nAll of this stuff and so we've actually acquired that live\nAll right so this is the list that slimy or wrote to his doctor no I didn't write it to it I just I mean I'll remind you or remind yourself what to say to her yeah exactly editor prompted was more of a prompt was on the topic is for Dr appointment\nJuly nineteenth eight ...

lips have stayed dry thought I had colds or went to a minute clinic for it was prescribed\nSore possibility the racks part of liberal when the crack part of liberal in a way but they became very dry and the food poisoning is out the door now\nWill no longer an issue well all I can expand on that after you finish and then he says uh\nSince then I've tried awkward for bird species rest Bruce rather in Roseburg rest perfect meals boring meals for you got very bad in writing [laughter] urge to be near ... blitz that keeps and\nCoconut oil and ... and lentil and noticed that he wrote a note that he wrote a homemade before coconut oil and then cross it out\n[laughter] like in talking about that as many rights\nNothing works [laughter]\nAnd then he writes then wake up every morning with incredibly dry lips [laughter]\nVery serious to discomfort on me recently there's been this has been swelling his well worried about ... lettuce worried about challenges glandular [laughter] pre cancerous that's

yes and and I got to tell you what the issue and did you take it out of your pocket it unfolded like you were winning a speech at\nGuys watching what the issue and I went aha I've prepared for this

I don't what does he now anyway whereas the now\n... eat eat eat and the you know I recently watched a movie about a called the end of the Torre yeah I've been able to go over there and foster well yeah and at the end of the movie Jesse Eisenberg plays a middle aged man\nWhy not\nYeah like so he's like ... young for the beginning but then he's middle age at the end and they added like the fake facial hair uh-huh and uh I was like wow you know he's really going to grow into himself\nAt some point or just as\n... ... ... ... ... ... is\n\nThirty four thirty five wow that's good stuff here yeah All right I'm going to choose a celebrity or you choose a celebrity who you think you know them pretty well\nI feel like you have to choose one that I could just use when I Know the age of not I just want to eat under the age of you know these um\n[noise] uh I don't know a\nDon Cheadle would be one I'd have to like ballpark yeah I don't know that when that are okay this is a fun game how I'm going to say on ... a\nForty four wow you know there's there's good things for Donny he's fifty three wow same age as my mom\nHe's fifty three I probably shouldn't have said that on the air well you know what that makes sense because she did hotel Rwanda in Ninety four\nNo two thousand for two thousand and four [laughter] I I just you know it's\nGreat advantages to advertise lose really early thirties if he was forty are now now let's return to Mark Zuckerberg how do you think that guy is he is I I looked it up today when I looked him up he's thirty three thirty four thirty four\nSo he and Jesse Eisenberg ... Eisenberg looks so much better\nThan Zach and Zach\nBut back to the original question like okay so he looks like people kind of liked him after that and then this whole Russia they like and then him letting all this Russia crap get through slip through the cracks with Facebook I think they do not like him you think the public is against stuck now\n... call and tell us yeah what do you think public yeah I feel like he's the kind of a I don't know I feel like with his middle name it as as much harder or you know there's not a defined that with remark blank\nMark\n[noise] man that's hard I don't know mark Paul you don't know what yeah Eliot mark Elliott ... it makes a lot more sense than yeah\nIt's like John Paul or John bon jour bon jour\nBon jour bon budget on them job out of John of John bottom or John bon [laughter] no not found them John John Bon Jovi John Bon Jovi John [laughter]\nJohn job John bon ... [laughter] okay I don't know but I think\nI think all like ... billion all these like billionaire\nNow but people elaborate ... sort of on a hot water right now I feel like there's no no no no it's not it's not a wealth thing is that they have been irresponsible with people's data yeah no of course of course right I Know that's the main people mad you know\nIn the Russia stuff like that is split along partisan lines\nEven though you know you you might argue that it should not be I'm\nGiven like intelligence community's assassin going nonpartisan organizations assessments and bipartisan assessments like the Senate intel committee assessment but the but on on the issue of privacy that's not something that half of America doesn't\nBelieve that\nSomething that everybody knows is going wrong and they're they're mad about mad as hell you know these guys profit from basically running an ad\nPlatforms with your personal data press yup\nHere's our ah our next guy it here I think it's a DJ goose yeah porch a doing this for jobs get stuff yeah and a stick around Thirteen minutes yeah\nAnd minutes ago and we talk and you know time goes by yeah time flies by the way you're listening to

Wonder if the nine tuned in knowing that the goose is coming on like the extra two we had seven do you think that if if\nAll you know ...\nYou're listening to the on the radio you sort of assume that you're like I guess like one of many like the radio at the public platform but or do you think what the old none of those people now feel like they're part of something much smaller\nYeah I mean how

weekend to Williams and Middlebury respectively um\nCross country showed out place third out of thirty nine teams\nThis weekend in their competition only behind I Believe is number one the number one team ranked in the country and you know the number seven ranked team in the country so that they're doing a fantastic job and they're really they're really showing the country what they're made of the ... competed well I'm\nIn the place twenty third out of thirty sixteen\nAnd I apologize a football gets a big win a date just getting back to back many trips to wins now now football comes home for homecoming against Amherst on Saturday I understand a lot of students\nMaybe I'll fall break but if you're not and you're sticking around\nCortland stadiums will be the place to be and it could be the place pop it on Saturday\nVolleyball continues to dominate and they went on the news on friday come back and they went on Saturday as well they are just absolutely rolling they they probably are the best team in the next kept right now um I haven't watched enough volleyball to tell you that\nBut I could tell you how hard each of these individuals work on this campus\nAnd they really make it work and they're setting theirselves up for another huge playoff run 'em\nCome the end of the season a field hockey suffers a tough defeat a this weekend to Middlebury um you know but again everything is running in the right direction in terms of culture for all of these programs in men's tennis with Carter\nAnd\nLive with all wind doubles at the Tufts invitation ... again I Apologize if I'm saying any names wrong in women's tennis they compete at the IT aids they use this there's finished fifth in doubles\nAnd India Ewing\nFinished third in cigarettes again I Apologize if I said the name wrong but that's a that's a terrific job I both of our cat his themes\n\nAgain as I mentioned in the last show you can just see the culture starting to change your eye was then it's it's never all you know hey I've got some playing time who seek and you know all this is it's hey did we come away with a victory or W and what can I Do to get better what could I Do to get better and\nThe effort to turn into results and you don't want for some of these teams in ... it's turning the corner and you could really and it's really showing so I Know that's a quick little intro on was sports\nAnd you wrote

I I mentioned diversity they met adversity right in the mouth tonight about two ... two and a half hours before the show came on the New England patriots defeated the Kansas City chiefs\nForty three to forty which fun fact for for a you all at home according to ESPN reports this is the ... that was the first time a football game to end forty three to forty\nSo they they do a pretty good job and and you made that event was foolish time after time after time\nBut again I've got to pump the brakes I'm going to pump the brakes on steak one Barclay because he runs behind a terrible offensive line it's hard to keep this up for sixteen games the giants\nAre a few believe should have taken a quarterback I'll get to that in a minute\nThe giants argue we should have taken a quarterback\nAnd how many times before defenders learn and they start tackling him on the first try now back to this whole should the giants has taken a quarterback\nDoesn't the giants are horrible there one in five right now I looked at as a proud New York than\nOkay they will drop the quarter back in the first round in the twenty Nineteen NFL Draft period and the story\nTo it to be honest I don't think that's a question I think it's gonna be Justin Herbert out of Oregon um I think he's the best quarterback prompt prospect as of right now I see there's\nThere's numerous numerous months ago\nBut the question is should the giants have taken steak while I'm Barkley at number two\nAnd it was kind of a foregone conclusion that used to pick I did not like it I did not like it because I did not trust you I managed to make it through another season or do I look like a genius right now\nYou know I'm a I'm a get myself a little pat on the back here I was a genius you know you you managed struggling he's a he's not doing great well we'll just got him later as well\nBut I looked like a genius right now\nBecause but here's where I'd give the giants credit the giants the giants laid it out pretty clearly the giants would leave it up to the gym the coach and the owner they got to decide\nIf we feel we can win football games with Eli Manning and we can make one more wrong with you I manning as competent starting quarterback than we need to take take one party\nAnd that is absolutely correct thinking okay that that is absolutely the correct thinking if you feel you lie manning is good enough to make it another year and you decide you want to stick with you I manning\nYou'll go drop that quarterback you gotta take the call and Barkley you find you I'm anymore weapons which is exactly what they did they got him to stay on Barkley who's a once in a generational town\nHowever if there was any sliver of doubt between the GM the coach and the owner you know top down they needed to select the quarterback if there was any doubt about you lie Manny they needed to collect the quarterback\nThey had to do it they needed to do it but again\nThey're gone they're good whole idea was read\nInsert take one Barclay again like I said he's a generational talent there are not many sick one Barkley who's coming out of college you know I I hear all the time on on on these talk shows like undisputed would skip Baylor's Syngenta sharp\nSkip pay was just like oh he doesn't remind me of of the week or David ... because they're lazy on bell or David John it's because he's not he's a completely different back\nThen every one of those guys you know lay beyond patient I'm David Johnson you know again David Johnson's all around it I I think David Johnson's will more of a power back\nAnd it's still a Sikh stay quiet as a power back he'll run away from you ... you can you help her do you know do whatever it takes to get in that end zone\n\nBut again I'm going to pump the brakes on shake Lombardi because I Need to see it longer again that what she's doing right now I think he's got eight hundred eleven yards from scrimmage through the first six games\n\nAnd that that piece is hard to keep up and you get a football team you're a football team like the giants if they start quitting on the team he's not going to get his yard edge here's the other thing too they garbage is empty they're losing by thirty\nSo what so what\nCares it's take one Barclay river fifty are touched down when the eagles were up thirty I don't it's nice to see it gets to fans out of their seats because the fans like some you know shiny new player that you know they haven't seen in a while\nI find their quarterback next year and the draft pick you know you you guys come calling me and\n... and ... me and and and all that stuff and I'll be waiting for it but you know it right now they don't have a quarterback which is the most important position on a football team not not you'll have taco night you pass Russia's you need a quarterback\nEspecially in the NFL okay and the giants miss their chance because again like I said I was right about Eli Manning he was a bomb you know I didn't think he could make it through another year and\nLo and behold we're talking about should the giants start fourth round pick hollowed out of Richmond shot I regiment\nYou know it it\nIt's become a fiasco and and now it's going to leave every giant\nFan wondering what could we have done differently\nBut if they find that quarterback Jake lump Barkley is going to be can be an all time great but I Need to see him do it longer I Need to see him do it in big moments\nOkay like like two weeks ago against Carolina he scored with I forget it was like a minute twenty laps or whatever it was\nHe scored with ... that's that's the kind of stuff I'm looking for that what I'm looking for in tangibly from him he needs to score when it matters most I don't care if he scores when they're down thirty who cares eagles just want to go home they want to get on their bussing go home\nBut he needs to do it when it matters the most and he needs to show me\nEven further than that\nThat was a lotta throughout you guys so we'll take a will take a quick break\nAnd then a will come back and will and will get into a will get into\nSome MBA discussion\nImagine the pleasure of listening to music that will connect you to the

opinions\nBallot not first ballot that's not what I'm asking is Eli Manning if a a hall of famer in general and I'll give\nYou some of his stats he's Seventeen touchdowns he sticks thing completion he sticks in your yard\nAnd for all the raft that he gets about his interceptions he's fifteenth interceptions\nHe is let's not forget he's one of five men to ever walk this earth to of won two Super Bowls answers Superbowl MVPs both against Tom Brady and bill boat check\nArguably the greatest dynasty ever and the two thousand seven when they beat him the patriots were undefeated you can make an argument that that was the greatest team of all time and he like many helped defeat them okay again you can argue lucky plays what\nYou know whatever you want\nThe other day he's Seventeen touchdown sickening completion sticks in yards\nOne of five men to ever walk to ever live on this earth deaf to Super Bowl rings and to shovel and BP's let's also not forget\nAnd you can look this up there are several Web sites I Believe that can from the United ... is the most Koch post season quarterback\nOf all time of all the time the stats prove it okay again I I don't know if that what I read that that\nDon't know if it included Tom Brady then against the eagles and all that stuff but you I manning was ranked as the courtship postseason quarterback of all time but I think in a bad week\nEnjoy it means that all you've probably seen Eli Manning face on there\nAt least a couple of times at least a couple of times but at the end of the day top ten yards completion in touch downs\nHe's one of five men went to shore both into shoveling VPs and he is the typically the most clutch quarterback ... posts teasing quarterback\nOf all time you tell me if he's a hall of famer you ...\nActually I don't need you to tell me I Know is the hall of famer I'm not saying he's first ballot because he won't be he's not a first ballot hall of famer and these these these crappy years he's putting together now don't help that but at the end of the day that prove\nManning is a hall of famer I Am all in on you live in and being a hall of fame or when I put everything I own on it okay\n\nYou know not really figuratively speaking I\nI Hope to own a lot of things one day and if I ever get proven wrong I Hope they don't get taken away from me but figure to like a man who was a hall of famer to me\nYou know you want to you want to scream run around the living room do whatever you want to do you like manning is a hall of famer no matter what you think about um so I Am all in how do you live in and being a hall of famer\n\nNext all in for full is Rob Gronkowski truly the most unstoppable force in football\n\n... tank this guy is\nYou know a Brazilian times ... and he's been battered bruised and battered and\n\nActually here to tell you I'm all in I'm all in Robin ...\nIs the most unstoppable force than football when he is on the field when that man is on the field he's the most un solvable force in football is not even close ... don't you know he's got the great\nAgain you can tell me his circumstances are great he's got the objectives his coach Tom Brady his quarterback\nBut again at the end of the day somebody's gotta catch the ball right Tom Brady can throw it in the perfect spot and somebody dropped okay we saw was poker drop a third in\nWhatever in Super Bowl forty six you know again Tom could have made a better throw but he put it there and he had a chance to go grab it and did so somebody's gotta catch the ball and Rob does a pretty good job of that and you know what breed he helps him be unstoppable force\nBecause he just gets the boss such a great spot the ball's in such a great spot it you know it almost takes more skill not to catch it\nThan it does to actually catch it so I Am all in on ... being the most unstoppable force in football again it's tough because\nYour best ability as availability so that comes into consideration\nBut when he when that man is on the field he's the lights out he is wiped out when Tom needs on you know it it can be Julian Edelman but at the end of the day\nYou know try not to let him get six hundred yards today try not to let them get two hundred yards today but I mean at the end of the day he kind of does whatever he wants\n\nWe have one final one for you\nAnd and this one this one will probably take us\nTo get as close into our ah into our wrap up in about six to seven minutes\nAll in so so it's a ... I'm all in on Robin ... being the most unstoppable force in football all in or falls the Dallas Cowboys are America's Team\nWin this question got raised to me because this was brought to my attention by somebody other than myself\nWhen this question got brought are you kidding me\nAre you\nWhat are we serious right now the Dallas Cowboys emergency why 'cause he got a superstar their helmet did they know America's Team\nDid a to point victories in Twenty years America steam what I I Want I Want everybody at home\nTo think about what America's Team what does that mean like what\nWhat is America's Team actually mean is it the teams that the flashes jerseys is it the team with the most success or\nIs it the team with the most ballistic owner you know what what is it 'cause you know only the ballistic owner can I see the cowboys really fitting into I I really don't see them fitting into any other\nThe psychedelic hosted by me psychedelic every Sunday at nine ... joined me for a musical trip through the vault of New York San Francisco London Tokyo and beyond FM radio the way it\nUsed to be every Sunday night at nine o'clock following get it\nEighty one one of them\nThis program making the material not suitable for children are sensitive listeners if you were offended by broken it'd be pleased to no no you have questions about the W. easy when you can see and I'm going to be called the police kind of your board of directors at age six zero six eight five seven seven zero three orange send an email to W. ...

[noise] no there's only one\nHow do you got it [noise]\nUm so [noise] you know and they laid a modest amount [noise]\nUh from that album but you know it was definitely leaning heavier on [noise] I just other\nParts of their catalog I'm not familiar with [noise] so I think if I was a really hard core minds now than it would have been an awesome show I get the impression that played a lot of [noise]\nYou know fan favorites in probably a deeper cuts [noise] what was interesting for the encore it was\nFive dawn and none of them were quote on quote on at\nAll [noise] was one of them in Africa and I told her no [noise] no it wasn't as [noise] they didn't last long range that all they didn't play the songs you know they didn't or they they didn't have a whole show [noise] are they like sharing away from that you think are well I mean this is my first time in them I don't\nKnow but I mean yeah they probably are like listen you know we've been banned for a while and I don't want to just wait for it on every night I respect that [noise]\nNo no it's play every night 'til they died but I think that's part of the problem with I mean like we're both Green Bay fan but I think I think we can say that pretty confidently we both enjoy I'm a I'm a I'm a greater than me to\nLike ... you know and there's a song that I I think they probably will planes ... jai yah and I don't think they need but they don't have just one song they know they go they can have because the amount of space shuttle hunter every song except for the one for them to ever they want\nRight but then they play the ones on every day they know everyone's going to be happy I get that\nYou've got to talk about the wages aren't we played okay on my answer is going to start so I I guess I'll just wait for the weight I mean we just heard John ... is is starting to go in there\nYeah yeah this is a always regard\nIt as I say it again so oh yeah All right it feels good ticket is maybe ... anyways yeah we we played a can't knock the hustle\nWeiss tonight You're welcome by the way it was a dog that\nIt's all because of my my friend Connor coming into the studio he uh he was like what you played a without me yeah she was more than that I think yeah I was a so anyway this is\nThe first single off of a long way to black album ... and yeah it's it's ... it's the difference it's it's a different down for them it's a [noise]\nBut it's it's what rivers was talking about in relation to the ... to the to the you know the blackout them for the past two years executed how he said it would be good to achieve\nIs that right yeah\nAnd how was that can you refresh my memory\nHops on with\nCurse words I mean that's all there and I oh\nI Know and uh like different instrumentation stuff yeah um\nSo I don't know\nKind of and I haven't gotten your your ah your initial opinion out of this was all straight off the dome right now right off the dome\nThe show dome\nWhich I'm sure it is just like any\n... song that I mean just weeds has been divisive yeah her whole career\nBut more so they've gone on I mean we're just like there's parts of it like in this part of it that I don't like and how much do you dislike those parts that you don't like [noise] not that much I like it more than I just like it but as the lead single especially\nFor an album has been [noise]\nUm so so long in the making yeah um I think I Would have wanted something strong shore um [noise]\nWhat would we use are as well you know especially like I feel like I learned my lesson both with the white album specific daydream because the the lead singles out for those albums I thank God for girls\nAnd still like summer yeah\nReally any any of the singles on Thursday dream you know I thought were okay but I was pretty so so on\nBoth those albums I enjoy yeah a lot I Love them and so we both kind of together yeah and a lot of a rotation out of ... records so I feel like for the cycle even though it's not what I was expecting and maybe not exactly what I Want either like\nI have more faith in ways or [noise] then [noise]\nThen I Would have otherwise you're not and I think they've earned it and uh [noise] I don't know so honestly I think it's a pretty good song and it it makes a lot of sense coming off of specific ... so it feels like a good mix\nYeah you can totally tell the evolution from white sympathetic to blast yeah and this is this is taking that like\nYou know there's some beach boys on a specific daydream\nGuitars and real drone\nBase parts like it's a\nYou know the bills well thought out and it [noise] ... the rivers yeah dumb observation then\nYeah right I mean the the lyrics could easily be\nKept exactly the same and wrapped up into like a an older we use or sound and nothing would be weird it's just the\nThe ... of it that yeah\nThat that makes it feel different and I think that's\nAsking a lot of people out so absolutely yeah I mean I think the lyrics are better than a lot of ... the guy on\nNo no I Do need ... ... ... ...\n... ... you\nKnow\nAny better than it is and\n\n\nAnd the\n\n\nIn in ...

millionaire\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nTo find out I was teaching as a graduate student on campus and I started the research to find out what the situation was for veterans so I started it as actually my dissertation research and I [noise] the way I did it was I visited many campuses but I mostly concentrated on to camp\nWith an ethnographic project so I studied that experience at one urban public university and sort of a a top tier university and then at a rural community college in central California\nAnd talk about what was that you've found first of all I'm how what what is the sort of approach that veterans tend to take at colleges in terms of what they want to achieve I'm not old veteran\nYou don't have lost limbs or or faced very serious combat I'm assuming does a big variety of experiences I'm assuming some may be experiencing some severe PBS he and others not so much\n[noise] yes I think that's a really good point that that they experienced the veterans in\nIs extremely diverse very varied and in fact people joined the military for different reasons I was looking at a subset of the people that joined the military and these were people that really\nWeren't interested in a college education and basically signed up to go to war to go to college I mean that's what that would ultimately the deal that's not why they did it they didn't want to go to war but they did want to go to college for the most part\nTo deal with people who joined the military with the intention of wanting to return to go to college because it might not have been acceptable for them unless they went to the into the military and the first place\nYes it wasn't I didn't exclude other that joined for other reasons but that went by and large a lot of people were interested in going to college at least and many didn't have the resources to do it but for whatever the very reason that they joined\nVeterans are having a difficult time in college because of the building colleges of an anti military by it which was something that I didn't I didn't see I haven't seen in my experience prior and I didn't see throughout the course of my research but I thought it was curious that that sort of\nIdea kept coming up that veterans might be having a hard time in college because simply civilians on college campuses where in effect driving them away\nIt sort of reminds me of that ... that are returning Vietnam veterans to the United states were upon by anti war activists than were vilified even after the attacks by so much\nAnd you were saying that this uh this might also be a myth that returning a Afghanistan and Iraq War vet that being a ton to buy non military college students is a bit of um it\nExactly knowing the document and what I found is that at the met with the foundational missing the Vietnam that I mean it was built on this idea that we as a collective\nA civilian population mistreated the Vietnam veterans on campuses and so we at collecting stability and today I went to the Afghanistan and Iraq War veteran to treat them exceptionally well and to honor them and to better write their service on campus so it's it's not only in similar\nMitt but it's a myth based on the summit them yet\nSo the um there are two separate issues and you take them both on because they're often conflated on college campuses one is that\nWho return from the U.S military their ordinary people who are often in a circumstances that are not um ideal they you know might be a rising from low income families are communities they've come back and they need support and to be mayor\nTo support them veteran then you're sure glorifying war glorifying the reason these students are these young people were sent to war and the first place on other breeding militarism um how do\nCollege campuses often conflate the to to the detriment of both back a non veteran students\nThat's a great question and I think that that's the way that they're completed its it's very subtle I mean they're\nThey're start out with a very heartfelt\nHeartfelt I'm a function that many civilians have I Would say if not most many civilians have that people have been sent to war and they deserve to feel safe and they did there to feel welcome back with the I think that that is a pretty widespread opinion but to take that idea\nTo couple it went to ... to a an idea or a story that campuses are\nAlready anti military have a bias create the need it creates a a manufactured problem of the anti military campus so that\nThat extra effort has to be put into ensuring that kept civilian kept our military friendly which is actually status that different universities and colleges vie for the military friendly status\nIt's actually a thing that is a designation that that\nThat colleges can apply for and half bestowed on them so with the designation of a military friendly Hampton\nUm everybody's trying to compete to who can be at the at to compete the most welcoming veteran and\nBut the problem with that is not the veterans get a good education that there is no problem and that the problem as I see it is that when the court for veterans become conflated with with the silent about the war for example I read in some literature some what's called the best practice literature\nAbout treating veterans on Capitol treating well part of that literature has set admonishing um capacitors and faculty\nSomebody said something against U.S policy or the current war that that might offend some veterans veteran\nCop to veterans are being treated as a symbol the fewer militarism therefore if you criticize us militarism you're criticizing the veterans\nAre the actual people but in practical terms used actually true how veterans reacted to any anti war um activism the might young Catholics are anti war or just even a questioning of militarism in classes\nWell absolutely in fact many veterans arrive\nOn college campuses [laughter] like wanting to question these their experience wanting to understand they're experiencing more which by the way many many veterans have extremely conflicted feelings about what they did the some of that all veterans\nPositively identify with their military experience it's a false assumption and it's it's detrimental people who don't fit into that Meredith and so they come many come\nAnd decided to study things like Middle Eastern studies because they want to engage in these debates they want to\nUnderstand their cool they want it makes sense out of their experience and so many told me that they came to college campuses and they weren't expecting discussions and think think basically step what's going on here why is nobody talking about the war why nobody mentioning and so there's that sort of\nGet to the matinee idea that you're supposed to help help the veterans by not talking about the war in the veterans ... thanks why if nobody's talking about the word I Want to I Want to find out why\nYou know to sort of a late night thing attitude of the uh college campuses have been told to be needed to adopt in order to make veterans field welcoming but what it is done is stifled debate\nAbsolutely absolutely and so which then in turn alienates veterans even more so right doesn't actually help the very people that need the help\nObviously not all are supportive of war either but I have a veteran founded the antiwar voices on campuses dot something that you'll be capitalism is supposed to be college campuses it's supposed to be places where you engage in healthy debate unquote shouldn't think\nAbsolutely I mean suddenly that was one of the security thing that I found I didn't go into ... looking for anti war activists among kept it but in the course of my research I noticed\nYou know an absence and I think my my theory is that in part that's because people are so cautious to to do what they think they should do not talk about the war is doing to prevent a potential effects to veteran [noise] um so I was curious to me that they're\nThat college kept us today are not center at square activism\nAgainst the war in fact\nIt's largely most chemicals that I felt were largely silent on this issue what I found with veterans that wanted to speak up against and be organized against the war generally found spaces off can't while which which is a different that's different from previous time and so\nIraq veterans against the war which is now what's known as about they did not have chapters in the in the capital since then I heard that it seems like and I can't speak for all of their chapters but it did seem like off campus organizing was much more powerful than on\nNow what about military recruitment on campus and how the U.S military you know I'm a had a presence on many campuses how does not impact temperature life for students in general but also about\nWell again if if somebody is if somebody's being recruited unkempt that on a college campus that generally means they are being recruited for ROTC in you know Clinton reserved\n[noise]\nRaj decorative\nHorrible [laughter]\nLike us on Facebook dot com slash bar you know that's the letters are

personal and collective\nRob Morrow welcome back to our show thanks for having me again Mike Rowe recently\nWrote an article about an open society and personal responsibility would you elaborate on this theme\nKind of like a ... a mouthful the title of it is conscious responsibility and the conscience free solace of consensus reason there's topics sort of came to my attention as a a couple of years ago somebody passed away my church I used to go to this\nLocal you use society where I live and this channel on the passed away he was in his eighties he was one of the people that I I if we look forward he and his wife to see every Sunday Morning he was just really pleasant easy going man and I wasn't surprised that he served in World War two but during the service I found out his business background\nAfter the service and he's married and had children adopted a daughter\nBut it turns out that he worked for one of the major banks after the war as an officer\nMight believe out of New York and it was one of the banks that was involved and financing the interests of the Nazis or the years leading up to the war and it just sort of struck me I I just kind of got curious about it when it's some of his former employees brought this up so I checked out that book by Charles hang in\nAny way this book documents all these various business ties and the west connected with the rise of Nazi Germany and sure enough a company that he worked for was it was a whole chapter is devoted to its ties to this and it just made me wonder how many people in society that are well meaning\nFollowing the routine of what the dictates of this society are to be productive or actually unknowingly supporting things that\nThe society in terms of its social and foreign policy would really want contrary to what people would support\nThis as well as in combination with stories I've read and films I've seen that deal with people in different\nWalks of life coming at cross purposes when they realize somebody in one part of society has the influence has the access to money\nTo affect other people in society they share they work in the same community but they're not supposed to normally need each other and as a result it can create conflicts that lay there the structural dysfunction analogy of a society it's supposed to be open\nSo wrong what you really saying is that personal responsibility is not just a personal responsibility but also requires a collective kind of view or a more social point of view so maybe you could contrasting compare that to what's going on in our political world today\nI guess a good place to start regarding this point is the polarity that's going on between people that support Donald Trump and people that are actually planning for the bomb administrator ... regarding the sentimental finding of the year cycle via bomb and the ... which\nScientists counterpoint and the defensiveness that we see today for Trump supporters\nSo you're talking about issues like tar sands pipelines police militarization the unabated expansion of global military occupation and the corporate position of all aspects of society if you look at the larger picture it's easier to see that with an impartial live\nThe ladder is actually building upon rather than on doing the work of the former so in this way I feel that the ministry and administration out his patterns played over and over again and it serves to distract people from the larger picture\nThe other thing is we're talking about the media as well you mentioned that in your article on his personal responsibility in the media reflect into their lack of concern about the issues warring Pete justice and injustice and so\nUh the book was like ... you should go rent part of the Booker Prize in Nineteen eighty eight it takes place in the years before and after World War two\nAnd it deals with fictitious butler that works for a manor house in England his name as Stevens and it's called darling hall the gist of the stories that he's looking back at his career after the war looking back several decades of\nDevoted service and he was always happy to be associated with starlings in the hall and lord darling to took it upon himself to use his manor house\nAs a meeting place for the elites in English government because of the emerging German Nazi movement so at the end of his career that house gets taken over by an American and he encourages them to go on a road tour of England to take a break\nAnd he keeps running into people from his past and they keep asking the questions wherever you when you're a master was meeting with this dignitaries representing but not to interest in what was your view about this and what did you do about it\nSo he was espousing the perception that the best that he can do as an individual is to serve a man of great value great destiny that has better judgment than he does but clearly garlic and didn't\nFind as much as he is more concerned about the gas marveling at how wonderful the table where the uh the silver is\nThen concerned about what issues are being discussed in what compromises are being demanded a part of the British Government in support of the Nazi cars in the end this creates a real crisis of conscience where this man and it also plays\nInto the whole concept of you know the great man of history theory you know the history revolves around key figures that are very influential\nAnd ties in with the general standard assumption that certain people in society are veterans managing\nThe affairs of large numbers of people than people individually are and\nIs a film that wasn't a novel is called the it's just a dinner but we were just talking about is kind of interesting because this film starts out as a sort of dark comedy\nBut the way the film was promoted when it came out on DVD was completely opposite of the you know the tone of the film itself this one stars the samba Hajek and she plays a healer that works at a a Cancer Center in California and one of her clients is a wealthy individual who is um instruction magnet\nAnd he's having a power dinner a power conference with sort of a Trump type character played by John Lithgow and she accidentally get stranded at the house because of her car breaks down it's a house in a gated community\nSo it's essentially what's going on is that she's forced to sit in at this whining dining session\nAnd she discovers that as a Mexican immigrant that it's quite possible John Lithgow is character was responsible for destroying the economy and the environment of the town that you came from Mexico because he set up in that country many resorts\nSo the two of them start going at each other throughout the course of the evening it's really kind of tragic and funny because by the end of the movie you realize she does have an impact on lift cows series or prepare occasion city indulges in but what's also interesting is that the other guests that are there they also defend him\nIn such a in a kind of a serpentine way once they find out that she's a healer\nAnd when things come to a head the cliffhanger in the big reveal\nIs that it turns out to a certain faction within the government is equally finding these creatures of his version\nSo we've gone from the message that says that change as it's always has been historically comes from the bottom up from the people that actually makes society function on a day to day basis rising to the challenge to the idea that the it's state organization that is going to be our savior\nSo you know if you watch it and watch these shows side by side is completely been turned on its head and I think the historical references that we're informing the ...\nHow reality are we now in a hall of mirrors in which we cannot look back so therefore we cannot look forward and our stories are narratives are being created for us rather than being reflected in these works of art\nKnow I Would say that's the case part of the problem I think and I think this is specific to the United states\nThink to a lesser extent in Canada is that the u._s. was obsessed with the new with a novel because this country has been historically such a locust for invention over the years we're just hung up on whatever the next big trend is\nAnd this can really lead us astray just a couple of days ago there was another stock market crash and I'm not surprised that one of the\nSegments of the economy that just really imploded was the tech sector and if ever there was a an aspect of the financial world\nThat is built on a house of mirrors of expectation and the cult of the new it's certainly the so called tech economy all this business coming out of Silicon Valley and the\nCase in point that eyesight is the experience of a Elizabeth Holmes and the people that invested in our company ever knows how she went under a couple of years ago but a journalist working on Wall Street Journal he worked on for many years about this company which is\nProducing what was supposed to be a revolutionary way of testing blood at home or in an office environment that would use the capacity of blood drawn from the arm to be able to test for a variety of ailments all sorts of conditions using just one drop as opposed to you know an entire violence\nSo the ... supposed to develop types of machines that you can even take with he went home and just use one drop\nAnd habits connected wirelessly to your doctor if you were in some sort of acute state either because of some condition that had to be monitored or because you were having\nShe quit and started got a patent for this idea and started to this business and it went on for Fifteen Years it was founded in two thousand and two\nAnd she got all these prominent people back or you know the typical fashion where the companies making money through revenue not because it's actually showing a profit by producing anything George Shultz was on the board Henry Kissinger\nA lot of prominent people are kind of taken in by this rather young charismatic woman and she was obsessed with the idea of the physicality of the price it has to be very small and had to be very compact\nBut the engineers just couldn't make it work the way she wanted to do there was this obsession with the appearance is the concept of it being different from what was done before and that's the biggest stumbling block is that she was so stubborn about this and it didn't go anywhere\nSo this married to rather aggressive business practices and culture of paranoia and a constant threat of lawsuits towards employees whistle blowers eventually brought the whole house of cards down and so much of our economy needlessly rests on this kind of mystique\nWrong when we talk a little bit about something we talked about on it earlier show the idea of disruption and that new technologies to disrupt old technology\nAnd that there can't be any sort of reviews of older technologies\nWhy do you think that we're still obsessed and the tech world with this idea of disruption why do you think that that idea is somehow a prominent today when it comes to looking ahead in terms of economic development\nI think it's a mistake that goes back to the founding of apple computers you know these people that develops something that was truly transformative and the way people handle information opportunities for creativity that just started out out of two guys building something in their garage but if you look at\nYou find that actually what Steve Jobs is doing side by side with gates or when he developed Microsoft is that they saw an opportunity for rearranging the way things were already being done\nIt wasn't really a matter of innovation also a lot of these people look like for instance I was just talking about Elizabeth Holmes the way she operated their business tattered herself for appearance\nHer business practices after Steve Jobs and she was always wearing dark turtle necks and so on the irony is that over the decades apple computer for\nIts part where they come up with things like the iPhone and so on conveyed actually stepped away largely from truly creating new inventions a long time ago things like the iPhone the iPad they they um access to the ingenuity of developers in Asia and buy the rights to them and then package them and marketing is\nThe wrong so a lot of people are infused with this idea of being disruptive but you know if you look at the larger picture about capitalism\nIs completely antagonistic to true innovations to choose a true disruption like look what happened with Tucker with his automobile back in the forties was the first American car I believed to have seatbelts and it had an engineering the rear\nYou had what is now I guess considered a standard type of a transmission system that was revolutionary for each time a lot of these developments we did see some of them come to pass by the the fifties and late fifties or sixties\nBut it took a heck of a long time for the establishment they all look awfully Eric an auto industry to embrace them because these shifts are these developments there were so many\n... introduced at one time and one vehicle it would require too much reworking of the pre existing company General Motors Ford\nTo have to keep up with them so they use their influence from the government to literally they got to the point that they were blowing up this man's car factories because they didn't want John genuine innovation or you can see this currently with the trend\nActually that's more like mental change pre existing industry tolerate because it's still as it was first first shift to the\nTune in next week at the same time for part two of this interview\nWith the boom boom boom

W E s U Middletown or ... you know and fame\nHello this is Anne Marie from the button would treat inviting you to visit us on main street Middletown or we uplift and educate people through the art\nIn Nineteen eighty nine the button to a tree had been supporting emerging performers of all ages and ability and so much more at the button would treat you can hear world class musician like Charles ... brother close and personal\nHow much impact could they have on reducing emissions globally on over that time and\n... as part of the whole system of eighties solutions and then they're ranked um according to that impact and I always say they're not ranks because we are going to pick some and leave others um we we need all of them and they're interconnected and they're part of a system but it gave us a sense of where\nSome opportunities are and and I think it actually lift up some solutions that um have maybe not gotten as much attention as they should um cut it but the unsung heroes if you will\nYeah um you know what stands out for you as one of the unsung heroes\nWell there are there are few and the top ten actually so number the number three solution is reducing food waste and the number four solution is plant rich diets and those I think are are really interesting because they are both about\nOne can have an impact on anywhere in the world and and probably a financial saving food waste it it turns out that ah roughly a third of food that we ... around the world is not can feel\nThat you can imagine rate how many resources are invested in food at every stage of the journey\nAnd in regions of higher income like ours we tend to waste by choice so we don't like ugly produce ... sir over by we don't necessarily treat food like the incredibly precious resource that it is so\nIt's an opportunity both to reduce the the emissions that are created by food waste on but also to advance\nThrough security and in an address hunger which is still a condition of life for nearly eight hundred million people around the world\nWill you know I was surprised to see a food waste also AS number three it was like wow that's amazing of that and then the next when I was also surprised about plant which diet in we often hear about why you should cut your meat and oftentimes it took it it would help\nThat you know we're yeah we're eating too much meat we don't need that much meat and it's creating a lot of health problems for for those who do have the luxury of having it not to mention those of us in the Midwest to have to live around the corner soy production\nUm which is the intensive use of um average chemical and uh I I I think I have this one right but right now I the statistic I I've been working with a Twenty one percent of greenhouse gases are\nAre caused by the way that we farm I'm so that that has anything to do with food and changing food um is in the way the ...\nAnd in your world is not twenty percent about rights for\nA coach was impact or contribution to greenhouse gases\nSo I I haven't seen that the Twenty one percent statistic and I would guess that it might actually be a little bit higher um [noise] we we think that livestock production allowing to produce says just under a set of\nGlobal emissions so well and and\nAnd most of the world's deforestation so by the time you you take into account agriculture beyond producing food\nFor and producing livestock um I I Would imagine it could even be a bit higher and and what's interesting uh recently we've talked about that rich diets and reducing food way honest\nBut whose sector where can draw down represents eight at the top twenty solutions and it's the largest sector for potential impact overall and about because it also includes a whole suite of regenerate as agricultural practices that cat in\nA in some cases not just avoid admission but also a tap into the power if at a center says\nTo bring carbon back home and ... and ... ...\n... ... um\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... [noise]\n[noise] oh wow ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... [noise] [noise] [noise] Mm\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n...\nUm yes I'm so glad that you brought that up one one thing that really\nClimate change or and maybe even sequester carbon but\nIt turns out that that probably healthier for us our personal health I'm definitely going to be way better if we reduce the amount of meat that we could do and look at more diverse diets that are as you put it plant rich diets that just common sense I think at this point\nThe whole the whole through sector is full of a kind of win win win win win sorts of solution so on and as you said on the rich diets are there's a great benefit for chronic disease and healthcare costs\nNot to mention the pollution from ah intensive livestock production and not to mention um the the end humanity up many of those cuts down on that but when you think about all these different regenerative agriculture solutions\nThey are also the means of restoring our our soil health and without healthy soil Fat Chance we're going to be able to continue farming effectively far into the future so\nOn and that is a really critical area where even if you totally ignored the admissions impact its interaction that we would want to go\nYeah well here in the mid west you know for every bushel of corn that we grow we lose two bushels of the soil going down the Mississippi right now and into the Gulf of Mexico which is now I've got a dead zone that ... was the size of Connecticut but but now it's even larger\nI'm so certainly once again lots and lots of reasons on both sides mitigating climate change for changing food number eight to ... which really stood out for me educating girls weren't number seven with family planning\nCan you talk a little bit about that I think that someone who was going to open it up and say what what is not ...\nThere's a a sector and draw downs that we call women and girls um so so we cover kind of a ... a whole host of factors electricity materials transport land you\nSued 'em and and one of the factors that we cover is is called women and girls why is that the case well of course women and girls are\nRelevant to every single solution and draw down and and we need women's leadership across all of the solutions and in fact you could argue that women and girls have\nThe greatest steak and the solutions because we know that the impacts of climate change hit women and girls the heart is just one statistic in some cases\nWomen and girls comprise up to Ninety percent of those injured or killed in a natural disaster oh Gees\nSo you think about existing vulnerabilities particularly in situations of poverty um and and women and girls are ... really are are set to to suffer the most and an frankly already are um\nBut there's also another side of that story which is that gender equity is it so a climate solution um while also shore and knocked resilience and two of the three\nSolutions with a non factor you mentioned um number six educating girls and number seven\nFamily planning um what's that about so uh educating girls um there are more than a hundred and thirty million girls today who are denied their basic rights to go to school uh around the world and\nYou can imagine all of the reasons why that that matters because education leads to ripple effects on better health and financial security and more agency at home at work in society\nHave reasons women with more years of education choose to have fewer children I'm I'm a more actively manage the size and facing their families and if you add up that ripple effect on fertility rates across the world and over time\nSecuring the fundamental right for girls to go to school will affect how many of us are inhabiting the planet at ... at mid century now that's not why girls should be educated but it is a a really meaningful outcome\nAnd its education's one side of a coin family planning is the other so we look at uh the importance of closing the gap on access to high quality voluntary reproductive health care\nOwn home grown\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n\n\nSo\nDeal\nTo ... to\nThey can\nWith nine and\nThey didn't\nTo bomb Iran\nDa da da\nDa da\n\nA game\n\nOn that\n\nDay that

known for on campus ... out yeah there sure yes so every other Tuesday lunch is vegetarian at used then\nYeah it's amazing and so we know that a couple of people on campus um\nAt least have expressed some concern about it's only every other Tuesday but some people are very resistant to even trying just a vegetarian lifestyle what would you say to those people to maybe get them to come on down and try that out just just for one meal\nYeah so I mean it is if you think about it two meals out of the entire month and you eat three meals a day so that's a lot of meals per month and not that many that are vegetarian and it's also just one of the dining halls so it's really not that\nSignificant other very strict [laughter] um [noise] although I Know some people expressed concerns about getting enough protein [noise] um and like\nAll do they kind of some time to talk about having their freedom of choice limited by that job she said um and we actually have a dean coming out and a couple of weeks hopefully that will address some of those concern\nUm does specifically with the protein thing\nIt's kind of kind of a myth that write the vegetarian diet limit your protein I mean obviously meat has a lot of protein but there's so many other sources that especially in this day and age it's not an issue at all\nThey cut out meet 'em so that's not really something to be worried about and also the freedom of choice thing I mean this this again is addressed in the dean but\nFreedom of choice is something that we're very fortunate to have at Wesleyan students and with that freedom I think comes a pretty big responsibility\nAnd just keeping in mind the fact that something as seemingly personal as what you eat for lunch actually has a serious impact on the environment and animal and even your health\nUm I think people can forget that because eating is such\nA regular routine thing that you kinda go into autopilot but you're dietary choices are really significant um on your surroundings so keeping that in mind when you argued for your freedom of choice I think is really important for sure\nSo going back to um veggie out as an organization what is the communication like with um you Dan with Boehner but tea at Wesleyan [noise]\nYeah so we meet pretty regularly with um a man named Michael ... who is the head of grown up here at Wesleyan\nUm just to ensure that there are no issues with ... she's day\nWe're also trying to get that job to say to be every Tuesday instead of every other Tuesday because a lot of people think it's every Tuesday anyway [laughter] I think it's ever to say look forward to it yeah so like why not if that's the general perception on campus any way we might as well just go for it right [noise]\nUm yeah we just try to keep things smooth and try to maintain consistent communication with them um I spoke to destiny who is the beacon death for lunches during the week\nUm [noise] the vegan section and the history of it it's actually was the un has had the again the section for really long time which I wasn't aware of and I think they're a bit ahead of their time in that sense but and that's really cool\nYeah I Know you were saying earlier it's it's really great to have a place where there's a constant you get an option like I I don't identify as he can buy their ... but I\nOften enjoy and it's it's nice that it's not limited to only those who do identify as we can do if you would like to try it out and like you just end up eating begun anyways more and more\nYeah yeah definitely like I talk to people come time and they say that they eat beacon meals kinda regularly without even noticing just because it's there and it's delicious yeah which is awesome\nYeah do I know there are like so we've talked a lot about the ... on at Wesleyan and on with named campus but I Know you're doing a lot of work outside of was in and trying to find more options for students and\nMaybe Middletown residents as well for 'em yeah to be an option at restaurants in Middletown could you talk a little more about that your project\nYeah yeah so I'm currently working on a project for ... out um but we're collaborating with a company called a billion bed\nAnd a billion badge their main thing is that they have this app where anyone can go on you should make an account and you can review a restaurant or specific dish at a restaurant on the spot\nAnd the purpose is just to kind of build a platform for people who are trying to seek out a plant based meal or diet\nUm and like make it easy for them to find good things to eat because\nThey are [noise] um so that's a billion that age and they contacted us to create a plant based food guide for Wesleyan students so that will include on campus dining as well as local dining so yeah I've been in town a lot this semester\n[laughter] guy like religion politics I feel like just like any sort of ... all all values you know like start\nWith your parents um and I also think I think in a way almost like having your kids eat meat is like an an active choice to say okay I'm going to raise my kids eating meat and dairy and there are a lot of implications that also come with that um yeah and you don't really hear people criticizing that series so and people\nAre criticizing saying like well what what source of protein do you have like what what are you you're depriving the kids of this of acts and that's why but that's not necessarily true at all and that they're actually a lotta times getting a better source of nutrition and a better meal when when they eat this\nYeah yeah I and I never thought about the fact that\nChoosing to raise your kids as people who eat meat is the same as it's just like the same as Britain's raising them as vegetarian or vegan um and it's funny maybe like the more the plant based diet gained popularity them more our\nConception and like our option of how the [noise] um how how this says will shift a little bit just like it won't be automatic late you're either a meat\nEater or not you know it'll be like which one are you [laughter] [noise] there is already like full countries like that like India a majority of the countries are vegetarian access\nThere's nothing that's true [noise] okay\n[laughter] true [laughter] can be delicious um\nOkay yeah so now we're just going to go into I Know you mentioned a couple of ...\nOn Thursday October twenty fifth it is a food just to feed\n'em and it will be in earth how a um an informal meal that we share\nCatered by a local Indian restaurant and professor Anthony hatch will be coming in and leading a discussion about food justice I think he'll be talking about\nUm the idea he he recently came out with a book or some sort of publication about\nUm sugar and\nAs it should be really interesting I'm not sure the details of what he has to say but it will tie in food justice and we're trying to we're going to be co hosting it with other groups on campus and also some Middletown organization to get a lot of voices in there\nI'm using yeah an Anthony hatch always has a lot to say and all of it is really fascinating so definitely come if you can earth house on at ... pm on October\nTwenty fifth sounds I Will definitely be doing [laughter]\nState um so our show was coming to an end well not really but kinda so before we go we want to play a quick game with you both um it's called fresh spoiled and coming into season fresh being the best thing late spoil being the worst thing you eat this week\nAnd coming into the the meaning what do you look forward to and I know for us at least um there's fall break so that means like a chance to go home and some home cooking so I don't just say what you want [noise]\nAlright yeah OK fresh I'm going to go back to the plug for BNB wings I have to say that was the most exciting thing I'd be in a while because it was an entirely plant but I I'm the\nObviously right but this was like a special opportunity I think because I was eating alongside a meat eater and she was very impressed interest um yeah and I thought it was delicious um sometimes like meat alternatives can be found\nAs I said do you like being more towards like vegetable based or do you like enjoy meat alternatives her\nYeah I I lean more toward vegetable based and this was a entirely vegetable based and delicious amazing and then my spoiled really quick was this weird thing I got out west shop [laughter] I had a lot of really good thing [laughter] ... thing wasn't for me it was like a\nA pre made pad Thai that I put in the microwave and it was like in a bag and I like it out of the bag and it it just wasn't fun [laughter] was it like there was a miracle noodles I don't know [laughter]\nMaybe fought it out [laughter] um and then\nReally quick my I'm just really looking forward to going home and 'cause my mom really like to cook for us and she's definitely going to whip up something delicious\nAmazing anything in in particular you're you really wanted to make maybe ... if she's listening though [laughter] um\nShe makes a variety of cookies and they're always really special\nGood and [laughter]\nThe mom if you're listening cookies

noodle dish so it's so good and they have this deemed bread oh my God you know probably one of my favorite thing um\nAnd they only have the cattle cattle one that was shot and it just wasn't the same
