I'm saying okay the second person joins then right yeah and then other people could genuinely believe that there was a contagious thing and then in that area and then it's mass hysteria\nYeah I'm saying that that the second person knew that it wasn't a contagious thing\nAnd probably just decided to start dancing and they may be stopped after a few people joined in\nYeah that is totally possible\nNone of this can be true because it was the middle ages\nYeah also I'm really struggling to picture what dancing look like in the middle ages\nYeah I Wonder if they were dancing with partners or just kind of thrashing around by themselves\nOr if they were actively inventing dancing [laughter] door you've within the [laughter] yeah of course they didn't have time to dance before this yeah one other tad bit of information now is that I'm part of the theory\nThat it was brought on by strategist because that area was experiencing a lot of famine and poverty ... at the time it's kind of like a\nAnd also scientist didn't really think it was worth putting that much\nWe'll go to more to uh with the fact to hold you over a militant W E s you idiot point one F Middletown I'm a\nI'm DJ oatmeal and I'm DJ wean the next song is by band called barber shop and songs called walnut think has use\nUm the the new release a check him out I'm a barber shop Doug Band camp dot com or the definitely appreciate any play they get so you definitely don't know these people yeah and this is not a call to action does not call to action but\nWe recommended 'cause you know\nIt's because we love GOOD Music ...

that issue the FBI probe is far as we know didn't address the fact that this person lied under oath and the politicians themselves the lawmakers themselves seem to have decided to overlook it that huge to me that's such a big break down of the process\nAbsolutely I think you know on the subject to the FBI investigation\nThat clearly was designed to provide political cover to cabinet supporters she intended to vote for him anyway and I think that a given the limited scope of the investigation the fact that they did not look into\nThese questions that you're raising about the ways in which cabin on may have a fudge the truth so to speak or in his testimony all speak to you that it was kind of a matter of checking a box and providing some political cover and not really about a\nAssessing what the facts are and are really coming to any sort of\nYou know providing having the recording investigation provide some some clarity both for the senators also for the country and I think that's another pizza so unfortunate is that it is behind locked doors I\nWill be very interested to see if it ever becomes public um if it gets leaked or if somehow they do really said um I think\nWe aren't able all of us to see what is in that report and and most importantly what is not in the report\n... now a the the the preamble a the Susan Collins went into in justifying her vote for Kavanaugh made it I mean she was describing a person that sounded like someone different someone other than Calvin on her mind\nHe was going to protect the Affordable CARE Act he was going to protect roe versus Wade he was going to be critical on issues of executive authority and not um you know bi partisan he you know she she she\nPut forth an alternative reality it felt in laying the groundwork for justifying and what sort of political price do you think some of these key senators will pay Jeff Flake even though he's a critic of Trump\nUm ... you know for cabinet Susan calling um and of course Joe mansion these are the who was a Democrat who switched sides um you know and maybe it's the Murkowski will play a pay costs with Republicans but did this come down to a handful of\nSenators basically facing a huge political price\nWell you know I think if we look back on what happened with the Anita Hill\nHearings and Clarence Thomas being a confirmed\nTo the court I don't know that there was a tremendous political price a than any of the senators who were pretty egregious during that process paid I mean you know Senator Biden Hugh who oversaw that those hearings\nAnd made a number of missteps\nI think you know\nAnd all of us would agree went on to become the vice president you know unfortunately because we're talking about the Supreme Court we're talking about a lifetime appointment and we are talking about an institution that moves much more slowly\nWe won't have the evidence of sent a ... a justice Kavanaugh's decisions I'm\nFor much later much after the electoral cycle this year certainly and you know maybe even next year and so\nYou know the way that those few institution interact with each other I think Jimmy raises a lot of questions about what what will the price really be I I think clearly they other than a hands at a couple of senators they are voting\nAlong the lines of what they believe will best help them to retain their their seat in the upcoming election and if there are a if if what senator Collins is purporting to be true about a potential justice\nKavanaugh does not come to pass I\nI don't know really realistically how she would ever be held to account\nFor that um you know I'm afraid that the cycle had moved on [noise] [noise] well\nI'm certainly remains to be seen how it would have to play out in the in terms of you with Kavanaugh on the court though what are your fears or somebody who runs the organization gender justice at the legal and policy advocacy organization\nCommitted a gender economic and reproductive justice all these issues seemed to be\nUm issues that will come up at some point before a court the ... on it do you worry for the future of our country with a court so obviously and you know tilted again so tilted in in the sort of conservative or view for decades to come\nYeah I\nAbsolutely I mean I think all of the concerns that had been raised throughout this process long before Dr Ford came forward were legitimate and very concerning I think that a judge\nAn interest to roll back civil rights for al ... people for women I'm certainly around reproductive rights and abortion rights specifically\nUm you know I\nI don't understand also this debate as they're trying to recast I mean all you have to do is read his decisions and see 'em where his ah where his allegiances lie on some of those really core critical issues and yes I'm absolutely concerned with the administration has already taken\nMany steps you roll back rights for transgender Americans in particular and um\nSome of those may end up in

it's the people who are already facing so many barriers or to the services and to the the ability to\nThe court with Kevin on it and the other thing I'll just mention is that\nUm I Am feeling you know relatively negative about about the prospects and yet it will also be interesting to see if any of the other justices shift\nDue to cabinet are being on the court um which I think it this way we can assume is going to happen um\nAnd you know my uh a Justice Roberts\nMove a little bit more towards the center in part because he\nReally values the court a court not being perceived as just to another person a entity and um you know we won't know that until we know that I Wish that that wasn't the only if he wasn't the only person we might have to hang our hopes on but um it you know it remains to be seen ...\n[noise] um so I Want to thank you so much for joining us today Megan Peterson it's really interesting the time that we live in we uh we couldn't have been able to predict a how all of

wanted to talk a bit about the Louisiana Purchase made back in\nEighteen oh three over eight hundred thousand square miles for just Fifteen million dollars so that was a parent\nYeah well it's it's long been argued although I think in an undercurrent um that the Haitian Revolution was\nThe precipitating cause of the Louisiana Purchase and this is\nAn argument that goes back to uh WABC to boys in the closing of the slave trade\nAnd or in the book is titled suppression of the African slave trade the United states of America published in Eighteen Ninety nine it's the boys doctoral dissertation it's a fantastic books that that everyone should read but in any event the boys\nThink in in to my knowledge it's the first person to realize the significance of the Haitian Revolution in um underwriting the Louisiana Purchase France I'm Frances new world empire was centered in Haiti and Haiti was\nIn say Seventeen Seventy six was the richest colony in the world um see a large James writes about Haiti that are no\nNo other place on the face of the earth was so valuable per square inch as Haiti but the Haitian Revolution I'm what makes you know takes Haiti out of the picture for France\nAnd France his vision of a new world empire had a included the Mississippi Valley as a food producing\nUm ... this is the leading edge of of the nineteenth century economy and what the steamboat allows\nIs for that um trade system\nTo become um to to shrink\nThe trade system because first of all it allows good to be shipped up river that in the Eighteen tens or Eighteen even even into the Eighteen twenties the dominant way of doing business ... business on the Mississippi was simply to put goods from upriver onto a flat boat and let them float down\nWith the current um tried to ship anything against the current impossible so people would literally ship\nEarly nineties or what was the change is all about the steamboat makes it it economically profitable for um certain people um you know fewer and fewer people over time as a as a competition increases to ship goods\nUpriver and and that leads to a tremendous economic development\nAnd and there was also an interesting relationship with the steamboat in that whole culture of the the steamboat and kind of counter culture of the boat because\nThere's some black people were or were involved in it and it may be perhaps you know working in it in some way or\nUm is smuggling in the bees and then the color differentiation because the whole one drop of blood thing ... you can have some pretty light skinned black people that you couldn't really tell right\nAnd and you know the the one one of the things that I tried to to emphasize is\nThat um the steamboat is the technological and economic credit for this massive expansion and intensification of slavery\nBut at the same time it provides it it it presents slave holders with new sorts of problems\nAnd um and presenting slave\nPeople with new sort of mobility and possibility and so one of the um ... ... ... ... it's really striking when you're reading a Nineteen centuries slave narrative and on somebody and this would be um Solomon Northup or John Parker says I really wanted to be sold to New Orleans\nAnything useful to New Orleans why I mean that in the nineteenth century New Orleans among people in Virginia is seen as a place of water and play for\nFrom other people bay they realized that that was a place that you could get on a steamboat whether you knock on or actually hired yourself on\nI'm pretending to be free or whether you were in fact employed on steamboat evidence lay person there are hundreds probably thousands of people who make their way\nOut of slavery on steamboats then the other the other thing you mentioned is is equally fast because there are really really fascinating nineteenth century court cases about the things that happen on the boats\nAnd one of the things that happens on the boats while these people the way that some of these people escape is by passing for white\nAnd um you know there are enough court cases documenting this that it is significant in its own right but one of the things that I\nArgue is that the stories of these people who pass for white on steamboats make steamboat past their their well enough known that steamboat passengers started to look at one another suspiciously wonder you know well that guy you know do you do\nYou think he's yeah he says he Cuban you know I was in\nAnd and that that I think is it is it's not the end of slavery and it's it's not the end of white supremacy but it is an interesting Eddie of doubt right in the heart of of expansion systems\nAnd and another example of people creatively you know finding a way to get out of a bad situation\nI'm into a situation that was bad but not as bad as as the one before so here you have with um the ... the great Mississippi going down then into the Atlantic ocean New Orleans\nMarketing in North America right right so in New Orleans and very much the center of what you describe as an international trading system because Ninety percent of the continent you said ended up in Britain so right\nSo so one of the things that that I um am interested in and have tried to to track the history of is of the transformation expansion\nAnd I'm forced migration of slavery within the United states so really through the interstate slave trade um people sold from\nA place like Maryland and Virginia down to Alabama Mississippi and Louisiana something you know around two thirds of a million a million people between Eighteen twenty to Eighteen sixties so we\nOne of the largest forced migration in\nHuman history does all of those sales\nAre while they occur with in the United states\nAre related to the workings of the global economy they're related to you know these are people who by and large are being moved from declining areas of tobacco production emerging areas of cotton production and one of the ways that one of the things that historians long ago did was they\nThey ... the historical profile of cotton prices and they draft draft out the historical profile of ...\nAnd those two graphs fit in and go up yeah one another you know and and so the price of slaves tracks the the price of cotton throughout the antebellum period and the price of cotton is set in Liverpool you know five Ninety percent of the cotton produced states is the ship to Liverpool\nOne one determine the other definitely danger relations um I I Want to get\nPlease you know down deeper into the house um I also want to just remind our listeners that our guest is Walter ... Johnson a professor of history and\nProfessor of African and African American studies at Harvard University's brand new book river of darkness slavery and empire in the cotton kingdom fascinating really I'm focusing in on a global capitalism and early um us imperialism in the north\nAnd South America as as the book in part is describes now in terms of that migration I wanted you to describe a little bit about\nThe speculators I mean that the small guys the ones who went and may be bought um let's say in Virginia or somewhere like that may be five or ten glazed let's say\nAnd then changes them right and did this march to deeper into the south where are you going to get a better price\nYeah that's I mean there is a\nUm well known price differential from really they can twenties on two twin Virginia and Louisiana Mississippi and [noise] they you know this is a fact which\nBegins to infuse every facet of slavery on both ends of the trade slave holders in Virginia by the Eighteen fifty are openly referring to themselves a slave farmers are openly saying well our our export crop of human beings and they're\nOpenly referring to inflate women as breeders and yeah that that there's a lot of this trade is overland\nIt is people who walk or are you know every once in a while somebody will get sick and they'll be putting the cart but they walk twenty miles a day from um you know the Fayetteville\nOr you know the the other a branch of the trade is maritime it's around the east coast on boats from places like tied water Virginia to\nPlaces like New Orleans and all told you know as I said we're talking about well over um you know close to two thirds of a million people maybe maybe more than that\nYes it is in forty years\nYeah this bind transporting telling us up things and then you also describe it in your book this thing about kind of jail not really jailed but holding hands in a way for ladies that could hold up to a hundred at a time in that show yeah I Know this is\nThat that if you were to it you know there there's a document from New Orleans I think it's it's in either Eighteen fifty two\nAre Eighteen fifty four I Can't remember right now called the census merchants and they walked around the different neighborhoods of New Orleans um cataloging for the purpose of doing a a new set of taxes [noise] what what are the very business as well there's a couple of neighborhoods in New Orleans where\nAnd the instrumental I vision of nature go hand in hand of of cotton and so [noise] in the Eighteen twenty some planters in a place called Rodney, Mississippi develop a hybrid strain of cotton um which has various names but basically goes by the name Pettitte golf or\nUm at the Gulf cotton\nAnd the the thing that makes that strain of hot and so um popular as it is quote pick ability\nThat the cotton fiber of the ... the sharp spikes around the cotton fiber which is is what the bowl is that that opens up very wide and on the soft fibers insider are easy easily detach\nAnd so it sounds what this hybrid strain of cotton is is if it's a plant that is engineered to the specifications of the human hand\nWell when we were talking about the slave market really what sleeve buyers and the Mississippi Valley are interested in is is human beings who\nIs to think about um\nThe particular formed the nineteenth century racism takes unrelated to the particular form of the economy now in ... people spend um the majority of their waking lives in the Mississippi Valley cultivating cotton most people do\nAnd that is back breaking work it is you know people are are stooped over all day they are working um\nAnd and across a field in but anyone who has been to Louisiana and Mississippi know as an under intolerable a white grinding son the that with the combined with the humidity makes it you know difficult just to walk down the street\nAnd then working sun up to sun down as the as the saying goes and then\nMaybe taking a ... hour break in in the middle of a day women would be able to nurse their children maybe once or twice in a day there's descriptions of of and the women working in fields with milk running out of their breasts\nAnd so it it is it's a situation in which I think that one of the things that I tried to think about it is then at some point and in slavery work and torture become indistinguishable\nSo we think about the the bull whip as a as an instrument of torture in it and it certainly is and then work itself is used as a punishment people\nForced to to work brutal speed up to run throughout the day to to work and and really just the the idea of I'm working caked in dos the cotton bowls you know cut up people's fingers it it is I think um\nIt's difficult I I Would have to say you know just thinking of what people went through in I imagine you just researching and reading but the the Mississippi Valley looked\nQuite different um when Native American people there I mean there were foreign ... they weren't just these huge deal right\nA cotton fields and and that was part of what the delays labor had to do right get rid of foreign\nI mean the first generation of and ... people you know basically they they cut down trees or or sometimes what they do is they they girdle trees they they put a band of of iron I'm very tightly around the tree to to kill the circulation through the tree and then they\nYou know them a tree falls down and they often leave the stumps I mean there's descriptions of the fields planted and cotton that are that are full of stumps that nobody's taking time to to pull the stumps out because they're so desperate to [noise]\nTo develop the economy but really when you\nAre today if you if you get an airplane and fly over the ... the middle part of the United states he fly over the Mississippi Valley then you can still see on the land the um square pattern of the land off a survey of the nineteenth century the pattern by which\nNative land's were expert appreciated come modified unfold off to the highest bidder\nAnd the reason that you can see that pattern on the land rather than simply saying a whole bunch of trees the reason that the the fans of trees seem like um interruptions in that landscape rather than just the way that the landscape business because they were cleared by by and for people\nWhen you look out the window of acquaintance it's it's very it's a very very stark reminder\nOf the the history of United States of America as a whole one of the things that I Want want us to think about the history of slavery didn't just happen\nIn Mississippi the history of slavery also happened in Massachusetts right that that the the mills in rural are spinning cotton that it's harvested by and say people in Mississippi and I I think that\nThat one of ... that it's important for us to to keep in mind the connections\nBetween industrial development and um financial services and Merck and talk capital in the nineteenth century you know throughout the United states to the system of flavor\nYeah and and also reaching across the pond as they say I'm at the Atlantic because the the caught and that was being sold to Britain and in in in ... in Manchester or wherever else I mean it is also connected here\nNo mostly Manchester ... you're you're absolutely right that eighty five percent of the cotton that is is finished in Manchester originated in the United states earlier I I felt that that eighty five Ninety five percent of the cotton\nAnd produced the United states goes to the north of England\nAnd corresponding ... eighty five percent of the cotton processed in the north of England comes from the United states and so these two polls Mississippi in Manchester Liverpool in Louisiana are inextricably linked in the um\nGlobal capitalism of the nineteenth century and I I think one of the you know you started off the the segment talking\nMore generally about\nTo me one of the things that I've learned over the time of the two longest time of of working on this\nBook is is to to stop trying to think about slavery\nAnd capitalism as separate thing and the story that we've been told the story that\nThat capitalism triumphs over slavery that somehow the history of freedom is linked to the history of capitalism and this is you know this is in some sense that the founding um mythology\nOf of capitalism in in the United states and I I think really in the\nIn the Atlantic world generally well that's not true\nCapitalism and and slavery come into the world together they are are one thing and that is certainly the case there was no nineteenth century history of capitalism without flavor the history of capitalism and\nIn Great Britain or the history of capitalism and in New York or in Baltimore or in Boston what the history of flavor their their their one thing not to\nYeah absolutely so and things are going very well for um a ... in the Mississippi Valley a lot of money is being\nMade and you you have just said slavery central to capitalism or you talk about the only boxers see\nMore integrated in the global economy then people are generally ... sometimes I think that also what you just said might be the reason that in the United states but there is so little discussion about slavery and what happened and and the details about\nWhat went into it and and the money that was made because then would one would have to say you wouldn't want\nIn the United states too often um\nThe persistence of the wealth and privilege white privilege created by inflate people in in very very material terms right well you know what what are the firms that exist today or or or you know the way that I was talking about the landscape of the Mississippi Valley\nAny day you're going to listen to the drive but by Monday

[laughter] oh well [laughter] they were hungry [laughter] um he might have\nAnd I I Know we had people who were in farm worker camps who were abandoned by their boss says not all of whom were documented in a way that made them feel comfortable to go find a from the show from the state\nSo we can you know one of the ways that were more effective is just not even asking\nAre not even attempting to do some of the stuff that the stakes he'll gonna have to do we don't need the document and who is maybe getting to the eight we don't need to have [noise] I Do for everyone\nUm [noise] we don't need to know that this was something that is\nThis your hunger and it's explicitly or go to the seat that we need to know that you're a person you're hungry\n[laughter] yeah well as other

oriented and forming other non state and autonomy action um since they're in such a lock on the fact that action offered by the government like government services how do we how do we ensure I continued success of a horizontal power structures and one that can be um\nEveryone has been through this this time has some experience um we when we didn't know where some of the communities who aren't going to get served by other people are we know where to go first um we know some other ways to set up you know workshops\nGray um how would you recommend a people getting involved and what can they do think enrolling projects\n[noise] ... you mean it's it starts with getting to know your neighbor right and it starts with with forming those those local connections and I'm being being able to take on projects and working together to solve problems um\nWe are able to help other communities when we have built up the capacity to take care of ourselves so yeah I get involved but don't you know don't don't feel I don't\nI'm\nDon't exceptional wise it don't make it something that's happening somewhere else don't don't make it something like the ... the sort of the problematic liberal approaches to consider this is something that happens and in Haiti or or something right and um yes it does\nAnd yes we we sources are very under source when that happens in Puerto Rico or eighty or something or somewhere that you can't drive to but\nThere are problems in your community\nRight now and the extent to which you find ways to organize to meet those problems cooperatively is the extent to which you build the capacity to be able to to help your neighbors and\nWhen you can network with groups organic like when we were able to connect with folks from Hillsborough and Durham and these pilots that came up from Texas we were we have the ability to do that\nI got that\n[noise] yeah definitely and that's a great way to put it in [noise]\n[noise] yeah thank you so much again um and then

ourselves because we really cannot credibly take care of the the people who are going to need it more than us until we can't take care of ourselves so let's let's learn how to take care of\nOur
