com to present a one hour special on religion and God\nWill begin Kenny she can pull my executive producer the seven hundred club worked with Pat Robertson Eaton that's written the book the Gulf of how Jesus joined the G O P\nThen we'll turn to Elizabeth Esther whose book spiritual sobriety stumbling back to when good religion goes bad covered the addictive nature organized religion finally author jade lecture joined us to discuss his book when God\n\nIs rising up what's going on and on your whole called on equal had our radio show is heard on the typical station nationwide at our TV show can be viewed on free speech TV on our Web site\nOn July ... Pat Robertson is not happy that Donald Trump facing much criticism for its unprofessional and gone is an unconstitutional policies Roberts said recently quote the lord plan is being put in place for America these people are not only were voting against Trump\nThey're voting against what God planets for America Roberts an added these left wing or took all the progress of trying to destroy the country that we love and take away the freedom they love they want collective with them they will socialism what we're looking at its free markets\nAnd freedom from this terrible overarching bureaucracy\nWill Donald Trump whose lifestyle is Nick exactly terribly Christian has them raised evangelical constituents these other value the stated by Robert than it is worth more than ever to examine the origins of the movement to these capitalism and selfishness other religious virtue\nMy guess just carry heat and he's the full my executive producer of the seven hundred club the Christian broadcasting network he worked alongside Pat Robertson and he's the author of the new book the gospel of self\n... joined the G O P\nCode that you have now left that a certain ideology that you where do you spend when you were working alongside Pat Roberts\nRight uh I I was there at a very important time a witch when when he uh up to and when he ran for president and so I have a some insight that is really relevant for today because\nWe were really the ones who began the whole concept of right wing media and uh so you know people have just accepted that that's a fact\nAnd uh the truth is that there really is no such thing as right wing media and and I think because it's political me or the mainstream media is not a political group and it never has been even though\nWe have been brand branded as such by the right so\nWhen we came along and are inserted ourselves as a TV journalism with a different spirit we ... we moved ourselves to the right and uh or planet ourselves to the right and said everybody else's liberal\nWell that's not true because you know we were political media and the mainstream was not so\nYou know we put the mainstream in a box and for crying out loud now today the mainstream is considered fake news so at least they've completely hijack the brand and present it now as fake news if you could actually believed\nThat the idea that to me than liberal media what's come from the region native with the Christian broadcasting network and to have an advocate\nUh you know we began that whole you know TV news with a different spirit thing and um it was\nCame at a time in the in the early eighties when people were really looking for something different a different way of looking at things a\nWe had just come out of the sixties and seventies Reagan was president and uh you know there was a sort of Christian revival in the air which you know fostered the development of the um tell evangelists and\nYou know there's um there there's an old joke that ah that the devil doesn't want three people in hell and they are Billy Graham oral Roberts and Pat Robertson because Billy Graham would get everybody said or oral Roberts would have you ever did everybody healed and Pat Robertson would raise the money for air conditioning [laughter]\nSo what's really a money raising him political genius and uh\nWe used you know Christianity of course to ah actually you know perform I'm a really profound act of social engineering and that being to move Christians in droves and to the Republican Party and then fly the Republican Party to the right at the same time\nKind of a quote from what pet products and sat in Nineteen eighty one this is from your book where you basically said\nI tell you in our world today people are like a bunch of sheep they're saying what do you know what to do with our money why do we do with our children what we do with our education what do we vote for and all the what do we do and somehow or other God's got to give some people with knowledge at the time to tell each other but they ought to do\nAnd I think we have a golden opportunity to do that in fact one of the things we're trying to do\nUnder seven hundred club so what did it all start out as ... ... oh\nI'm a need for people to be given some direction and uh\nSimply a way for him to the ... people could donate to the seven hundred club no I I I think\nThat observers such as yourself and people outside make a mistake and thinking that this is a a a greedy act by any particular person or group I I Will\nTell you that the um everyone at that\nOrganization at least when I worked there were entirely sincere in their efforts I mean we felt\nThat the that the country was going to hell and uh that uh that God\nYou know through Jesus was the only answer and so you know I think you have to understand that pat a is first\nAnd always was a political animal\nThat he happened to be a minister a Baptist minister didn't or a change that at all in fact it opened up a whole new avenue for him to pursue his real interest I don't believe that was disingenuous ah\nAnd ah although I mean you're free or anybody is free to argue with me on that I just I I think it's a mistake to think that\nBecause um that would that us us assigns a bit of a\nFalse understanding to the whole Trump phenomenon too because those people in middle America who followed Donald Trump um\nThey are sincere in their beliefs to I mean they're ignorant but they're sincere and so that it requires a different approach to try to um to\nChange that focus because for thirty five years you know\nA a whole generation now has been educated on the belief that there were ... you know this break between liberals and conservatives in the mainstream media is liberal and that the conservative press uh actually you know\nIs more conducive to the thinking of a Christian then otherwise to know how the\nHow did the idea that Christianity ride the natural sort of a compliment to capitalize them\nAnd then ... I mean we why or just collective at them and we think about religion and spirituality and you know what ... what God might want to most people if you set aside all the politics might think\nThank you for having me thanks so much for joining us so honesty um it was hard for me to kind of relate to do story I grew up in a very non religious how cold\nPractically atheist um and so when I started reading about your story this was very fascinating to me and of course I'm sure many in our audience didn't grow up in similar household to yours maybe not as religious but somewhat religious\nEven ranging to some people who grow up in extreme reading religious household so why don't we begin with sharing your story in a nutshell\nHow you were raised in terms of the faith that informed infused every aspect of your life\n[noise] okay yeah I was um I was born here in Southern California I'm Nineteen Seventy seven which coincided with a religious movement that was happening at the time the Jesus movement which was\nBasically a a lot of people getting born again which means like asking Jesus and to their heart going down to the beach and getting baptized\nIn the Pacific ocean\nA with a very community driven um church started by my grandfather in the beginning it was very\nUm idealistic and loving and everybody was\nIn it together um [noise] a lot of young couples and singles and new family\nSort of a started that as time went on though it began to spiral into what we call legalization which is a very strict interpretation of religious practice and belief and eventually by by about the early nineties um\nAnd even really in the in the eighties and we were we had become very insulated very rigid very strict didn't watch TV obviously didn't drink alcohol didn't dance didn't listen to a secular music didn't watch\n'em watch very few movies I'm almost had an entirely separate sub culture and that's what I grew up in it was also very physically abusive especially to children\nUh we had a obedient withheld and very high regard so children were essentially spanked to the point where they were ...\nAnd in order to get obedience compliance but I'm not going to you as well\nOh yes yeah for years and um and then the parent you know when you had a child you were also trained to raise your\nChild that way um I ended up leaving when I was twenty five I got out and um that's kind of like the what the first book discusses list that childhood and being brought up and that girl in the end of the world to ask your earlier book to\nCorrect and so this book is more or less\nUm my way of trying to ... my way back to some kind of\nFace practice and figuring out you know what went wrong what was it that I grew up in what and I began to realize that this happened to a lot of people and so this book spiritual sobriety is sort of my way to say hey a a health will practice is possible\nAnd so let's talk about the hallmark of religious addiction because your your book spiritual sobriety read like a handbook for somebody was being\nSame way that a drug addict would rely on cocaine or heroin or an alcohol addict would rely on you know scotch um how does religious addiction share hallmarks of sort of classic addiction that we know more about the kind of standard forms of addiction\n[noise] yeah that's a great question and I think that was really what defines religious addiction it's when religious beliefs are practices or use to numb pain I'm escaped the present moment avoid dealing with reality avoid dealing with um real life situation\nI'm sort of magical thinking I'm also when we use religious beliefs are practices as weapons against ourselves um ourselves or others um one way that this man is that there's a lot of like obsessive um confession and then a kind of a compulsive ... if you will um\nAnd also\nFor example there's a there's a huge emphasis and migrate from particular aren't ... times theology which is\nA whole sort of theology built around the the end of the world happening and we did and and it's a way of avoiding reality which was you know we don't really want to live in the here and now we are so consumed with going to heaven and being ruptured into the sky with Jesus that it was a very convenient way for us to avoid living in the real world\nYou can also talk about creating with God if I pray this much then that will happen to me you know how to describe that a little bit more [noise]\nYeah I describe that as a transactional use the God or or like a vending machine got like you put obedient and to an end to the vending machine and out pops joy happiness prosperity we see this very much right now in our culture or a very prosperity driven\nAmong marriages and it's it's a very much a an idea of I Do this for God and he rewards me this way\nWhich can become a very addictive way of living\nAnd it's kind of seems to be you know it it seems to be inconsistent with what one thing to for image and you're you're supposed to if you're religious people to have unconditional love\nFor your creator right yes yeah well I mean I think that that it's all it's often I think very true American Christianity Today as we see it which as I'm associating\nReligion with political victory for example or associating um Christianity with um well ... or ... you know it's not for the better good of all it's also not for um current a reward Turner that's supposed to be because living this way is\nIs the good way to live that's what you do if you have a good relationship with God not because you're hoping to get something out of it and also not because you're trying to avoid living in reality\n... now a ... can you describe the feeling that that you and other people you when you were in sort of a submerged in the sun and people who do get very deep and in in the the sort of in these religious practice the feelings of euphoria that mom when you\nUm are religious meetings or the religious summer camper conferences and these these feelings if you're forty odd that really you know are related to both to how a person feels when they get high and then you come off of that high and I feel terrible\nOh yes yeah I had one too many of those um experiences and it's very common actually now a lot of of of what a big mega churches do is they are creating an experience driven environment so you have lights and music\nContext and that is you go in there to have an experience almost similar to maybe what you would have at a at a music concert um or or whatever it may be but then\nThere's things dynamic speakers that come forward and they tell you how your life is going to change and how with Jesus your life is going to be so much better and all these false promises that you were given and that it it when you're in that situation and you're having sort of this like mass communal experience with hundreds of other people\nI'm sort of the psychological dynamic that happens is you do experienced a few for you this high you walk out of there are feeling like you have some grand purpose for your life and it happened to me so many times that just you know a couple of days later I'll have the post conference crash\nUm and and feel so depressed and empty and them and regret because I spent all this money on this conference 'em and kind of like this withdrawal almost physical withdrawal of having to deal with reality because nothing changed I mean nothing changed my real day to day life\nUh I just went to an event and so unfortunately what I that was sort of a a ... a habit that I've gotten into after leaving the cold um and we had similar experiences in the coal as well that I grew up in um and and it caught at a cult I Do call it a cult yeah\n... and so that's sort of feeling of euphoria is what a lot of people who end up in these religions are turning to coast chase chased the euphoria just like an addict would chase a high\nVery much so and I should also say that I also experienced that sort of euphoria that high in other contexts as well um I began practicing yoga and I realize at the end of that that I had a very similar sort of experience to it which is one of the reasons why I\nSo it I think that when when you have like an addictive personality and especially if it manifest in a religious context I'm kind of have to exercise a lot of moderation in any sort of stimulus that mimics that euphoric high\nUm Los Angeles California this is rising up with ... and I'm near hosts ... car or the child when I visited my home country of India I got to witness the amazing Hindu religious practical that unfolded on the streets the Mumbai\nOne of the most striking was the last state of ... thought the festival masses of people with Kay giant idle because the Hindu elephant headed God can nation\nAnd much choice it seems to move the idol he's the water other somebody gesture\nI wondered what happened to be idle in the days and weeks following\nAsking the question of what happens when we need just practice this an environmentalist them collide is my guest Jane Wexler he's a professor at the Boston University school of law where he has taught environment cannot in church they lost his teeth out one\nAnd he's written a new book called when God even green a worldwide journey to places where religious practice and environmentalist income night I'm so pleased to welcome to the program and Jay Wexler\nI'm so happy to be here thank you for inviting me\nFor about the journey that you undertook to invite them so how did it all started to kind of an unusual topic to research\nYeah well it was a long journey to get to the topic\nI uh I I wrote a book a bunch of years ago called ... which is a go traveling around the United states in places where church state Supreme Court cases came from and I learned that I really like that in places where the controversy\nCamper I'm supposed to talk to the people really understand what was going on on the ground but\nOne thing I did not get you on that for that book is I talked to any Native Americans in in any Native American pocket controversies over church\nIn an area of law involving ball and golden eagle feathers\nWhich are are ... the issue there is that many Native Americans in a Native American tribes want or need to use bald eagle or golden eagle feathers part of their religious ritual but it happens to be illegal under the bald eagle active Nineteen forty ... any kind of better of any eagle in the United states so\nWhat to do then and what what the United States government did was create the agency called the national eagle repository which basically collected bald eagles\nThem and then the feathers and other parts of the Native Americans who are high for them so I thought that was fascinating and I visited that place and um I actually wanted to write a book all about bald eagles I thought they were fascinating but nobody wanted to publish a book about politics [laughter] out\nNo matter how many times no army proposals like road or how you know much I begged nobody would I wanted to publish that book so I was talking to my editor at ... and ... uh she asked me\nIt it might there be kind of a bigger story here that the bald eagle is an example of and I I because I all I wanted to do is write this book about the bald eagle and I said wow I don't know how about religious practices that\nHarm the environment and I looked up at her and she was smiling finally and that and she said now that's interesting are there other examples of\nA religious practices that harm the environment and I I had a few on ah in my head because I taught these two classes for a long time and so whenever a religious issue came up and environmental law or vice versa\nI remembered them so um so I said I think there are and I'll go do some research and sure enough the turned out that there were quite a few practices\nOr that I could investigate that religious practices that harm the environment\nYou went in you traveled around the world um he went to India and uh\nAmong these examples because I've seen firsthand how ... you know Indian Hindu thought about the rituals and how much how are they are are there are multiple grand festivals throughout the year so explain what you saw in India around the ... festival that I opened with and what do you need that happened to the idols after the over\nI Wish I could spend more time and it was unbelievable I never been there before\nAnd I spend about a week in Mumbai and during the festival and I showed up a few days into the festival and I basically wandered around by and uh to the places where the really really big uh amazing extravagant get Nash idols war and and as you know\nI mean there are millions of people who go and worshipped these uh Idaho throughout the entire week and it's\nIt's really exciting and they're beautiful to to look at and then at the end of a third of the week as as you pointed out they bring them to the sea and there's an incredible day ritual\nAnd chanting and colors and I'm\nSinging and glorious except then I don't just\nOr check it out to sea unless there which is an amazing sight I have to say it's sort of like a the rose bowl parade ended you know at the Pacific ocean but it but then it just kept on going into the into the sea that kind of what it was like and uh what happens\nTo them is they they sort of deteriorate they break up they are are they there have been studies that show that they ... they glued to water they harm or the ability for ... marine life to live in the water\nA it's very interesting I went the next day the next morning the what the what the damage was on the beach and it's just kind of it's a much better scene and the day before because you know there are no people except for a lot of we spent in a few college students who are volunteering to clean\nAnd they're broken and they just sort of litter the beach and it's a\nI Try to take a picture [laughter]\nBut the police were got a having any of that they took it I had to put my cameras away 'cause that could cause controversy but you can get your but it was it was a pretty uh that ...\nThose those are the Indian festival a pony which mark springtime the things where people gather in the street near one another of these brain jewel tone colored powders nails and get drunk and high wants to get an awful lot of fun\nBut at the point that in your book how to use I haven't really talked to pick and by the way the the practice a pony is actually spreading to other countries\nMinus the Hindu significant um and I just I don't know exactly how talk like all of the powders are that that people use in other parts of the world but in India needs to do it you know we'll wait what did these powders made up off they're not like ...\nOr they want to I think they used to be I think they used to be made up of spices and ... with the news and other natural things but now it's much easier and cheaper to use chemicals I Can't remember the name of the chemicals are in the book but\nUh but there have been studies done there too which which showed that stuff you know we're both retired to hurt their skin but it also gets into the water and and the causes damage to the water supply is so so it's dangerous to it and there there are certainly people who are as with the ... and you there are people who are pushing for\nA more eco friendly conscious holidays but I think it's a\nSeems anyways with a sample that it still kind of a long haul before before environmental interest or fully incorporated into the ritual\nNow the fire where Hynden set off fireworks sensitive Ali which is also the Hindu New Years is mostly made puffy practice on China Chinese New year and this kind of a more universal pharma\nHe abandoned the polluting fireworks having ... and in other parts of the world they opened and and it causes a lot of atmosphere Lucian does\nOr does it their study done that to the show uh the effect of the of fireworks on the air um [noise] I'm not sure there's some some uh holidays which involve smoke it things where there have been studies that show increases and hospitalization and you're just a room and stuff like that [noise] um\nBut yeah I mean it's it's not the biggest environmental crisis of our time or anything but it is it's a it's something that people ought to consider I mean I personally I I Can't stand fireworks I don't know my wife's family they pick up\nI I have fireworks too I might might be unpopular and I might be unpopular but I Can't stand the that they remind me of bomb yet right they're just really loud and everybody looked in the sky is\nBlue but I\n[laughter] so basically these are I mean he did the particulate matter that is emitted from fire where some ... can cause very severe short term damage even if for example in the grand scheme of\nClimate change thing on ... main not compared to the ... coal fired power plants um when you're cutting off fireworks in the neighborhood and particularly matter and the smoke\nIs being we'd digging in on that I'm sure it's a cause us problems particularly among children right\nAmong children and among sensitive individual people with asthma and other a common area issue that can be really dangerous and you can have\nA you know they send you to the hospital on rebuilding for a very small amount so so right it is serious but it's a short term level for sure\nW E s U S ... or to an estimated white one [noise] W E s U [noise]\nAnd welcome to another edition of carnivores radio and it's also another edition\nOf the record fairs Dr lock in on what you actually one of the reasons why E S U is so special isn't it\nIt is the record fairs

to be\nIt really is um so I'm In the news\nWe had um oh here I'll play you the reaction to um Conway west going to be I'm\nThe White House the other day\nHim in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing so\nLittle about the president sitting there listening\n... smart cookie period leading to talk of that prison reform in the U.S President Trump was back at the White House were held a photo op Kanye West today I think it'd be cool for them to Detroit factories because he's a master of okay\nSo you know kind of West obviously a little bit of a controversial figure I'm Still on and so forth but\nIf you really not the mainstream media and the liberal democratic establishment scared to death that African Americans are leaving the reservation\nOf course and it's not just African Americans I mean Taylor Swift came out in back the Democrat in Tennessee the media went nuts oh she's backing a Democrat she's been a political so far and they cheered her ruined Kanye West does the same thing for Trump oh it's terrible that they're using um if he's going into\nBigger it's not Conway wet Dr ... gun yet kind of way or it's about\nDemocratic liberal establishment scared to death that and I think it's really happening that they're normal constituency is starting to leave the reservation and African Americans are among them\nOh absolutely I mean especially when you take a look at the financial condition of the African American community under Trump has increased tremendous\nScared to death because the Democratic party\nNeed dependency yeah he has pardon but at no ... is that true or not oh it's definitely true okay and they and they've been really capitalizing on the I'm I'm the pain of the African American community since the um on the junk Johnson yeah the great society and\nUh I think they're scared to death and they'll do that\nAmerican entrepreneur is up self directed this and I think they're scared to death or what do you\nThink they really are they spend so much time painting Trump is a racist and now all of these African Americans are coming out and supporting him uh in fact this week she named the very first African American female general yeah but it did not even really the\nIssue it's not really Trump doctoral happy and it's about\nThe no but it is true that is a pro Trump is doing these things and it ... the ... because they're leaving the Democratic and Trump them given the reason that he would\nNot be a great a hundred percent and it really boils down to when you have a paycheck you don't need the Democratic party eight zero\nEight five seven seven zero zero six eight five seven seven zero zero is it true we're alerted audience out there a W E as you all of them going through the records here very soon this Sunday\nUm is it not true that the Democratic party it scared to death to their constituents the African American and Jewish American because you tell me one good reason Dr Laughlin why a Jewish person in America would vote for a Democrat\nThere isn't at this point the Democrats have been so anti Israel ... he didn't have the repeal it and why you would vote Democrat if you're Jewish\nGuy we love to hear from our listening audience are people maybe there's some people and African American listeners out there a Jewish American a listener out there or panic America is betting Americans are more entrepreneurial then the basic constituency\nIf anyone out their leading eight big zero six eight five seven seven zero zero six eight five seven seven zero zero um and what happened is okay you went from Ninety five percent\nCan a logical behind the sky\nAnd I don't know the logic even apply it to the ... elections in order to make a difference\nTo you need to come up with a opinion on what would be likely scenario I think it was basically Ninety five percent of African Americans voted democratic what do you think it could what do you think it could transition to mid term and then next election cycle presidential twenty twenty\nMid term I think it could go as low as just below Ninety say eighty seven eighty eight so you mean going more towards the republic yet so against six percent improvement if you're a republic about that yeah I'm by twenty twenty depending on what goes on\nThat could actually double it could go down to eighty per then there\nWas this cat which is ten of clues make for Democrats\nYeah if you're losing Fifteen Percent of your audience is an election\nYeah and how do you make up your democratic you really can get you can with illegal immigration have them vote\nThat the only guy that they are but it's going to take a lot to get that ... lost middle\nAmerica big time I'd love to hear from a listener who who may be a traditional democratic voter liberal maybe on ... and maybe I'm maybe\nThey've lost the a lot of the er or leaving the reservation what do you think they really are\nYou don't have traditional lines of of politics sending more you've got different groups are switching sides it's really all topsy turvy [noise]\nYou've got people who have voted Democrat for years or voted Republican for years switching sides because what's been going on is no longer business as usual\nYou know it's interesting speaking of as a business as usual I'm Marty\nDiscussion we're talking about on traditional group a democratic groups that are like the African American community Ninety five percent democratic in the past they're starting to lead the reservation\nI kind of a West is kind of maybe give them a little bit of an alarm bells over there I'm a Jewish Americans leaving the reservation in terms of democratic and it's interesting Dr Luskin\nI read an article that millennials in the in in this is a blue collar millennials are leaving the Democratic reservation I'm at your younger present a bigger quite a millennial but um have you seen a shift in your circle of\nFriends social orbit that were wants to die in the wool liberal and now starting to leave that reservation\nWell thanks for having me all of a carnival radio um I think with at least when I see in my friend just that they no longer want to be identified as either Republican and Democrat and just for example um in our gubernatorial election that we're about to have\nA they can see that our ... our state has not function properly\nOkay wait until that point and why okay I got I got it why would any sane person vote for Ned Lamont I mean you're getting basically no matter what Dan mulloy Dannel Malloy\nThere's not a Republican or democratic gives you literally put the dagger in the state of Connecticut liberal hate him conservative ... why would you vote for Ned Lamont\nWhat I think people get so wrapped up in the Republican Democrat thing and that they're never going to vote for Republican because they think oh the wealth is all just going to go to the\nTo the people well actually actually Dr lock and maybe you can comment at the Democratic party that is now the party of Wall Street and global business\nSure as long as they as long as a one percent benefit to hell with it I went out right the people that are contributing and that's part of a number and make sure that they can stay in power then you know the rolling out sector\nAll they're all lining their pocket\nOn our on our ...\nSo what what's the what's the song lyric close to the left of the joke is to the right to I mean this is what we're stuck with that is true in any oh\nClown left to me um\nWould have to give to the right job jokers to the right and you know something I saw this on a guy with my life where you remove yeah my life is really ever were in the middle of with you I saw a show on\nHits the Nineteen Seventy eighty also did bakers town or something I'm\nAn old ... down in Bay oh no no no I'm\nWearing the the one he goes on I'm On this one night stands you know ...\nAnd you're trying your [laughter] yeah so anyway a little you get all this wealth of information or radio harbor I Can't believe\nThat ... and for those who want to check out these lyrics you can go to the record there over the weekend and then the other day from\nEleven to for ... for right here on the campus of Wesleyan University and you're listening to carnival radio interviews expressed on carnival radio or not the views of W ... you or ways we in university but only carnival radio and\nThe doctor can you tell our listeners about our great pod cast in where it's available\nYes you can check it out on line at carnivores bites where we

listen to the entire show at W. E. S. UFM God or apps and to entertain your entire family entire families\nThe euro six eight five seven seven zero zero eight five seven seven zero zero I think maybe one of the reason is is not such a nice day today Mm and it was raining in the morning and it's beautiful it is beautiful it is\nBut I started I comment on on one of ... points about ... because I think the big one of the biggest issues in this country and why we have such partisanship is because of the gerrymandering\nAnd ... and when when we wait how why is it better or more elevated higher brow than a third rate\nBanana republic it's basically fixing elections show\nAt all it is right on both sides have yeah it's it's fixing a lot of\n... and ... and when and when the districts are either heavily heavily Republican are heavily heavily Democrat you you then you don't have to worry about a an opponent from the opposite party with opposite views you have to worry about who's going to be the most extreme to the right or to the left in order to\nNot you know in the end you're rewarded for being the most extreme gay in other words yes it's worse than actually did anything I'd ever heard of anything that give her here make a speech earning\nActually I I Will defend Larson Larson actually came out and voted for the budget to get through got a lot of funding for Connecticut in the last budget\nOh wow he's what age man who is one of the only\nDemocratic um congressmen to cross the line and work with the Republicans to make sure that they got what they needed how about Rosa DeLauro\nThe Laurel voted against all of it is she like what is she has she ever done anything for mental time either from Middletown though I think the only I've lived here since two thousand to the only thing I can name that she's done and all that time\nAnd get a statue put up in New haven for her father boy that's it no seriously I I Am sure it's not the only\nI don't care a tax credit and when the tax bill came through with that in it she voted against that\nInteresting I it's very interesting um I Wonder if any listener would have an opinion about Rosa Rosa DeLauro since it is Middletown\nDidn't she started out as a aid to was at DOD or one of those he was somebody that was the only way to do the ... the only one he never assaulted [laughter]\nI I don't know where it where it was she started I Know her father had the seat before she ... and basically it's just become a family business now it's like most of the politicians are never really done anything no never no seriously as far as I Know she has not accomplished anything\nWhile eight zero six eight five seven seven zero zero six eight five seven seven zero zero before we break off into another subject we're going to go a little round table\nThat we'll start with you urinalysis I'm given recent development and all those out articulate them for you the\nAn economy you know the ... well before you were born that the economy in the job prospects had never been better since\nAbout fifty years ago on December Nineteen sixty nine exactly so ... any kind of is it not true that if you actually want a job I mean real ... I'm not talking about and again you can get a job at this point yes okay\nSo an amazing job market um the Kavanaugh hearings which by the way like your opinion on I thought there was a complete freak show oh sure I Am a craft shot themselves in the foot I think it was so opportunistic Cory Booker another real genius of manner destroyed Newark\nAnd um the whole lot of them I think in in our own I'm Richard Blumenthal or denying debt also was embarrassed well a couple of things on Kavanaugh um first of all my own personal preferences I I Wish that he wasn't\nNo that's not even in you know I met\nBut the hit job on him that that was that was completely political\nI mean they had the guy that was so so how does that translate into the mid ... I'll actually ... I went to UT ... short senatorial races the Senate how's it going to look\nWho picks up what I mean and that individual seat fifty one or forty nine now correct that okay um what do you what do you think happened there what do you think happens in Congress was it the NPR in a marriage just put out a recent poll NPR there's got to be non biased right right right yeah but this is the point this is the point because\nThe entire summer and leading up in recent months it's been there's going to be this blue those huge Roy ... you know huge way they're just going to sweep and and now they have to after the Kavanaugh hearings which has been the catalyst for this change\nThey have their now admitting oh it's it's neck and neck actually I Would actually rats\nNew new or by the way Dr laughter and you're a big advocate it and they they actually the only one that predicted the twenty sixteen election right in close or they're saying it's typically even now winter and it was like a twenty points democratically did you end up not in terms of ... a favorability\nDemocrats Roy which gives you a good little litmus test and how it's going to have in the ... what do you think's going to happen in the ballot in the mid term well you know I I think the Republican well this is what I Hope for the Senate and not let me just say I'm\nI Wish if if the Democrats if they got elected if they weren't going to be solely focused on impeaching trauma that's our focus which is going to eliminate the questions the young person can you tell me anything that the modern Democratic Party stands for beside\nMaybe global warming and open borders no seriously I mean anything and the economic platform any trade platform and he ... he platform there are some a liberal commentators and like I'm Talking about no I'm Talking about ... ... ...\nYou're asking what would they run on minimum wage and a lot and what is that women need for health care health care how is that\nPrison reform which is as go the republic there's Trump was actually doing that right now I'm like OK Doxil I've been a minimum wage and tell us about how smart of an idea that his government getting involved in government\nGetting involved in minimum wage all it does is actually create inflation\nEspecially on the federal level it is ridiculous to say across the country you have to have you know X and X amount of dollars per hour as salary using the Fifteen dollar an hour figure that everybody tosses around\nIn New York City Fifteen dollars this ... poverty in Arkansas you'd be a rich man making Fifteen dollars\nAll doctor locked in a really crazy thing that liberal Democrats would have no conception of and it's called supply and demand and the other thing is when you have an arbitrary you are betrayed what minimum wage should be able to go to McDonalds recently they now have robo order yeah you get rid of\nHay and you know what I didn't think put those then they get my order right when people number did\nTake back the point is Nancy Pelosi these Chuck Schumer's or the world standards Bernie Sanders again never had a real job never even worked until he was like forty just stay away from economics please you have no idea so let's hear what our caller has said color you there\nOkay but do you what do you feel about our country we'd be talking about trade agreements earlier in the show they were not sold out these trade agreements were awful but they benefited lobbyist ... and basically global corporate interests at the expense of America and our government's supposed to be helping us they're not helping us or you know they're not\nBig corporate interests but they know what to talk with Chuck Schumer and all of them that they're all from the little guy you know not the full of it\nNow and especially in watching this medical I mean they have doctors that we had a things performed on them and just the things that happened to them as doctors you think that when you're in good hands and I know the FDA is\nThe fight the good fight processing and I didn't go down by the idea just give you a good deal continue doing all this money [laughter] awesome thank you very much but I\nIt's interesting about medical devices because I think technology is going faster than the training\nFor a lot of the doctors that are currently practicing Oh absolutely because I've got a friend that work in a operating rooms who are totally aghast that the the lack of a patient right because they're oh they don't know what's going on and they're just shocked by some of the behavior that doctors and nurses where they're trying to operate these\nUh machinery and they're actually calling people from the operating room trying to figure out how to work these things so you know it's very scary and also it's\nAlso interesting the overall subject of technology and that's what we're going to do earlier in the show is when you look at um\nFor instance ... doctor lap and I were talking before the show and a metal get your opinion on this as a young person I was teaching my college class and I we were talking about security and about um about privacy\nAnd and we were talking about Heinz ketchup or something and then all of a sudden\nThree or four students held up their phones you wouldn't believe it I just got a pop up that for ... so don't you find it creepy I don't know if you read the book Nineteen eighty four short it seems like a comic book natural air stones or twenty four seven listening to\nI mean you know when I when I Know that is true absolutely and when I tell my friends you know all I turn off the microphone on on specific apps you know and ... you sound like oh like Alex ... yeah exactly why are you doing that well it's it's just the fact that they that they listen\nI mean even like the Amazon echoes and the devices that you're putting around your house they they scanned every Fifteen minutes and they're recording it regardless of Utah\nNot exactly what they're doing the entire Android operating system the entire point of it is to collect your data\nOkay but you don't think they can be I mean it's a rhetorical question how dangerous is that\nThey're incredibly dangerous even by accident that dangerous there was an incident um a few months back with an Amazon Echo\nThat somebody found their conversation had been recorded\nAnd randomly sent to people in their contact lens [laughter] wait a second how does that happen\nI don't I don't know how it happened they had it it was I Know it was in the Amazon Echo that did it and I'm Don Was oh well it's a once in a a lifetime possibility that that happened but obviously not because it's actually happening\nAll of these data collection devices and that's what they are they called them personal assistant picking their data collection devices they you know is it like a Trojan\nHorse for you guys and you think okay this is for that is not even map kinda freaks me out like you know like a battery all it knows and I drive here I mean it's not a big deal but it's like I didn't ask you to do that [laughter] Fifteen minute\nTo middle ... yeah they're tracking everything you do and they say well you know it so that we can give you a better experience for that but I mean Tim Cook was talking about this the other day\nBecause one of the big things that separates apple operating model from Facebook and Google is that they don't sell the data they don't collect data other than on the phone at no\nThis is what's happening is when you deal with Facebook when you deal with Google the product is you you're not the customer yours the product that they are selling to advertise or what's your\nName brilliant analogy while he's got his PHD in radio and I know [laughter]\nThe Internet of things I I Will not talk about that though I Will not buy anything from that because Amazon bought them and I don't need Amazon monitoring what's going on in my house is really\nKind of Caribbean but also the big companies Google Amazon or you know some of the social media you know I'm organization\nCertain political bias and you're collecting information who's saying they can't help another party right and now they're caught they want\nAll of the appliances to be able to communicate with one another in your own oil so this whole idea of Internet of things it's like the third wave of technology at first\nWhen they were putting these computer together it was like All right we're going to put a computer on everybody's desk okay that wasn't a big deal but now all of a sudden it's morphed into what in God's right away right but\nI I like what you're saying but I hate to be blunt any more on that need like smart refrigerator right how can you have to explain to everyone you open the refrigerator and you put the cookies in\n[laughter] and ... you don't really need someone like I don't need that I don't need like yet they fire places you put them locking hello\nYoungest son got another Johnny to build a need to remember is if the device is attached to the Internet whether it's your phone a refrigerator your car anything attached to the Internet can be\nHacked right wow so you're an addict but also use violent like Marty was saying Amazon and then when they hear you talking to your wife is not only that but hold on for a while I held on after that you're there you're talking to your wide you're and you're talking about gee I'd like it I like that\nI I had these certain feelings not feeling certain interests it's an issue to an ad about yeah about a kayak ghettos\nNot just the money you're ready for another government can come in and basically they get access to the last ... go well there was a story\nA number of years ago this is actually even before all of this was so easily accessible on computer a man walked into target\nWent to a customer service he was absolutely furious sap them because they had sent his Fifteen year old daughter ads for diapers baby clothes\nHe came in he was absolutely in fenced how dare they encourage her to have a baby you know well what happened already pregnant she was already pregnant targeted figured it out by her purchases bought her father didn't know\nThat it's not good [laughter] so anyway that that that shocking Dr lab Miami\nWe allow it you know I guess we are we allowed to it and it's so interesting to flip phone okay let me ask you Dr smarty do you just got rid of my flip [laughter] do you think it might be a movement is Moore's this comes out that people\nMight have to devise is like you might have your smartphone he might have split phone\nThat wouldn't be a bad idea but you go back to why would people want that they've already got technology in their hand but why are they standing in line at midnight for the store to open up at eight so they could buy the new thing that a lot of everybody just wants to have the new thing without thinking about the ...\nI read I like that Mr King enough I'm Mr Keener you are a big uh Roberto Clementi fence on Google yeah you know he's the picture to buy a whole lot because it's not as Bert now and it's not the day he died\nNo I think it's Latin American heritage month and he just happens to be one\nOf his work I Know and you know something he was under rated there might have been some racism involved in that but because he wasn't a home run hitter\nYou know he was two Ninety nine rather than three\nAnd I never got but he wasn't the court cheddar right now you know we needed to get on base you put Clemente up so he was the last player to well three twelve not too shabby not at all okay so\nHe was good but he just maybe had a home run or something like that same way Don ... what's his name uh Richie Ashburn\nNot as good but not that a lifetime three under hitter for the Phillies I think you only got into the hall of fame after he died be like a thrill five batting average just never hit the big home run other Philly there you go so um let's see what many can reflect on our\nShow your experience on the show for\nA minute or two before your father does a news items so um what do you think the big takeaway for\n[noise] you know I I think I I thought it was interesting the uh the callers who called and I think we got a a a wide variety of opinions or\nYou know just on ... on the first caller or when he was when we were talking about is this Trump's economy and I think one of the biggest reasons why it is is because of the slashing of the regulations that have been really\nAnd I you know
