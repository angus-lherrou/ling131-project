I mean look\nWe look for optimism wherever we can get it these days do you think that if the Republicans ram this through\nThat if Jeff Flake the summer of ... Susan Collins all fall in line behind their party behind Donald Trump and a push this person on to the court but it could be the beginning of the end of the Republican Party because it's hard to see how women\nAny woman who is especially experience to our butts\nSeems as though not only when they lose in November but they'll\nProbably lose the happy if they put cabin on\nYeah well um I Would like to be that optimistic I I don't know um\nYeah it's you know I thought that there was no way that after the Access Hollywood tape came out in twenty six teams that women would be able to vote for Donald Trump and that was not the case I mean the reality is that\nThere are women and white women in particular to benefit from their proximity to um the patriarchy and end with power and um are you know invested in their own ways so I think unfortunately this is a it's a very complicated\n'em long established structural power system that will take you know many years and unfortunately probably many more of these sorts of\nA collective traumas political politically and socially traumatic experiences before we're really on were really able to unravel all of that\nOh to finally make and how important has all the activism being in Washington DC there have been hundreds of women some women traveling from quite far to\nGo to confront senators over the past week or so they will be more in next week as well I'm In the initial confirmation hearing there was a\n... you know one woman after another who spoke up and protesting during the initial Kavanaugh hearings and well rested and dragged out and it was quite brave and remarkable to see these women with their bodies on the line\nAbsolutely I think if there's anything\nNow that really launched the me too movement um\nYou know if there's one thing we can take away from from this past year is that the power of women\nAre coming forward and telling their stories and being engaged and making their voices heard in whatever way that it takes in order for that to happen including standing up and shouting and the middle of the hearing or cornering Senator Flake and the elevator um I I think we we cannot\nUnderestimate how important that is especially when you look at them\nCollectively in overtime and the fact that we're not going away we're not going to stop telling our stories were not going to stop demanding accountability and we're not going to stop demanding that there'd be real substantive changes\nAre making give it a website for your organization gender justice where people might be able to find out more about the work you do\nYeah I'd like to thank you gender justice dot us\nAnd we'll put a link to that from our website thank you so much Megan for joining us thank you\nMy guest has been making Peterson she's the executive director of the group gender just just which is a legal and policy advocacy organization committed to gender economic and reproductive justice we've been discussing the political circus around the Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination\nI'm ... online are rising up with ... call we can sign up for our daily newsletter subscribed to audio podcasts John I tune that our video channel on their meal\nYou're listening to pour water from the view if you remember alternative radio part of Connecticut\nDolby ... was supported by what the University's Center for the arch presenting Connecticut from Europe trends after ... one person show the themselves ...

insightful history of how international\nLaw has been used to encourage justice and economic opportunity he will also tell us about the powerful forces opposing this movement Richard will give us examples of how the international\nMonetary Fund and they're minions used economic policies for political domination of many countries in the world will even asked\nWhy the Orwellian slogan ignorance is strength is the order of the day for the corporate mass media and its coverage of U.S foreign policy and they're related issue of endless war so stay tuned for why we will be soon fighting Cold War to point one five\nAnd why this manufactured war is good for business but not so good for your daughter your son or the rest of the world\nRichard you have a lot of interest and knowledge about international law could you tell our listening audience how the United states deals with international law today\nShow looking for answers himself up for the wall but for the special leash but it was national and loan with all this stuff\nOh I live in went on to sever theme so don't root still go back to the store vertical white five hundred years however\nThe Europeans tried to do both of which started serious when you're sixteen forty eight which pretty it was all you know not that much data to international all around and say all\nAround Nineteen hundred ... when the first time I think that she's in Seoul and they're very boring sport is to operate and people began to be concerned about know about half the battle\nSong have gone virtually everyone not\nJust about nothing that any human being serious the wine [laughter] how during World War one and\nSo then the move was for the league of nations in the U.S Senate ... signed on for a lot and then Hitler hadn't most selenium and Frank Pearl and saw all\nMay flagrant violation of the of the nation charter and the thing of started to be um\nRestructured all with the laws of the of the UN at the end of World War two\nAnd a number of rules and so on which was the creation of us because the U.S have almost all the real power in the world that if we got six percent of the world people well we had Seventy percent\nOf the world's English three fifty percent of the world's wealth and so in terms of capacity ...\nOn the rush to the world our capacity home alone and when you did that all the other countries around us and with the way that we dealt with this on the one hand was potentially extremely productive in the in the group trials which was the principal\nThe best that we've been reading digging on those commitments more and more than just the way all relative power and the role has declined such marketing fully five\nHe wrote the UN Charter and we've got everybody involved into such was Eleanor Roosevelt for instance when Mike teen forty eight we're driving force people to be on the universal declaration of human rights and yet\nStarting shortly after that we started reading on commitment them that much to international law that would get other countries as as many rights as as we have of course we want to them than any other patients me has the power\nAnd you are you ... well actually shaped please let us started invading other countries or were you up to the top of the communist move there and thought at the border all around here and by the fact that most of the day in Guatemala by\n... op ed in fifty four\nSo on and so all we were committed from the beginning to housing a hypocritical posture\nTowards the law that you could create that is really with we use the word was used for us but though or interfere with what we want them to do the simple things covertly or temple here's your option to other countries\nSo we all around the country\nThan an extremely difficult position first\nGetting ... we took the universal declaration of human rights with everybody had to lead us to do like to do what he does have an animal is concerned and respect the rights to\nYou know national talk on the economic social and cultural rights whereas the cocktail this country's giving up a mock those rights\nOr one or the other half of the ... civil political fights wars and so we get by with two ... two covered minutes so that we wouldn't need the worst economic social and cultural rights dysfunction was fucking\nWalking down the road there or whatnot that protection for quite for so long as all bump\nYou could even the there's the civil political rights is if they wanted that we have stayed in that they used to posture since Nineteen sixty six and that was wrong which allow us to talk of the cost is about\nLike Vietnam and now allows us to pursue pretty much the actual world in in the middle east ... we we just\nAttack a country is so I Will and if if they want what they regard as all the international wipes human rights are there people were all\nIn fact in the middle east we have a tendency to attack\nOr from ... to resist you you know what was the last couple of other than\nOthers in China and China of course of the art is this a economic routine in the u._s. open rocking several nuclear weapons is actual so India but in the last sold off they allow the on\nThe right in the woods institutional support to deal with it but one is did the sea turtles dolphins was reluctant\nOr and so the the ... but I started dealing with gay individual states of India's so that they wouldn't have to go for the federal bureaucracy the state of all under production which was mumbled locally\nHad taken money from them\nWith what bank money\nSo that it was wanting to have to collect more taxes falling from the rich who didn't want to pay them more from the poor will Clinton though\nAnd that meant that this was being a Kurd which would have to be paid off by children and grandchildren and I said well we're going to do things like roads so that the coverage of of Andra could be shipped out to to the rich countries\nAnd to some extent begin to build some schools so that the average level of education well above two and a half years which is ... was in a team like the bar song and Christmas in the neighboring state of corn that\nAs a as a teen Ninety eight the map that was being spent perched do do\nThis because in the late ... rupees per person per year which was\nThen about twenty cents [laughter] so\nThat just ... when they don't want them to spend more ... were you when he told me entirely in in order to maintain schools and\nThe the parents trucks are the people have socially\nThat's because the you know all all of the people with color I envy you belong to the upper three much though but Raman fishery until I see it and they weren't going to give that power off and they want to keep a traditional society which\nThe longest one saying for a while they were making all the decisions about has money should be the money was going to be paying that are the people of the state is a call on this so I'm sure that that well\nThat was an assumption that weighs brings us that Reagan was some show it was just a theory and so the ... of of the ... the two things on any of them\nWas surprised that the power or the federal level which is what they wanted to be because they couldn't walk we use the federal government to get back the below the that it\nAnd what was the scene after the Soviet Union with his poll that was over and over again usually less power\nBecause the Soviet Union that Russia has started to to be a burden much like that you can wash bite in and getting all possible to the richest people so that meant that there was no one anymore just the for the people of the world\nAnd so there was no resistance will desire of investors to make this much money as possible on them and so that's\nNot recently Richard we've come to the realization that a new Cold War being waged by the United states to come in the western forces against other nations in the world and it seems that the two political parties in the United states are essentially picking on certain areas of the world\nHas the potential for a new Cold War for example Hillary Clinton during her campaign want it to basically started a new Cold War against Russia and now Trump is talking about starting a new Cold War on countries like China and North Korea and Iran so in what sense are these cold wars fake\nWords or worse than have no reason because there's the economic backdrop which is really driving the conflict\nI mean you've got three types\nBeing cleared it I mean it's like if you know you would tax Nicaragua that is the ... the international court of justice\nWho owns the Nineteen Ninety six\nYou're going to be breaking a whole lot of nickel how when when you go around killing people minding our birds and the whole backside to stop the second way you're going to be breaking the law because they're actually ... rats in them you know and they're your baking good manners Perry of most of all they're not\nAlso halting breaking you all\nFor the church leader in Contra deal with US law\nAnd then Reagan found well you know\nBoth my my memory tells me I didn't do this but you know facts told me I did\nAnd the reason he was concealing it wasn't calls with a violation of you know so called rations oh we currently\nHave gotten hurt operations for Lloyd honorable agreed upon resistance even though you get a lot of you mentioned institutions for instance lick claim that they're doing these things are going to have a sense of honor their sense of all under is directed to their ...\nUnder it means that they're not supposed to live their superiors that they can't\nWhy everybody else that doesn't mean that they can't find they don't make everybody else's rights at all if it's not\nAt the same sort of honor that makes sense in any democratic\nSense only in a sense what are you know you're obligated to your leniency lord\nAnd that's really what we're running around the world there's a lot of them look good will lose their lives as even you know the the wrecking ball it costs to ensure that keeps going on as a witness to I mean when Bush and students decided that he wasn't going to worry about violating the magnet\nCorridor or when he said well they were going to get rid of the hideous Cornish rules which\nWhat's the worst of all going to stay on the one we study we're spending very well

um regenerate economy\nAnd and we we do that with um\nEvery intention of you know it ... community empowerment um we have community gardens that the youth take part in that serve a purpose for you know training or local use for empowering them to be involved in a what comes to the plate you know\nUm and we have different aspects of education that play along with that\nAnd um that go from tricky them to recipe manuals to community classes and so we're we're trying to touch on every piece of education um so that we can all move forward that we can all\nProgress that we can all create a a healthy positive um community for our next generations [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWell you know that's it's still the title to hear about that and you know I interviewed other people and they talk about their community garden projects [noise] they're they're having some success by having kids in the garden like as a kid who will never you know ... to ... the the growing and picks it and go wow that's not so bad\nI'm I have seen that kind of thing here because they know the rest you also have this obesity diabetes problem and you say you're getting education and all that are you finding that you're able to get kids to like these things and also their parents to start cooking some of those things that are in the garden\nYeah I mean I'm I mean reservations native peoples you know minorities are probably one of the most um studied people's home\nIn the world and so like for reservations um you know we have a lot of health disparities um but once it's really like focus to narrow it down I mean it all comes back to the food it all comes back to the food that we consume that we eat and we put on the plate that we\nYou know that we that we connect ourselves too and so I'm\nFor here on the reservation um we've we've we've done a study where we were done a study with our with our food system um and found out that basically Ninety five Ninety nine percent of our food is shipped onto the reservation\nI'm Talking foods that are high in fat high and sugars you know I mean just saturated you know processed foods that come on to our reservation um\nAnd that you know less than five percent I'm of the of the houses that are here you know the community grows their own food and so for us to be you know food sovereign we have to we have\nUm locally driven on the food system we used to have and the food system that we want to see and so um\nThe curriculum is is key who've written the um food sovereignty cricket them um locally so that we can put it in the schools so that we can teach the next generation you know where their food comes from and how they can\nYou know how they can do gardening how they can be more involved and also you know given the historical pieces of us as local people without food look like\nI mean we have a community garden here that are displays different systems have growing because you have people who have different needs needs a you know we'll chairs or\nWant to do um small ... acre smart or planting and stuff and so we create those opportunities to display but also we have a school a childcare that has their own has their own garden so they have access so that\nThe farm to school idea where we've implemented in our local school um we're talking probably Eighteen months to five years of age\nStudents and staff who acts have access to a you know local local produce that they put into their\nThat they put it into their menus and their systems but one of the big opportunities that we um that we were able to engage in and bring in is that we put buffalo back on our back on her use diet um\nAnd it's it's been a long time coming um but we've incorporated our traditional meats are traditional food back into the menus of our schools across reservation\nAnd you know these are big you know these are these are big movements that\nWe're able to help change the mindset of younger generations in to build up there you know build up their their taste to build up their opportunity and access to locally based foods\nYou know Nick I I Know that you were raised on the ...\nYou really um have been trained to be a leader how do you see yourself as a leader in you know what is it that really your inspiration for wanting to keep doing some very hard for you to\nUm I guess my and my my inspiration me and my inspiration my my connection my involvement you know comes comes back to my grandmother\nI mean my grandmother was the one who I'm basically pushed me to get my hands back in the soil you know as a person to reconnecting back to the earth um she was an avid gardener I mean she did canning you know had her own garden and she was pushed for self sufficiency and so\nUm when I graduated from Fort Lewis I moved home and I'm during that summer she was out gardening and everything and\nAsked her like why how do I guarded\nAnd she just said you know grand friend you have all the opportunity in the world and you have all the land in front of you to do whatever you want just go pick a plot\nTurned the soil plant some seeds and you know that's how you learn is by being\nBeing you know being in the soil in in the ground I mean that was a that was twelve years ago\nTwelve years ago I've been I'm kind of connected you know in the soil for twelve years and focusing on you know that reconnecting but you know back to the soil reconnecting back to the food um and trying to change in my mind set because being a college student you know\nI started to kind of around myself out and connecting back to food by being at the college that I was because they're they're the college I went to was driven on\nSocial social issues environmental you know environmental issues and seeing the impacts that you know the food systems have and so I was driven even more to come home and one of the ...\nI was my grandmother\nAnd mother and my mother teasing and really inspired me as well one of your nine I'm initiatives I think it's a small demonstration farm that sounds like a pretty exciting program on maybe you could talk a little bit about that as an inorganic farmers yet\nUm yeah I mean I could say we're ... we're majority of organic farm and so we have like I was talking about the two point five acres I'm it's our it's our um regenerative pulls you centered agriculture system\nThat we adopted from the main street project caught up in Northfield, Minnesota um there there are a main partners for the for the ...\nYou know adoption for the adoption for the for the creation for the building of the food system here on the resume for the food system that were that were regenerating here on the on the Pine Ridge reservation um and it's full sun chickens it's focusing on utilizing chickens for their\nUm regenerative outputs when we talk about regenerative regenerative stems from everything from you know quality of air to soil to how the food is developed to you know utilizing\nYou know I'm you know the animals for their natural abilities to provide for the ecosystem and so we have four hundred and eleven Rhode Island red egg layers insider insider system\nAnd so with the system it's a multifaceted system for growing food um right now we're creating what twenty dozen eggs a day that we're I'm\nLooking to get on the shelves of our local supermarket switch there in goes to the plate so far a local community who I'm having that access to local foods you know in in generations\nAnd so we're we're making those opportunities by the food systems that are creating 'em and looking to

Sam ... of course that sixty sixty five year in October first [noise]\n\n\nUh we are back a little bit of technical difficulties is afternoon it's uh actually my difficulty I'm my headphones around seven seconds away so I'm hearing myself in a vast echo chamber uh but\nUh I'll go stands headphones for a while and see how that goes uh just to let you know are format today will be baseball will open up a baseball and we'll have more baseball at the end if we get to it\nAnd then in between uh we'll do a little bit of a was Lee in sports and finally some sports politics if we have time for that too so let's start with the most important things going on\nBaseball and a while I'm\nBroadcasting I'm also watching the uh uh ... central division game game one sixty three between the brewers and the a cubs it's in the ninth\nInning and uh\nThe winner of this game will be the division champion of the uh central central right now the brewers are up three to one and like I said we're in the ...\nAnd so a then right after this game we go into the other similarly scheduled a division a championship game in the west between the Dodgers in the Rockies\nNow the interesting thing is I'm a was a couple of interesting things uh one is ah the brewers have a player by the name and yell at each on their team\nWho uh had the opportunity given this game one sixty three to actually or capture the triple crown a\nHe's a won the ... title for batting average already uh he will not lose it but in this game even if he had gone on for Seventeen he still have the ... title um he actually has had a pretty good day I think he's three for for\nA he was one home run behind the home run lead and that leader is going to play in the game to today\nAnd he was to R B eyes behind the RBI leader who is playing opposite him in this game so are the three players for a batting average home runs and R B eyes are playing in these uh divisional playoff games today\nAnd are\nReally the only thing I think that is a shirt and right now is that a yellow which has won the ... title if this game should go for any reason into extra innings and you were to hit a home run a he would be tied for the home run lead\nAnd he would also be tied for the FBI lead so [noise] uh that looks like it may not happen though\nWe have one out and uh I Can't see who's coming to bat but uh they have\nSome pretty good relief core on a Milwaukee Steven\nThere will go and play a wild card game will be part of the wild card\nGame and they'll play the loser of the game that comes afterwards they will host that game so as Chicago goes on to lose this game which are currently would probably the odds are very high that they will lose it they'll play again tomorrow right here probably John luster will start to a game\nFor them um in case you're wondering um [noise]\nHow much baseball we have after today um well not even how much we have left but just this coming week\nUh we have a fourteen games counting the two today before next Monday fourteen so that's an average of two per day one to today than one on Tuesday\nWhich is the NFL wildcard one on Wednesday which is a a wild card\nWhich may interest quite a few of us ... coming into play the Yankees\nAnd then Thursday we start the playoffs and so a Thursday are there are two games friday there are four games Saturday there are four games or a two games and Sunday there are two games friday is the only way that we have four games [noise]\nUh so it's a busy busy week in baseball um there's something every day and if you're a little bit stressed out that there's only one game\nTomorrow and one game Wednesday let me assure you there's was Lee in sports to go to and those\nTwo days and you should be taking advantage of\nThat or if and I'll talk about that in a little bit when we get to the Wesleyan sports so uh that's my pitch for the playoffs are\nTwo teams that I described in my response to the argument is shoot choice of the Rockies going all the way a which were\nThey would call that the what the ah ah the one on one series the freeway series I don't know um they called her freeways da da and they're like you know like they're important or something though one on one of four oh five\nUm or if that were to happen um I Would be surprised\nAt the very least there'd be a lot of unhappy people because everybody's expecting for sure\nA a\nA big big mat match ups in the American league Boston or Houston or a ... Boston and New York and then possibly or one of those teams meeting Houston so uh that should be a killer American League series\nAnd out west it's a little bit murky here um and we'll we'll just have to wait and see what happens\n[noise]\nUm let's see I Want to switch now to some good news in baseball um last week or CC's about the I was making his last start for the Yankees maybe his last start ever I'm not sure if he's going to come back next year but it was less sort of the season [noise] um\nFor the Yankees and he had a hundred and forty eight innings pitched\nUm and ah he was\nIn line to get a five hundred thousand dollar bonus or if he pitched a hundred and fifty five innings um he was cruising along throwing very very good baseball he had a hundred and fifty three innings he'd gone five innings\nLooked like he was going to make a seven innings and get his bonus and then something happened uh his catcher Andrew Rome mine was up at bat and uh the opposing pitcher for Tampa Bay\nI don't have anything showing for cross country rich or crew's coming up this week so sorry about that folks but um sometimes they get a week off you know after a grueling event like they just had um [noise] the football team this was the big family weekend\n[noise] all the extra foot traffic and\nPeople blocking my driveway with their cars because they think it's okay to park because they're you know well I don't want to say white privilege but maybe just can't find a parking space in Wesleyan didn't provide enough parking whatever\nBut um uh\nThe big thing for the weekend was the football game and we did lose to Hamilton a close game thirty three to twenty nine I don't know how close to the game was based on that score\nOther than we lost by four points um I didn't do any review of the game a on line to really find out I Do know that a next step for us is Saturday we go up and play Colby\n[noise] I'm more sad news out of field hockey team probably had one of his tougher weeks a losing to number three tops and number fourteen Hamilton\nAnd I'm a ... this coming week should be a a little better for them as they don't play ranked teams are on Wednesday of this week uh they play trinity college and then on Saturday to go up to Colby\nSo um that's that are\nAs you know from last week a Lyman orchards the golf course at Lyman orchards hosted a qualifying me\nFor a a ... and a top for were to qualify and unfortunately are golfers didn't make it into the qualifications um the four teams that do qualify we're Middlebury\nTrinity Hamilton and tops and they take\nThat combines scores of of your of your ... for best players usually they you\nUh event so you've got five players and I think there was eight eight yeah I think it was eight colleges are competing to might have been more but I think it was eight\nOr maybe more because I think we've finished date so maybe let's just say ten fifty places a approximately fifty places\nAnd ah you had to have golfers finishing in the top ten\nTo vulture team in the top for Middlebury had three of their for golfers when the top ten trinity had a one golfer in the top ten he was actually the top golfer of every of all of the golfers\nHamilton had two golfers in the top ten as did tops a we had I think our best golfer was around sixteen so I'm\nKind of on a learning curve there or a development curve for the golf team but ah give it time and I'm just keep playing those courses and hopefully\nUm it'll get better for you [noise]\nMen's soccer had a a a a rough week losing to both types in Hamilton um that's the men's team actually and um this Tuesday that would be tomorrow at four thirty trinity comes to town and they play them\nAnd uh and then ... and he plays the women in field hockey on Wednesday so there's your Tuesday and Wednesday games\nIf you don't feel that won a game of baseball's enough sports for you on Tuesday and Wednesday because after Wednesday there's more baseball everyday there's at least two games almost every day [noise]\nUm did I mention Saturday or we are at Colby and soccer I think I did as are the women the women track that whole thing\nOr the women are play trinity at seven PM they have the uh\nThe women were playing Hamilton and something had to give because the women were undefeated at home while Hamilton was undefeated away and I said one of them is going to come away from that game disappointed\nWell in the uh kissed your sister department they both came away not so disappointed in that they ended in a double overtime tie leaving both records intact are Wesleyan women's soccer team has a three and oh and one record one tie\nAnd uh the Hamilton away record is one when no losses in two ties so congratulations to both Hamilton and Wesleyan women soccer teams on maintaining your undefeated away or home status whichever the case may be\n[noise] okay I'm On the tennis\nUm um\nDo I have something here I Do I Do I Do ... do we do yeah\nMen's tennis um\nThere's a new kid on the block\nFreshmen Peter anchor\nLead the way for Wesleyan at the IT a regional championships making the quarter finals in doubles alongside sophomores act Fleischmann as well as winning a pair of singles matches to make it to the third round\nIt was only anchors second tournament as a cardinal but the Norwegian established himself as a threat in both singles and doubles 'em and these are usually two day affairs on day to anchor was the only cardinals still are in competition\nFreshman battle tough against former national champion Noah feral of Middlebury but in the end experience one out with Farrell taking the match seven five three six\nIs this Saturday ah\nThey will host a Rensselaer Polytechnic for one day tournament\nUm\nSo this could be interesting Rensselaer has a pretty good team actually\nUm\nThey probably you know those engineers have very good at math so they probably know all the good angles to get\nYou know what kind of a torture and to put on the ball who knows they just maybe they just beat the hell out of the bone overpower you\nIt'll be a challenge for both the men's and women's team actually the women's will not be a hosting Rensselaer there'll be off doing playing Middlebury\nI'm\nI'm Sorry uh I take that back I take that back ah\nUm\nI have bigger a bigger story for the women which I Will get to right now uh [noise]\nThe women tennis team as making quite a splash again they were very good last year\nA year after winning the New England IT regional doubled championship alongside Utah's strong senior Victoria you came back and won the tournament again this time with the new yet familiar partner her sister Christina\nShow 'em they combine to take the championship with five wins over the weekend their second term it when of the fall\nIn the final Victoria and Christina faced freshman Jacqueline buzz boxed in who won the singles title and Claire ... of Amherst while both sets were tied to use ... ...\nAnd it was definitely style play that want it for them the uh approached and that quite often and uh came away with a solid six for six three when\nA also the cardinals do very well and singles they had two of the for singles semi finalist as both Victoria you and freshmen vinita young\nMade runs through the draw unfortunately the two had to play each other in the semi finals where young played excellent tendency to advance to the final\nWhere she would eventually fall to Amherst Jacqueline bucks and\nWho are we beat in the doubles but who took the singles championship so congratulations to uh uh the doubles

that because those are those interviews always shed light I have um\nGood uh I'm standard Wesleyan is setting hopefully by doing that I Want to mention that the off a little bit off topic but not really all that off topic [noise] um [noise]\nReading a book right now by ah the lyricist [noise] that are composed the lyrics for most of Bob here's music by wherever the Grateful Dead or his name is John Perry Barlow he just passed away right before passing away he did write a memoir an autobiography\nAnd I'm as he put it in the intro uh he got really really ill and two thousand Seventeen and he said rather than take time\nAbout a pretty powerful book or early on he talks about his experience here in the sixties at Wesleyan where he was a student I'm One of the things he makes note of which ties it all into this uh our Greek community\nUm I'm stepping up to the plate and I'm Talking honestly about sexual assault and how to prevent it was the fact that\nHe will join a fraternity which also had a chapter at Dartmouth and um he said the behavior of the two chapters was like night and day\nA dark myth was basically and they've been called on this as recently as five years ago I'm being just total a boost towns and you know rampant partiers and just you know troublemakers et cetera et cetera et cetera\nAre kind of\nTypes of behavior that has been getting a lot of news play lately that a university shouldn't be a very proud of and he said that ... on the other hand\nThey're Greek or a system which wasn't really all that will formulated than in in the early sixties or mid sixties\nOr what the one he joined was more of a literary club and they invited a famous speakers to come and talk and and and have a ... and and whatnot and it was a much different experience than what was going on at Dartmouth\nSo um I got tested this because ah also my daughter chose Williams over Dartmouth although she was accepted it both schools because of the fact that uh she spent the weekend\nAt Dartmouth a as a prospective freshman incoming freshman [noise]\nAnd they focused on how much they liked the party\nWith the resources were women and how to um avoid the rape and um you know how to be prepared and also what what did the same thing happened\nThey had it right out there and opening that does happen and we don't want it to happen to you know we want to do as much as possible meanwhile let's start with they were just talking about how much party and they do and\nA lot of students posted on their Facebook pages I'm not going here now and that was five years ago

I'm a I'm a junior [laughter] I'm at and I\nBeen working from about my freshman year at the farm doing various [laughter] I'm up\n[noise]\n\n\nWhere you have a small farms in general [noise]\n\nUm\nThings about how they how far is that [noise] I mean\nOf the cool things is that a lot of the food to go to our dining\nUm so it does provide a way that we can get involved in um the food that we're eating we can try to encourage more organic and local food um on campus the author way to get involved in the community um because we do a lot of community program to give a lot of food to different places in Middletown [noise]\nUh and so I think it's a good way to get kind of organic local\nHealthy food more available to everyone [noise]\nYeah right I agree um I also like the the aspect of like physically working\nLike the environment and getting to see those results um come to fruition directly in front of you for for instance like this summer what\nWas really special it's like I helped\nThese plans and then Bob\nThen eventually ah\nProduce fruit and being able to move those foods and then\nTo people and feed other people\nA really special and really\nThey you know the whole life cycle of plans and um the make [noise] you know agriculture to around\n\nYeah I'm here\nThe people and or what program you bring farm things like that [noise]\nYeah um what we do every week is we have a community work days on Saturdays from nine AM to one PM I'm as well as for right now I think we're having a farm stands I'm from eleven to one\nUm and on Saturdays we'd just a there's a lot of thought there but we encourage anyone to come out and\nUm you know maybe learn a little bit about farming um maybe help us with some small tasks but then also you get to take home um whatever food you harvest yourself\nI'm Joe if you'd like some pretty vegetables and you are absolutely welcome to come by [noise]\nWe also I'm doing it about a third of what we wrote to um saint Vincent's food pantry which is I'm middle ... main street [noise]\nUm so that's a great way to kind of help a local organization that I'm working to help the people and alleviate suit inequality um and we give to the other organizations like food not bombs on which gives out free meals on on Sundays on main street Sunday like noon on time\nAnd as well as a few other um local organizations are people on a case by case basis so we really tried to make sure that our food isn't just staying within Wesleyan um and that our farm isn't just for a wetland students but it's something that is integrated with the community and we're sharing this with with the community as well as with was when\nI Do my um you were here over the summer working on the fine and you just talked about that experience and what I like what happened\nYeah totally um [noise] so the summer with a lot I mean three months out of the year that happened to be like the most important for the growing season because you know that the longest days in the most heat um but yeah we did have a couple\nEngland was cooler um but the whole process where we went from um raking in ... the um plop into rows and then planting plants watering them every day until they terminated [noise] um and then continue to take care of them we eating and I'm\nWanting to watching them until they started to sprout fruit and then we would harvest pretty regularly a couple of times a week and um you know we have\nA I think eleven different plots though we had to do that eleven times and so there and there was only a handful of us that we were constantly working constantly had things to do [noise]\nUm we also have some other projects going on we um we're doing some work in our ... culture slope which is basically we just kinda let things grow as they are with parents of the few fruit trees\nAnd we're just taking care of them as well um we had some projects in the community and I'm also a beekeeper and so I have a couple three has to be out in the farm and um my job is to not necessarily harvest honey or take something from the beach but to just check up on them and make sure that\nThey have enough food to survive for their the seeds and to make sure that um they have enough based in the hive I'm the hot types of ... that I\nHave um it's pretty easy to make and pretty easy to give them more space we have to make sure that they um are using what they have\nAnd um yeah it was it was a great time or again it was really hot it was really\nA lot of work but really rewarding as well\nI think [noise]\nRight I mean we still have lots\nUh food pantries in town we also have a friend who has a free um stand in the north end on green street um which I think you should check out if you're interested\nUm and so you know we were able to provide people with with rude we also had a farm stand 'em once once a week and then we're at the farmer's market on main street every Friday which we are still doing until the end of October so\nUm if you stop by between ten and two on Fridays outside of it's only natural\nI think that yeah actually you're right about the our sorry [laughter]\nUm\nWell in what ways are providing I'm proud to communities that might otherwise not have it on you were mentioning when we were talking before the show about a food stamp program in and just like talking about that\nSo um [noise] the northern farmers market would have to we were just talking about has a really cool program called the double dollars program which is funded I'm to the north an action team also called meet\nAnd so basically the way that it works is that food stamp on it it provide the money so that food stamp devalue can get doubled went by saying it's at on the first and so I didn't go to a lot of great things it allows\n'em farmed land and the other acres the perma culture as kind of wild growing plants [noise]\nUm and we this summer we had a range of food not all of it is still producing both the we had tomatoes peppers onion eggplant garlic I'm hard\nWe have a lot of squash and pumpkins right now we're still growing corn okra\nBasically whenever it's like\nYeah and we tried to be very diversified and growing a bunch of different kinds of um crop\nDon't like to make out of what you get from the farm ... something that was like yeah\nI'm the cherry tomatoes are fantastic they are super sweet and you can just kind of eat them like candy and like um I live ... for the foreign student group fair and we had like a ... like everyone had to to but they all had like candy and we had the big thing of tomatoes and I was just like eating horrific amount to them and they're no good\n[noise] um I have never been a huge fan of tomatoes but this summer having like the really fresh tomatoes um that became one of my favorite foods which I was really surprised about\nA mile so really like our peppers [noise] um and I recently just tried our okra for the first time I've never made okra myself and so I\nI tried my hand and it was really good actually so some people complain about our okra but I think that's perfectly fine [laughter]\nYou know I really do a lot of people he and I really think if they tried ... summer tomatoes they change their mind\nTotally totally it's just like it get they get soggy in the middle of a sandwich and it's like why is this year but when that by itself for one that's ripe for like a ... and we made some of our tomatoes and to make into tomatoes doc\nI'm an east on pasta along with some squash zucchini which was really good this summer I'm In that made a really good pasta\n[noise] so so good [laughter]\nUm okay this is kind of a fun question but I Know that you guys have stuck on the five yeah super cool um but I Want to know more about like how did they get why are they they're now how are they doing [noise]\nYeah I actually so when I first came which was three years ago\nHave around in terms of like keeping down past and stuff there's really no reason to keep them\nUm and then we found out that one of the people involved with the farms parents lived in Connecticut and just loved having chicken and had like twenty chickens really great so those got dropped off at that person's house and I think they're doing well we haven't checked in a while\nUm but we also still had duck\nAnd I don't know exactly when the ducks are first team um but the idea is they produce eggs on and they keep down past are primarily 'em and they fertilize because they're ... it's really good for soil on so that kind of the reason the reason behind them yeah and\nThey're you know they're fun pets we have five of them they all have names I'm an okay we got a chrysanthemum Dali and time\nA pepper corn for corn and Genevieve [noise]\nNo they're they're just the cutest and it's fun to\n'em so everyday we let them out of their group which is like I'm a roof enclosure with food and water and everything and we let them run around the farm and so they go around digging for worms and bugs and whatnot\nAnd um and then you know we might put them away with their kitty pool we fill up a kitty pool for them to turn around and then we also have a\nKind of a pond that we made 'em and we can build that up with water and let them swim a little bit deeper\nAnd it's really cute to watch them like clean them up and walk around the water they've it's fun game in the when they get in the kitty pool one duck will get on top of the other ... like on the back and like stick its head underwater and like pet got it and like clean underneath it's a feathers really funny to watch\n'em at first you're like oh my God stop [laughter] round the other dropped but it's actually like they're playing\nOur female friends and you plan on getting anymore anymore you know\nThere's some there's been some discussion of the appointed debate but um five of us do a lot to take care of so [laughter]\nBut hey baby ducks are very cute\nAnd you mentioned before a little bit about your bees and like honey a little bit more about that\nYeah I mean I don't have much to say it's kind of hard to to give up for\nHigh run through without the bees right in front of you but the idea of having bees outlawing lane is that if they you know a mutually benefit relationship the bees need\nUm flowers to survive they ... they eat pollen and nectar from blossoming plants and then they also help with pollination which means that they\nUm when they go visit a flower they get covered in the power of the flower and then they fly to another flower of the same plant species and that helps the plant reproduce and then bear fruit\nUm so it was really interesting this summer to the you know the budding plans starting to come up and then watching my bees I'm collecting hunt or like collecting nectar for them and the thing the whole cycle with uh being played out in front of us\nSo we're already been like three minutes so we just have one more question than a little game um is there anywhere that people can find new online or\nAnywhere like people know more about ... and how to get involved\nWe have a Facebook page I think we're just long leaned farther along land for him was when we also had an Instagram which also is probably only wind farm um if you Google as well\nOh the easiest way to find out if you also I think a wetland long wind farm in the mail dot com um is a great way to contact us and in terms of getting involved you mentioned the Saturday work days from a ... a nine to one\nAnd those are the I think probably the best way to just come down check us out paying out the what we're about right or come stop by on October thirteenth\nFrom twelve to for and that's pumpkin fast\nI'm we're going to have a whole bunch of games music people out and if you'd like to learn more about the farm you can definitely talk to one of us there and we can get your contact information are due to our email list [noise]\nReally really quickly we're going to a game called spoiled and coming in then you need to have like ten seconds tell us what was the only way anyway and something you got\nAll right I'm worst thing I ate today I was really hungry after class I came back I have the Thomas in my fridge it was you know so little funky it wasn't that bad but I was like if not more so I can still eat it [noise] um and I had these practical chips\nIt was it was fine but you know I was just trying to finish out the the last one container I'm the best thing I ate my house mates and I we do how dinner every Sunday and yesterday\nMy two friends made fresh bread and pasta like hand made and that was super got lots of carbs but it was so\nAwesome I'm looking forward to I'm really looking forward to the sweet potatoes that have been growing since July um we've been waiting and waiting because we don't have that many and I'm hoping I get to try one [noise]\nI don't know anything like really bad that I mean recently\nIt's another fire alarm comes off like a fire safety people have to give you a demonstration on cooking space [laughter] God that was like I didn't end up eating it but that disappointing food experience\nThe best thing I Want to say something like call and homemade and natural but I went to the drum county fair and there is someone that wearing a rape which are like Cory patties with a mosque in the middle like fried\nAnd it was the best um and coming into these when I'm really excited for pi season and a lot of pumpkin pie and yeah\nSo thank you for hot for
