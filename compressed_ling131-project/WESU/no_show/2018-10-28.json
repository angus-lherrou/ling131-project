give you an update it's almost a year now that we've been in office so we want to give you some update\nBut we also want to hear from you it's it's unfortunate that we can't go out and not doors like we were doing when we were voting when we were looking for your vote but we also want to make sure that you know that you're still important to us but you still mad at you with\nThat your voice is still important to like the lead on this Thursday seven PM\nPlease come to our town hall meeting it's going to be located at three thirty Park Avenue I Know we have some issues with the parking because there's the new construction going on but there'll be a shuttle bus from Carmen air raids right next door to um\nThe senior center so please please please come out and and share some thoughts with us\nGood I'm good coming along fine less\nThan ... you know how much problems we had with that right [laughter] you know the rumblings in town about that ride with very glad they're under their on target\nIf they're on budget and the building is shaping up to be looking really really good\nGood and when are they going to do with it on\nOn so when we when we uh started construction we actually constructing on the soccer field right so once this building is up we're going to tear down the old building\nIf building right because some of the concerns were that our young people who uses that field they won't have any place they go right so we needed to make sure that yeah we would get a new Human Services building but that our um sports uh stars would still be able to have some place to practice in the play\nRight right right and that's a good thing to do of course I'm\nGoing to be talking to you later on when you feel about the one thing that we could add to give back to the yes we do a lot of course I Want to put to him I served in my town so you know that something's going in a lot to do be need to be in the sports world so\nYeah I got to put things together to help our future out and to make those you know much better place than\n... yes a place where we can work and play in a place for all of us lumps that you know\nI'm just interestingly once um we started taking off it we were hearing about an African American Caribbean and war and I'm saying what African American Caribbean or why is there an African American a Caribbean war\nWe're all one people you know I spoke with somebody when the police pulls you over what Lacey first they see a black person is not African American or Caribbean we're all in this together\nAnd then we exactly right but we need to deal with in the best interest of up on each of us we all have a voice we all have a vote we all have the lights\nAnd Bloomfield is a place for everyone to live work and play and that's what we are trying to um that's the message that we're trying to get out there for our town no segregation no silos all of us coming together to make our town the town right\nThat's right that's right folks that you hear this from my [laughter] having these little tidbits huh\nBut yeah and the guy that does that mirror on because I mean people look at life and see what in a church you know go that's ... that's\nThat's the that's the sad part there's no safe place anymore and I think our country has gotten into the place where he oh my goodness hate is if it's the talk of the cage and we have to overcome eight\nMembers you know that's what I what I spoke about earlier I mean nobody would tell us that these you know yes and it will pass because we're at which we can in high places but yes at the same time you know ... Toto says you know\nLet's see if it's like he's given every body coordination you know sometimes people would hide and say things are hiding things but it's like now get permission for you to be ... the un hateful and just to do whatever you want to do because that's how you\nFeel and that is not the country that we all came here from you know when we're in Jamaica and people talked about going to America\nIt's for a better life a better life for your family that's not why most people migrated here in America because we had a great melting pot\nSlowly losing it slowly slowly losing it but I like you said um we the people have to make the change we have to unite in 'em\nLet people know all over that yes this is a great place to be a town or city or they you might be and what this is what we have to do I mean and I'm you know me you are on the opinion more who were having the same ideas and thoughts so\nWe just have to bend them together and yes and if people being put away the hypocrisy too much he has too much fighting too much you know this one cannot afford to let this wouldn't be better than him or her and you know it's just that but it does the way of life and down we at people need to know what to come together and understand who we are\nWait what out of many will walk down the line\nAnd that's the idiot unity I live in the unity up not individually and collected if he's really the eye for the weekend jak but when they walk no matter what's going on around that I think we would be better for it and so what I found in our city Oh yes in our country\nMhm the work we're we're we're well that's true yeah actually that I don't want to keep you have you gotten bigger event to tell my son was targeted and we're ... the more and talk about that to them and you

...\nHa ha ha ha\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nMm\nMm\n[noise]\n\nA a\nA planet called earth so if you were to come from Jupiter you would ... probably called a ...\nA few came from Venus ... if you come from Mars your Martian a you know other\nPlanet as a whole not as little pieces so we've been so used to in our earth based history that we have been\nSo used to being known as nation when in fact we are earth spins and I'd like to start seeing people say oh I'm a nurse and so if you've ever meet somebody coming off his ship from another planet you're not going to tell them you're\nFrom a from California Hawaii\nChina you're ... you're on the planet earth urine earth in its I Know it's going to be a kind of a concept to transform into because you've been brought up to believe\nYou live in a nation but if I take you all off of your nation's into space you don't see nations you see one planet with water and land and atmosphere and your planet called earth\nSo not sure when\nNations started or how that happened but everyone lives on the planet earth at least on this planet it's called earth it's not called Russia China Asia or Scandinavia the planet earth so wouldn't it be a great concept to start saying\nYou know what nice to meet you I'm a nurse in and so it does I'm from the town of so and so it doesn't matter you know I mean that's fine but you are an earth in\nYou're born on a planet called or if it's not cold or something else you know how to plan to get their name that's interesting ... interesting how did earth get\nI think about that too much because it's going to start a frying my consciousness a little bit because now that I'm asking the question I don't know the answer\nOf how planets got their names\nYou know how does one they'll just found this new planet and it's called do and so now how did they get the call this planet something how do we know when we find a new star system or a new solar system what that name of the solar system is or that galaxy how do we know that\nAgain I don't have the answer honestly I don't know now I'm going to be thinking about all these questions I put out to you and I have no answer for them\nI eventually will but at the moment\nIt just totally boggles my consciousness to try to figure that out just going back to the essence of what how planets get their name\nYou know a restaurant or look for planets are people the study Programme look for new places but how do they know what it is how do they come up with a number for a planet that they've never known before light years away or you know I don't understand that\nI mean to have some sort of a\nTone Patrick ability to pick up on information I you know there's how does one understand all this now I've got your thinking on how am I going to figure this out\nYet um [noise]\nDon't worry about it too much what we have plenty of time to think about that and consciously meditate on it but are we are in a planet colder than really the essence of what I'm trying to talk about and that is a whole nother realm to get into in terms of you who comes up with the names for planet\nI'm you know you were born you accept\nYou know ... why does that name go to that particular planet why if what happens if you want to change the name of the planet I don't\nI don't want to strike trouble here were these primaries you've found planets over many centuries but I'm always I'm very curious how did these planets in known and unknown galaxies and solar systems and other places get their names and if you find a new planet\nAnd that's what do we just found this really new planet light years away and it's called going so well how do they know what's called snow and so did they have a meet up with the extraterrestrial from that planet that told them this is the name of\nOur planet now being hypothetical of course but uh it just\nBoggles the mind when you think about these questions because it's just like my question I've posed many times\nAnd I've had to just come with the answer of about God universally that God just exists now if you try to stay who created God you're gonna be going nuts trying to figure that one out and if anyone has\nA more hats off to you because I certainly have come to the conclusion with the whole question of who\nWho is God or how to guard get treated\nIf you try to answer that you're going to be going on and on forever never ever getting the final answer so I came up with a conclusion the best way to deal with who created God in the universe or multi versus that God just exist it\nYou know\nThe whole thing with this big bang theory if you're going to go with that then you have to say who created the big bang theory\nOr the big bang\nSomething created that it didn't just things you don't just happen\nI'm doing a lot of things that you hear it's just a between how planets got their names you know who created the universe what created the universe I mean you can go crazy thinking about answers and you might have your own theories\nAnd at this point really\nIt'd be a theory but the you know if you believe in the creator which I Do if you believe in God universally which I Do and you stay civil who created God\nBless you come up with the answer God justice in God's will always existed universally multi dimensional e then you have to understand that it's always going to be that way you know I mean\nIf you want to stay constantly what is happening words heaven mile answers always been cosmic Lee that had been is in higher dimensional frequency\nThat people that go to that frequency what you call heaven or the many layers of white that exist in the higher dimensions when you leave this experience but that's again my defining of heaven versus someone's religious beliefs of heaven I'm giving you a cosmic\nBelief of what happened is er heavens are\nYou also want to stay heaven on earth if you want to decode that you can say have been on Mars have it on Jupiter heaven on earth\nIts meaning that a planet lives in peace that's my perception of decoding what that means\nAnd you can have your own complete different understanding of that but certainly that's what I perceived to be always coming from the stars at birth my understanding of those things that are used it\nYou're a different meaning of heaven on earth which is a decode meant of peace on a planet we happen to be on earth you might be on Jupiter or some other planet or in the universe or mysterious be\nUh area and and those planets you also or the palladium star system and your planet and the ladies have it on the ladies so when we look at the cosmic definition or the decoding of that that's how I perceive it in a the cosmic understanding\nAnd as I'm speaking the sun is finally coming out and it's a it's a beautiful thing to have a little bit of sunshine in our lives you know\nAnd um\nSo I never know where consciousness will stream me to speak\nTo this day on the cosmic I asked her command radio show 'em your host commander rally on it's wonderful to have you listening around the world\nThroughout the Connecticut River valley up and down the valley on eighty four on the interstate and Ninety One Ninety five wherever you're going on a boat well I don't think they're on the Long Island sound it could be some books out there\nTuned in eighty one and I'd be perfectly good thing too so we talked about all the things and bring it up\nAnd you don't have to have all the answer's neither do I ... on this you know it's just a interesting question I never ever since I began this show over twelve years ago ever asked how do planets get their names\nYou know we might want to actually uh open up the lines for that let's go to\nWind signed a few of these things I throw it out to you and I know it's a massive amount of information\nUm Thursday is or is a day for the Norse god\n... I'm only the creativeness their real names of things mhm mhm and as far as uh who created the creator a yeah I just pretty much a subscribe to what you said commander the ...\nIt's a ... in in ways like there was dark mess\nYou know and then then came to light I look at it as God was asleep mhm created with the sleep woke up one day\nYou know 'cause uh one of the things I say the only way I can stop going drive myself nuts on this question is who created God universally used to say it just does what it is there's no if I don't do that then I ended up\nGoing to that question so many times and the only answer that keeps coming back whether it's from God or just my consciousness is that God just is God always has been and then you say who created God\nThen you get yourself into that mind set of consciousness meditating saying ... I've been to stop trying to question that because not that I don't have to do this I Do the only answer I get is that God just is\nYou know the three questions we're supposed to ask ourselves and meditating um where did we come from\nWhat are we doing here\nAnd I and I guess where are we going for me it's a lot easier to imagine the concept of eternity goes something that's already rock it's much harder for me to grasp\nUh the alpha ... at the beginning is no beginning right so it's easier for me to think there is no end so eternity is easier for me to grapple with a it's kind of a chicken and egg thing come here and [laughter] it really is because I don't yeah\nFurthering accept I questioned who came first the chicken or grad you're listening W E s us I'm constantly guy radio you know there are people that go back and forth with that\nAnd then when you get back to the whole thing of who created God universally or did God created\nReally it's essentially\nIt just is it just like you were just saying a second ago\nThe defining of that answer for everyone's going to be different um of course all my listeners there many of them out there that don't calling but I'm sure everyone has a perception of their own reality of\nOf that creation you know it's interesting\n\nUm you know first got his first ... the creators the first cause I'm question who created the creator\nAnd you can go into the matter of lesser guts but any way you consider that there is the first original creator Ryan ... question always romance or you know where did we come from\nIt's a it's an interesting question and like I said I've posed that question on and off in the last twelve years and every time I Do that I ended up still getting to the point is finally only recently in the last few years have I\nSaid to myself you just gotta let it go and understand that God just ... and uh if you tried to point and how God God created\nI don't think anyone's gonna I mean it will have an answer maybe but to me the answer is to have more peace within just accept the fact that God just exist\nWell that's part of the mystery which is similar to the word history you know his history a lot of it is a story out working up the creation his story but when you look at it from the creation\nIt might have been too obvious um if they left the old in he\nWould read like my story yeah they change the oath to the east I wouldn't be too obvious but to me that's the definition of mystery of the things that the creators withholding from our understanding our only for Haitian understand so therefore it's my story if you look at it from the creators of you\nAs a new slant on the word mystery\nRight interesting where ... yeah I appreciate your\nYou know your wisdom and input as well help other people will be less shy to also share what they are the things that are brought up to you I think are you just where the catalyst distort things going on the phone line here and I hope others will not be afraid to to share a as I ...\nI agree I agree so I'll I'll say I'm have a great day and let's let's move on a few other callers talk to you\nSound good and you have a blessed that way as well all the\nBest hurry St you peace loving like the commander in all your listening audience\nYes indeed the ending change the change is\nComing up or some I found a website called\nPrepare for change dot net and it's very positive commander talks about all the good stuff that's going to have ... ...\nYeah no I definitely uh has believed that and shared that from the command perspective when there's no gas is so yes for\nLactic perspective um there's been a pulse released from the central son and his approach you\nKnow everybody needs to just the you know do their light work and help their brothers and sisters on the planet\nTime to come together as a human race\nAnd that's what we are we're not a\nA Connecticut race were not a Massachusetts race where the human race\nI'm into that so that website again is prepare for change dot net and [noise] the names or your listeners that go check that out are going to be up lifted a because it talks of light workers\nAnd light work it talks of um as I mentioned energy that's been released um\n... they say the central sort of the galaxy but I'd like to think in terms of the central son of the central galaxy ... the central galaxy which may in fact be a black hole\n[noise] super big black hole yeah you never know right\nBut as far as ah [noise] twisting your mind um it's it's\nSometimes it's fun to imagine that the you know the earth is spending on to access it's rotating around the sun you got spirals formed by the moon our moon which is which is rotating around the earth rotating around the sun that's our son is rotating\nIn the Milky Way around um as I suggested before a central galaxy\nYeah when you would be the the middle of fields physical universe you might say so it's fun to to to play those games but we do remain in mystery\nAnd that's how she's supposed to be\nAbsolutely well I appreciate your you're sharing and thank you for calling in the cosmic guy as ... come in radio\nIt was fun it was always commander all the best usually a peace loving light and a huge to can participate with me on these questions and the\nWe've been searching for answers on and if you have an answer that you've found from your meditations on\nYuki for calling in and if there's any other people that wish to call and I know that many people listening out there but not many that call in and we appreciate you're listening believe me but we also like you to be able to have the freedom which ... station give you the freedom to share\nAnd call in and go on the air and share your spiritual wisdom you're a cosmic in sight\nMaybe you don't have the answer like hide you know like for me for the whole thing about planets and how they became named by people\nIn our solar system or you know the whole thing with the concept of how\nWhat God created well God oh we there was God created you know that's a very pointed question\nA and not sure that we any of us really have the answer but it certainly is interesting indeed [noise] uh we're going to go into some space ship news\nIn just a a little bit here coming up to about twelve thirty and if you want to call in if you also want to talk about\nA UFO sightings that you've had\nYou may do that as well we welcome you to call in\nAnd I know a lot of my listeners are with that you know essentially are what the term means but are we going to take another phone call here at W. yes you FM I Believe hopefully and\nCall as well and the ah you know you never know when I'm going to have the code information that you're presenting to me and now it's not something I have to even think about again I don't come from this planet so when certain words are are presented I can decode them instantaneously\nWithout thinking I don't have to analyze it\nOr they do do appreciate that that was great and uh we're at the cosmic I asked her command radio show\nIf you want to call in and join our discussion it's eight six zero sixty five seven seven zero zero and uh we'd be happy if you're listening to the show simply started this morning you'll have a concept an idea of what I've been talking about\nNumber of things including we're talking about now a about a ancient ET history\nOr just a lot of interesting things and uh so we are going to take another phone call here I Believe let me just a ... let me just before I get I mean this is W E s U cosmic I radio W yes you're on the air much blessings loving white welcome to the show\nYes thank you thank you\nAnd that makes you turn your radio down if you have it on what can you hear I can hear you [laughter] can you hear the radio or no I can hear your coming in good judgment and where are you calling from by the way\nWe're recalling ... yeah I'm I'm really not\nA great welcome to the show and uh what would you like to share with us here in the\nSand all this gentleman spoke earlier yeah all about why not yeah yeah yeah that's really important history\nIn the Bible [noise] [noise] oh it's great to be ... or ... so to speak with cats\nAnd the ... that's interesting you know we talk and they would have fallen now where do you think cast them down we used to it now again if we want to decode the word cast down after the lactic were happened who cast of what what\nWhat ... days well All right probably the original groups but what was once in\nA very interesting idea and as we talked about that with different people it's great to get everyone's input here because we're getting pieces of the puzzle put together just to you when you're\nDriving scrambling [laughter] the masons couldn't be yeah that that's true\nEven ... than you know even like a thousand years ago and I mean it's amazing what we look at my my previous caller was talking about the world them and when he mentioned in the ... different book about the world when\nAnd I just decoded that instantaneously being you being lifted up in a world when he was being lifted up into a ship right\nSo we can decode things if we learn how to do that it can be done right\nA lot of debate can in the Bible that you read the Bible which are less spy okay yeah I'm gay so but we look like grass Bob Baer to both swat aiming\nAt that time so we're already here right\nThey were over here and that's why a sequel words will destroy them they were kind of yeah yeah there were a lot of galactic\nWars on this planet you can even in ancient history relate to\nAtlanta is on the more you the battle that ensued in Atlanta became not that the people wanted a war\nBut the people that were scientist became so powerful with their energy that they created they took the power to start a war with a peaceful U. T. race on the earth called the ...\nAnd that one dude and then you can see what happened or what you would have been trying to find it and he was a continent of Atlanta and also I wasn't called moon which is memorial so all these children into related you know\nSo as you know we've been facing with you know we're we're below mhm [noise] oh so also like to open I signed a treaty what does it but yeah\nAnd uh when that happened ... go ahead\nAnd exchange where are you located now move and you\nCan also we're on the dawn of human right\nTo your turn can I hear a radio in the background is near you can you turn that like down to zero shareholder no problem I Want to be able to hear the listener and you don't want to\nLike\nYou know he's I'm going away from the combat troops W yes you are than be you know now that now you're perfectly good so that way not people can hear you better so um yeah when you're talking about that that is actually true for people that are really familiar with that and the right where there was people would go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo I was going to say there were meetings between\nThe government and also when that happened the asked her command in the desert out west in the early fifties actually it was early sixties mid sixties the government rejected the asked her commands proposal and they decided that you said with the agreement that was made witness later protect your life\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nOkay so windy\nPort thing is that that that what you're saying is true\nRight [noise] well there are people were outraged make it or what have you heard that oh yeah absolutely right [noise] well I'm going\nTo explain to listeners what that means there are people out there that might have any no concept of what that means\nEm Ali what that means that it's a negative look\nRight but in terms of the tea related stuff how does that become important though\nI don't know I'm not the label was up to a human construct\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWell I definitely appreciate that I mean I can still hear the radio tobacco but I'm hearing you so but I appreciate what you share it and and that's part of the puzzle is to everyone get to share a little bit on the radio with each other urine or what we would come up with some uh\nAnswers down the road you know well hopefully we can get some ... made more public would that would be good well this isn't some of the technology that young and yeah it's like living in a negative lifestyle and then it really opened by now like poverty\nRight and it's not just the technology but people consciousness and vibration\nThat's the first thing that has to change on the planet no matter what plenty you're on the vibration of each individual human being the seven you know hundred seven billion people on this planet needs to transfer into the higher vibration of light and then\nPuts without that no matter what the technology is if the vibrations up there the use of technology is meaningless unless the people's vibration is equally up there as it is on other planets beyond her\n[noise] so you have your work before you we all do [laughter]\nWell I appreciate it and I thank you very much for for sharing\nYour ...\nVery much so thank you for listening and have a blessed day and a light filled day\nThank you pick yours as well\nAll right thank you and uh what's and or what what's\nGoing on here just do this I Can't even go I just turn\nThe thing off so I Want to thank people for calling in and sharing you know I'm going to try to get\nTo some space ship reports here\nUm\nBut we're gonna go to you know\nI'm going to read one report here let's go to your full sightings daily I got all my UFO saying reports up\nAnd are\nWe going to see 'em\nIf we have any oh here we go well then when you know the UFO signing daily is going with the hollow son theory will have to get into that sometime or that is an interesting theory indeed\nBut a\nHere's a citing the Gulf of Mexico this'll be the only UFO story for today\nBut according to the witness or your phone was spotted over the ocean at the Gulf of Mexico last week UFO appears long but I Believe that says this is from Scott warning uh we are looking at a desk from the side\nThe UFOs clearly taking time as it moves and it looks like the lower part of the UFO it's semi cloaked\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI can still remember how the music\nUsed to make me my\n\nNew if I\nThat I could make the people the men maybe they\nBe the one\nThat made me shiver\nWhen I ...

[laughter] you're running gag for that have done when they are not a super\nAnd making connections with like minded individual\nYeah yeah I I don't we don't know the date yet for next year but we had Lloyd the master and his daughter Sophie came up people had a good time you got to get up to own and here's the kicker so uh you know New York ... than verification Seventeen hours of\nYou know getting a a [laughter] basically vetted to enter this building I you know even when you're spending a hundred dollars for a ticket or whatever it is\nA big town of ... obviously not the same scale five dollars for the whole day this is this is the you got two of the best deals going of all time that we always tell you about Connecticut called classics every other month at the at the grand theater and see more ten dollars to movies\nUh intermission with raffles the snacks are cheap it's a fun night and then you've got ... Khan that's even cheaper it's five dollars so\nAnd and with with that you get all these the local artists or some some fairly well known people like Richard beanie Richard puny from a health class you know she has been going for forty years ... years and uh he's he's been going for the last few years and really really enjoys being God just like when we went deeper set up there\nYeah just you have to leave his last one was the year we went which is too bad 'cause what an interesting dude [laughter] when ...\nThere's been some great great artist great writers great creators uh there's there's the the con luggage there every year\nYeah we we talk to them last year on the ... I I said Hi to them this year I took a picture I I should posted up at some point because it's pretty good when they're these guys are at their local to Connecticut\nUm lego ... or what I learned when I talk to him last year Steve the uh I guess he's kind of one of the leaders there lego users' group so lego obviously is a big thing our old our co host many from from years ago on her old podcast wisdom lego fanatic\nAnd these people were houses built that I really [laughter] is right in the path of hurricane yeah whoa we'll everything's okay for you and then um but yeah it looks so check them out you know and and ... G v\nMichael doesn't have a license these guys have the blueprint to make um [noise] you know the enterprise then they could show you how to do it\nAnd they do things with a light in with a ... the whole set up is built um ... this year I had a had a train or a moderate it was like a train station and the town yeah and and I had like a little late you got dying they dislike that thing together so fat now oh is it is incredibly oh they didn't bring that in like ... it was no it's\nIt it all they they come in with tubs the big ... and they're all pieces most of the the bases are put together but then they just snapped them altogether as they go and yeah it's a quick\nI guess yeah ... yeah as three or four of them there it's unreal\nComedy I watch Tom Ryan\nA combine into the hardest working artist in a impossibly in local a con history a check them out at the WWW dot Tom Ryan so T O M R y A N ... and then add another ... studio\nAt ... dot com and you could check out some of his stuff I bought our second piece of art from Tom yesterday for our living room my wife like the ... I brought one home from terrific con\nTom that really fantastic paintings ... I'm not buying the original aren't buying print by some very fantastic paintings or he paint them\nAnd I bought a bear from him this very cool\nPurple bear with wings and the halo\nAnd yesterday I picked up a uh an hour with its wings outstretched and and the guys fantastic and he literally that every show ever\nWell I don't know how he does it what was being where we first met them yes we might have been ... years ago when I got the uh the the wage for a very specific poster from Christmas Vacation yeah if you guys have Christmas Vacation there's a scene where\nI'm Glad he is dumping out of the port a let out of the RV and there's a famous line that we can't stay here and W. E. S. U. F. M. not at this hour blank fall [laughter] yeah and if you know the movie you know we're talking about John Fell in love with it immediately and we just\nDo different things and he watched our stuff and getting not that I was to wear names and grab it but it's still feeling to know that you know [laughter]\nIt's true it's being being there and the church it's a it's it's kinda cool I mean it's such a laid back atmosphere and this is old setting\nI did give us couches this year so there is some odd they're oddly comfortable furniture there that's for sure\nAnd I got to say it's kinda it's kinda weird but um [noise] you know I just I Wish that my style I'm painting and again I Hope you listen to the point\nIs that making seven o'clock man if you can go to our hours easy\nYou can do to more hours each way or the art fight again\nMe and John you know our last year the winter if you remember we talked about last year you're not gonna remember this but our objective so they basically they have two of us standing on stage and he does with multiple people most of the natural artist by the way John and I'm not I'm standing on stage and someone shouts out a character and then someone shouts out a\nAn action to take and they have you do it last year\nIt was they wanted a Audrey too from little shop of horrors of breaking out of a boom box and uh I'd be John and that one I'm not bragging by the way because [laughter] this is the objective is is bad are all around it's it's just like glorified stick figure that it's just yeah I think it was more people felt bad I think the only thing that made me feel good this year I'll tell you the second was\nLast year I don't think anybody wanted my picture and if you're a little kid asked for my picture so out of this year it was because he was yeah I I was in a row of the time she had a ... from lord of the rings\nA verse so his someone yelled out his towards name was staying which it is\nAnd then they said what is he doing well he's gonna be start fighting who sang the actual a lead singer of the leaders so we poorly drew that although I I have to admit when we when I looked at both of them both are things are very familiar both you're staying with very spiky here I think we're thinking of things circa Nineteen eighty two maybe\nYeah I always messed this up seeing is Gordon Sumner right\nAlf is Gordon Sherman way [laughter] I always wanted to say that the thing is Gordon Sherman way what is what's your name well John Wayne southerner\nThere is so close I guarantee that the only person that struggles with that if they're member outfit awful it's it's weird 'cause his things done is now out performing as Gordon oh is he really are are Graham Graham ...\nI don't know so now I'm messing up the next but either way he sounds just like saying oh really yeah it's a\nAmazing actually and does anybody out there if you want to call in to the dugout yes you requests line [laughter] eight six six eight five seven seven zero zero if you can answer this question we're not going to really give you anything but we're going to say we we don't have any price we don't have any prizes led to this point but we're gonna we're gonna shots you out on the air\nAnd that we don't get to talk so much a pop culture with you on the air although you've done some of the podcast but\nTell people out there what are some of the shows that you've been watching lately that you're really enjoying that maybe people should check out a Hulu or because we don't have cable any of that stuff what some of the stuff that you've been watching lately that you really dig\nA well than watching a practical joker\nYeah that that those guys are funny a practical joke is four guys a high school friends who ... it's very much a a practical joke show but they will they will do anything that the I guess the contract has written that it's like it's like candid camera it kind of like candid camera with four guys from Long Island I'm not showing\nMy age [laughter] yeah ... fun [laughter]\nPractical joker is that something makes you laugh what else what would what some scripted stuff that you like\n... ...\nYeah that's a good one that's a good one I couldn't get into that you didn't like that when it's not that I didn't like I just couldn't get into she's infectious happy Kimmy Schmidt and uh\nYeah I feel like that's not fair gun thank now [laughter]\n\nSo we can go from one end that this actually happy what's the name of the other show that you watch that's like the most depressing thing on Earth I'm\nTell him tell all have you seen this thing now because it's again it's like a you know this is one of those shows uh she watches and and I know it's based off of the books\nIn the future uh wow God women are are if they're able to bear child there may subservient to\nTo like the it's it's horrible it's horrible it's a I mean it's a well written well acted show but it's just it's kind of like we talked about earlier um yesterday we were just talking about a another great show also an Amazon show 'cause this that they have it on sale right and then\nYes but I think that's cool oh\nOkay me I think I think you're wrong on that one but I could be wrong no you know what I made my who I think you're right that's ... that comes out once a week\nRight now and it used to be just NBC [laughter] yeah I Know she was so easy\nBut the other show that I found that ain't away is a another great show that you watch and I watched the first season the ... which if you've never seen this great but it's about an alternate\nUm history at the history where the axis one world war two and so everything's different and I take sleep in the sixties Nineteen sixty two right so it's about Twenty years after\nUh the Germans and the Japanese have actually one and the world it's just it's a much different place again it did show but it's it's one of those shows you like The Handmaid's tale it's an\nUgly yeah it's an ugly show it's really well crafted it's really well acted as a lot of money that they've spent on a CGI special effects are incredible in that show it's pretty amazing\nThat got credit for it but not everyone I've been watching\nAh yeah you know and I I got to pick up on that again\nThe good places one of those shows Kimmy Schmidt is another one that that ah oh there's a giant ant that almost crawled on me I'm going to kill him or I didn't tell them I just flipped him off at home or a good place to another show like the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\nThat Lindsey watched I did not watch with her or she wasn't kind enough to ask me if I wanted to watch it with her and from some kind of like hang on to it from kind of paying attention to it I really kind of like the good place\nBecause it's a really cool idea yeah it's it's one that uh one of the other a DJ to catch her cat a really enjoys yeah has tried to talk me into watching and I tried to I just I Need to be more involved in the show I\nWatch a lot of TV and back I don't know how you do that because ... most of its just dull yeah there are shows that I could put on like and and do something while I'm while I have it on but for ... ... very similar you we can be watching a show or movie and she just get up and go in another room I Can't do that I've got a positive I've gotta because most\nOf these shows just that they're not smart enough to maintain your attention like men in the high castle I have to be like focused in on it right that what you're talking in the I asked yeah there's twenty minutes of that I I don't need to know because there's nothing\nImportant in those two minutes [laughter] I can tell you exactly how it's going to end because the show's already so\nIt's so crafted for you to shut your brain on right you know you don't need\nOne of the reasons that a lot of people have said to me you know did did you watch legion I watched the first episode and I realized\nI this is a show that I have to have a full attention for every time\nAnd unfortunately you know working on stuff\nMy full attention is maybe one episode or two I I watch trip to the daredevil this afternoon and then the second one I uh I I watched forty minutes of it and then woke up at the end and finished it and then had to go back and watch the twenty minutes in between that I you know except for the care and paid stuff now carrying heritage stuff in that it's just\nI don't know what [laughter] I should get rid of that character\nSo what else what else have you been uh checking on TV or movies or anything that you really dug lately and anything with Henry ... yeah I hear your cab all\nBut I don't even know [laughter] I'd have to prevent from the just the movie [laughter] oh okay I had no idea of yeah [laughter]\n[noise] uh yeah the the whole [laughter] I'm a when if you don't combat dog that I met [laughter]\nIf you ever listen to our podcast or you might hear that in the background Lindsay is a is a earth angel and when we record the potash sequestered dogs several rooms away because my dogs have absolutely no chill whatsoever a they have never wants to be able to be quiet we actually didn't we record one of the episodes with ah yeah we recorded October Lloyd\nWhen you were in um ... uh Gary Cohn and we had to have the dogs in the room with the good ones you're recording with us and they said quite the whole time\nThat's a rarity yeah it was really weird it was really weird I think it was because Lindsay was there and they just they chilled out and lay down but my God All right well I just wanted to get John stay high love yeah in a in a\nHe's not coming home tonight I'm not coming home tonight [laughter] going home with John ... yeah yeah if I knew it was going to happen yeah I I wanted to break if you live on air [laughter] I've got I've got rich crackers ooh you know how she did\nDie I'm assuming you know not to eat it and you eat a lot of cheese it's All right Lynn I Love you I I Will be home in a you know an hour or so\nSo [laughter] I like being on paying the comics\nThank you bye\nAlright [laughter] that was my wife Lindsay what the answer it was John Constantine are created by our friends the descent who we interview that time a Coca Cola created deepest at and Alan Moore and and a ...\nA mark Buckingham mark Buckingham I'm Sorry I'm Sorry a no wait no oh no\nNo you're right that it it's okay All right I thought I I'm a I'm\nMessing that up with um a miracle man\nMiracle man was Alan Moore mark bucket mocking him\nAnd a Neal game and got caught a bit later on\nEarly eighties that was great about seven minutes no miracle man goes way back to the fifty well the one that Alan Moore well it's it's all connected oh okay All right that I remember reading that at the heart of the problem okay they basically miracle man is a\nA ... the British version of captain marvel the the ship them kept okay I'm so confusing people take out the marvel now because we've almost officially a agreed that\nKept marvels only in the marvel universe and that we now call the other guys you know I agree with you I I hate it I hate it I saw a video of the other day with a with a factory Levi near Comic Con and he was going around asking people if they can tell him\nOr what the ah what the acronym of his name stands for and uh and he kept saying what's my name and I'm like that's not your name out of the very end of it he actually said we've got another guy who dressed like captain marvel and I'm Wondering if like someone from DC slap them [laughter] and I can't say those words [laughter]\nIt's so weird I mean originally that the character was called marble man I'm from the fifties from the fifties like er and when not who ... who who is this was a publisher in England\nIt's okay and this was not a I'm a DC or I mean I don't know if he's pretty that was\nA faucet publications was was the originator of original public publisher of the captain marvel books which were whiz comics a while and then captain marvel junior and a few others I I uh I Can't remember them All right now but I was never that big of a fan of\n... stuff so okay it was just it's fun\nIt's a good story it's a really brutal story as the as to how things ended up at D.C but in England they decided to publish a character but he he ended up being called marvel man\nThey completely changed everything he said instead of saying she's him he would say ... which is all he had a word to yeah he had a different word um\nUm is actually a like a twelve year old kid who when he uses the the\nThe words as damn he's granted powers by uh the wizards use them and he dreams the ... and I'm going to try this [laughter] I watch any off it's not a you know it's tougher as the blackout aversion yeah that's the blackout versions base I I I watched the video I didn't realize I Know it was different\nForces you into this first right and then it's on that road and the arts centers further down the road there yeah and it's just an awesome time are we going to get out there and it's this display is going through a anywhere it yeah through ... asked him 'cause I he said to me he said oh I've got a I've got all my classic I'm a monster art and the the capital stuff\nAnd I'm like oh he's going to say it's like for three more days and now he's like no goes through January on my all perfect and things that uh for a long time awesome\nAnd uh there's musicians up there frequently so yeah we met a guy yesterday\nThis is another guy who met yesterday with I don't remember his name I met a guy maybe Kevin\nWho who is a musician and he said that he\nHe I guess directed at some point you're still directs the uh the the ... the Springfield company remember the gentleman in the in the star trek to do a monitor what are they called monster maroon ... yeah the um hockey player this guy knows his Star Trek yeah and he was dressed in of your if you want to close your eyes and picture\nThe uniform they change over from Star Trek the motion picture where they had those really shiny suit awful jumpsuits suits and then they went to Star Trek to where they had those kind of actual naval looking\nA double breasted jak if there are more ruined and the black parents that were\nTucked into the booth and everything this guy had and he made most of it I guess he didn't make the flat part you said to the jacket was was not something he may okay ah put everything together but we ... guy pins but and he's done how was involved with a with the truck he tours he's done\nSome some work with the folks that are have been doing a filming for for um fan based track stuff okay right very local things in the area and in New York he said but ah but yeah he he was up at a truck on

stands in Mount [laughter] if I'm Out in the guy who's playing Christopher Pike\nIn the upcoming season of Star Trek discovery which yet again if you did not watch Star Trek discovery and you have the ability to watch it I think\nLloyd the Mansour actually set it comes out this week on DVD and Blu ray or next week\nThe that is unless it's a hundred bucks that is the first season worth purchasing I enjoyed and worth watching or maybe it was like maybe fourteen episodes\nBut a really good Star Trek story I'm a little bit more what's the word I'm serialized ... not a self uh self yeah yeah it's definitely there is an arc along yeah there's a long arc and there's a couple of hours that kind of go through the show it's it's definitely a building oh you've got a\nCall so [laughter] I guess I'll
