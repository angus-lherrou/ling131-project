S. U. N. decency and I'm seeing any pilot policy please contact our board of directors at age six zero six eight five seven seven zero zero or visited at W. E. S. U. of Penn dot org\nSo that means anybody who's up late listening to the radio like all you crazy kids than in middle school\nNow a days you're going to have to turn that dial up for the night get some good sleep you got to school tomorrow you should probably be studying or something anyway over here at the Holland Tunnel we are going to do a couple of things so like I mentioned before\nThe Holland Tunnel as a tunnel connects New Jersey and New York\nIf you aren't from New Jersey or New York you probably never been in the Holland Tunnel\nBut that's okay and they were going to be looking at a three kind of separate groups of of songs in art is the first we're going to take it back to the late nineties in the early to thousands for an hour and be recognized as some of those especially if you you grew up in the mid to thousands\nOr went to like the eighth grade dances and stuff like that\nUm [noise] the next group will will ... is our some low Jim we're going to take it down a couple notches let everybody relax a little bit and they were going to be right back up\nWith the newer stuff some nights ah like bluesy funky rock and roll type music\nIt's going to be a really good time I'm looking forward to it I Hope everybody is having a good night you're listening to W E s U Middletown and right now we're going to listen to some more music talk to you in\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd [noise] you don't want to get down on me to go do [noise] and I want to get out [noise]\nGonna do it if you really don't know\nOh you do that though they believe\nGoing to do it if you don't do\nA lot better than they do we\nDa\nDu ... you want to get out\n... do\nJob\nApparatus by apparatus is hope everyone is having a good night the couple of songs you just heard are of course all from New York New Jersey\nPainter off the album worry again her and finally I won't from ... off the album double the luck I'm Sorry trouble deluxe edition a\nCool in the gang is it is an incredible group really great music some great stuff out of them\nUm you're probably familiar with some of the music from the mid nineties then featured heavily in movies and TV um the biggest example I can think of it that cool in the gang comes up all the time in the show scrub which was on from like two thousand and three to like two thousand twelve or something like that forever\nOr have you watched that show you've heard cool in the gang um but they're all over that was one of their\nUm somewhat lesser known hid although that's probably are not the deepest cuts of all of them but maybe we'll get there in the coming weeks where again are of course famous for uh the song I Will survive\nI'm the answer a little bit less well known hopefully give you an idea of what some of her other songs alike of that had a lot more of the of the like true R. and B. vibe than I Will survive or some of the other songs that she's done that was good and then they take on a\n... that you all know him or he he was really big I think for a while I'm at the song I personally hadn't heard until very recently so hope you enjoy that one\nAs it did a show about New York and New Jersey artist it's only appropriate that we talk about New York or New Jersey so I uh I was driving the other day so I I drive ... students places they need to go because that's just something that I Do in my ...\nUm but yeah so I was driving a group of of what's going to all of whom were from New York City and it's it's really fascinating to be\nSurrounded by people who are all from New York because no matter where they are from as long as they're from like ... and no matter what borough there in or whatever as long as they're from and why the they they all have something to talk about for hours and hours and it it's really interesting to me is coming from New Jersey I come from a really rural part\nI'm with not a lot of exciting stuff uh but I I I mean I Know it pretty well uh but it's not like I I Know the ins and outs of the geography and how to get from one place to another\nIf anybody is from New York anybody who get together they're like all know that same specific places and they're all really like of Europe places um they were talking about like\nThe donut shop on on one eighty four and then you take the D train up uptown to and it's just a bunch of words I don't really understand I Pretend to understand how the trains work in New York\nUh but I don't think anybody from New Jersey really knows how the trains work and they just know how they're trained to work that they need to take to get wherever they go they're commuting I'm from New York has really do know the train edit it very interesting to listen in our conversation with them because they'll be talking about\nWhich train station they they use the most than and like what restaurant is right nearby and everybody knows what everybody's talking about no matter\nHow long ago they they ... they moved out of New York or no matter how long ago are no matter where they're they're placed to geographically within like actually like New York like the island\nUm which is really interesting so\nEverybody has gone in New York that don't mean anything to anybody else it's kind of a ... um local bonding experience I guess I don't really have that in New Jersey I'm you know there's not that much exciting we we we\nYeah there's just not I don't think there's anything super exciting in New Jersey that everybody from New Jersey like oh yeah I've been there I Know what that is\nUm their places in New York that everybody in New Jersey has been to that we talk about\nBut other than that I Will admit as the New Jersey and that New Jersey is slightly more boring than New York but that's okay we have some exciting stuff ah we have some cool artists\nWhich is pretty nice uh some really cool band which will be hearing as we continue through the program but we just don't have the geography anyway\nUh yes so W if you will be having its record fair this upcoming Sunday at back um hall in a at Wesleyan University I'm yet to\nBe running from eleven AM to four pm please come out support us support a college radio stations freeform radio\nThat we don't have to talk to the man and play corporate ads or by some records it's really cool stuff there I think uh\nLike an hour at the beginning for early bird people come in there and and\nTears through records looking for a specific things and they they usually find a couple of things like a serious collector so if you are a serious collector we have the stuff for you if not you can come by um will have some live DJ playing over the airwaves and within back um hall which will be really cool [noise]\nUm you could buy some merge you can buy a teacher\nUh and if you can't make it to the event you can visit as a W the UFM dot org and buy some T shirts and stuff there and make a donation\nWhatever you can do to help us out and if you're listening now you want to make a donation mentioned the show the Holland Tunnel\nAnd they gave me like a nice pat on the back through an email um which is somewhat in personal but you know a book for someone who thrived on on a attention and who who thrives on validation\nIt really does mean the I mean the world to me um I wept lashed last last time I got someone imagine my show when they've donated I ... I ... over that email so\nUh if you want to make a twenty year old college student weep\nDonate the money and mentioned the show wow what a beautiful bonding moment we just had thank you guys so much for that\nBut without further ado we're going to do really here to do tonight which is listen to some more music so now you hurt our our nineties R. and B. I'm ... we're going to transition a little bit slow things down these uh these songs or a\nFree love birds out there it's slow danced in the kitchen it'll be sweet it's a nice little moment um so we're going to hear three slower song\nYou're going to be here uh last night when we were young\nThat's actually from Don McLean but it's an album from twenty eleven so ah Don McLean of course is famous for like American Pie and Vincent which came out what in the in the seventies in the eighties\nOr but he still releasing stuff so this this is a song from twenty eleven off the album botanical gardens relief in the same year that's what will start us off and they're going to hear some some other kind of cool stuff the more obscure stuff that we'll talk about when\nWe come back but on till then I Will be a Jew\n\nLast night\nWe were young\nLove was the star\nLedger song on this song\nLife was so new\nSo review Snover\nAge usually go\nToday\nThe world is are\nYou from\nThey choose to the\nProbably [noise]\nDo you can do\nA lot of talk about yoga oh no a lot of flak given to yoga oh no for allegedly you know breaking\nUp the Beatles and stuff like that I don't know if I totally believe that narrative I don't think we should but in either case I'm In talking\nAbout that whole narrative we we kinda lose who Yoko owner was ... and uh she was a really talented artist or like ... like um [noise] like physical I don't know for like studio art or like she did some really incredible\nOh no and like the plastic ... or something like that um and she got a solo career with a song like that what would I really liked it I think it has a good\nDown to I think if I'm the kind of um like a collect Dick\nSort of a lyrics and found an experimental isn't that you would expect from from Yoko owner if you're familiar with any of her like Judy ... pieces but uh I think it's so it's like one of her\nLately less experimental pieces just to kind of get our foot\nIn the door at the show we might be playing the more obscure stuff from her later but I mean at that point anything from yoga\nAnd I was kind of a cigar right compared to to obviously the music of of the person she was married to or anything like that so\nUh yeah I really liked that song will probably be playing more yoga oh no\nUm she's a good boy I really like that\nSo I Hope you enjoy it as well that last time we heard was summertime from a lot of David off the album love again I'm also a just a really pretty sound really relaxing\nThat's the one that really got me into this like calm had been uncommon mood\nUm she has a really really nice voice or the song and like that so often to stick easy listening type of thing that I like to study too and and read 'em like read books while I'm listening to it stuff like that so that'll probably make its way onto my\nAcoustic mixed on my spot if I play with but uh yeah\nSo all of those were a New York artist\nUm [noise] yeah and I think that that that's pretty much it's\nListening to the Holland Tunnel by the way which is a a look at New York and New Jersey or to some some new stuff some old stuff some well known bands not dwell on the band when ...\nFrom who whichever artist or bad we happen to be playing\nYeah so our next group is dogs were going to listen to it the newer stuff um a couple of new bands right out of New York city um all these songs are from twenty eight teams there from the past six months or so\nI'm In all of them have this really cool I wanted to end the show on that it has this really cool like a like funky vi beat down to kind of kind of like rock and roll type stuff uh but all this stuff is new so we'll talk about the band a little bit after\nWe play these songs but hopefully you enjoy the next couple ah you're listening to WBFO Middletown DJ goose egg call in if you have any requests then he thought that he thinks there oh sixty five seven seven zero zero ... and then everybody and we will talk after a couple more song\nFrom\nAnd so now I'm Guy and\n[noise] and and [noise]\n[noise]\n\nManaged to me than the [noise]\n\n\n\nDidn't know how\nDo\nYou're\nA man\nThe time [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nUh\nI'm

president he's acting as though he's going to win\nOn how ... what uh what is supposed to not represent\nFor the for the new liberal capitalism in Brazil\nThat's a very good question very important question a\nWell first of all we're talking about\nSocial media but the mainstream media let's say that nearly a brew\nConservative mainstream media\nAlso a start to trick him here's a radical fashion this course in a normal weight you know it's hard to normalize\nAnd that and many analogies with the United states and the election here\nExactly very similar to saying the same way that the media was fading Strunk before the elections now that it's more criticism of him but at that time of course you know all the mainstream media was promoting him though are very similar situation and then of course you know the new liberal potty\nHand which is a very dangerous path right into and uh just to give you an example in the economy is rights which is a mainstream ... magazine or in England had the front page covert saying that that both a lotta would be dangerous for Brazil so at that time we asked\nHow are you in the room going to react in Britain you right but ah it seems that said they're going to embrace both on that are so the ... the newly Ambrose we're going to embrace fascism which is very dangerous\nNow uh the uh you you mentioned wants to most when I was about ... or ... or how he voted in the name of torture or around the a corruption scandal what is it what are his links to the military given Brazil's history with the dictatorship\nHe is there a very real fear under able for NATO regime if it does happen that we could see a sliding back into fascism into military dictatorship\nYes for sure there was expelled from the army because you know he is so extreme events with answers insects or something the army but here in uh the\nCandidate for vice presidents are which is also on military guy he already said that so we should stroll the constitution out which is than on the current president goes to the ocean was created in\nNineteen eighty eight before almost Thirty years of I mean is there a dictatorship and it's almost the first democratic cook this notion that we have and he's saying oh we should just throw that away and have a small group of\nPeople creating a new constitution so they're talking about going back to the dictatorship very openly\nElevated has had a dramatic increase in the political power that it's managed to grab it will be short period of time can you explain I'm ... how much power I taught them how how that came to be the same forces around a\nPoor media coverage fake news on the you know and everything just lit up to ... some right\nYeah that yeah it is within the same context or\nI mean imagine a joint the impeachment of president do more with staff\nAll t._v. stations were calling for protests against her and we're broadcasting those trucks that live all day long ... two years past ... years they have made ... cents at a pack\nOn the chain on that last on progressive forces but it's actually amazing that little is to the most popular leaving the country you know even though he thinks\nHe's constantly attacked in the media or\nSo but that is of course within that context we saw a discourse of have\nOf the year being X craft and then the ... pills to that Gawker calls in just settle actions at the same time\nYou know we increase the number of women a progressive women are in Congress and the the the the also elected a new people younger people I'm afro Brazilians indigenous people got elected\nFor Congress so you know it it's not as bad as we ... with states so we have also a very huge company that the president women parts and they're\nHam had sex ... that said in a couple of weeks or a Facebook group\nExactly so because the thing is that we are women don't mention his name or on social media and then on the\nWomen start to say well we don't want to promote his name so uh the hashtags not ham became huge in Brazil so and that and then a week ago\nAlso very large protests led by women against him so not having\nThe knock him come ... and you know became very popular as\nWell so do you use a lot of opposition on the ground to what both for NATO represent\nNow it's a matter of Buddhist showing up at the polls um I understand that tens of millions of Brazilians did not vote on Sunday during the initial election on and on like the United states you actually are are obliged to vote illegally if you don't\nVote you have to explain why you didn't vote kind of like jury service during the u._s. um do you expect will first why do you think why did so many not boat\nAnd second I'm real those non voters show up during the\nElection on ... you know that you've Brazil from a boost when auto presidency yeah\nI think that about that in me and then the proteins unfold and are both on that\nPower than a fight in need them votes\nAnd died while set in ... as well so I'm with a third of the\nPeople who can vote citizen so I think that it's because of this the idea that the politics that it doesn't matter or ... well we do all politicians are all politicians are corrupt\nThat are in the Senate since all that\n... when they grow out of the thing is there's\nNothing matters less than that\nNow you and I had talked a lot on this program about um how the current president of Brazil Michel Temer who's\nYou know basically I'm Carrying out to the rest of his term as a lame duck president\nUm how he too has been a very much I'm under the uh uh he has been implicated in corruption scandals and ease represents the right wing in Brazil I understand that he's going to try to\nRush through or many of his unpopular policies in the last few months of this year as possible what is the link between ... and ... not really funny [noise] [noise]\nWhile we're seeing now it's really a\nNearly ... or ... sort of a of a structure adjustment pharmacist embracing fascism ah with all that to have\nThe new new Bruce and Bruce you would raise their ... their sense of fascism but that's not what's happening um\nWe have talked about that here that's one of the reason for the beach or maybe the main rent that would include man upstairs to measures rides cuts in social programs prevention station of a a\nState's comp and it's a swat allow for example foreign ah corporations oil corporations to explore the offshore oil reserves in Brazil so the U.S\nCorporations have a big role I have been playing a big role in undermining democracy so you know and that of course and just made that the situation the war's a when that President Zuma and go in her\nMusic and memory and\nSaturday morning at seven on W E s U middle\nNot supposed to die I don't I'm not so much as I did\nWas made a few changes to our due time schedule in an effort to bring listeners are diverse daytime talk radio programs sooner than later with him for some of your favorite we support the program said nine AM and two PM and don't miss rising up\nSo now we've had this new time one right after democracy now you can find a full program on line or W. B. S. U. of M. topped work we can also find two weeks of our programs to catch up on any shows [noise]\nYou're listening to W E s few Middletown eighty eight point one FM it doesn't ... W E s U Middletown ... now and fame [noise]\nHi I'm Melinda Hamel guard a registered dietitian and investigative nutritionist on a mission to connect the dots between food health and agriculture\nAnd find food truth and today it's an honor to welcome my guest Mr Rick does he has a photo journalist and senior advisor to the water keeper alliance\nIn fact Mr dove has been a part of the water keeper movement Nineteen Ninety three he was one of the founding members of the water keeper alliance board he served on its first board of directors\nAnd as the former river keeper for the Neuse River in North Carolina and one of the first river keepers in the south east Mr dad has assisted in the birth of many of the water keeper programs in North Carolina as well as many others across the country\nMr dove pioneered the use of aircraft in documenting sources of pollution and if you've seen any images of the horrific bills that have happened both through the coal lash and livestock disasters related\nOf the Neuse River pertaining to it's horrific fish killed and human health impacts resulting from the deadly vampire organisms hysteria gained worldwide attention and major reforms in pollution practices route the news watershed resulted\nHis photographs have appeared in many publications and he might have seen his work in important books including animal factory and the water's turn to blood this moment on earth crimes against nature and righteous pork chop\nPrior to joining the water keep her movement Mr dove is a licensed attorney and he served at the United States Marine\nAfter twenty five years and serving twice in Vietnam he retired as a colonel and military judge and his many honors include the EPA region for merit award and being named one of time magazine time for kids' heroes of the planet\nHe now advises the water keeper alliance is pure farm pure water campaign in North Carolina\nThe campaign has served as a nation wide model for its effectiveness in the prevention of environmental abuses of industrial animals factories he lived on the news river near New Bern North Carolina welcome Mr dive it's an honor to have you with me thank you for having\nWell I have been aware of your writing and your images over the course of say the past decade in which you've documented the horrific effect of hurricanes and the worst ending storms on pollution in the beautiful North Carolina eastern shore\nAnd I wonder if you could just tell us how did you become involved in the water keeper alliance\nWell it was ... a retired Marine corps and I wanted to do\nWhat I Dreamed about as a young man and become a commercial fisherman ... school of course did other things\nAnd my ... shoes in uniform and went home and put on my oldest dirtiest clothes and went out on the river with my son open to see food store and\nWas having the time of my life until the fish began to die and we began to get sick and suffer memory loss insurers on her body and\nHad to walk away from it and then and opportunity came up with the Neuse River foundation to become a water vapor\nAnd the Neuse River keeper and that's how it all started back in Nineteen Ninety three\nSo were you being affected at the time by the organism Syria\nI was I didn't know it at the time my son and I were suffering from memory loss I had sores on my body\nAnd I knew that something was wrong in the river 'cause the source on the fish were exactly the same as the ones that we were suffering but I didn't know what was doing it I didn't know if it was a human waste in the water or just what it was it wasn't till around Nineteen Ninety to Ninety three\nThat the organism hysteria ... was discovered and the impacts of that in a neuro talks and put in the air as well as the water\nWe're all linked to the symptoms that my son and I were suffering\nAnd so how did that Oregon is going to be in the river\nWell it's likely been around forever it's a vampire organism that's one cell animal you could put a hundred thousand of them on the head of a pin yet when it's in the water and too many nutrients are in the water too much fertilizer for example\nIt grows out of control and then it attacks fish by putting a neuro talks in in the water which also gets in the air\nThe fish suffocate or die from it and they attacked the fish to get to its blood cells because that's what they eat the blood cells and they'll do the same thing to people as they do to fish and it was very\nAnd they document of all this verified it and publish their report in the world's leading medical journal the Lancet\nSo it was over a period of years that we've finally found out exactly what had happened to us and we know that this organism fish the area and these massive fish pills that we suffered on the river we're just a few weeks of billion fish we thought\nWe knew that that had never happened in North Carolina until the whole industry time while they're not\nObviously totally responsible for all the pollution in the river they certainly are big shores\nWell I have looked on math\nAnd I have seen just how many confined animal feeding operations\nExist in North Carolina I Believe you are one of the leading state for the industrial hide industry as well as the poultry industry and I believe it was back in the nineties when the first hurricane of significance hit\nAnd cause massive destruction of these facilities where\nWe saw in ... I Believe they were your images of hogs floating in the water and I believe these images were so horrific that the industry now doesn't open the gate and let the animals out they just die in place [noise]\nTell me about your first incident where you capture these images of debt hog\nI've been following hurricanes in North Carolina says there's been a whole lot of them going all the way back to Ninety six words are even friend and then\nThe big one was for it in the nineties that was in Nineteen Ninety nine but then we've had other hurricanes and the two thousands we've had Irene a Isabel and then just two years ago we had Matthew\nSo this hurricane was pretty much the same is Floyd\nWhat hurricanes affect different areas show one hurricane will impact one area of eastern North Carolina and another one would would impact somewhere else\nWhich really hard to measure except when we fly and wish you all these\nEnvironment buildings underwater with poultry and we all we know that if their animals inside and many times there are because they couldn't get him out there like we all die and hard to know how many died because you know frankly I just don't trust the figures of the industry and\nIt's a sad situation I've followed it during Floyd after forward and and all the other thing\nYeah I think it was the images from Floyd when I first really became aware of the horrific consequences of this storm and as you said we are seeing more of them they are becoming stronger they do hit different regions as you say\nBut I'm Wondering what happens next so as a dietitian I'm concerned about certainly antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria that are getting out in the water we've seen the urine and feces and\nI think it's interesting just how much weight hogs produced and yet it is not treated other than collecting it in an open pit what is called a lagoon by the industry [noise]\nSo what happens next now that the disaster has struck the floods have come the waste is dreaming into rivers and the ocean where we do\nWell the answer to that one word is nothing\nI Know that everybody believes that after a hurricane like worried or like Florence just to this and we have all these images and shield is equal waste running\nSo they're really obsessed city area of of W age group as it is Murphy in in in that operation which is what started over ... here in North Carolina but it's an interesting thing because the way\nThese are all called inner graders they own the hogs but they give us a hogs under contract\nTo a local grower local grower\nIs responsible to build the buildings\nTo do what exactly is the industry says they want it on to build a ... but they're also responsible for anything that goes wrong for example they only get paid for the ... live hog dies then they're responsible for that whole area and they don't get paid for it\nIf the lagoon breaks loose or they if they violate and spray into ditches and it runs in the waterway they're responsible for that they're responsible for the pollution under contract the integrated takes all of a liability and shift it down to the local grower\nWhich is really unfair because the local grower has no other option he either grows for the integrate or he doesn't grow it all doesn't grow the hogs at all\nRight so the integrated has so much control\nAnd when things go wrong like in these hurricanes like with Lawrence everybody's looking at the local grower because he's got a problem with this lagoon\nWell he can't afford to get rid of a lagoon and put in a wastewater treatment system\nOnly Smith field and W. H. grew loans Mayfield can do that they're the only ones that have the resources to do that so we're kind of stuck with growers who can afford to do the right thing\nAnd an industry who\nGrows there hubs under contract with that grower who won't do the right\nTo the pressure has to come from the public to force or legislators to force a change in treatment system you know and\nAnd that ... that that's very hard but it that's the only way\nCampaigns and shown alright so whenever anything happens in North Carolina for example you when the drone technology became available there were many groups at one to fly drones to get video of what's going on in these hog farms in the journal assembly in North Carolina came up very quickly\nAnd said you cannot fly a drone overall farm\nIn North Carolina and then they increased the trespass laws and they came up with gag laws and you know they they do everything to protect the industry nothing to protect the people who are forced to live near these factor phone\nWell and I can only imagine that the individual he had a livelihood the only livelihood they knew in the fishing industry their lives have been devastated as well\nYes there are a lot of people in eastern North Carolina who are suffering as a result of this whole thing\nAnd there are a lot of people trapped yeah some people who work\nFor the industry who need these jobs and it would all be so much better if the industry would just go ahead and invest in clean technologies that are shift right you don't have to invent anything new we know Shaq really what's needed\nTo properly treat the ways to get rid of the older and to be a good neighbor\nIndustry just does not want to spend the money to do\nExactly in addition to the hog waste and poultry waste that's gone into the waterways you also have the added burden of the coal last [noise] and\nI Can't imagine the combination of toxic soup that is affecting the residents of birth Carolina I Hope that the north Carolina department of health\nIs monitoring what's happening as a result of the disasters\nCoalesced problem is her wrist\nThe ice and I flew as recently as yesterday and I took video and I took pictures they can see 'em up on the water keeper dot org website on the Flickr account or their posted up there\nBut you can see the coal ash just and and that's very toxic stuff by the way right you can see it\nRunning downstream I think there's something like thirty thousand people that are downstream on the Cape Fear River where this actually just flown right through\nTheir communities along the river which is flooded heavily in that area you can see the firm's broken loose you can see the coal ash rash running everywhere it's\nIt's a terrible mess it uh it Wilmington a sudden and then of course we've had coalesce bills in the past up in Danville in up at the leap land on the Neuse River in Goldsboro\nThis business of burning coal and storing the ash over many many many years and now trying to get rid of it it's an expensive proposition and the industry is looking for cheaper ways to do it then comes a hurricane and it takes care of business by wishing all of that coal last right down on the people\nYou know I I Believe mercury and arsenic are present in class and I know I looked at what happens to children's brains when they're exposed to tiny part of the toxins parts per billion\nIs um and there are many different toxins in they're the ones you mentioned that there are many many more I I Do the photography and ... but ... and others who you should get on your program Donald listened be would be a real good person she's with water vapor\nAnd she's actually been it Wilmington and um she's been out on the boat actually over the ash ponds that they have there and they've been taking samples\n... well I Will be sure to bring her voice to our listeners in the future we just have a couple of minutes left so I Want to give you an opportunity to contribute anything else to this conversation that I might have missed\nWell you know here's the way I should\nWe are in a rush to get the ... are the laws of men and their laws of nature of the laws of nature far superior to anything we pass those laws are journals somebody can say it's okay to do all these things and hurricanes and cause the pollution they can excuse everything\nBut at some point if we don't fix this show mother nature's gonna step in with a consequence that none of us can tolerate it would be the swine flu it could be fish kills it could be toxic gases I I don't know\nWhat this much I Do know Mother Nature is not going to allow us to continue doing what we're doing all these factory animal facilities without giving us a consequence likes of which we will not like\n... thank you for that I Will make sure that our listeners have a link to the article that appeared in the Washington Post I Will have a link to the water keeper alliance Web site\nIn closing I Need to let our listeners know that I Want to thank our listeners for joining us remind everyone that foods with radio is produced by Dan Hamel guard ... studios in beautiful downtown Columbia, Missouri and most of all I Want to thank you Mr does for documenting\nWhat we can't see from the ground and I want to thank you for writing about it and showing us the real harms that we are experiencing and will continue to experience unless we change our ways I Want to remind everyone that we had been speaking\nAnti as a photo journalist extraordinary will make sure to show your pictures thank you so much for being I

H. O. one\nPretty important reports laying out the dimensions of the problem\nWe also have examples of success so take for example the country of Scotland amazing what's going on there the entire country has been mobilized to make Beijing care safer\nAnd the results are stunning they've got well over a twenty percent decline in surgery mortality they've got a major decline and errors and care that they can document so when you get mobilized and we can do stuff science is advancing really fast\nWoken up we understand the science is a safety now we need leadership the big deal here is what boards of trust these CEOs of hospitals chief medical officer is chief nursing officers please understand that making patients save his job one\nWe're speaking today with Dr Don Berwick president murder is senior fellow at the Institute for healthcare improvement in former administrator\nOf the center for Medicare and Medicaid services talked to her when you talked about these inherent challenges in the American health care system and\nWe're seeing big players coming in you got Amazon partnership with Berkshire Hathaway G. P. Morgan Chase coming in and you got apple and other technology giants entering into the personal health technologies space\nBut also looking at how do you control cost here\nBut I'm Wondering what you think about these disruptive innovations in business models that are injury in the healthcare space with what's good about it and what keeps you up in the\nHealth care is it's really I guess broken his way to say at the the way we both the healthcare system in our country is far too expensive and the way underserved populations for all sorts of reasons\nIt's like asking a tank to fly you need airplanes and so some basic restructuring it's going to be needed we did work\nMuch harder on continuity of care and reliability on safety and the health care system has had trouble doing that had trouble changing their too many changes in store so with these new entrance like the Amazon Berkshire Hathaway J. P. Morgan a tree the the\nWe're going to be seeing some really wonderful innovation new basically new ways for people to find help to get care\nA more immediate lower cost more responsive customize to them as individuals more adaptable more portable so I there is really good news here\nOf course a downside risks we'd better do it with discipline you know some of these innovations are are not going to work and we need to make sure they're subject to a cropper scrutiny and evaluation and regulation when needed and back to the mainstream we still going to have all schools are still going to have doctors' offices they're not going to go away and you have to work on quality within\nMainstream system as well but I'm pretty excited what's happening\nMy recent encounters with tele medicine and tell us what were you take consultations project them virtually it's amazing I mean you can you know the the miles between those\nDissolve suddenly we can help each other in the ways we didn't like possible before\nWell that's where we are also very excited about all the things in the possibility of relationship between patients and their care providers being a enhancing augmented dot replaced necessarily buy virtual care so a lot of\nVery interesting work going on it's not a really\nBig issue of concern and we're reading more and more about it in the literature is the epidemic of clinician burnout\nPeering that uh people are you kind of at the end of there with the people who are providing care that they're exhausted that the work demand outpaced what they can do and that they're challenged by everything from some of the additional responsibilities that have come with\nElectronic health records which we embrace on the one hand but it's made things difficult a somewhat on the other hand\nWhat are your thoughts on this end they did we see the to the patient safety issue obviously um you want your clinician to be a satisfied and filled with joy in practice not feeling burned out what are your what are your thoughts about what we should be doing in that arena\nAll the problems are clinician burn a serious in danger\nDr that's terribly sad if you consider how wonderful this professionally has been and can be we're asking people to do impossible jobs now we've taken healthcare and these layered in\nAdministrative burdens reporting burdens measurement birds payment systems productivity targets that make no sense and who will never ever get excellence by trying to drive doctors nurses other workers and healthcare harder and harder or they'll they will burn out of course they will\nBut we need is different care care that supports them it doesn't end of their way part of this is\nIs getting out of this current wave of\nWay excessive metrics everybody's spending all their time reporting measures and yet we want transparency but we need doctors to spend their time\nTalking to him being with patients the electronic health record which has tremendous promise it's how pervasive almost all hospitals habit and more and more doctors do but it isn't working right the way we built the electronic health record is actually adding work\nIt's adding nonsense to care doctors nurses know it and we need a whole round of reputation of the way we're looking at electronic records so they actually support the care instead of standing in the way of it they were actually more bills off in his billing systems\nIn his care systems and we need a change of attitude we're we're not going to fix this by yell at the doctors and nurses is not going to happen there doing their best\nOr we're gonna fix it by creating systems in which people really can focus back on the needs of individual patients part of it is changing financing I Am publicly in favor of Medicare for all global payment\nIn which we finally get help to organizations budgets to help care for population so they don't have to keep running a dribble cage and doing more and more in order to survive financially we need them to focus on what matters to patients and that's going to require a different financial ...\nYou know I was thinking about your comment about Scotland work that's going on there and talking about Medicare for all we see a lot of these European systems where there comes a point and see them\nOh good on the show when he really talked about we we need in American solution I'm not sure that's always the case but\nAre there best practices that can be integrated into our systems that for sure what what are you seeing as you look around\nYour questions ... right on target when you say best practices we have like ... almost any question we do have an answer the problems the answer is no everywhere even if we just look within the United states all take for example\nKaiser Permanente is a focus now I'm wellbeing and upstream work on housing and transportation and and and risks in their population it's\nQuite thrilling to watch a ... on environmental responsibility healthcare has a big role to play in stopping global warming and we see or examples like Gunderson loop through the system and in Wisconsin which is\nIt's become not just carbon neutral it's actually\nIt's a carbon reducing part of the health system that's exciting respect a patient centered care we have plenty of examples where patients are getting power in health systems in changing the systems like Cincinnati children's hospital just Nettie Ohio patient safety breakthroughs we've seen zero we've seen actually\nReaching zero and infection rates and complication rates in places that are dedicated to it\nOutside the United states I'd say even more innovation and delivery because of the different financing system not all single payer summer summer votes or payer systems but they have government as a ensure of last resort so everyone is covered and in places like\nScotland and in Sweden in Singapore and uh even middle aged now you're seeing a innovations toward moving
