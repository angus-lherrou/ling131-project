pushed aside\nThey respond angrily denied that there's any problem\nAnd eventually they do cave in and um the credit for doing the right thing by it or if we want to really give credit where credit's due if the grassroots movement from old angles to push companies like Amazon what will this Fifteen dollars an hour wage ... an ad suppose we should also give credit to the fight for Fifteen movement which is\nBrought to the way you could it have on this\nRock to his movement that uh we started in Seattle which got what your ... automatic people workers themselves who were who you know who were

be one day story ... ... dollars an hour in Seattle the first major city to do it\nAnd then Minneapolis LA last downtown Washington DC many cities I wanted and I am sure you remember in the Democratic primary and into the Bernie Sanders made this question you know federal dollar minimum wage so I think\nA first of all the direct impact of the Amazon Fifteen dollars an hour ... as you said a immediately materially him to the living standards of the workers who work at Amazon book the uh for the department workers and the country workers that could be higher than the holiday season so\nThat was an incredible thing an end in itself as a socialist I Would say in it so that is going to fighting part if we can improve the lives of ordinary people in our day to day basis however that will not be the only ... the other impact is and it is a this is a bigger impact\nIt's had the arm off the feeling of empowerment that working people's movements and feel not only love the nation but

up to maximize profit involved or the people at the buddy job at the expense of the rest of us so you're totally right I could do not enough just to fight for Fifteen it you know you'd have to be built our in the workplace and in fact I can tell you you know I'm sitting here in Seattle in Seattle\nAnd then I'll be area already Fifteen dollars an hour is not a living wage so they're very sober about that reality in ... and it's our obligation unproductive constantly remind everybody around our cells and build\nStrong movements on the left precisely because we know this is only a small measure of justice and the reason we find it in order to give credit where credit's due and not\nA celebrate some sort of mythical largest object based in because meaning movements our future movement young people to understand that you don't\nYou don't collect the inequality under capitalism let alone fight for a different kind of system bikes in the hospital do the right thing no it's not a coincidence why don't they don't have done this now\nAs opposed to some years ago because as you said so now the workers have been demanding schemes for ages and it happened\nNow in Amazon because Amazon had a buddy in age and it's trying to mitigate in trying to look like he's doing the right thing so it's important that we understand that it is not enough to just stop here\nWhat other point I Would add in terms of why it is necessary to you\nKnow we're in an email there the me do struggle hats\nAnd power countless women not just in the U.S but around the looks to come out so bravely to talk about the trauma that they face to sexual violence rape workplace sexual harassment and it's really not easy to do was Christine blocks\nThe ... this afternoon I Will be joining a protest you can get an appointment and uh the reason I'm Talking about this is that we're not just talking about workers struggling for or against low wages they're talking about fighting against workplace harassment any kind whether it's based on race or gender or ethnicity\nThe McDonald's or didn't McDonalds workers recently have multiple walk up and cities around the country up against sexual harassment from their employers so that I mean two movements are spreading to oh I shouldn't they spreading doing in many ways it's sort of originated from working class women or domestic workers et cetera\nExactly exactly that I'm really glad you mentioned the McDonald's worker that that is in fact I heard that that is the first strike action was taken on the issue of sexual harassment so McDonalds workers action is critically important in what's going to happen\nThat's turned to what has transpired in Seattle over this past year uh and the fight that you've been involved with\nAnd whether the reproductions but I'm not raised wages to Fifteen an hour for its workers\nWill have any impact on the fight in Seattle so the head so called head attacks which was basically a miniscule drop in the bucket that Amazon was being asked to pay\nA per employee in Seattle in order to ... the pressure on the housing market Amazon fought dot tooth and nail and managed to reverse city council vote\n... um ... do you think that that that um the to the Fifteen an hour a move may pave the way for Amazon doing the right thing in Seattle\nI think this is a very important question you're asking suddenly the connection between Amazon the nonsmoking Fifteen and what happened in Seattle and what could happen next just do a little bit of a context to what do you just said you know we had a movement fighting for the attack and it will be all in the Amazon dot because\n\nFrom KPFK Pacifica Radio this is rising up with ... you know I'm your host on on equal how are you can watch this program on free speech TV and listen to it on Pacific radio stations and affiliates nationwide a major New York times investigation published this week 'cause uncovered\nThe president Donald Trump gates in what appears to be tax fraud\nIn order to keep up much of his parents inheritance possible the bombshell story on the cover up the paper was titled Trump gauge didn't suspect tax schemes if he reaped Richard from his father it detailed top Trump received ... four hundred and Thirteen million in today's dollars\nFrom his father's real estate empire much of it through tax Dodgers and the Nineteen nineties\nThe reporters pointed out that Mr Trump won the presidency proclaiming himself\nHe's self made billionaire and he has long insisted that his father the legendary New York city ... the Trump provided almost no financial help\nA Trump lawyer released a statement after the piece was published saying that the times is out of ... is a fraud and tax evasion are one hundred percent Fulton highly defamatory there was no fraud or tax evasion by any one\nNow the uh in the wake of the report the New York state tax department is reportedly looking into potential wrongdoing by the Trump family my guest is Frank Clemente executive director of Americans for tax fairness welcome to the program Frank Frank\nAre earning are doing well thanks so much for joining us of course I'm to be the pizza new New York times\nUm was not surprising at all since the ... the the kind of thing one would expect Donald Trump to do it I'm kind of is consistent with a his secrecy over tax return he has\nThat's my thing to do he doesn't need us fraud but a deal I suppose the deal which he has benefited from this potential tax dodging it's quite stunning what were your response is when you first saw this team\nI Know it's it's quite remarkable and and this was a a scheme that had been underway for many years even before Donald Trump junior himself knew about it he was getting a couple of hundred thousand dollars a year as a toddler from his father\nA but it clearly are based on New York times story a Donald Trump himself was in on the fix at least as early as the Nineteen nineties uh in he knew how to share a sham corporation was operating which\nThat was set up as a way to get money funneled a tax free to a trust which then he inherited along with his siblings\nUh [noise] they also um he knew that I'm sure he knew how\nThe large properties that were worth tens hundreds of millions of dollars how undervalued those were a being estimated on their tax returns\nAnd that was a way to another way to give over to the siblings a centrally tax free money\nOf the times story estimated that uh they avoided at least five hundred million dollars in a state taxes\nAre over these this period of time so it was a it's a massive a fraud I use the word to delicately a fraud implies criminal activity I think there certainly was appears that there was a lot of the criminal activity\nLet's just call at least a massive tax dodge there was going on but\nHis family and he was in on the fix\nSome type of a state taxes what the Republicans like to call the death tax write I mean they want to do away with this for a long time they liked the idea of people who are greedy wealthy being ...\nThe government um and so just to tease into what you said initially\nUm it sounds like it wasn't just Trump but his siblings his parents um who kind of worked together to minimize the value of of their assets in order to minimize the tax bill right\nYeah well certainly the father of working with his accounting firm and the business associates has set us up at some point Donald came in on it I'm sure when he became you know a successful business person he got in on it\nI I my guess would be the Donald is using some of these same uh activities or tax dodging activities you'll recall there was a story a couple of years ago\nHow his son Eric ah received a couple of condominiums ah I think it was in Trump Tower in another building and uh especially are paid for them at a fraction of what the value of those things were that looks like exactly the kind of tax dodged the times reported that Donald Trump benefited from\n... it's pretty incredible if you look at the journalistic work that we went into doing this is going to quote from the article because of course the reporters have to make the case for how they arrive at their conclusions and they said that they're finding the three reporters altogether\nAnd uh I shouldn't even say they're named because it's so important to give them credit David bar Suzanne Craig unrest Vietnam\nAnd they said that their findings um are based on interviews with Fred Trump's for my employees in advisors more than a hundred thousand pages of documents\nDescribing the you know working than immense profitability of an empire they include documents cold from public sources mortgages and beats probate records financial disclosure reports regulatory records in civil court filed also it grows on tens of thousands of pages of confidential record bank statements financial audit accounting ledgers\nCash to brush my report sin voices in ...\nWould be vulnerable to criminal prosecution for helping at Penn State taxes\nIt could be I I happen to too long ago and a pop pop the statute of limitations there is no time in the ... it's fine for tax fraud and we know that the state of New York is looking into that any sense of what the consequences could be for Trump and he's sitting in the White House\nWhile it's certainly an I ... I certainly helped with the IRS who's going to be opening an investigation here ah they need to be independent of the president uh\nThe ins that in the Nineteen eighties and nineties I mean I think they should have been catching\nKnow hey we we don't they don't pull the curtain back to help us understand that there were times where they weren't negotiations with Fred Trump over whether or not he was a you know shading the truth and hiding income and hiding or\nA hiding things uh there were artist and we're taking place or we will not find out about this until committees in Congress to a serious investigation and the IRS itself as a serious investigation\nAs you may know for the last three years we have been calling for Trump to release his tax returns we've run\nCampaigns with the public and lobbied Congress we had about almost all the Democrats are signed a discharge petition about two hundred members of Congress signed a discharge petition last year a unique two hundred and Eighteen people to sign a discharge petition\nWhich would have forced him to release his tax returns we did not get to the to Eighteen because the Republicans blocked and the Democrats don't have a majority in Congress but\nWe're going to demand as a first order of business as part of the Democrats are preparing an anti corruption packages perhaps being the first bill if they win control of Congress\nIt would be the first bill number one that they were proposed we think it ought to be as part of that legislation a requirement that um all presidential candidates going forward and all presidents cans L and all presidents sitting presidents have to\nRefused to release his truck tax returns on precedent every president for the last four years every presidential candidate for the last four years\nHas released their tax return so he clearly has something to hide we now we learned that he got a lot to hide in terms of the U.S taxes he was dodging and uh and the the inheritance as he was getting from his his father that he didn't want to the public to know about 'cause\nHe bragged about being a self made billionaire a but we also suspect given this listen to ... given how he ... and the president Russia\nThat there is deeply hidden in his tax returns a a A N evidence information that would allow some tracing of of some financial connection at least two oligarchs and Russia as you do the oligarchs\nAre extremely close to ... the crop up government their financial and uh we think he used to that there's some real hidden stuff there that he wants to avoid Trump or you have to understand he has the Trump corporation the Trump Organization is five hundred ... businesses\nThat roll up and become the Trump Organization each one of those gives me has its own a a a financial reporting a its own profit center and its own a schedule that they report to the IRS as well so there's a it's a morass a and you can imagine the kind of secret stuff that's going on there\nAre ... probably by design right um it's interesting the article just to pick up on what you said about Trump claiming that he is a self made man this is part of the\nUm misstated ah public push stone now but the New York times article points out that my age three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year in ... ... dollars from his father's empire he was a millionaire by each each\nBecca Blackwell the themself inch mom friday October fifth each six zero sixty five three three by five or ... billion dot edu slash your face\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nUm [noise]\n\n\nGood afternoon and welcome to another edition of carnivores radio and uh the funding for for the ... fanfare for the common man certainly appropriate for me here Marty Qena that's in Studio way I sort of feel like\nUh taking control your Jeffrey is on his way and it's\nAbout ready to settle into his chair so we'll be able to have our normal weekly conversation about the uh doing to the world around us and so uh as we get ready to um participate or we'll just continue with our introduction will be within just a moment [noise]\nUSA the W e a few middle eighty eight points one of them and on the Web that WWW dot W.

programming on this alternative radio station [noise]\nA couple a couple of minutes no big deal [noise] uh yes side this is a V. carnival or radio and thank you Mr Kenneth are\nCovering it was a a good job and do we have obviously um we got the whole thing with the uh the speaker thing again that always happens it's a little bit of a foggy there yeah it's like almost you can almost count on it I actually at this point so that I\nSort of was channeling my inner al Haig there are sort of felt like I was back in the White House ah under control\nThe leader was under duress and ah you know we did have somebody here in control at the White House that the carnival radio and a quite an interesting day here are just coming out of work and hearing a few things on the radio relative to the confirmation of Kevin off for the Supreme Court\nOr it looks as though that he's going to get a vote from Senator Collins so or the\nConcern of one of the senators who might have turned against the nomination has a spoken in favor of his nomination so I Would imagine that going to continue as a trend\nOr maybe not all but a scene that she was going to be a swing vote a it looks ... favorable certainly does not to remove the sting of his nomination or that of which is occurring to not only him personally but the\nTrauma that his family has had to go through so let's hope that the job that he\nTruly wanted in a was worth paying that particular price for it's unfortunate that uh the world that we live in right now has become so polarized that those kinds of circumstances come and became quite an ugly moment so uh I'm sure that'll be one of the topics that we're\n... yes I agree with that you know it does bother me that the or the board is always screwed up anyway\nYou know the last in the studio but anyway such is life\nOn the ... we talk about the destruction of major league baseball the decline or a ... little quiz your teacher or what the average age of the major league baseball fan\nProbably about forty five or sixty I mean the measures that the median yeah it's actually fifty five okay in marketing term the\nReal bad mhm but I think tonight's game which I'm going to watch\nIt could be interesting to watch the whole thing that the Yankees Red Sox yeah well that's a traditional New England or you know why even around the country I think I think it's what major league baseball kind of need to know what the ratings are lately for baseball I'm sure it's been a continuous kind of a downward trend but for the game this\nAfternoon would have been interesting to watch the Cleveland Indians and the Houston Astros you know the not necessarily second tier because the Astros are defending that a World Series champions but those are cities that have not over time experience the success that certainly the red Sox\nThat's actually interesting you 'cause you're right 'cause I read a book I was by ... believes in about ... you know what's wrong with major league baseball I'm paraphrasing and part of what we're saying is that like Pittsburgh\nYour second tier city go into the season with no chance what do you think of it and it did affect baseball so it's a good you're more Cleveland is still a B city meaning you know ... if not you know on the Pittsburgh Kansas City but they've been actually doing well\nAnd I think oftentimes those are places are\nSomewhat a constrained by the fact that the Yankees and the red Sox and uh probably the Dodgers and so you know they're owned by billionaires and they have their own networks to generate a you know billions of dollars in revenue so when they do spend over the cap a you know there are more than willing to pay the fine\nTo expenditure but you know it doesn't always work out that way because when you just look at what happened with the club or they certainly have the same kind of a financial backing with the rickety family\nAnd their own networks and they were unable to move forward actually I was a cubs fan when I was a kid I'd be died in the wall I was dying or oh you are Ernie Banks fan than I can still do you know something about\nThe new job but I don't mean that we're we're best friends but I don't understand a bright guy like you fixation on sports ... like for me no it's not a criticism bright guy smart guy he could do whatever you like right um I don't know I just I watch a game I really don't care like Billy Bob from Hector universe I\nThe last several I could care less I could care less you know there was a thing well during the week you know when I have work in the day you know that I you know I'm not going to stay up 'til eleven eleven thirty watching extra inning game for people that are not you know totally engrossed with I guess I guess what I'm saying is that when I was a kid I can still name yup the Nineteen sixty\nNine Chicago Cubs you had Randy hungry behind the plate Ernie Banks Glenn Beck are done catches or Ron Santo you had young who sucked in center field one of the reasons why they collapse I'm Jim Hickman ... I mean a a Williams whatever his name ... Billy Williams sweet swinging Billy Williams\nOkay now like if I watch the eagles I Know like when you know\nMaybe a ... I have no ... it is one of the game I don't really you know it's really not that big of a ... your your\nThe matured yeah just you know it just a big deal just kind of interesting I look at it more as you know sports as a scape Islam you know or I get tired of hearing the news all the time but where do you think about that in a lot that I\nDon't see the point of watching most news no no no no it looked to be fair because\nAnd I think that even if they if anything was nominated that would have helped them in the end\nYou know if it was a gamble at some level\nUp there and say oh you know as a diversion I think that there was a legitimate victim of something\nThey agreed to do something happened to her without a doubt I don't know if he did it I really don't know I told you know\nMy feeling alone thing here\nI don't know the ... you know what I've seen in term evidence either way I I mean I suspect there's a possibility that he was involved you know but then he neither here nor there\nI mean I don't know I think he could have been I could you could I Do think the only thing I Would have to name I'm Marty Mr Keenan citizen a couple he certainly like to drink does any\nWell the the unless beside the point you know I mean he I don't know whether you're still does\nI mean he's just apparently like here a lot but you know and no doubt and we've all been in a ... year in college situations and you know and then maybe in situations where we drink to a point where we did not know what we did the night before um you know the fact that he sat there and denied that\nHe ever drink to that degree to me I mean it's\nIt's a lie right and he he was in that time we again I don't know I agree with you we don't know I think he did\nIt or not he should have said look you know I I partied a lot in school okay he was five years ago\nBut let me ask you do not know that would ban the things I Can't\nRemember I don't know you know and that would have been a more honest approach but he ended approach you know his or denying that have a drink to excess when there's enough evidence to support that he didn't who doesn't you know when you're in college you know scenario\nCandidate but I didn't get elected on when you got your story for you know it isn't\nThat to think what Mr key to go in second um don't you think you're going down kind of a rat hole I mean\nParty you know event you Tony isn't that strategy\nExactly exactly even if he's tried you know what that was me I'm so sorry\nI'm In a more qualified to be on the Supreme Court than I think she is now I think\nHe is now having lied to the public about the drinking I'm having showing notch them the kind of demeanor that we need cars Supreme Court justice to have it shouldn't be a hot headed\nHe he came by proxy started really PO he was now you've\nGot the email and you got rattled he got he would rather not overused\nComposure and now the self should raise the flag that and the fact that he started talking about\nDemocratic conspiracies which sounds to me like he was coached by the White House you know we don't need any partisan politics on the court we have enough you know bad enough we got it everywhere else we go on the court I mean it's going to take you know take what LeBron mustard there is on the court off if he gets a point that\nHe's not only did I really don't highest court in the ... did you hear that\nDid you hear that Collins said yes and mansion he eats a done deal\nIs done yeah well I don't know it's I think there's no possibility that the decision is going to come down to the vice president sticking his nose that are happening that make the recall\nBoth either way do we need to go he will be underscored Marty do you have a question\nNot necessarily a question but I agree on both sides of ... of the conversation here because\nWhen he did get a belligerent it was after the White House said you know the president had said how you know he's looking for a fighter he's looking for somebody does he does it made up his mind you know would we will have to see how he handled this until I Believe he took on a persona know he felt like you know he was the president wants to see\nAnd uh and that's what he did a but at the same time you know it wasn't a criminal trial and it didn't have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd uh so there was reasonable doubt\nWell I was the one that gave you a ride home and I you know there was just it was not much outrage from friends towards her after this now there's a couple of reasons you know everybody\nGot everybody got sufficiently numbers nobody remembers the party\nYeah you know and then nobody wanted to ... yeah I wouldn't want to be adding Marty is a good point there's no way\nIf I was a woman or even a guy you want nothing to do with it you just keep quiet because you are going to be dragged through the mud in Nineteen eighty nine you had a DUI who the heck no I got lots of no seriously a last question how do you think this plays out in the mid term\nWhat\nHow do you think this plays out for the midterms congressional\nOut I mean I think he's going to get appointed a it's it's going to spread of the divide the country are I think that the people uh you know it's it's not going to have a lot of sway one way or the other ... clinical\nStudy I think we all thought it was interesting before we let you go I really did not an alarm in ... I really do believe in my lifetime I think we're going more and more down the road of like a third world country will be coming on governor and what that hearing showed there was respectful debate there was animosity\nAnd hatred between the two parties where do you think\nWhat we don't have anybody there that represents us we have people that represent their own interests and the their their backers most of which is big money and you know\nIn which I got a lot of ... but the level of vitriol and hate it used to be Tip O'Neill diametrically opposed to Ronald Reagan go out to go out and have a beer they're not drinking back together no way me Haiti things\nThat you know but a lot of this started you know uh in the last Twenty years and a lot of it and most of it was pursue the tainted by the Republicans I gotta tell ya I Would I wouldn't argue with that\nYou know you learn about it so be careful what you wish for what you do color thank you I don't quite\nWell like you say there's almost no law there's no rule of government there's no you know what a point where the the government's doing what it does and it puts on a big spectacle and you know and everything's good because the public is stupid that's basically the\nStumps and that and I also think I can kinda lame can't do anything about it we got a choice between Peter and Paul will call it a democracy\nAnd went to lead the way with the ... to ... you know people say look we want a third option none of the above go\nBack to the you know I have never been out since Nineteen eighty with ... but the third it seems like the party the two parties have a monopoly that both feeding on the same trough\nTo a bunch of going to do you think they're actually they said ... ... words and things that make there could be yeah there for me they don't care about year they're all big money and they squashed third party initiated destroy that right well that's what we need is a third party thank you very much color when they think you guys get\nCaught in absolutely I Know but don't you think I thought this was going to be an option where we could get a third party politically in a small state like Connecticut ... for governor in like a an ... might be able to make some inroads\nBecause we're not that huge a state where we would be able to you know get that third party conversation going and I don't think every ... every time\nBelieve me they squat you know they have rules you know it's All right hold fair and quotations right but it's all you got to have the demonic signatures its own it'd be a great color we invite other callers to join and you're listening to carnivores\nLady radio W E s U eighty one point eighty ... FM in Middletown views on carnival radio or not the views of W E s U or Wesleyan University but we'd like your views to give us a call at eight six zero\nEight five seven seven zero zero six eight\nIncreasingly moving to a completely dysfunctional a government that or if not\nLet's say respectful disagreement it's actual hatred these people\nHate each other and we have a President Trump who I think Mr Cain up put fuel on that fire by calling cry and ah you know I'm a ... you know crime is calling the naming a Blumenthal it's just I think he put he put the topping on the cake\nAbsolutely and and I think that that helps him as that helps him with his base and uh you know that's that's the bully pulpit and unfortunately he's the bullies you know normally a bully pulpit is to bring forth a new policy and may be moved to direct\nNot thinking of the family I think he's not the\n... the the business of governance is not one of his favorite things but he loves doing those rally oh man loves that's\nWhat you mean he could you get ... not that big of an interest in\nGoverning no buddy love you know be a real he loves to be a lot of bin Laden he loves during the pot and he loves now he's down the road almost like every other day no seriously right going in and he cannot get enough of it\nBut it's always been places where he knows those are his people I mean\nWhat I did it you know there's no no no I disagree he's been to Pennsylvania I think he could go to Connecticut and still sell out twenty thousand no his bases loyal and he was in Minnesota that the Democratic it's sold out whatever's on\nTo have known that was going on if the guy's turned up the music and covered her mouth\nWhen she tried to scream a no win corroborate touch it and it's not even a question the last question do you think Kevin Roose river tarnished by this\nI'm afraid he is and so many court cases will come up that will involve um\nSexual assault\nNot only that but strong partisan feelings and he's disclosed is deep seated animosity personal feelings against the Democrats and the liberal you know that type of things so\nIt's almost impossible for anyone to trust his impartiality on hot button political issues in the future\nAnd I would agree I think it will be a couple of years before they even offer him to be the lead writer of any of these opinions I think you're just gonna be a part of the uh ...\nThank you I might drop a color and we invite them to call back in fact they are what do you think about that mark well you know\nWhen when they say thirty five years ago we are talking about the early eighties and ah I was living in Washington DC at that time and\nYou know we can say the date and then it means certain things to certain people but when you go back in time and you look at what the early eighties was all about it was free wheeling men and ... and uh there was a lot of stuff going on and then and people in the social scene you know there was a lot of partying going on and it was a lot of uh\nA sexual freedom on both sides of you know to to say that sexual assault was part of that motif\nBut the attitude in the communities of young people uh it was a party atmosphere so you know he was just a part and I think we were all just a part if we were old enough to be a part of that you know we were a part of that team and so the\nCaller did say your battery was dying she said that the lie detector test or will he had like three three question would know based on but you know that who knows yeah I read a lot of great callers so far love it and\nWe invite other caller she joined discussion topics are really obviously the cabin on hearing uh any comments\nAre concerned take away from that um we all do on what to talk about the midterms didn't have any effect on that and the bigger issue is already really in the midst of a dysfunctional government there was a time where yeah you'd have healthy debate\nBut you didn't hate right the liberal or hate ticket they they hate each other you know I mean you know humor and Trump hate each other and you know humor and Trump will do anything to dis\nEither way over here and not in a kind way no not at all like gentlemen's agreement I use the term overall it's these people hate each other that's not a ...\nClick that and ah you know and it's not just\nYou know individuals that institutions that the failing New York times that uh\nYou know this or that you know or making claims that aren't necessarily true you know a he is kind of watch that and and he's he's lying I mean the guy is ... ... troops on so many different factors that I think people would become numb to it a lot of ways I feel that when they were with the the hardest thing\nBut it's interesting that his approval numbers are actually which is of me because I Know it's my ... my previous point yeah he knows he's a reality stuff mhm reality he knows what makes up middle America they're not interested in reading a dissertation on\nForeign policy do's and don'ts right they're interesting crying ... their emotional versus intellectual overall yeah\nAnd I think he knows how happy and he's doing it brilliantly he is and I think um I think actually the or if you will the powers to be are scared to death because he's running roughshod over the whole\nAll their nobody's nobody's safe I mean look what he's done to was the attorney general so I mean you're talking to the top you know journalists are in the country and you're treating them like that then you know who else is safe\nThe FBI everybody's ... zero\nSix eight five seven seven zero zero six eight five seven seven zero zero however I Would have to say it's not as big as it used to be a problem but people do vote with their pocketbooks ... and you know that the unemployment is at its lowest has never been in Nineteen sixty nine that cannot hurt him\nKnow and the market is a way a row in general so I think I'm again it's not as big of a factor as it once was but it's still a big factor I think um I think that um I think they've done really I really do believe that that the Republicans pick up a couple of senatorial seats\nFrom personality ways but for policy wise and I\nYou know I'm more concerned about the decisions that are made you know at department so let's talk about the environmental protection agency when we had that\nYou know secretary who was finally run out of town because he was a nut job in a you know we're spending a exorbitant leave for just personal items and not really paying much attention to you know the job at hand but those that are in charge now we don't hear much about them but they're making decisions that are you know problematic for our environment\nOr we have a little bit halls and now we're just going to go real quick route and we go we went on hold and one never going to take right now call her what do you\n[noise] [noise] hello how you doing good what's up I'm\nI'm listening to the yes you're on TALK show and they get a phone number so I'm calling to get my\nComment had given were here yet but you\nKnow okay I just want to say in today's atmosphere as far as I'm concerned everything is great falling ... retirement is up I don't understand what the problem is\nUm you know that's just something that is food for thought because you know the you could pose it what other ... why why the Democrats are up in arms color\nWell that's exactly what I'm\nGetting or they scared because they're looking at a well you just articulated in her saying we got nothing\nI think they're afraid of a loss of power\nThat's what I'm saying yes and things continue to go the way they are they gonna fall on deaf ears isn't it\nAnd then what's gonna happen is people are going to say why do we need them in off\nThe why do we need big government I think it's an excellent point government and we thank you very much for the call All right thank you bye or we did a drop of color and we fight her I'm I Apologize eight six zero six eight five seven seven zero zero six eight five seven\nIt can no one of the reasons why we encourage folks to donate

able to have you on hold and and kick your right into the program but we do appreciate your participation\nYes I think um I think today show was is quite a you know where to our seventh color yes quite good and I think it shows that people are engaged and\nI think the cabin or hearing stirred up a pot that could be productive Mr King\nAnd I'm Wondering you know the next caller I'm going to see if we could talk a little bit more locally is swinging them one way or the other in terms of our own government\nEditor am shocked Ned Lamont is it really hurt says yeah he's twenty points that oh my God twenty unbelievable so even if you cut it in half ten point three point four point oh he's done I guess I'm shocked yeah me too I'm shocked I mean I don't care what you did spend you\nTry to be intellectually honest you always are but did I Know your partner and\nThere's no objective mean can you say the gamble he was a\nGood guy you know and I'm not voting for not oh you're not no I'm voting for Ron\nOkay I I Know I I Need you know I keep talking third party and I I listen to ... whenever I can when he was allowed to you know make a comment and I'm looking in the newspapers for

you know not to me there's nothing that I Wish I could say more\nYou know\nYou know I'm going oh\n\nThat was wonderful things he's done some I think very much um what do you what what [laughter] what do you call it\nThat long ago what's known it's off of a an extended play that I put out probably I don't know a few months ago and it's called um Jimmy a blaze is greater than it and it's not on the mind of the group and this was sort of the solo extended play or if you will\nIn my group is called the Rosenberg since the family a family thing and I wonder if this is\nJust perfect because I really want to know your door and hear more about the man he's come a long way um and you obviously have an interesting background and a really great you know things like that and I'm like you said that you're from Minnesota\nThat's rather small town a relatively small town called itself the average that side of the twin cities\nDid you did you grow up that it did I grew up in Minnesota last fall on your whole family there you know that's\nThe most part I Would say I'm not really sure when my when my people settled in excel fear or near or in the Minnesota region per se but that is where I had known all my relatives to be from that is\nCorrect um let me just project just mentioned as a family no that's right I Do\nWith my brother I did my brothers and sisters and we've been doing it for a number of years\nUm and it's a it's a thing that I I started mainly 'cause my brother killed Gore um hopefully we'll be calling in to the program at some point the next hour a day with my brother killed were mainly and then my sister in law are a little ... there are places or the bass guitar and these things as well with me and a mounted on the ...\nUm but these songs most of them are ... mainly altered with my father held before he passed\nUm and then of course killed or has a large handle songwriting as well and uh we tried to play as much as possible but it's been a long time since we started a band\nAnd for a long time we didn't do it in just that there's a there's a solo thing I did which I did with the group but it was all my songs so we just called that Jimmy ... record rather than the Rosenberg essentials which is the main group ah and then that was sort of or a bottle of sorts after years of high to [noise] uh and so yeah it's been good and we're and we're back at it and it feels very good yeah\nUm so you had an album because he wanted to have the family wasn't producing enough music and you had the contrived well no more or\nThis is a great story we got a well we made the record almost I Want to say a in two thousand nine or ... when we made the original record and back then I was Seventeen years old um and uh and so\nYou can imagine it spent some time and I'm a and so we we made that record and it was really no interest in it and we recorded it in a very low budget low key manner in a basement in St Paul and ah and it was just put on a at the time I don't even know if we put them on the Internet we're making tapes\nAnd nobody would listen in because we were just a small town family ban and we still very much are but there was a renewed interest thanks to you that when you posted on a on the uh what we saw in ... and is with this was just such a wonderful thing because\nI'm obviously I connected with this friend of mine over here and then somehow he must have gotten the music to you and is it right to those people that don't know there was a that band camp dot com did an article on the radio station and and and ah and digital ... they're posted our record on the article\nAttack your friend showed me this record I don't know how you know him but I live in and out of it in a really great um a really great kind of revival of folk where we're in a generation\nAnd it was really refreshing to hear a kind of a more modern take with a lot of traditional comment fucking like I thought that was really just a wonderful I'm so when did you start to project and my dad right around that you grew up in Minnesota born ... ... ... yeah\nSo when did you guys all decide that you got a long enough to want to make nice slow to funny\nIt's a funny story and we always got along it's and that's a nice family we got a excuse me\nAre we always go along quite well and something uh you know we're we're a pretty regular a family\nUm you know a we've always just sort of had a very normal American Life and I'm no one in my family was known to have sort of the um [noise]\nBig time aspirations if you will of making the music industry and I still wouldn't say that's completely the case because obviously we're still very small time but we found out is somewhere in our teenage should um let our father had been writing songs for a long time and we ... with this and he said I write\nSongs and a and a and I never told you about it but I used to play the guitar and I said well they grab this whole thing out of the basement and started playing these songs a long way my ... my dad was doing it\nAnd uh and so I said you know let's let's work on this and and he said well you know all your brothers and sisters they play and you guys should play some of these films so what we do we took down the road and we wrote some new ones and we worked on the phone that he wrote and that was our first record and that was two thousand eight and two dozen none were working on it and we stopped until uh\nUntil this past year when after you posted the thing there was a renewed interest and we decided hey I got a couple of songs from all these years which was put him down\nThe first time you've ever played the music on the east coast or outside of minutes oh yeah very local band or I mean yeah we all have ...\nYou know we all we're not lives over there and so it's not we don't really have the means to go on to her and I don't know that if we went on tour anyone would come and see it um but uh yeah\nUm oh like you'll go might be
