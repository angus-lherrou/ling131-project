refugee resettlement numbers um in normal years in the last you know five or so years the average was about Seventy thousand there were years during the Reagan Administration where almost a hundred thousand refugees were coming in every year\nAnd given the fact that we are experiencing the largest level of displacement in the world in recorded history\nAnd the fact that the U.S has been the world's humanitarian leader since World War two in resettling refugees and provide providing humanitarian protection we think it's it's time for the U.S to step up and share the responsibility with these countries that are struggling to provide services and assistance to the\nHundreds of thousands of refugees that are in in their countries um\nYeah Melanie we just have thirty seconds do you have a message to refugees this week uh with the hate fueled violence in the United states people coming into the country are now afraid to ...\nWe don't see refugees as anyone who is different than we are

... host on on both hunger or online or rising up with ... home more than seven hundred people gathered in San Francisco in late September\nFor historic mobilization of women of color were elected officials running for office we're putting women of color in politics\nThe gap in school she the people organize like democracy in color and it drew representatives like permanent job out of Washington and Barbara ...\nWe're Nina Turner and ... and others on our show today we'll bring you special coverage from the the people after the break\nFrom KPFK Pacifica Radio this is rising up with ... ... you can watch the program on free speech TV and listen to it but if it got radio stations and affiliates nationwide hundred the women of color gathered at the sheet to people comment\nOn September twenty two thousand eighty in San Francisco for an event organized by democracy in color\nThe summit was intended to pull together women of color who are in the running for office were supporting those women at office\nI tend to just comment that was able to speak with a number of women will begin with congresswoman ... jai up all\nOf the state of Washington has been a progressive trailblazer in the house pushing for policies like Medicare for all and confront President Trump on immigration the Supreme Court and more special thanks to keep your feet but typically radio for sponsoring this coverage\nWelcome to the program a congresswoman ... fall it's an honor to have you on it's an honor to be on a gathering of women\nWomen like yourself or you know women are considering that were running for office and all the women behind them pushing them\nWhen you give or can you give those women\nOne of the members of Congress who's been who hasn't held back who's been very bold but it takes a lot of guts to be bold [noise]\nWell I I think for the people that are coming in [noise] I've been telling them to just be who they are and to hang on to that\nTo pick their battles why it wisely you know not you don't have to you don't have to play giants every single day um but you do have to think strategically about how we get across what we want and at the same time never allow anybody to minimize or patronize you\nAnd to do it with as much love and generosity as possible and I think that's the thing that I've noticed is I don't hold back from ... standing up for myself for standing up for the issues that I care about\nBut I Try to do it in a way that would make my grandmother feel proud you know that would that would um [noise] that that allows me to lift up the beauty of who we are as women of color and his immigrant we believe in generosity an abundance not in scarcity and fear [noise]\nSo I Want to show a different way and I want young women of color and other women of color who are running\nTo think about bringing themselves and and to think about what they want to do not what they want to be um because I think that's important\nUm do you feel that your work in Congress and just keeping your president has inspired a younger generation of\nIndian American women or South Asian women or just women of color to say I can be myself and be a member of Congress I don't have to swallow who I Am\nThat's been one of the great things about being an office is\nI get all these particularly women across the country you know tons of email and people coming up and saying that I've given them a different possibilities for their future so that makes me so happy because it's it's great to be the first but honestly that's not what I Want I don't want to be the last\nReally wonderful and it's not just all these men and women either as immigrants because I'm One of only twelve immigrants in the United States Congress out of five hundred and thirty five and so to think that we are capable and um that it is possible for anybody to achieve whatever their\nTheir goals are and so that's been really wonderful and one of my favorite stories was when I was running for the state Senate actually I had these two\nYoung South Asian women who I think we're about Thirteen or fourteen at the time\nAnd they would volunteer for my campaign and they would literally takes about an hour to come and volunteer every day and the first couple of weeks they were very quiet and they would sort of stand on the corner of various shy\nFourth week one of them quite old up to me and said\nDo you think I could run for office some day and I just thought okay my work is done here but it was really wonderful and she came back she worked as an intern in my D.C office she's now gone off to college she's doing a fantastic job she's majoring in political science\nAnd I do think she'll run for office one day [noise]\nSo the house\nI Want to get into politics now because it's so critical such a critical moment where in\nThe house has the power to 'em push to impeachment proceedings and I'm Wondering if you add the progressive in the house\nThe mid term elections will be in that leadership pushing for impeachment\nI'm On the Judiciary Committee and I've spoken out on this before I'm actually one of the members of Congress to sign onto a side of articles of impeachment I have voted twice on the floor that we should be having this debate around impeachment and I tell people and the district you would really like just the tunnel trumpet teach\nThe thing to understand about impeachment is it's a political process you have to get the majority\nI think that to get the American people on board and therefore to get representatives on board um in both parties frankly and so what I Hope to do in the Judiciary Committee is immediately be with our ranking member jury novel or who will be the chairman if we take back the house\nTo really push for accountability to have a series of hearings that show the American people exactly how Donald Trump has been violating their monuments clause exactly what those conflicts of interest or\nWhat has been the interaction of the Trump campaign and Russia why are we not focusing on election security what does he have to hide I think these are the questions that will be on the table and it'll be up to us to really push those cheering the what we get out of it and hope\nI'm part of this historic move and I mean it is going to be incredible to have teacher of the year next to me John I have on a path Lee and all these just incredible women that I Know um [noise] understand what it means to walk onto a floor with half of your colleagues are millionaires during the income bracket that will truly never understand the struggles back home\nAnd I'm we are just I Know I'm honored and humbled by the chance to be able to be a voice and get get a seat at the table so that they can feel like they're being heard\nHow much do you feel that the policy\nStruggles that you're going to be engaged in are going head to head with the Trump Administration and the Republicans and how many struggles are going to be pushing the Democratic party to be more progressive I think it's\nGoing to be a combination I don't think of it that way you know I'm a person\nAnd that doesn't think of things that strategy or political strategy it's like there's a need and want to address it and sometimes the barrier will be maybe other colleagues that are in different communities that are important to my district\nOr in in and it just means me pushing harder and advocating harder what I loved about congressman Conyers at the time and he didn't just vote the right way on the floor I never had to check him on his boat\nBut he also came home and was part of a movement and part of a grassroots movement and that's where I come from\nAnd not only am I going to fight there but I'm also going to fight in the court and sometimes that means uh people that tend to may be seen as somebody that support ah you know Kool Aid funding equal\nEducation funding uh based on need a ... and and and those that believe in the privatization of our education I called the education industry because it's become such a for profit industry that there are going to be people that might have a de next to name that\nA unique position on as you well how are you going to push on this issue what policy positions you're going to take on specifically the Israeli Palestinian issue and the score of other issues around the U.S does intervention in the middle east\nI think that it's important to know I grew up in a city that every corner is a reminder of the civil rights movement\nOn every corner some birth of something regarding the labor rights movement many of my teachers experience being discriminated against because of the color of their skin I couldn't live in certain neighborhoods some even recalled walking as a child in the Martin Luther King you know next to Dr King with their parents\nAre all of that comes with me because as a child going to Palestine with my mother seen her in a separate line seemed a different color license plates that different color\nKind of um passports and the treatment of you know you can't travel here you can't work in this area are you can't live in this area\nYou know I Believe truly that integration of our school system can change that whole dynamic there and and I love and embrace the fact that when you know that the type of Netanyahu's you know Israel just like Trump's America\nThat that doesn't in line with many of the Israelis and very much doesn't in line with off course Palestinians and we have to embrace that and welcome and I love\nThat when he declared when they declared he brought the official language Israelis and Palestinians marched together they protested together people don't talk about that and that's what I Want to support I Want to support that organic movement\nWhile they are coming together I'm pushing back against that division that is happening from within and we got married and kids but as Americans we need to stop choosing sides and she was values and sit back and and allow us to to not be bullied in positions that\nThe human eyes one or the other and I won't let you know the far left told me that Israel you know Israelis or this or that because I'm not going to reflect a wet and then he now who's doing on all of the Israeli community\nI'm not going to share the stories that are my grandmother and my grandparents ah I'm there as a child there mark my roots of around activism parts and full of stand you know and and that is something that comes with me as a member of Congress one where she don't

wait for the community that survived because there was a time where\nIt was possible like your mom a lot of folks who left the south came to south LA you had a way of earning a living I'm that fled and you had a community that was more or less devastate that you had the whole coin ... operations FBI operations against the militant black movement and\nI'm In you know that were part of south LA at the time so then you had a situation where the the the the um businesses more or less had fled auto industry or anything else the militant black movement had pretty much been destroyed you had a lot of young folks out there but it's basically\nNothing to do no way of earning a living so I wanted to ask you what [noise]\nHunters and us marched in South central really uh I was there to watch right I remember the ... I talk about to watch it in my book um we stayed and watch it at the time I watched buildings burned and watch the fire department put\nBuild how'd you hear about all that the ... the ... and I spent all that what's happened\nI was so young I really didn't understand but I I did where ...\nYou want to be back that I wanted to be a Black Panther my other\nMy brother march with us or it was us or I can remember the data he came in a what a chip to fund his nose was bleeding the police and hit him in the face you know we're Rogers Park with a Billy club\nOh I'm In I can remember to resent that I have for the police from that time on my brother had become a hero he was um\nProbably my first he wrote and I looked up to an activist and he was activist so uh and he would take me down when did they go to march in and and they have yeah Corinne army jacket in in and they will be watching down Broadway\nRed black and green [laughter] oh they're read the black and the grains or I ... I didn't want to be a part of that\nYou know and and would any kitten and that's the way it goes you know and then I can remember when to quit smart and I can remember that I wanted to be ... so it it's so much debt our young people want it to a point or something\nAnd coach do do you recall what the community was like at the time and I must admit I drink is talking about\nAre the part that I Do remember that because I'm a few years behind Rick cause I was born in Nineteen sixty four it actually happening sixty five\nAnd uh I stayed at exactly to have lots of riots last sixty five and I stayed exactly two houses away from where it all started on outlawing it a hundred and sixteenth oh so I Know that all of our families where of all because we're all had migrated into\nSouth central uh I you know as a child you really just don't know when you live in what we consider this\nDeveloping we developed skills street skills or because it was it was set up ... you know it ... if you had to survive in order to go you know you had to cross barriers that most people couldn't even close but there's a trial you you just don't know that you\nIn that war and I think that's what we're facing now because\nOf the I don't again I don't believe me having a gang problem we have any substance prop ... you know and we were and they had to find somebody like us who who was\nA I'm not academically town a had a had a had a property ... situation where you wanted to make some money in order to survive when they ... they found the right people they found the right guy you know regarding there\nAnd had a tenacity for trying not to be poor didn't realize that what we're doing was gonna make us even more\nSo I Want to go to um a clip the Congressional Black caucus held a hearing\nYou know when the ... it all came out about the CIA connection with a crack cocaine and south LA and I I Want to talk to you all a little bit about that but just finally finishing up the the early days and and families stuff\nYou know to pot has the song where he's things about his mother actually I Love that song I I was a single mom myself for like five long time and I'm\nAlso and talking with some of the young people stone name gang members to who told Me Margaret ... warriors right and a number of them said you know we watch our mothers' struggle\nWe're going to go out there and we're going to take care of it you know you saw the safety net dismantled under Clinton welfare reform was caught when that happened a number of women are single mothers arrested for profit\nYou know in certain community and I just walk wondered if you had any comments on that and before they get into that that the substance of the whole\nWell I ... I Believe that there are people who do the jobs that they sent him to China I Believe that we want those jobs are in and we want the opportunity you know they they put you in prison and\nThey have what they call unicorn prison and they pay these guys twenty five an hour to do a job and if they was on the street\nThey will be making twenty six twenty seven thirty dollars an hour to do\nAnd these guys do these jobs faithfully and in into overtime or so when when they say that we're lazy and in in in ... and we don't want it I disagree with that I Believe that the drug business is one of the toughest businesses to be in you have to be totally dedicated a\nReal art smart or thank God the faint [laughter] economic trade unafraid\nFor her you know willing to die willing to go to prison and and when you see guys that are willing to sacrifice that uh\nI mean if they get in any other business is no way they can be stopped in and when I taught guys in prison that was one of the ways that I taught him I was like\nIn your ... ... you know I'm In these other guys out here don't have the tolerance for pain and and hurt that you do so if we have to take that same energy and channel it into something positive uh ... will be just crazy\nRight above the athletes that said and coach clearly you felt while still looked like a football player [noise] right right so you\nYou know that's one of the way that we feel that we can get out of the ghetto under most people in the ghetto worn out because it's been in the ghetto was like then in prison or\nPeople want to get or like their kids\nUp a community to fail because we we've always known historically let a third man with a third grade education could move in this world but they had to confuse our people in in that do gain that crack it wiped out for generations\nWell let let's get a summary because when when the story broke um recently um at the at the time that we're recording um this interview\nThe previous day December tense was the tenth anniversary of the death of Gary Webb and you know we're gonna talk about about Gary ... and his work Gary Webb of course being the San jose Mercury News reporter\nWho broke the news on the CIA turning a blind eye to crack cocaine and and one of the reasons I'm I'm Ricky Ross that you were getting it's so cheap\nRight that the the the price that you were you were getting at and so the whole community was in an uproar the congressional caucus held a hearing and this is what Jesse Jackson junior how he summed up\nThe situation let's go to that clip right now\nIn Nineteen Seventy four crack cocaine makes its first documented appearance in California\nThe same year the influential man that's his family in Nicaragua tablet says a relationship with the Colombian drug dealer\nTo Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen Seventy nine\nNor when money is suspected of smuggling stolen car from California to Central America\nAnd shipping cocaine to New Orleans and the west coast sound an Easter revolution forces them enough food and others call to the U.S back the most a dictatorship and it causes them to clean into south central Los Angeles\nAfter this Congress has warned of a looming crack epidemic\nIn Nineteen eighty groups\nWith soldiers loyal to ... begin forming in Honduras and Guatemala and later coalesced to form the FDA in a CIA sponsored guerilla army known to the world as the contras Ross begin selling small amounts of powder cocaine in black Los Angeles\nIn Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two\nAnd vulnerable communities so so Ricky Ross your your thoughts on well then you found out and all this point\nWhen I didn't find out into a ... we we kinda got a hint that something was going on when you're first contacted us about I'm Gary led land on a but\nGarrett was really careful with this story with me over a Gary knew I had a relationship with Jesse cans from LA Times along with quite a few other news reporters because I I was already\nGetting a major news coverage just from my drug dealings ... for me being\nDrug dealers that I was I was as you are so good at it [laughter] [noise] and you know also I had to walk through a freeway passwords who got indicted\nThe ... the ...\nYear remember those cops who was still in the money and plant ... will they had also got indicted as well you know both of us got an diving almost at the same time so I'm Gary was really tight with the story I mean when he was when I first talked to him on the phone he talked about\nGiving me information will I didn't get any information and two of\nThe day to the story was published\nWas the first time to get me started giving information file a we're now doing trial\nUm if people know when we were going to trial in my lawyer was questioning the witnesses for the government will he kept going back and forth from the podium to Gary webs\nSpot in an audience and the judge broadcast\n... in a you know out and told them say well this guy seemed to have information that we don't have and that's something that the government should have turned over to us in Brady I'm\nSo this was the first time that I kinda got an inkling because he said something or\nThe active about in ... new tests I think it was an Indian land on to something like oh well one day he went on a fishing trip with George Bush senior\nAnd when he came back off the trip\nThe word was\nThe ends justify the means\nI'm ... ... ... the guy who ran out fishing trip\nAnd we gave mutant uh-huh and George Bush senior\nAnd when he came back off the trip and he met with ministers and brand on and the rest of the country has a blend don't say that he said the ends justify the means\nSo you found out rarely rather late about the CIA\n[noise] yeah I was totally novels to the whole situation I didn't know yeah I don't know what the Central Intelligence was yeah I'm Talking about a ... to\nPeople who had never read a book\nI couldn't read so hardly watch the news\nOnly begin to watch the news once I was in jail or so so I was really an obvious to to everything that was going on around me I just knew what was going on right there in my little circle with my friends you know\nBut you must have had a way with numbers in your head and you must have some kind of\n... well yeah the numbers you know there are number we get that I was\nGood at numbers for but my main key that I found out was really was the key to mock successes that I Want it for my brother would I Want it for myself\nAnd um you know what about you coach um any at what point did you find out well I didn't want the real deal with the real deal was an I received a call from your\nAnd at that time you know a few years earlier or you know Rick and I have discussed it I was getting out of the game and I went back to school I went back to college and\nI played football made all American and became a college football coach after this drug business and since then I was just becoming the new head football coach\nAt Coptic community college and I was hired as the youngest head African American head coach and that's the time when Gary approached me about standing and I was just like your life like man I ... I just want to focus on what my career is now\nAnd he told me somebody say said porno Amanda don't staffing and don't angle for anything right and a shoot a couple of years later you know he's dead you know stand that a man committed suicide shouldn't himself in the head twice and I was like there's no way\nCould possibly happen and uh that was your first reaction to it yet I\nYeah I was shocked I was I was working on a\nDocumentary with a a Kevin moved a great white hope in a museum was record in the the interview and you know I took a break to do lunch and when I came back and called him a he told me when it happened I was in total shock and awe\nUh-huh did you believe that the time that it was the last time I still don't know\nYou know if it was really not a I\nRead articles where doctors they did it is possible to shoot yourself into here twice [noise]\nTo me it seems kind of odd\nYou know that a person would have the the word is after you shoot yourself\nTo take the pistol was a you know when I didn't do it by a ... go ahead and finish this off on that think that takes amount of willpower and in in in in consciousness\nMy absolute opinion on what happened why I absolutely don't believe that he killed himself I think that they'd get\nStraight up I just don't take that as possible when the thing that that\nYou know I have to say about Gary and Gary is against injustices in and I know that with the thing is happening right now with a different person and in New York deaths from a new Gary will be all over these these these these situations and uh\nIt's sad that that he's no longer here because he was a true a news reporter you know he wasn't declined didn't\nLike now where you can buy 'em off you know\nYou know Gary walked away from it salary you know he walked away from a paying job because they no longer wanted him to report on the things that he felt was important and I think that that's really important with with people in general that uh we have to do what we feel is important and not just a go with the money\nYou're kind of almost feel like they they let out the Gary Webb it looked like a warning gay by out where you do this this is what will happen\nBut you know you know we we we got lucky enough to get an interview with Jesse cats for nearly\nDone really well I have to admit that well he talks about how at the other times they never went\nAfter enhancing every story\nThey wouldn't have to Gary oh to discredit his story totally you know you know on our documentary or Jesse apologizes to ah to Gary in into the world a which he says in the documentary is one of his Lewis points in his uh Korea Korea\nYeah well I I I Want to do now I'm looking at it I really really need our as if you guys you know because we haven't even gotten to the tip of the iceberg but um it can go to try to pick 'em up with a I'm a I'm a Robert Watson as you you talked about\nThat's important now too because it is connected with what's going on you know right now we have a law enforcement officer shooting down to a twelve year old black child\nYou know for no good reason Michael Brown she'll let ... Eric Garner somebody said uh I think I Can't remember who was one of the rappers that it was like watching a snuff film on television where you go choke somebody to death right um so let's go to that clip right now\nYou had no idea what you were going to come into everybody carried extra firepower\nAnd I carried and they are Fifteen in my trunk with three thirty round magazine [noise]\nAt the time we were coming out for hundreds and thousands of dollars\nTo get into a location there'd be a closet filled with money\nThe federal government started using the money [noise]\nThen they way they work that out that money was given back to the agency that these that then that agency will use the money to fight the battle on trucks supposedly\nHappened they had a meeting with us and he said you know if you want to keep your job\nYou keep taking that money because the sheriff's department needs to\nGet the dope off the street to get as much money as you can and bring it in [noise]\nThe guy said you know what we've got five hundred thousand dollars or we're going to turn into evidence what's gonna happen to [noise]\nThe first time I was given money\nI'm In a parking lot sidewalks up any one of my partner then it says here just as your share [noise]\nNow look in the paper bag and there was a month [noise] and that's what I'm thinking okay what the hell do I do do I take it and they part of the group [noise]\nDo I say no I don't want this and then I get labeled as mentioned the bag I can understand [noise]\nOnce you've done that they're dirty [noise]\nAll right it is it's\nI'm a freeway crack in the system it's not yet in theaters but it will be by um award winning filmmaker I'm Mark\nW.
