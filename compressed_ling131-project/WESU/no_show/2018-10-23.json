you're here with us [noise]\nSo you have a you've been a musician for about fifty years according to what you're telling me I guess when you add it all up it's about fifty [laughter] I Know where that helped where that\nCame from the blink of an I well I'll tell you what you've got a a a group right now and you're calling it the the jukebox forty five and a it's the premier fifties and sixties show band right that's correct yeah and so what I wanted to do tonight jury was I wanted to go back\nI wanted to go back and\nI Want to go back to I don't want to find out exactly [laughter]\nExactly um how he got into music and and you know all the musicians today so everybody's influenced by somebody when they're very young age right and that's why they kind of went to this yeah so let's go back where did you grow up my friend\nI grew up in a ... in Connecticut that along the shoreline I'm In Allentown which is a suburb of West even\nWas on its way out but I still do remember it and I have fond memories of going there with my uh my grandparents and my aunt and my my my parents and that was a it was winding down let's say\nIt was winding down now what are we talking late ah sixty ... than they are like well yeah probably a little early to mid sixties mid sixties yeah yeah you're right that's that's a that's what it was one guy I remember driving through there with my father when I was just a\nA young boy and uh we would go the Turks door we would go over to um [noise] oh I don't know my dad and my my mom and dad are always there in the summertime right my very first job was chicks oh there was no you're heading chicks driving them it was a great yeah free beach parking I [laughter]\nAnd you know that that was the that was a great way to get people that go into chicks right oh yeah he had he had it all he was a smart guys out and of course it's close now unfortunately when that was a great place great summer place that was so you're a young boy growing up in a west haven in and what at what age would you say you got turned on the music [noise]\nWell um I can tell you exactly the day it was a February ninth Nineteen sixty four [noise] um the Beatles were going to appear on the television show that night was a Sunday night\nAnd uh you know I had heard about it and I just really wanted to watch the show and\nAnd um you know my parents did not ... not you know it's a school that you have to repetitive wide ride right so you know you know my sister and I went to bed and of course they had the door cracked open trying to peer into living room to see if I could watch any of the show from my bedroom\nAnd as soon as I Do live in a came on and said you know ladies and gentlemen here's the Beatles of course you know my parents but come on out you could sit and watch the show you know am I right at least not in front of that television that you know I was glued to the fact we had a small black and white TV track and uh\nYou're not going to be doing that you know we're not going to be like that you know right by today's standards you know that's that's very conservative\nAfter your parents okay with the uh the Beatles and the modern music eventually they were they were yeah\nLike I don't think they knew what to expect initially but uh so you know every every kid the next day he wanted to have a guitar and a guitar and that was no different ... and then we go back and play with those it's the Beatles and we'll go back would you ever been really good to have you talked about his life right here on cruisers radio [noise]\nAnd I went on\nA bad\n[noise]\nWell see me\nShe won't\nAnd when I\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nOh the academics who have worn that he'll house high school and took their name from the uh the name of a of a sports teams there he'll how's academics Jerry that will bring back some memories [laughter] I remember\nMy on a new a couple of guys in that she went to help out in right she knew some of the guy she did the group yeah and I was just I was just a little kid I didn't really know any better yeah but you know she introduced me knew him and everything and we watched um rehearsed at somebody's house it was a great time\nWe're talking with Jerry fan for nearly Jerry's the lead singer and guitarist for ... box forty five and they've got a date coming up we're going to be talking about very shortly in November\nAnd they are the premier fifties and sixties show band in Connecticut and Jerry is a generously agreed to spend some time with us here in the studio and talk about his life musically and so you took a guitar lessons or for a couple of years\nYou started out with a ... you went to a music school with ... shut down it seems like all the doors are closed Jerry so tell me he formed a band finally right\nWell I well I when I was taking lessons from Joe he really didn't want me to play in a garage band or anything you wanted to teach me how to play the guitar banker right way which I did you know I studied with him for a long time and um you know we still keep in touch he deliver very close friend and mentor to me\nAnd a very dear to me um but yeah so we eventually started our first my first behind a my friend around the corner Monti Rowley was the drummer yeah and uh he and I started off the band and my mom became the manager\nOh no kidding yeah this is like a Beach Boys being with us\n[laughter] and they were looking for a lead guitar player played rhythm guitar at a time\nAnd um you know a a fellow into the ad and um came to the rehearsal and are we really liked him in and he was really good player and um so he ... he joined our our band you know and here we are rehearsing practicing and come into her so that he would come from east Haven Connecticut yep\nI'm come across the bridge and come into New Haven downtown to the green take a transfer from New haven to take another bus into west haven right then he would get off there and walk several blocks to get to where we had a practice you know really has a long trip what year is is it's just like Nineteen I say Nineteen sixty eight maybe\nThat was a dangerous place to be anyway but back in Nineteen sixty eight yeah and he had a valuable instrument [laughter] imagine doing that for that you know and then well I think he was I think we were about twelve years old yeah yeah over\nThirteen or something like that anyway or John payload his name was and um [noise] you know uh I guess after a while I don't know if it was his parents they didn't want I'm traveling so far to go practice and everything and it came to ... and he told me that you know he was not going to be able to play anymore and of course you know\nWe were like you know gosh that's just terrible worst things that you can get you know\nBut uh we replaced Jon a with a ed nice thick who turned out to be a good guitar player\nAnd um you know we we kept that being together for about Thirteen Years while I was the name of the ... the impression the impression and um I have a funny story about John actually because uh\nAfter he left you know I didn't seem any longer random you lose touch with another or talking about that before and um gosh I think it had to be almost forty years went by and uh I just\nAnd then this thing called Facebook comes out and ride I took a shot in the dark and I tried to find them and I didn't even know what I was talking to I said are you doing this may seem odd to you I said but um my name is Jerry ... and you know I had a band when I was a kid and my mom was and he\nDoes not only do I remember I remember your mother putting the ad in the paper and I went oh no kidding and do we we we hooked\nUp right after that and ah you know we've been good friends great friends since then\nUm and he's still playing music or he is actually a tree or a name for himself Johnny pie and he plays the role of the assisted living and uh oh no kidding yeah he does quite well and he loves doing it\nYou know I'm Glad to hear that Jerry I my mother is in a a a home in Florida she has um Alzheimer's\nAnd when we find people like your friend who goes into these facilities and I got to tell you when I visit my mom last year um they brought in a musician these people they they don't remember who their husband is they don't know who's visiting them but when they hear those songs and that music I Know\nAll the connections forming their singing the songs they remember all the words right now so God Bless people like your friend Yo Yo's into these home he's\nThe he's was from having above wow he he loves doing it too he's ... he's been doing it for a while and uh and he asked me to get involve you wanted me to do it a little bit you know and I and we do my band does play a spot in different uh assisted living places on occasion\nBut um you know there's not much money to for a for peace banned for now writing it's more of a single yeah former yeah and um you know what they do now is they'll have a special event you know and it'll be like an event that they have an an oldies event and they'll have money to ensure for the band you know let's get back\nAnd and did you ever think at one time during that period Jerry I can make a career and I can do\nThis well [noise] [laughter] that's a good question um yeah I I I thought that I Would want to I always thought that I Would want to do that and I've been in the in most of my life yep um since you know age twelve Thirteen\nRemember the first time we ever played out in public we played for a Cub Scout blue and gold dinner okay you know just a bunch of kids aren't yeah short\nAnd so at the end of the show you know when I went up to the games that you know we finished our performance you know we can uh getting paid and he said to me\nLike kid I just gave you a meatball subs ... what are your walk from me [laughter] but that was the first job we played ball [laughter] but you know as\nTime went on you know we ended up getting better uh yeah uh gigs and I'm so many interesting stories in better pay but not much better I mean the the music business and it's really\nA terrible but yet they'll pay you are you still think they can pay now what they did back in the sixties right right of guys want to play so they do it you know\nWhat's confidence ever a problem for you to get up and perform in front of people\n[noise] no no I I really enjoy playing for people I really like uh uh the feeling that I get when I see people smile and when we play the oldies I Know you're talking about because some of the people that listen to some of the stuff that we do you know they'll come up to us later on and say you know jeeze God I haven't heard that song since\nI had to dance with the love of my life on the gymnasium floor in high school [laughter] you know that I haven't heard that song stun gun you know yeah and it really makes it warms my heart like a candle\nFeet off in the audience to defeat the league ... that you get that when ... what about when you're not getting that Jerry you got to dig down and just remain professional I mean there's got to be ... when you're not getting the reaction you were hoping\nYou know on occasion yeah but most of the time people really enjoy the music we play and there's not too many people out there that don't like uh\nThe the older strong so I think it was a period of time when I'm life was simpler right um you know people seem to be happier back then there was less craziness going on in the world I I really can't say that a hundred percent because we still had problems in the world or\nA but but the times back then it seemed like that to me these seemed like\nIt was a nicer time I think music grounded us back then honestly the lyrics were just writing was easy to listen to write I'll drive down the road and somebody next to me we playing [noise] I don't know what kind of music but all the here's boom boom boom boom and I see the trunk of the car [laughter] actually vibrating going up and down\nAnd I wonder how they can sit in the car and listen to that I Know [laughter] when when I Know how it's impacting me and I'm In my own car with the windows up its mind boggling um which you told me earlier that one of the influences\nAre for you and and some of the songs you performed by this group the decrees\nA it is what people will see when they come to your shows\nUm I have one here I don't know does your group do you belong to me by the breeze we stopped so you do huh that's one of the first things we do okay well let's let's play it now and come back and talk more about your life my friend\nShark and Brooklyn Yup I knew when it was time in my late forties it was time and I wanted to do it oh man you want to start as late forties I mean that's a whole different ballgame yeah I mean he he's still afraid to this day he's pretty old\nNow but [noise] and um so he said you know I'm not really that it's not a problem if you if you you can't handle that he said\nYou know you could help people being civil servants you write firemen yup and and that's what I did I interviewed became a fireman I became a fireman and for the

I mean what have you guys got planned out into the future well he does about six to twelve shows a year okay are you guys are going to be with him\nUm well ah I ... I I Would like to be with him in the future yeah um I guess a lot is riding on the show a so if we do a good job I guess though right [noise]\nYeah yeah so we really know uh all the jokes that he gave us to learn a wee wee wee bone up on all the changes when we come to rehearsal and we're just polishing them up and putting the finishing touches on now\nUm and then you know there's a little banter back and forth with him in the band and rice and uh so\nI think it's going to be very high energy show a very exciting show or it's going to be a lot of fun and I think the people in the audience are going to get a real charge out of it um that's my own personal feeling about it and\nUsually you want to have those feelings and usually pretty amusing correct you know about it because uh some of the songs were doing it just so great you know really nice stuff yeah that he did and um and we try to play it exactly the way you know the the record is or the way the Youtube video and you know we watch the show that he didn't have any to the gym\nAnd then we we watch it over and over again and then we try to listen to all the\nThere is there an audience out there for this I mean because you know look I be honest with you there there are a few shows here on W E s you weep late fifties and sixties and and I mean the early stuff oh sure we we will\nMaybe even earlier right so is there is there an audience out there for this music\nI definitely think there is yeah I Believe there is um and I'll tell you the reason why I'm all ... all the baby boomers now are reaching retirement age yeah trend or so they're looking for something to do and they don't want to do it really late at night yup they like to do it earlier in the evening\nAnd um I think there's a lot of people out there who really enjoy this music still I get people coming up to me all the time of war you practice at my house in Middletown yep I'm\nIt's right on the path for the hospital people back to the nurses and stuff that go down to the parking lot\nAnd they have to go right by my house to get there\nAnd um you know they're always stopping in saying oh my God this is great where are you planning and let us know where you're going to be playing next to Matt\nAnd we love the music in it you know so I definitely think that people really like this kind of stuff I mean you know there's I mean there's people that like different kinds of music obviously but uh I don't know of anybody who doesn't like that's kind of music\nWe all do you think it just takes us back to a better time in our life where things are a little simpler\nIt does to those who know the music and who've lived through the period yeah um I think that you know I remember it being much nicer time [noise]\nFunny but music takes us back to specific points in our life we remember when you talked about the Beatles experience and peeking through the cracks in the doorway\nWe we associate music with many of those\nWhat I Want to call photographs in our life right those those still frames or we know where we were when we heard that song maybe it wasn't on AM radio and you're in a back seat a mom's car in the sixties and that song came on and you just love that song and mom would return Adele no no that's right\nAnd that music is really special and um it really\nOr group um jukebox forty five playing the freeze the raise bill Haley and the comment the Marcel the monkeys the rascals Johnny Cash orbits and Dell Shannon the Belmont\nDel Vikings Janey Americans this is all these are all groups to play the music we grew up with ... and there's still there's there's that audience out there I mean do you agree with that\nAbsolutely one hundred percent you know um we get to have the best of both worlds really because we'll open for the show yeah we'll do all those songs cry and then we're going to actually become the Elvis tribute band yeah ah and\nThen after the show was over ... people are still going to stay I think it's open 'til twelve so we'll go back on again in play of the rest of the evening so people can get up and danced in and just enjoy the rest of\nSaturday morning at seven ...

since the end of the Obama administration Russia is now more dependent on their nuclear weapons because of our missile defense are huge conventional superiority\nAre expanding NATO eastward the actions that we've taken in Syria and Ukraine that have been you know very difficult for the people there but also counter to Russia's interests because of all of that\nRussia is now more dependent on their nuclear weapons for their security which means you and I are less safe our tax dollars have pushed Russia into this place where they're relying more on their news making us and the whole world less safe Americans Russian\nIt was a pulled the U.S out of the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty\nYeah not a surprise at all and of course fault and a lot of people think it making it more difficult in terms of diplomacy with North Korea and pushing for a confrontation with Iran which could be a complete disaster bone doesn't believe in international treaties and international\nUm alliances that Saturday believes in unfettered a U.S military power\nHowever again and I'm not trying to achieve Pollyanna history naive about this it is possible that this might lead to some broader deal between the United states and Russia and it may involve things other than nuclear weapons but if they decided to figure out what are the\nConcerns are around this treaty it is possible that the United states could stay in this treaty\nThey also need to extend the new start agreement or else it will expire in twenty Twenty one and then there will be no limits at all on the long range nuclear forces or we need to stop and reverse this commitment to\nTwo trillion dollars of upgrading and renewing our whole nuclear complex and in\nFact the U.S and Russia should get on board with the majority of the world's countries there was a treaty signed at the United nations just last year to prohibit in band nuclear weapons eliminating them from the face of the earth hundred and twenty three countries have signed onto that\nNone of the current nuclear states have but that's the direction we need to be moving at not spending trillions on new nuclear weapons we don't need and nobody wants and certainly not risking confrontation in Europe or wherever with nuclear\nWeapons nuclear weapons just touch of the royal me totally true they are quite literally\nThe most you know the biggest to leave the ... the the cue the humanity ever come up when I mean we just don't talk about\nAnd this is where you have this uh oligarchy ... and ...\nGo and U.S Russian relations were better at the time there was a a\nFairly vibrant civil society\nMoving on peace and environmental issues starting to grow in Russia now unfortunately that's not so much the case anymore and there's a lot of problems with the Russian economy or the Russian people are wonderful I ... I I had the best hospitality that I could have asked for\nAnd the people have Russia's don't want a nuclear arms race or spending so much of their resources because their economy is so much smaller than ours is\nOn nuclear weapons and that's the same thing for the people in China or Pakistan or India or any of the countries that absurdly have squandered resources on nuclear weapons and it's not just a squad of resources me mass tragic enough uh they're they're asking is that for this whole nuclear a build up by the United states and you could put that towards addressing or at least mitigating\nClimate change all around the world let me say oh we don't have the money to do that\nWell yes we do is just that we're putting it into wars and weapons and nuclear\nWeapons especially instead of addressing climate change just to pick one issue that's very important [noise] ah but then the fact that nuclear weapons they're sort of forgotten but not gone you don't have a lot of people even progressive that are very concerned about it yet it's the greatest threat to life on plant on the planet in in the near term and it's so on democratic\nThere is a great book by a colleague in support of ours arguments lanes scary she's a professor at Harvard and it's called thermonuclear monarchy and what she says is especially in this country but also be other democracies that have nuclear weapons the fact that we have a democracy is completely thwarted by the fact that one person could\nMake a decision to launch nuclear weapons that could lead\nTo ending life on earth that tell on democratic nuclear weapons are\nNow a ... ... ... treaty audits camping I enough treaty bilateral treaty between the U.S and Russia should be talking about making it a global treaty having that do that are ... doing to pull out\nI suppose uh [noise]\nYou know France and Britain but why the heck France and Britain still have nuclear weapons they should get rid of those tomorrow it's ridiculous the only company that might make sense\nWould be China or whether there are other ways to deal with with China and and China's actually very modest in terms of its nuclear forces and its nuclear posture and its policy and so again if there were a bigger bargain here\nBetween the U.S and Russia which again could include things like how do we cooperate in Syria how do we cooperate with\nRegard to Iran over us doesn't want to cooperate with around since we pulled out of that uh anti nuclear agreement a Ukraine I'm fixing the concerns about NATO expansion so there are a lot of issues that could be taken into account here and why don't particularly excuse Russia's\nAh actions it's understandable that they are at such a economic political and military disadvantage to the United states in the west but they are going to take some defensive measures or to protect their interests so I Do think you could look at broadening this treaty but I think the better way to do that is through\nBroader treaties including again the treaty was signed that the United nations to eliminate nuclear weapons worldwide which none of the nuclear states are currently on board with and probably won't be soon but that certainly doesn't demand that we do care about life on the planet\nNeeds to be raising that you guys need to be getting rid of these dumb thing not spending our tax dollars on them and moving towards abolishing nuclear weapons far beyond just restraining this type or that type of thing\nRight until accomplish find a way to make the ball is in a nuclear weapon into an insult to all us veterans [laughter] I'm Kevin what about a congressional approval desktop need congressional approval to pull out if this treaty and he just like you\nKnow the cars to try to stop it but this Congress certainly would not uh I think if he decides he wants to do it and again he's not the first one to do it George Bush\nTerms of them that could start an arms race of so called defensive weapons but as I said before are not particularly defense if they are viewed by Russia and China and others as part of an off sensitive strategy or so it's not the first time in the United states has pulled out of an important\nA treaty to deal with nuclear weapons [noise] um\nI think if Trump wants to in the end he will but I think there's still some chance we want to give them this announcement Saturday\nWas not an official what's wrong with an announcement to do so and it's interesting that the meeting that a boat and this is having right now where it's very late of course that Russia time right now we may see some News Tomorrow about what kinds of discussions he had a with Russians Russians were not happy about this but\nThey also seemed to be open to some dialogue and there is also within the IMF treaty itself a dialogue mechanism verification commission to deal with these complaints or disputes and they've only met twice clearly they didn't get far enough because Russia does have some complaints as does the United states\nBut again my preference and it is possible that\nThere could be a at least setting the stage for a broader conversation not just about this treaty or these new and coming up they haven't announced another summit between a hoot and and a Trump but November\nEleventh armistice day the end of a World War one hundredth anniversary there's a meeting in France that both a tuna Trump will be there and why not on the sideline of that ticket half day to sit down and talk about some of these issues and see if we can make some progress\n... well ah who knows what'll happen in the next few weeks it's getting the mid term election some of the dynamics Tom in government real change finally Kevin I there was a time when anti nuclear activity can look all the rage um and it doesn't seem so now what needs to happen in the grass roots\nTo make nuclear weapon elimination a big issue\nIt's very difficult I mean it's so depressing people want to put it out of their mind being denied\nAnd nuclear weapons climate change will unfold unfortunately over\nWell fortunately or unfortunately is unfolding over time whereas nuclear weapons could in life on Earth Day uh\nAnd I think a lot of people see climate change and they see the effects of it as affecting their lives or they they they see it on the news they don't necessarily see the effects of nuclear weapons and it's just easier to put it out of their mind\nOur video and audio for [noise]\nYou're listening to your point one of them for years few middle per listener supported community

Margaret Garner our guest is Mary e Fredrickson she is one of the editors along with the Lord's am Walters of\nA brand new book gender resistance women's slavery and the legacy of Margaret gardener of course this is Margaret Prescott host of the journal truth so Mary welcome\nThank you very much pleasure to be with you\nMary before we get into some of the story a covered in this anthology to have some contacts fear for our listeners I'd like to discuss a bit\nThe breeding state because a lot of people are not aware of breeding states and and I think it it really helped to give some sense of reality of of what it was like and tell us what you know what can you share with us about these breathing state\n[noise] well I think one of the things that we wanted to look at in this particular volume or\nThe stories of women who had um and and slave and who had been and lived in a sexual live away and we focus\nAnd er ... story in the history of slavery one of the books that followed Toni Morrison loved it which of course is a fictional story of Margaret gardeners life\nIs a book called modern ... D a\nAnd I think that I'm Margaret grown are really in many ways was a modern ... I think that Margaret gardeners story illustrates the breathing states probably Kentucky may not even be on that list of breathing states\nStates where in fact slave owners were having impregnated ... slave women on a regular basis to increase the number of slaves\nI Would argue that had happened in every state where slavery occurred I think we have historical evidence\nThat that happened across the board\nAnd Margaret coroner stories certainly illustrates that\nI mean she bore several children who are at the historical evidence indicates were fathered by be if you can use that word where the master had impregnated her the stories in gender resistance\nReally revolver around the issue of sexual slavery and I think that we see that for a number of reasons one is sexual pleasure one is sexual control and probably the most significant is for reproduction\nIn Cincinnati when Margaret gardener in her family members escaped\nThey knew they would only stay in Cincinnati temporarily and then they would have to go further north and in order to escape from slavery in the U.S they would in fact have to go into Canada\nSo her family was planning to go to Cincinnati get into Ohio but just stay there for a short period of time until they could be transported north\nBasically they were caught they were though so there's the ... sensation um him you know our listeners may not know that\nThe river the river was frozen that night\nAnd quite solidly and they were able to go across get to the other side and they went to what they thought was a safe house where they could stay the night before or probably stay for a couple of days before they left to go further north\nThe master of of Margaret gardeners plantation\nLeft the plantation got federal marshals to cross the river meet at or make them in Cincinnati they track the family they went to the house where they were staying they burst into the house\nThey had guns they had weapons of all kinds and they capture the family and they um [noise] and they arrested them they were arrested by the marshals\nAnd it was at that moment that Margaret Garner made the fateful decision\nTo kill one of her children her her young daughter marry rather than have this child return to slavery\nWas her her intention to kill only about ... or did it ever emerge of her intention was really to kill all of her children rather than have them when the lights and plays well with\nUm apparently the intention was to kill all of the children she was not able to do that had two sons with her and that the baby as I say she was also pregnant at the time\nThis young child was described as very light skin with rosy cheeks there was discussion about it\nKnow all of that though I say in with a had a hesitation because who in the mouth of its words came out that we are not sure\nYeah and and you know of course that that story and the impact of a fair trial there was great interest in her trial in a a lot of people being appalled by that but certainly\nWe had heard of that story before even of\nWomen who were enslaved a and giving birth on slave ships fundamentally did to making the decision to kill themselves and their children\nRather than than be in play but Margaret gardeners story is certainly a very dramatic instances that and and the fact that the trial itself was you know such a such a sensation\nTo tell us about the impact of it in and then I I also want to before we leave the Margaret guard a story\nOr looking at the clock regard I Do want to get more in depth about Elizabeth Elizabeth Clark gains\nBut Tony Mars than the Nobel laureate in her book both love it a lot of people make the contrast them in comparison with the story she tells in blood where Beth\nI'm One of the characters are killed the child and that it's the trade as a kind of emerged the killing\nA marriage right absolutely and you know Tony Morrison face the story but a lot better on them are quite garner case um she\nRead of them are quite garner case actually in a wonderful book of documents called black women and white America which I'm her story in court or gr to learn or at ten back in the early seventies\nI can see it on my shelf now but girdle learn or put these documents together in one of the document she included in the book was a very short piece from one of the Cincinnati papers about the mark where garner case\nAnd Toni Morrison said later that she had read that story resonated with her\nAnd that then she wrote the book the love it based on that story so I think that you know Seth the character of sadness clearly is based on the Margaret gardeners story\nUm I I wanted to say I have um the Cincinnati papers the New York papers um we're just\nFilled with articles about them Margaret coroner trial um\nI have one of the clippings here and it says from January twenty ninth arrest a fugitive slaves a slave my mother mergers her child rather than see a return to slavery\nAnd the article begins great excitement existed threw out the city the whole of yesterday in consequence of the arrest of a party of slaves and the murder of her child by a slave mother bought the officers were in the active making the arrest\nUm another one goes stampede of slaves a tale of horror\nAnd harassed by the U.S marshal ... deputy US Marshal shot a negro child's throat cut from ear to ear by its father or mother and others wounded\nSo [noise] you know they are by its father or mother that seven\nSensationalism around the case around the arrest around them or the death of the child and around the um\nThe trial itself the trial went on for quite a long time one people filled the streets of you wonder how people had so much time on their hands but every morning when Margaret Garner was brought from the jail to the court house\nThe streets were lined with people curious to see her\nFollowed people followed this trial it ... it was for\nMany many years it was\nMaybe forever it was the most infamous trial around slavery in the in the country\nYeah and and ironically and I'm a ... a ... who co\nEdited the book with you I mean she writes that\nAnd I find it really ironic that I'm Margaret Garner wasn't tried for her child's murder but that the judge who is that a federal commissioner overrule the state's right to prosecute for murder but upheld the fugitive slave law\nRight do you just said act supporting slavery and that the family would have been sent back to Kentucky\nWell yes and then that that there was a fight between the state of Ohio in the state of Kentucky about what to do with Margaret\nGarner Ohio pointed to try or for murder\nNow ... there was an irony there because they wanted to try for murder and one of the rationales for that was that if she was tried for murder she could be kept in the state of Ohio and not return to to slavery Cincinnati in particular\nEight so it was a thousand feet across the river and you were in and depending on which way you were going where you are in a free state or a slave states\nAnd abolition is in Kentucky and national abolition it's one of them was Lucy Stone\nWho was a separate dressed and an abolitionist she came to Cincinnati for the trial in fact she was the one person who pointed out the sexual abuse that Margaret Garner\nAnd the sexual slavery in which Margaret gardener had been held\nSo there was a struggle between the state of Ohio wanting to trial for murder partially as a way to keep her in Ohio in a free state and not ... percent back into slavery um versus Kentucky where the argument was\nThat she could not be tried for murder because she was in slave and in fact she would have to be charged with destruction of property\nThe horrible irony if this is many of them were abolitionists but they they like the idea of freedom in the abstract but having thousands and thousands of pre slaves come to the city was something that they did not want to see happen at the time of the first riot\nRacially base fry it against free blacks in Cincinnati\nHalf the African American population of Cincinnati left about Fifteen hundred people left and went to Canada and settled\nElizabeth Clark gains in her family stayed they held their ground there and wait it out and things did get somewhat\nBut as you say in Eighteen forty there was another major riots\nAt black people just just an amazing story there but I I was also very moved and again this is Margaret Prescott hoses to during the truth and our guest is Mary he Fredrickson she along with Doris I'm Walters or edited the book gender resistance women slavery\nAnd the legacy of Margaret Garnett you know there's not a lot out there on um women resistance to slavery and the books certainly is one of them\nI was very moved by the story that is a told it actually and your chapter Mary Frederick than in the book about Margaret about Elizabeth Clark gains\nFirst grandchild Peter Clark\nAnd he gave just an amazing speech because he became an hour to earn an organizer you know labor in citizenship and workers' rights than and much more as you say I just wanted to quote something from a speech that he gave an Eighteen Seventy three\nWhere he says I Do not forget the prejudice of the American people I could not if I Would I Am or from Seoul to crown with its blows to the ... by the bedside of my mother\nAnd intensified her pain as she bore me and it further says it poisons the food I eat the water I drink the air I Breathe it didn't the sunshine of my days than deepens the darkness of might night it hampers me and\nEvery relation of life in business and politics and religion as a father or the husband it haunt me walking or writing waking or leaping and then he further as Hercules could have\nEasily forgotten the poisoned shirt which scorched his flash as I can forget the prejudice\nFrom the Caribbean and I thought that Peter\nBack then captured so much the of course the horror back then but also the you to do a much more limited degree of course ... residuals of having to\nDeal with racial prejudice and and oppression and and then he was alive the kind of terror that people went through and and here he was um the grandson\nOf a ... a woman who had calculated in and made quite a fight to free her cells\nAbsolutely and her her sons and then her her grandchildren became just all of them were absolutely amazing people Peter Clarke a remarkable orator\nHe spoke all around the state of Ohio and was very connected nationally he became the head of the black schools in Cincinnati his uncle\n... one of ... Clark gains children had founded the black schools in Cincinnati arguing that if there were going to be schools for white children there had to be schools for black children\nThese were people who were absolutely sought education business religion the church the school and the home as the foundation of American Life for blacks or whites they spoke\nSo powerfully about equality and opportunity and fairness and justice\nQuieter are remarkable legacy there are other than the Clark gains I also wanted to speak with you about the ... bowl and junk and the role that it played\nThe chapter in the book that deals with this is by our colleague\nBall she actually has a book coming out soon on the quad dream balls and she included a chapter in the anthology gender resistance she talks about these balls that were held in the early\nNineteen century in many cities actually in the U.S but the most famous city was New Orleans I'll just read a short ... the CI includes a typical description of such balls appeared\nIn the Providence because that on August seventh Eighteen twenty every Saturday Night is ushered in with splintered quadruple balls none but ... ladies\nThat is women of mixed blood and white gentleman are allowed to attend those ladies are prohibited\nFrom marrying a white man and they are too proud to Anaheim manning to to ... marry wound up their own color\nConsequently in this land of sensuality\nThat is New Orleans they become openly without any degradation kept mistresses\nAnd will it said while engaged to be for a week a month or a year be true to their employers it is also said to be the common practice of the mothers of such daughters to educate them for the purpose of pleasure\nAnd barter them away during their minority to the best bitter\nAnd there were often referred to as left handed marriages because clearly a lot of abuse men or men of means that you know had their own ... and and family\nIn the case of the ... involves often these um these women were second wives they were shadow they had\nThis chapter that I think is so powerful it says she examines how the um quite dream balls have sort of had a Second Life in American visual culture in recent decades their films about the quad during balls now\nAnne Rice is second novel a feast of all saints\nFeatures the ... balls so there's interest in these stories and quite frankly in does sexuality and the intensity of the stories\nRight at the questions that Williams as it is how how much power did\nThese women have\nDid their families have you know because on the one hand these women can be seen as caught in this\nSystem absolutely they work this abusive system on the other hand there their mothers leverage this life for them which in Eighteen twenty probably in qualitative terms\nWas a better life for them than they would have had as\nAn enslaved woman who didn't occupied this particular love mental status as a quandary room\nI was interested that included in this ... you edited do one of the editors of is a chapter titled resurrecting as she got ... and I I first learned about her actually spending some time and\nI'm One of my life and Venezuela actually\nAnd she could to fill up the TV [laughter] soap opera it's huge I mean everybody wanted to go home to be able to do what she could go back and she was in a slave woman joke to tell our listeners\nSaturday morning and then

set a kind of went out and try to figure out some people and you know of course a lot of people connect\nUm a lot of anarchists try to connect with some of the sort of more critical pedigree dogs meaning like Paul the ferry and other people like that yes and I said well how do we how can we kind of look even further back and figure out what was happening there and so I started reading\nSome space like Emma Goldman and other folks that kind of touch on some of the uh anarchists in education but then I started looking into Francisco fair who basically you know I was trying to read through it and go\nWow this hasn't been out like hasn't been published for quite some time and so um or in sporadically and different places but but uh so I asked like I've been working I've known Ramsey from PM pressed for probably like twenty over Twenty years so and he put out the anarchist pedagogy is a\nEdited book um that we did in two thousand twelve and so basically I said gosh I really I really should be published this book or re release it and do it in a different context in part of it was like one of my students to kind of have a historical context too because it really\nDoesn't provide that much in terms of like um as much as I think the students would\nCatch on to so I think it was really inside the sitting there thinking I go hey I think mark Greenwood I'm you know I was looking at looking at his actually video this is kind of interesting I saw a video that he put together of some Spanish anarchists\nThe sanitizing for rare from that perspective but also ... him\nPurely ideological anarchists figure who who's I educational vision was the epitome of anti authoritarianism and actually if you if you dig into um his other writing into the school newspaper into details of how the classes were organized\nWith very I'm scheduled sessions like this session will go from one o'clock to two o'clock than we are going to do that [noise]\nAnd they initially the school did publish ... not only gave the students' grades are published the grade they would publish when students were late to school with scold them for being lazy it's ended after a year so you can see that you know project is finished on its first day and so\nMany of these principles are put into practice later it seems but by showing this as a work in progress by showing for rare as someone who was an anarchist but also retain elements of kind of Republican not in the American Republican tend to put in a\nWorking for a republic rather than a monarchy a heat repaint elements of Republicanism and um\nHe had a sort of ... relationship with several of the women in his life he had a proper relationship with his children\nHe was a darker so in my translation and in the um biographical information about him the goal was to bring all this out and give English language readers a full picture a to respond to because all too often\nPeople that have written about career in English have essentially taken for rare description of the school in his own book at face value and um that that's a bit misleading\nThat's fascinating I think relating to that I was struck by the discussion of\nForum and content and the differences between emphasizing form and emphasizing content and an artist teaching because fares idea was solely focusing on the foreign\nThen by the state or by\nThe ruling class and I was thinking about how now a lot of private educational institutions and they're selling point is alternative and project based teaching methods um and they're not necessarily meant to be some versus but they're about climbing the corporate ladder or\nYou know by using the current trend is critical thinking and so given that as critique I was wondering if you think that the tension between foreman content\nIn this courses of alternative teaching holds true today how is that how does that play out today\nRob you want to think of that one yeah yeah um so so what we're seeing like especially in\nSort of quote unquote twenty first century learning environments that you know the individualized instruction you know what I mean and that's really kind of this idea that we're you know all students we should differentiate instruction for everyone and we should have new\nWays of teaching for every single student that we have and a lot of that is is really being pushed towards the on line work in the private sector\nAnd you know where he can to get your degree in uh in your pajamas or whatever those sorts of things but you begin to start you begin to start seeing how\nA lot of that gets advocated for basically the sort of pushing and moving towards that sort of hyper individualistic sort of way of being right so it's not that we should be working together and collaborating in any sort of but uh but we should be doing so which really really what the marketplace [laughter]\nYou know in into at the end right so we're getting a job um\nBut also feeling good that you're getting this job via your\nEducational background in your in your desire right in in terms of ah what type of education like so it's all catered towards these sorts of things and I think you know as far as like anarchist sort of ways I mean I've had discussions with you know people in in in terms of what can\nUh create sort of online anarchist educational sort of practices um you would that mean like skills sharing or whatever whatever happier kind of presenting them or is it you know intellectual worker his historical work that I think is\nStill up in the air I think there's some people that are starting to try to do those sorts of things but I think it's still it's really the movement towards [noise] sort of the project based learning and all that sort of stuff\nIt's really stems from sort of the progressive era sort of ... like the Dewey in sort of an educational process of learning by doing a project based but really it comes down to\nWhen he talked in those teachers now even in the public schools um it comes down to its it's constructive ism and those sorts of things and progressive education\nFor people to move into a certain type of education meaning the creative economy you know I mean those sorts of things [laughter] basically as opposed to sort of liberal tore a perspective you know a sort of a moving ourselves for different in a different direction in terms of social movements or those sorts of things so I think that we're starting to see\nA lot of that ... Haitian of sort of free school I mean even in Britain or they're doing the same thing where they were like you know really kind of promoting somebody's free schools\nBut it's in line with sort of state and sort of co sort of existence between the the state and corporations right we have the same thing here where we have um it's sort of\nA corporations and charter schools right you know so they're basically having a certain type of agenda even though they're promoting\nCritical thinking progressive sort of being you know those sorts of things\nI'm a ... and challenges it and I'll sell sort of alternative pedagogical practices but I think it comes down to how do we begin to start taking on roles of of really\nJust having you know having them there as a window dressing I'll use that [laughter] church for sort of like you know to fetch rates you know the dominant society\nTo to add on to that it you know it's fascinating\nTo read in in the book that we put together the anarchist critiques of career along those lines that ... I'm caught by Ricardo may uh\nUm and Clemente is occupied that by teaching children anarchists content for example such as like teaching them to be against the state or against war or against capitalism or or you name it\nFrom their perspective that was anathema to the project of education because ah they argued that in our case should be neither monarch yet I'm Sorry education should be neither ... nor anarchists et cetera et cetera\nIt's ... I think it's also interesting to think about that debate in terms of um anarchists an anti authoritarian politics more broadly because I think one of the outcome of the squares movement of the last decade has been for some people to reduce anarchy them to a set of procedures and practices\nOf decision making making in street protests and a person I think that's insufficient and can lead to these kinds of movements being redirected in markedly non anarchists directions and so I think it's interesting to try and think through the role of of content informed both in\nRadical education and in politics more broadly\nAnd just on the final no on that is that a host Jay Pratt one of the other anarchist writers in this volume who addresses this question draw the distinction between\nThe role of propaganda for adults versus what he described as kind of indoctrination for children and argued in favor of propaganda for adults but the the children should be treated differently politically so there's all sorts of interesting do you want to think through with the question\nOf I mean even we used to talk about this in her book and philosophy of anarchy them education is like this idea that you know\nThat ... kind of naive to pedagogical right and sort of like historically and and I think that is it's it's not I mean I think there's there's some aspects of that but I think for me at least with generating this new\nYou know in the book it clearly shows that the discussions were there you know what I mean like it clearly shows that what ... how do we teach kids like how do we work through that and really um and I don't think\nI think that's happening at over time especially in the United states who've had continuous conversations or even you know post sort of like end of end of this sort of modern school D.J Skelton and those sort of thing even in the fifties and sixties\nBut I think now is is is to continue that are bringing that back to to have those discussions like how do we\nEducate right and what is the purpose of that in terms of sort of radical space is that we operate it you know what I mean and and I think Mark's right on it for him to like the idea that you know we can just have these social movements in these sorts of things in the ... pie in the streets and it's like well how\nDoes that can be redirected very quickly or if we're not in sort of understanding of what's going on you know I mean and what the sort of practice what's happening in those sort of an analysis I guess you'd say and that's in those sort of practices\nTeachers and working you know the front lines in public schools right we have comrades their anarchist that are working in public schools and we need to acknowledge that and understand that those folks are also struggling to work through this process of trying to intervene even within the the ... the sort of dominance of the state\nAnd the sort of curricular set of guidelines and also state standards and those sorts of things so I think you know in talking with pre service teachers with me I'd say they look at like when I when I had them read a\nEmma Goldman's the child and its enemies or you know about train declares war ... you know offensive affairs\nGreat for young people to get you know to engage in terms of how to God will practice is however they always regress back to the sort of state\nOperations right you know go well how do we you know get kids into college and how do we do these sorts of things and for me it's like it's it's that I think there's a cultural struggle that goes on with that too as well as like that sort of\nLike intervening in this sort of cultural practices that are dominant people's lives and also the economic and political realities like what what's happening with them so I think there's like two sort of problems that I mentioned being as like\nI think we need to continue generating those practices base in those conversations at least that have been going on for over a hundred years right\nAnd revisiting some of those issues that have already been discuss I mean which that gets back to really doing the intellectual worked at I think it's important for anarchists to do like\nUm yeah and then on the other and then on the other hand is having a also supporting the struggles of let's say teachers on the front like you know working in in public school especially like you know\nI was just talking to a a friend of mine from West Virginia who is in this sort of wild strike down there you know the teachers and it's like we need to support those folks you know even though it is kind of the state as we still need to kind of continue to to try to carve out at least some space for them to\nContinue to do the work that's the critical work that their continued doing\nAt the same time developing sort of alternative projects that I think we can see like that have been going on for quite some time I mean it's and in the matter is is like I think and I mentioned afterwards is being trans parent you know it's like with students' week we've got to be transparent on what\nWhat we're trying to accomplish you know what I mean it's like if and if it means younger kids you know that we need to talk to them about transit there I mean I I think\nBaggage the social baggage that we have as adults right you know they ask questions that we wouldn't we sometimes don't you think about asking right because it's might be taboo or something like that kids a lot of times asked us questions that we're like whoa kind of throws you off so\nI think yeah and develop those spaces that are encouraging for those young people to do that to be able to ask those questions and the rise to understand the world in different ways because\nThat's that's the reality of what were you know that's going to move us in different directions and so and I think with\nPublic education again it's it's an unhealthy [laughter] but but it's also there's also people that are doing some incredible work in the school that we need to I think\nLook towards to how we can intervene in the space it's right you know in the ... state apparatus that um that it's always difficult to intervene and I think there's anarchists educators out there doing some amazing work\nEven in the public schools right in spite of the state right yeah that makes sense [laughter]\nYeah yeah also to to follow up on that\nHistorically if you look at some of the debate for example in Spanish and left during the time that forever was around you have socialist arguing for working within the state to improve state education\nWhich is sort of the general Marxist perspective of the time and then you have anarchists to argue for\nWorking outside of the state on surprisingly and creating alternative schools I'm working from there and that sort of attention that exist\nWithin ... different kinds of places is the feasibility of working entirely outside of mechanisms a that exist I remember like five years ago I was invited to lead in Spain\nUm I was hosted for a book talk with the local see anti and afterwards\nOf a health care against a you know the the destruction of public education with a few of them saying\nYeah we need to stand with these movements and defend public education defend public health care and the other comrades saying we're anarchists were against the state we need to create our own alternatives to education at all not Turner due to health care outside the state and not get caught up in these like state is politics\nUm and there are plenty of people who sort of had a a position in between and so that is not exactly the conversation that we're having us proud of the reason\nThere is no seemed to be viable like hey an anarchist let's create our own competing school system like you know realistically that's not going to happen I think that you know if people have projects they want to put into place more power to you but\nAs a sort of large scale strategy I don't see that happening\nUm so you know it raises the question of how to make a as Rob was saying as teachers as parents making intervention in education\nAnd also I think raises the question of how the education relate to other forms of social struggle\nAnd you know we we we can look back on the wave of anti authoritarian schools that were created in the wake of parades execution around the world\nI'm In other kinds of going back to the discussion of former content other kind of um schools that prioritized um students centered learning\nBut I wouldn't say that if you have these educational initiatives in an authoritarian capitalist society it's very difficult to push against that no matter what procedures for what can happen I think we've seen that born out so you know in terms of a larger revolutionary pictures I think important to take all these people\nSome of that I Would say more\nAbout that conversation playing out like let's say with the Chicago so the teachers a strike or you know it was like ... almost not ten years ago or eight years ago or something like that or were you have anarchists basically you know marching with public school teachers here twenty five thousand schoolteachers and you know\nWe saw that in Brazil happened recently in the last five years um and I think there's there's some interesting\nSpace I mean the I think that conversation needs to be played out more because I ... and again I think mark brought up a good example of that in having those conversations like well we don't want to be bothered with those sorts of things and and the United states it's like there's there's some issues that you know I think you're right mark in terms of\nUh uh in terms of like really can we create an alternative educational space that with contest [laughter] the sort of public school systems that you're better than generated for you know a couple of hundred years almost so um so that's that's definitely\nGoing to be difficult\nOften thank you so much for your time it was great to hear about but in the process and historical context cool well a lot of questions I was a great yeah that yeah thanks so much\nThis is the big oh always ready I was just standing you thinking about you\nWrite a song about dedicated you take a listen\nIf you didn't go back to D.C You're really not groovy maybe you feel that the the baggage just don't like being do ever think about how when you look standing in a number oh I'm In a big cost ... ... you really holding\nLow don't let me go do no good yeah no I don't well Bob low donut calling I mean big old you are\nThat that when they get they get when they get when they get you really want to thank God thank God and\nAnd

really going to be I probably would have asked a lot more questions but I wasn't\nYou know I I was shy I was only Fifteen when I met somehow so I I guess I didn't feel like that I Want it to pass or

handful of really really dedicated players who loved this very at the time\nVery eclectic music totally out of the mainstream you couldn't go to a record store at this time and by any LPs you couldn't get old records they were deleted from record company archives it was a time that the record collectors themselves\nWere canvassing door to door in the south the people that stuff and new\nAnd they would come back with a single copy of Charlie Patton lp and everybody would like\nTotally rejoicing and they would trade these records back and forth and they were very correctly a lot of them but that's what I listen to I came up listening I really grew up listening to a lot of this incredible rediscovered music\nOr the the people who actually played it playing it in person and that went for a country music and blues music\nYes so I guess you didn't have a choice in what you were going to have your life [noise]\nNo no and I didn't have any uh that you know I like I say a lot I think music

having having running away from home ... uh quitting school just running away from everything feeling totally alienated as a young teenager and a young girl having a difficult childhood\nBut then in ... the music you know it's like the music was everything in music helped me together still to this day if something happens and I of course again written about it in my book\nI Would find myself picking up the guitar and just grabbing it like help me you know and the guitar would help me and then I'd write a song and I thought wow I just went from total despair to total joy just from writing a song\nSo it really it really has this incredible healing power to music does and I mean everybody who plays it knows that and everybody who loves it listens to it knows that\nSo you know it's a it's
