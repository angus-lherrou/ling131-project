[noise]\n\nThe seizure of our political system like global corporations and just depressing\nAnd I think that we have to confront and what's before us including our failed democracy and yet rise up and resist any kind of moral imperative because we are responsible for the world that comes after and even if we ... we may fail\nBut even if we fail or at least let those will come after us and they try and if we are passing in front of the system we are complicit in what Emanuel continent called radical even\nThat's Chris Hedges and this is the alternative radio I'm David by the time you're on this edition of a our futures Chris Hedges on rise up and resist\nWomen's enough enough in the face of evil what does it take for people to move from passivity to active resistance\nThroughout history there have been instances of people defining tyranny fighting back no matter what the odds an example comes from Nazi Germany often considered the benchmark of evil opposition to the regime was highly dangerous\nSeventy five years ago hands and so the shore brother and sister and others at the University of Munich said good new enough\nThey formed the white rose movement and cold on Germans to recognize their moral duty and overthrow the government they disseminated critical information through flyers and graffiti\nThree times in so the show were arrested and beheaded their resistance and courage owner today they took risks can we\nOur guest today is Chris Hedges he's in award winning journalist who's reported from the Balkans the middle east and Central America\nHe writes a weekly column for truth the dot com is the author of many books including America the farewell tour I talked with him in the studios of KGAN you in Boulder, Colorado\nWelcome to the program consent just thank you David well why a farewell tour because this is the end of American empire a and\nOf the warning signs that exist when empires disintegrate are flashing red uh the expansion of a military machine a that is Halloween the country out from the inside\nThe erosion of civil liberties the D. industrialization of our cities the capture of our political process by a tiny cabal in this case corporate that read directs all of the institutions\nThat once made reform possible towards the further consolidation of power a and amassing of obscene amounts of wealth\nThe political system no longer functions in at least in terms of\nPropel in a society forwarded its its role in that society backwards as we enrich this tiny global financial elite and a which is largely orchestrated attacks boycott they pay little to no taxes remember Eisenhower or the wealthiest individuals\nThat's why you get programs\nNot only of austerity but debt peonage a student at one point five trillion dollars\nHousehold debts over Thirteen trillion you're late on your credit card that's twenty eight percent interest or you're going to poor communities and they're just fine to death for the most ridiculous offenses\nIncluding an obstruction on pedestrian walkway is which means standing on a sidewalk not mowing your lawn which is actually a fine in Ferguson, Missouri because with the loss of tax\nRevenue these counties and states can't fill their budgets and because that\nOligarchy elite has rendered themselves untouchable a and we can watch massive acts of fraud by Goldman Sachs or banks and nobody's held accountable than the uh the system for its pound of flesh takes it out of the most vulnerable\nIs from the symptom of something much deeper\nYeah Trump is a symptom of a political system that has seized up\nAnd doesn't work uh and that's why we're\nSeeing Trump light figures appear\nThroughout the industrialized world Viktor Orban in Hungary a night or for Roger Boris Johnson in Britain you know the polish government just destroy their legal system the sweetest elections just brought to power these are the right wing nationalist\nBecause in essence this global financial elite has seized control of national economy as we see it in Greece\nAnd it it the citizens have a lost the ability to determine both economic and political policy\nUh and so the debate has shifted in and Thatcher and Reagan were largely responsible for this it shifted a towards an assault on national identity um you know they're\nPatently absurd um but it works when you have\nCorporations controlling your media platforms and there was no rational discussion of corporate capitalism or how it works a and as we move closer towards a financial crisis and one is coming on the other one\nUh you will see that kind of language and incitement to violence which Trump has already done be ratcheted up\nWhat are the signs in the coming economic crash you mentioned that\nWell so what happened after two thousand and eight is that the banks and the global speculators received at virtually zero percent interest twenty six trillion dollars according to the University of Missouri of fabricated money out of electronic ether\nWhat they did with this money was not invest it in the society they didn't build new factories create new jobs the way of traditional capitalist structure what what they did was hoard it\nBy back their own stock that's what they did with most of the money from the tax cuts because their compensation packages are tied that's why the overheated stock market the idea that that is somehow a symbol of a healthy economy is absurd\nOr\nThey invested it and very risky ventures like fracking so\nFracking though the the value of the fracking industry is determined not by their profits in fact it's a money losing operation almost all places\nAnd they've had to borrow a tremendous amounts of money over two hundred and eighty billion to keep it going but the fracking industry has value like the dot com industry on projected profits but at a certain moment that bubble burst ah estimates are that within a couple of days\nThe stain of all now what happens this time around is that the elites don't have a plan B they can lower interest rates anymore than they've already lowered them which is virtually zero I'm In fact central bank some central banks in Europe\nWere lending money at negative interest rates would pay to borrow money\nAnd that flirt with what will be the death blow of the American empire and that is the day the dollar is no longer the world's reserve currency and why is that significant\nWell because then the dollars value collapses completely I mean it's a fictitious value as it is a but it's it's held up because it is the world's reserve currency it's remains the world's reserve currency we saw\nA ... an example of that when in the Nineteen fifties the pound sterling was dropped as the world's reserve currency\nOne of the characteristics of late empire is that it makes disastrous military\nDecisions military fiasco so ... in the the the Indian Empire the in in ancient Greece they attempted to invade Sicily their entire fleet was sunk\nAnd most of their soldiers were killed ... integrated in fifty six Great Britain attempted to invade Egypt after Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal and\nHad to retreat and humiliation and that led to the pound sterling being dropped as the world's reserve in that they were finished\nWell because he was prophetic about where we were headed and the danger of essentially allowing um celebrities entertainment to infect\nI mean what our politicians are you know like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama they're manufactured personalities there's no substance it's remember the old\nYou want to have a beer with I mean this is insane but ... they're very skillful the public relations industry which was arguably one of the most evil industries in America and making us confuse how we are made to feel with knowledge\nAnd that manipulation now courtesy of handheld devices just goes on twenty four hours a day or and we are uh I think\nIs a\nForce dean wrote that probably the most illusions society in human history meanwhile we are being impoverished stripped of our civil liberties or have amassed\nAn oligarchy ... elite that you know rivals not that existed I mean I think is great interest in terms of income inequality is worse than what took place under the gilded age and you can't maintain a democracy in an oligarchy that isn't a particularly sophisticated\nPolitical thought Aristotle a elaborated on that to some three thousand years ago\nWho didn't Louis Brandeis the Supreme Court justice say you can have a you can have the two things you can have a democracy where you can have great concentrations of wealth that you can't have both\nRight and Aristotle said that you know when you have that income inequality than you're only two choices are chairing a revolution\nLet's go back to grab see again because you write in your book that he would have this spared of the divide in the United states between ... and you make a left and the working class\nWell\nSo I mean we had radical union movements the ... the old CIO the old United mine workers and that in the name of anti communism or the ...\nIs written some good books on this which were ... there was stuff she wrote she's a historian on that period that I didn't know I mean that that it didn't it wasn't just the\nHollywood writers and Pete Seeger and\nDome trombone or by the FBI was going into high schools with lists of quote unquote reds with no evidence or and then these teachers were fired and blacklisted they couldn't work again it really is at the all through the layers of society\nThey were purging people with a social conscience critics of capitalism\nThe effects of that were quite devastating\nUm we saw a rise of movements in the Nineteen sixties and then this contemporary ferocious assault\nA which began in the early seventies and Lewis Powell memo uh attack on the free enterprise system is kind of the blueprint for that Nineteen Seventy one Nineteen Seventy one and so\nFrom that point on word labor unions were decimated and we just saw with these so called right to work laws a further attack on unions only six percent now of\nThe American workforce in the private sector is unionized at all\nBut with the right to work law employers can't even make contracts with unions are it it really expands the ability of employers to hire exclusively non union labor and so this re configuration of American society a is one\nWhere we have been left virtually defenseless as these forces role forward and and you know as Carl pull Yani rights and the great transformation\nA unfettered unregulated capitalism is ultimately a destructive and a self destructive force because it can modifies everything we haven't even spoken about climate change it it commodity\nAnd and there's no constraints anymore uh and and part of the ... I think what all of us who read climate change report sphere\nOr is that these elites are are utterly and capable of responding rationally to the greatest existential threat to face the human\nSpecies or it isn't just Trump I mean yeah trumps the climate deniers but the whole\nMonitor that we can somehow adapt or the Paris climate accord which are nonbinding a you know limits on carbon emissions I mean all of this fails to confront the gravity of of what's before us\nThe question always comes up though these corporate managers they know the science then getting reports you know accurate information and they have children and grandchildren so how can they be acting in ways that are endangering on their own families\nWell because in order to become the c._e._o. BP um you probably have to have a psychopathic personality um these are not I I went to school with him I unfortunately I was shipped off to exclusive boarding school at the age of ten where is that New England eagle broken and women's\nUh on scholarship so I grew up with these people uh you know I went to school with Louis Scooter Libby I Know who they are I Know ... I went to I Know them all and they are a incredibly entitled incredibly narcissistic\nUm they believe that their wealth will protect them\nAnd\nThey are in gauging in behavior that in the short term makes them wealthier and more powerful and I don't think they see beyond it you know by the time you reached that level you are so\nThe vetting process where those who rise within the New York times or any corporation do so because they exhibit\nA loyalty to the institution not to the individuals who work for it or the individuals that are exploited by it and that is a very distorted personality but institutions\nAre quite good at selecting those who who will Neal before its alter\nAnd you know and I come out a seminary I mean that it is a form of idle a tree and we were taught in seminary that the danger of idols is not just that it demands human sacrifice but in the end it ... it demands self sacrifice that your finally\nSlaughtered on the altar and that's precisely what's happening they they think they're going to a scape it I mean you've got these Silicon Valley millionaires buying empty missile silos and the mid west where they think they're gonna\n... I can tell them from covering the former Yugoslavia that the people who rule when society breaks down or those who have the guns are and their body guards are not going to sit around and take orders from them once society disintegrates\nYou're listening to Chris Hedges on rise up and resist\nThis is independent alternative radio you can order copies of this program and the Hedges book America the farewell tour\nBy calling one eight hundred triple for one nine seven seven\nThat's one eight hundred for for for one nine seven seven or you can order online on our website alternative radio dot org that alternative radio dot O. R. G.\nListening to W E s U eighty eight point one FM Middletown WB issue is supported by Wesleyan University Center for the arts presenting a ...\nFull of Indian music and dance this Friday Tobar twelfth that eight PM and crawl concert hall accompanied by percussionist David Nelson and joined by by ... not tickets and information at age six zero six eight five three three five five or Wesleyan dot edu slashed the FAA\nThat's what's your diet I don't know what I said I made a few changes to our daytime schedule in an effort to bring listeners are diverse daytime talk radio programs sooner than later listen for some of your favorite with the Pacific programs at nine AM and two PM and don't miss rising up\nSo now they have this new time when the right after democracy how you can find a fall program on line that W E s U FM dot org where you can also find two weeks of archived programs to catch up on any shows us\nI Want to draw a little bit on your studies of the Christian evangelical right in the United states you you wrote a book called American fascism the Christian right in the war\nOn America large numbers of evangelical Christians in in this country are on nationalist and servants believers in capitalism eighty one percent of them voted in the two thousand sixteen presidential election\nYou are a unaware of the wisdom of the past uh and that means you're very easily manipulated by a very malicious powers\nWe were talking about a Christian event you know the goals and magical thinking the question always comes up is how do you reach people what vocabulary do you deploy to uh try to persuade people that to him too is indeed for and not five\nBut who are convinced that it's five you can't the says you give up your walk away you don't\nGive up I mean so you know it was interesting I mean even when after my book on the Christian right came out there were people I wrote about I'm In the book was called American Fascists but I wrote about the average person in a moment with great empathy\nBecause they're suffering was real and because I I felt compassion for what they went through um no\nI think it's economic I I think that if they're if they're social bonds are not recreate\nAs to shatter their peculiar world view is to leave them out early bereft of any foundation by which they continue to exist\nAnd so I think we have to organize around for instance\nYou know raising the minimum wage to Fifteen or twenty dollars a we have to organize around universal healthcare we have to organize around issues that dramatically improve their lives are and that means building alliances with people in our communities whose\nPeculiar world views may be different and even repugnant to ours um but no I've spent a lot of time with these people and ... you're just not going to ... I mean the the whole I took a creation a seminar and so this was a class for\nA teachers and Christian schools how to teach creationism\nAnd then the instructor had to confront the fact that uh\nYou know the world is created in the first day of the lights not created till the fourth day so what do you tell the students while you tell the students that God created a temporary like I mean it's all in the details it's ridiculous it's not in the Bible it's completely fabricated\nBut it shows you how disconnected their ideology is from reality and that's just you know on every single level\nOn a whole range of a public issues from a protecting environment to universal healthcare to having tuition free colleges and universities these are all according to polls including one commissioned by the Koch brothers majority Terry in rye use yet\nThe political class does not move forward on them why not\nBecause we don't count because we're all people know legislation we know statistically I mean legislation and laws are written by corporate lobbyists and we'd been utterly distant power we've we live and what Sheldon\n... a scene that goes to stop all and death camps well\nAnd it's not a a Hitler Mussolini I mean I don't think Trump has reached that point so you have the facade it's like the late Roman Republic you have the facade of the republic but\nInternally corporations have seized all of the levers of power to render the citizen it but at a really it doesn't matter I mean it doesn't matter cabin uh commits\nPerjury I mean there's not no question he goes right on to the Supreme Court I mean it's remarkable uh the laws don't matter or at least for the rich uh and then you have\nA criminalization of poverty\nUh so you know mowing their lawn\nOr not mowing your lawn or standing on a sidewalk which means obstructing pedestrian traffic or a having an open container your find in jail why because these county and state governments\nBecause nobody pays taxes and under eyes and how the wealthiest corporations and and uh individuals' paid Ninety One percent\nTax or they don't have any revenue so they're they can't get it from corporations because their\nImmune so you take it from the vulnerable so the pressure on the poor and the working poor is just getting worse and worse and worse and worse and there were powerless to do anything about it because the system whether it's the Democrats the Republicans the established elites\nAre beholden to corporate money\nGrump she used to say and it's often quoted by Edward ... and ... and others and saying that he had pessimism of the intellect and optimism of the will or is this something that appeals to\nYes because I mean people say well you know it's so bleak it's so depressing well it's bleak and depressing um\nPlease stop all carbon emissions today which were not doing we would still suffer catastrophic climate change\nAnd one of the reasons that climate scientists are so terrified of going beyond two degrees Celsius in terms of global warming is that they know from study and other planets like Venus which ones had water and now is eight hundred degrees that it triggers feedback loops which you can't control there is nothing you can do that\nAnd they've run mathematical scenarios on those loops that range from Seventy percent die off of the human species to complete extinction\nLots bleak and it's depressing um the seizure of our political system by corporate power global corporations are is depressing\nAh you know the fact that sixteen million hungry children go to bed and America every night is depressing as if the fact that we have to point three million prisoners twenty five percent of the world's prison population over half of whom were never charged with physically harming anyone is depressing\nAnd I think that we have to confront what's before us including our failed democracy\nAnd yet rise up and resist any way that it's a kind of moral imperative because we are responsible for the world that comes after us and even if we fail and we may fail but even if we fail at least let those will come after us say they tried a and if we are passive\nIn front of the system we are complicit in what Emanuel conned would call radical evil\nIn Nineteen eighty eight the NASA scientists James Hansen I went to Capitol Hill and for the first time\nI talked about a clue what was happening with the climate to so and increasing warming of the earth's temperature and the potential dangers that that may pose a down the line well here we are Thirty years later\nWith the U.S pulling out of the Paris climate agreement accord\nWell climate change was first identified as a problem in Nineteen oh five\nNineteen sixty five right\nNo Nineteen ... o fun yes it was a scientist I'm In Europe I forget from Sweden or somewhere down a fight it\nUh but then you had acts on their scientist in the seventies understood the nature of global warming edits danger so it's we've known for a long time the elites have certainly no uh but unfortunately they chose their own\nPersonal profit and the prophet of their corporations over human life uh and that's why I don't hold out any hope for the elites I mean we have to remove this system from power\nA we have to overthrow the corporate state and that comes through mass acts of sustained nonviolent civil disobedience such as we saw an Standing Rock such as I saw on East Germany Czechoslovakia Romania or we're finished and we don't have much time left\nI used to live with the recent example of arming effort yeah that's quite a story here you had this really ... ... ... ... ... ah that was literally a overthrown by hundreds of thousands of people in the streets shut\nDown because what happened in East Germany I mean I was in Alexander plots was half a million East Germans and the ... state was the most efficient security and surveillance state in human history into our own\nThis is the uh twenty fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords which Edward side denounces Palestinian verse sigh\nA since then the possibilities of an independent viable Palestinian state has receded under both Republican and democratic administrations what'd you see in terms of the future for the Palestinians and for the region as a whole\nWorried about it um that movement has gained a fair bit of traction in Europe um they are seeking the Israeli lobby to criminalize it here in the United states or I mean we talk about Russian interference in the elections how 'bout Israeli interference in the elections I mean they literally a pack give them money to candidates and\nUh obviously the assault is worse and worse especially cutting off funding us funding unreal\nThe un relief agency that\nProvides food I mean most people in Gaza depend at this point they live in the largest open air prison in the world\nOr don't have access I mean Israel has bombed the sewage treatment plant so the whole coast of Gaza is filled with raw sewage they bombed the power plants a of Ninety eight percent of the water is you can't drink\nWe're nearing\n\n... or the ... or ... who\nAre gay or a beach or ...\nOr ... or be

songs at ... ... what does that mean that there was one of the great composers the south Indian music lived in from the middle of the uh Eighteen the middle of nineteenth century\nAnd or at least is considered the s philosophically the deepest of the mall is is a song texts or\nDeep and very very multi layered in fact I was writing an article for the Garland encyclopedia of world music a number of years ago and I wanted to you\n[laughter] well I always I always say it was natural for me to take on them are done because my dad was such a great player as it that's a complete joke because [laughter] I before I went to India is a junior in college I had never heard this music I didn't know anything I couldn't when I went to the first concert\nI couldn't even tell where the songs began and then did I had no clue what was going on but\nUm no he can do\nI once in a while [laughter] um so they put me with a teacher\nRan roughshod over me for for about nine months and I had never actually been treated like that by any music teachers in my entire life so I really took to it when I came back here the interesting thing was he said until you can come back\nYou should go to Middletown, Connecticut where my students brother Romney dragon is teaching\nSo I got back to college and I had a senior thesis quarter coming up\nSo I came to Middletown and by that time the singing teacher I had in moderate was also here ... so I worked with them for that quarter and then I went back and finished school and came back and uh I'm going to tell the story just 'cause I enjoy it so much I\nAh came back in after a while\nApplied to the MA program which was MA in world music at that time\nAnd got turned down [laughter]\nWhich turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me because I'm meanwhile I had hooked up with\nUm deepest Fernando ... who ended up being here both until they died\nAnd I was then I was so long ago for Thirteen Years after that and that's in ... so I replied as a PHD candidate a few years later after getting my MA somewhere else and of course got accepted\n[laughter] that is where I Know I Know and now I\nHave a future immunity to farm and it was a man can you tell me a little bit of your students and how how they are approaching and review it comes to whether we are in already with a history or\nWell after that we're going in love with me it's much better that way yeah\nAnd a ... you know the great thing about listening to science you know sometimes a um even though they're they don't understand so they pay attention so that that's a you know ... ah especially this music as a lot of uh you know I'm a\nTemporary Sherman says or a decorated a a melody moment um that's not easy to even for the Indians so when I'm when I studied with the TV show nothing here or I mean in India back in India\nHe taught to how to approach the melodic moment in kinetic music of course I was learning with a menu dishes but ah she showed how to approach the financial aspects of a kinetic music\nAnd uh which helped me now I'm I'm I'm I'm working with my students it's amazing so because he showed us how to write an audition for the you know his way of teaching for non Indian so I took that from him and then now I'm using the same thing\nUh I think a ... a couple of years back I took our students to perform at a different venues like got to live and New Jersey\nAnd then a a you know the Indian people they really amazed with the performances are\nAnd I know David you have a you have a book about and another one on the way I'm not a new book on the way the first one is so good to menu real and what's the what's the new ...\nWell ... well the new book is an extension of that into more advanced material but the interesting thing about this is that all our um drumming is taught by means of spoken syllables so when you learn you learn a pattern you learn first\nIn India you learn it in the course of your training and and singers have a vocabulary of of\nRhythm syllables and dancers have a vocabulary a rhythm syllables drummers ever vocabulary this we all have this we'll use it all the time it's our notation\nRight so we don't write things down we learn it in our body you learn to speak it and cut it with the taller and you get the beauty of that is that it's real time ... so you you cannot fool yourself\nThe minute you got to get off you feel it as physical discomfort and it's it's a wonderful thing so\nIn India they don't teach the spoken stuff's separately from the instruments and some genius here at Wesleyan University back in the\nDay I have no I don't know exactly when it started but it was well in place by the time I was around\nIn a ... let's say early seventies they were teaching silica to as a as a stand alone course and I realized that the genius this immediately because what it means that you can communicate the uh\nThe theory is a practice all the concept to do with the behavior in in the ... and the music rhythmically\nTo people who don't have to struggle with an instrument they can go play it on the guitar or the piano or whatever they want to do or use it in composition and they sure do so um I over the years kind of have devised ways of approaching the material that\nDoesn't dilute the Indian ness of it in other words we don't use we don't use notation western notation we don't use equivalent like referring to are different um pulse rate\nThe way they're supposed to be learned and and it's it's just wonderful\nIt's fascinating fascinating way to approach music\nI'm sure not to miss the concert by these two masters fried eggs over twelve\nAnd eight PM and crawl concert hall is part of the forty second anyone out Roger festival the sort of other events that we can I wanted to
