W E s UFM noncommercial which the supported Pacific gets really radio I'm your host a commander early on whether you every Sunday Morning\nFrom eleven thirty two one oh so you can check out our Facebook\nA extra command group we have over five thousand members there\nAnd my global website which I'll be checking before I leave today a we have a global website over a hundred Thirteen nations represented of white workers connected with the extra command it's a very good site and I've been doing that for two thousand two thousand nine\nIf you do joined the fight or want to you must go up to spiritual question\nWould direct answers to them and so I Know you're a human being and not abide or some spammer and that you know and are connected with the extra command so uh you can do that then I'll review your application online\n... you'll be a member and you can share your spiritual white with our our members from all over the world All right so that's pretty much my deal and we'll be back in just a few minutes\n[noise] [noise]\nOh\n\nOh oh\n\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nNew\n\n\n\nUh\nI'm a\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm a\n[noise]\nUh no\nSo um\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNa\n\nNa\nNa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n... what they were doing was the most amazing developments of their life when in fact it was just the opposite what they thought it was amazing was something that can destroy and annihilate the planet\nEarth nothing amazing about that\nAnd on this show cosmic I asked her command radio and we are asked her command radio one hundred thousand percent we know that there are nations on earth that still have these weapons\nA lot of the you call superpowers still have these weapons they must be dismantled destroyed and the medals recycled if possible\nBut these weapons must be demolished\nNo citizen of your planet should accept anything less no matter where you are everybody on this planet every human being that exist on this planet\nNeeds to stay clearly their intent that old weapons of destruction must be destroyed the production of these weapons must be stopped\nThe production of nuclear missiles and nuclear submarines must be halted the only reason why they produce these nuclear submarines on your planet is to provide jobs\nFor those people that need work that part of it there might be other reasons\nBut there must be it at an addiction to producing things that can kill life on earth that addiction must stop\nHave a defense to create peace if that defense produces weapons to destroy the planet no matter what country are you living on earth\nYou understand this to be true so this is our message from the command like I said we were monitoring this report the other day\nAnd they asked ... turn the command what should I say about this and very clearly it was David your state the commands position on any planet specifically this one in terms of weapons of mass destruction\nVietnam nuclear nuclear be it whatever it is to destroy somebody\nNapalm\nBig bombs it makes no difference things that kill life or against the very universal laws of the truck command so there's no arguing with the command on that point it's been universal but not just for planet earth\nII minds and emotions this has been the universal offer no matter what planet it is this is the law and the earth was quarantine\nBecause it broke the universal law of peace millions of years ago that's why the planet\nWas quarantined the ... going against the universal law\nBeing given the opportunity to live in peace but egos in power and less for power by the creation of man on this earth lead to these wars these lower vibration of frequencies\n\nThen again came back in\nDuring the time of the development of the nuclear weapons\nThe testing of those weapons in Nevada the Cold War brought back in those of the white beings\nTo prevent this planet for being annihilated you won't hear that on the news on the nightly news they won't talk about it\nBut it's true don't we talk about the future of this planet the future and well being of the earth\nWe are talking about each and every\nOne of view around the world participating in world peace in a world in which you your children and your children's children\nMay survive thrive and enjoy the fruit of creation that creation that God gave every planet in this universe and every other universe beyond this one every solar system\nEvery galaxy everywhere in the multi worse that creation the opportunity to live in harmony with each other\nAnd to live in harmony is to not live in a lower frequency of hate fear misunderstanding of one another\nIt's to come together and start to relate to each other no matter whether you're speaking English or no English or whatever language you speak\nThe commonalities more clearer than the differences so if someone has a family in Russia or what you call the United states\nRich culture might be different on the planet but the one thing that brings people together is the need to have connection\nThere are those in power that play the citizens of this planet like porn meaning\nWhen they if you are a human porn they play people and put them against each other to create conflict which creates wealth and money for those people that have all the money over the planet those\nFamilies those people that would have billions and billions of dollars or more\nAnd this is and you're the chess game to look at you as a worldwide chess game and those that pull the strings tried to pit people against each other because it makes the money on this planet the more you get pitted against each other\nThe more fear you have the more money they make\nFrom an ... perspective when you let go of all of that stuff than you are awakened\nYou realize wait a minute I've been had for many many years but now I'm In the wake in Seoul cosmic soul and now [noise] and now I'm not going to live this way I'm going to love my brothers and sisters\nI'm going to treat people would respect I'm going to love my family my biological family my children my wife my husband and my boyfriend girlfriend whatever it might be\n\nAnd I'm going to want to live on a planet that sustainable so to have a sustainable planet again the command says to the leader\nYou do away with the treaty on these missiles is a wrong decision and what publicly dating it in a very universal cosmic way\nThat you understand we don't care about people's politics\nWho they support this is about your plan it\nThis is about world peace this is about standing up peacefully and saying no we used to listen to the planet disagree all weapons must be destroyed or missiles must be destroyed\nAll factories that produced missiles must be transformed into useful purposes of peaceful production whatever that is so that's our message from the command and they wanted me to share that this morning\nI Hope it resonates with all of you out there and it was important to share that with each and every one of you\nAnd coming up about twelve Fifteen as I said we did a Twitter tweet on Twitter that we want to hear from you regarding your UFO sightings from childhood are currently\nA share your stories as much as you can remember a few ... of the journal of what you've seen or you videotaped anything over the years are currently or took pictures we want to know about your sightings you can also send me\nOr you can actually actually message me on Facebook or would you er messages under commander rally on where you can email me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nAnd we're back would you hear on the ... so may be in the music higher dimensional downs on the ... with the cosmic I asked her green radio show on every Sunday Morning eleven thirty he'll one PM followed by a loving seventies ... coming up after\nAnd we're about well when he flies in the afternoon\nTo have had a UFO encounters a sightings or could be an old one from when you were a kid that you remember that you kept a note of you could have something that currently happened that we don't know about so we want to hear\nFrom people all over the place the number one eight six zero six states five seven seven zero zero will you with those numbers again one of the out of the area eight six zero sticks say five Seventy seven hundred if you're out of the country dial zero one one\nThat's due oh one one eight six zero six eight five Seventy seven hundred for a worldwide listenership at W. years two of them died or\nSo I'm getting a we're going to do a segment here where we hear from you on your sightings are also I posted on Facebook\nFor those that had actual encounters when I say encounters with ash char encounters would being from the asked her command in your life if you've been around a long time and you had those encounters maybe you were part of\nA the contact the moving in the early days you're still alive you have some stories you can share regarding that we love to hear from the old timers of the contact the movement\nAnd or just people today around the world to have been having fighting they've never talked about never did report on any of the UFO reporting ...\nThis is your time to share your stories I Know you're out there and I know there are people that have had sightings there's no way\nIn this modern day and age and no one has not seen something they couldn't explain in the skies above a now again noting the difference between a the a regular conventional aircraft which has plenty of that\nA U.S air force than the modern technology they use uh the stealth technology just with protests\nYour stories regarding any old time stories of your own experience is not somebody else but your own experiences maybe you had a fighting this week somewhere in the world and you're just not thought about talking about it or why the times the mind they'll tell you well yeah well it doesn't really matter I saw something but I don't know what it is\nBelieve it or not that's important if you saw something and you can explain it but you might says that don't worry about it\nYou still remember what happened we want to hear that story you might have seen something Going Radical in the sky and went on for about a couple of minutes and they'll put it disappeared you might have seen something extraordinary which is an actual thing you can say was a spaceship\nAnd it was flying at night or two in the morning or something but yet you didn't want to tell anybody about it because we're afraid of ridicule on this show Cosby car radio as strict commend radio worldwide\nWe will not ridicule you for sharing your story cheer unlike some other media outlets are that I Know of\nSo you know you have the ability so many of you to share your experiences\nAnd we live in a society where people have been programmed to believe that if they talk about these things they're going to be ridiculed\nI mean twenty Thirty years ago most likely\nLess should be now because we are more advanced in knowledge that uh things exist or beyond our control\nAnd even when they did a polling on national polls about the subject over eighty five percent of the people believe that there's life in the universe eighty five percent that was probably less than ten years ago that report was done\nSo when you look at the development of human consciousness and our ability to understand the cosmos and understand other reality to where we live it's you know it's an amazing thing where we've come from\nThe movement would meet in shrine rock those folks there most of them are even live anymore those folks would generally write journals of their experiences they actually had human beings to other planets come to them to go on their ships you know to bring messages back to earth and they wrote books about the many of these books\nAre kind of out of print but you can find them and I know most of the more it for the most part uh you know colonel Wendell Stevens\nWho's no longer around he wrote books about these are extraterrestrial people\nOr many of his books rather print but he wrote a book of people that had encountered in the contact the movement days with people from other world that word van that had not just technology but we're advance spiritually it's pretty amazing all this stuff you know if you take it out\nAnd we're here to blow your mind in terms of getting it to just go that extra mile and seek out those things even the out of print books if you can find them\nRead some of the history of some of these people that are no longer around from the contact the days\nBut you are the current contact ... when I say that you might have had that five minute UFO experience in Connecticut or somewhere in the er Alps or somewhere in Asia or wherever it is\nSo I Know with all the listeners out there and there are many many of you that don't call in you've had your folks for instance the question is why not just sheer feel comfortable\nWe're going to get into you oppose sightings and again if you feel that you want to\nShare your reports would that's a now in the future weeks we will be happy to to hear those reports so let's get in here and we'll start off with some of the things we're seeing\nThat are happening\nOr will start if you switch sightings daily one of my favorite areas to\nBring you some of the G ports are that are happening so let's go to that detract could be setting daily should be in here somewhere\nWe just had it up to minute ago so let's get out of this thing\nLet's\nAnd check out some of the reports that are from your first sightings daily and that's Scott Warren's a website warnings website\nAnd here's some of the interesting things here it says ah this is interesting and this is probably more of a theory I think\nA earth sun ... E. R. I. T. one Ninety five cameras filter so NASA has a camera that does video and photos of the sun and everything so\nIt's saying here according to this report there's a huge hole building up at the northern polar region of earth sun right now as you see it's about four hundred that the damage or earth\nI Do often suspect that our own son might be hollow that at the center for our son there are many may be a large planet full of intelligent alien species harnessing the sun's energy\nThis is only a theory of this dark opening may be them about to move something big through maybe even the planet itself\nI caught the hollow stunned theory again it's a theory and we're not claiming to this to be true\nUh and it makes a lot of sense instead of the dice in ... a year built around the sun the sun and it's been dead squeezed until Halloween using energy field\nWhich alien then place their planet or planet space station and such within this to do it again the theory of cereal a serial energies got the warning and that's one theory and he's created a you know interesting or subject on that theory\nWhether it's true or not or that remains open a black you off over Mexico City court during day strolling passed over Fifteen\nWhen a worker came outside for his break\nThe UFO tilted some as it moved which is what many UFOs do in order to control their direction just said he had such a bad camera looks like he is using an old phone to record it had it been an iPhone seven or eight this radio would be that defended proof of existence of the tea\nI spend those that there is a blurry field around it just a thousand your view of her reports also described and that's pretty much the energy field of space craft\nBut the person to take some video footage of it and I'm according to this I'm not sure how this is going to be actually\nEven proven\nShe captured sixty years ago by the U.S military is still a prisoner today forced to work for them October twenty teens video\nAnd let's see here is what happened when real footage was leaked into the private sector and goes unnoticed for years but uh then loads of fakes begin uploading to YouTube for\n... cents cash do we continue to ignore the real videos and label them as fake or to give us a clear conscience or hell no it does here this is real real a roar footage from years back\nThe video was uploaded more than nine years ago at a time when I was he said five in Taiwan top ten list on YouTube back when they were not a thing\nOr three years ago before you die pie existed on YouTube time when people didn't upload fakes for cash\nA this is real footage of a ET probably the gray from Roswell New Mexico crash when all but one alien or he was killed the last one curled up injured scared and found by US Army soldiers sure that\nThey are in their own environment it looks like this is that same one from the crash waiting time out waiting a because time for ... minutes compared to time for us it may be thousands or millions of years old\nSo what's a few decades as a prisoner of the U.S military until it finds a way to escape\nBy the way last alpha Los Alamos labs Thirteen eight samples from it and clone day hold true for those grades to do work for the military in an underground based\nAnd wonder how is the first note this five kilometers below Los Alamos labs it's time to remember the truth watch the video below I was just got a warrant wearing a mentioning this so I'm not sure where he's getting that information\nOr again\nWhat is the sorts of the information um but it's possible and um earth sized us lower spaceship return to distant from the NAFTA so whole link October sixteenth\nUm some interesting stuff happening there [noise]\nA lot with the sun this she's really focused on that total shutdown of space what are they hiding by secure tend team October Eighteenth or killed over twenty a coke pretense twenty Eighteen video you'll frustrating news\nAnd ah there's a whole story about that and that's the cover up UFOs or a spaceships appeared in the sky of\nWhole hot Inner Mongolia Beijing\nThat says here October twenty Eighteen and as a pitcher with a video and it shows that are that it appeared in the sky of I think it's ... hot Inner Mongolia many onlookers took out the mobile phones and called them\nEr during the same period and it appeared\nFor the second time every second time this is actually happen\nAnd now let's see if we have any other interesting stuff from that area and that would be primarily yet ah let's see here now this is interesting it says the October tenth amazing\nA spaceship or your phone your trees that drilling city taxes like over twenty Eighteen video UFO citing news\nIt says here this is interesting um incredible spaceship would windows just it's interesting you know let me read this report which says I won't get one thirty in the morning shut the windows\nAnd this large your photo was getting close to the trees about sixty meters away I grab my camera put it on the stand and was able to get to more photos where they two seconds exposure\nOr it with the with the object up fantastic clear shot\nAnd the person has a a a video they created that they took of this fighting\nOr the ... they added photos to the video and it looks sort of like a plasma color like a green\nThey're saying that there was a windows in it and I'm looking at the photos now so we'll have to share that with some people and get their perspective\nYou first writing daily on that one and uh he's got a lot of other your for reports um [noise] and I'll share the last one we're coming up to about ten minutes before one white glowing a spaceship cited overland thing Illinois October first\nAnd there's also video footage of this happening\nAccording to witness the location is is you miss ...\nWas uh Illinois\n[laughter] the report shows something else saying was in Japan so let me take a look at this for a minute yeah lancing

a report in October first it says here\nAnd this doesn't make much sense that was a fishing village let's take a look at the video and see if this was actually a village it looks like it\nIt could be a in the United states and like the yeah it looks like it is a\nA U.S report and someone's got a video footage of it and that looks to be the U.S so it says a\n\nOn a report in the video I think it's

[noise] an all out of all evil\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] right\nI was over rule so we didn't include banana splits we didn't include HR possibly stuff that was purely cartoon until we get to the nineties [noise] because I think we both agreed that the ... playhouse deserved to a place in the book so we do have that but um you know otherwise uh\nUh it's it's purely cartoon but the other thing that we do to real quick is that we you know as much of the cartoons were part of the experience of the centerpiece of the experience\nIt was the commercials as well\nSo what we've done is we punctuated throughout each chapter I'm a commercial break\nSo for like for instance in the sixties we have a battleship in alphabet cereal and then like bright in life cereal and smash up derby set in the seventies and the cabbage patch dolls it'd be eighty\nNothing and so on and so forth so we really want\nBack glorious time on a Saturday morning\nAnd you do that uh there's there's as you say the uh the advertisements in there that you wouldn't normally see in a book of this nature um I don't know if it's so different because you really just just dive in with both feet\nSo there's going to add and then like you said at the uh the smash up derby which completely flummoxed me 'cause I I remember seeing that I never got it I always wanted it [laughter] but again it's one of the many things that I never I I got a sweat how have you been in couch\nTime because of that I'm just curious\n[laughter] ... my the Thursday night or damaged [laughter]\nI have a three year old and I tried I and I started in the book in a day and I was showing the um the commercials I was talking about for the national Germany and my son's eyes but if you just wait a second you can smash cars he got hurt or think ... is that avail he didn't say they want it you could tell he wanted that toy\nI mean it's been this country and I think for decades but maybe somebody should bring bring that back\nAnd they're bringing everything out there might as well it definitely has the effect on your ... on your mind at that age because I can still see I can still sing tunes to\nCartoon theme songs I haven't seen in Thirty years I still remember the theme songs you know what I mean like ... to ... the magic you know like gummy bears I'll I'll always remember that they're bouncing here there and everywhere I haven't yeah in that I was like seven years old but I I Will never forget it because it was a time in my life that\nI mean really like like we're talking about what this book does this is\nThis book is um I guess you could say an anti bummer I mean this book is only good news you might get men I meant to make you feel the best you felt probably at any point in your life well I I don't remember the commercial for the for the Encyclopedia Britannica I just don't like it was a little blind to the classes if I remember correctly\nYeah through the nerdy guy already got yeah\nYou know that that every kid it from the nominees would like to have you know the stereo a massive computer city where but he didn't have the Encyclopedia Britannica set to finish his paper yup\nI remember those I I just don't remember that I don't I I think there's about six or seven your age gap between me and John and its times like this that it's really it's really a parent to match up derby I Know you're talking about oh that was that was just something special\nI was like five years old and was great yeah I have no clue that I grew up a on a journey quest will laugh rooted prepared but I've never ever forgotten that I still think it's the best animated she'll ever produced so about\nJohnny Quest it what what what I found really surprising is and this is this was\nYou know like ... because people you know they can get pretty critical about what we didn't include and you know I'd never mind it being criticized for what we don't include because we can't include everything but if you can take issue with what does get included then of course that you know that's a concern but with Johnny Quest\nThink about the impact that that show is head and they only did twenty four regional episode was only one one season it but yes he had to really stood the test of time and I think it had to do with what the\nThe essence of what that show was all about and the fact that they were so inspired by\nThe uh action adventures of the old radio cereals jak Armstrong the all American Boy and this sort of thing and that was the idea was to create this um this sort of saw a ... you know animated adventure series and and it was the first of its kind\nIt was weird and also do you think about it and I'm saying that they show like space does enjoy seeing the Pussycats there weren't that many seasons to both of those shows me jokes because that's only had two seasons\nIt's basically said one but if you look at the the uh the how far it has affected pop culture I mean there was that um that spoofing space go show 'em from coast to coast you ever does\nThat show and crisscross wasn't even on that long\nI think I think that part of the uh effect of that day and age too like for shows like that is stuff like the u._s._a. cartoon expressed where they they have shows like that and even though there was one season they ran it for nine years will ever do you\nRun for ... in the in the days of syndication everything was re ruined everything was everywhere\nSo you you well Bugs Bunny the perfect example of that exact yeah they ... they really ran Bugs Bunny\nSport ever um you know it's it's probably one of the few cartoons like it's the only one in our in our book that really does span almost four decades\nBut couldn't resist it and talk about a memorable tune is is is a you know when\nThey had the uh the review and the all of the ... and all of the characters with march out onto the stage\nUm to that to that song a lots of memorable songs and and are talking about that you know the Jetsons in the ... stone songs they're using that in a in a radio ad today yeah\nSo it's uh it's amazing the impact that those um [noise] it it and the emotion that they vote the way they would obviously they wouldn't be using them in a in contemporary ads today if they didn't vote that missed allergic feeling\nWell I I certainly a ... in some of the detail work that you put into it the uh the\nSeasons produce the episodes produced um I had no idea that the pink panther went on for as long as it actually did I had no idea [laughter] no long was nine years I think the nine year round of well over a hundred episodes\nBut it's just it's unusual I didn't know that\nI didn't know that and the thing that about pink panther I think to support it's surprising but is there there was ... nowadays the new version is a this is talk on the show but in the original one they only had one I think a doubt peak for pink I may be wrong about that\nThe paint panther would mesmerized audiences and no talking at all\nAnd I love the ... yard mark a sub subplot stories that they had in in a in a pink panther shows I don't know if you've ever\nSo those you know I I actually I think I watched the pink panther occasionally but I don't really I'm more familiar with the movies you know I I Know the character from the movies my employer I watched it gets into that really oh Cousteau ... a net\nSo the question I had before uh and we're obviously going to get ... they were going to stay in in in the great time period but this is just something I Do not know as an adult and two dogs need team are there still Saturday morning cartoons\nNo they're not I mean what I mean there may be something a higher Mandela had a really good caught about this if you say to a kid and you say or do you watch Saturday morning cartoons they look at look at you\nAnd they said well yeah I watch cartoons on Saturday in one then Tuesday Monday in a sense I I assume that there are skilled cartoons going on of course you have\nWhole networks devoted to ... to suggest cartoon programming at this point and then if you go on YouTube you can watch anything but as for the whole phenomenon we're talking about when you wake up early in the morning and your experiences for discrete amount of time and then ... you know then it goes into wrestling them that that doesn't exist anymore that died out\nPretty much the late nineties there were some stragglers at the end or going into the two thousand foot because of the Internet\nAnd because of you know changes in the networks really ended I mean our book we view the golden era ... ending in the nineties\nRight okay that ends with a sinking in the brain it's a it's a last ah yeah\nI was thinking it would rain Saturday morning well see that's that's the thing that we were talking about before\nGot you guys in the air is that a lot of the a lot of the shows that are in the book for us around here and in the Connecticut area or afternoon a fair only they didn't put them on Saturday mornings I GI Joe the transformers um\nThree o'clock on a Monday through friday right we we didn't get\nThem on Saturday morning specifically like I guess other other markets in in areas did\nA Saturday morning to me it was always more like transformers GI Joe stuff that's like considered like the ... more action is a Africa in school I Know yeah this is the robo type stuff like that for me to try to be morning was usually the Scooby Doo the goofy or fear though the city or fair right go funding agrees with them for the most part\nLike the show with what dark matter dark you know that translated to the ... of the er the afternoons so they would they would indicate is seen as soon as you turtles I watch them in the afternoon secret GI Joe when I was my parents actually my mom wouldn't let me watch GI Joe she thought it was to violence you know I did actually no one
