instances of people pushing back in ... on your call\nCounter movement the counter movement to social movement of people who do not accept what capitalism is doing to them and they push back if\nYou want to change the system we're going to have to understand how capitalism works it's not just about surviving with it\n[noise] that's Eric ... the maintenance and this is the alternative radio I'm David ... army on this edition of a A R features Eric whole team members on pushing back the corporate food regime\nFood is the basis of life we needed to live it's as simple as that the un declares the right to adequate food is a long standing international human rights\nBut the aim of twenty first century capitalism is not primarily to promote our wellbeing and health it is to control markets and maximize profits\nThe production of food is a gigantic global enterprise dominated by a handful of mega corporations General Mills Pepsi nationally Unilever and Coca Cola\nWhile they do well hunger and food insecurity affects billions of people around the world including tens of millions in the United states\nCommunities are pushing back the corporate food regime biased tablet she co ops environmental and food activists London I should of India says\nFood has been transformed into a commodity destroying farmers livelihoods destroying the health of the planet and the health of people\nShe calls on us to become the change we want to see in the food system so it no Russia's the earth and all beings our guest today is Eric Holder in minutes he's executive director of food first the Institute for food and development policy\nHe's the author of calm Pacino outcome Pacino voices from Latin America is former to form a movement and a food\n... in Portland, Oregon and now\nEric Holder the mayonnaise is correct school she knew I was doing with no money doing like in my I'm doing my ... I mean I cherish\nMy grandfather is turning over in his basket craved were butchered that sentence but I just think that uh it's an honor to be here with you\nOn indigenous lands and I thought I should honor indigenous people with my own indigenous language thank you I'm\nSomebody talk start talking about or capitalism\nBy talking about the colonial food regime and I think good place to start talking about the colonial food regime is with the Irish famine [noise] um because I think the Irish famine really encapsulates\nOr what the food system has been about ever since the dawn of capitalism let me just read from you hear from my book it doesn't matter if the food is fresh\nOrganic uh rubella or a Big Mac ... from the highlands of Ethiopia or cheese whiz from Walmart doesn't matter whether you need it or not whether it's good or bad for you\nWhere it's locally produced or traveled from afar whether it was corral cage free range or let a happy life\nIf enough people wanted and have the money to buy it someone will turn it into a commodity\nAnd sell it so that is the basis of our food system\nSystem and when the commodity\nThe forces of production it changed the relations of production and millions and millions of people were uprooted from their lives from the villages 'em and driven\nA out of their social relations and out of there are productive relations into capitalist relations into the factory panic meals\nUm and many starved or even though there was plenty of food the Irish potato famine it's really a misnomer there was plenty of food in Ireland or during the famine people were just too poor to buy it\nIn fact there was one of the golden age of a English or agriculture high farming and\nUm but people had been separated from their means of production and we're no longer able to feed themselves and were flocking into this attack meals or to look for work where they were literally worked to death that is the introduction of capitalism that introduction of what we call the colonial food regime [noise]\n\nNow this was a great concern to great thinkers at the time and I'll just mention two that's nothing to do with co ops in John Stuart mill who is a very important reformer and who believed in co-op cooperative victim um as a way of helping people to respond\nTo what capitalism was doing to their society\nUm and of course Robert on a\nWho was a utopian thinker also very much in favor of co ops end of a a planned communities\nUm but and he was also trying to uh not just sort of reform the cap can the capitalist system that was being in ...\nHe wanted to pull out of the capitalist system any also want to collapse to help do this so we begin to see the cooperatives or tools and different responses to capitalism\nVery few people today actually know what John Stuart mill or Robert own said we don't really studied much owing and crew or the philosophers and and the sort of the wealthy people who were pushing back against capitalism at the time\nBelong to a very elite level of society and they sort of launched these ideas in what we called the public sphere were there was all this debate in the coffee houses in London about oh dear oh dear what shall we do about capitalism after all\nBut in fact there was another public sphere where people were discussing what the hell to do about capitalism how the hell to stay alive working Eighteen hours a day and not getting enough and literally thing were to death\nAnd of course those were the partisans\nWho had been these skilled and just placed by the industrial revolution\nAnd whose work had been devalued\nBecause of this enormous what they call reserve ... army of labor starving people willing to work for nothing in order to survive and so you did this response\nFrom the co opt for survival resistance survival but more than that because when people get together and once they can eat they begin to talk and then they got to talk about a lot of things that began to talk about\nAnd of course the discourse was we're going to save the world from hunger by increasing productivity so they send out all of these inputs in tractors and fertilizers in the eastern I'm into the third\nWorld but the third world doesn't have any money how's it going to buy all these things so banks from the United states loon private bank loan money to the third world to be able to buy all these inputs and they do\nGovernments are forced to push peasants off land and so basically the industry\nDisruption of peasants societies and they flock\nTo the urban centers looking for work and you get what Mike Davis cause a planet of slums well did you shoot everybody starts over producing\nNot only are producing all this food and the third world we're producing it here too and the bottom drops out of the market and then no one can pay back their loans well in this country in the seventies we lost half of our farmers they went bankrupt the farm crisis\nAnd the third world we get the third world debt crisis and so the world bank steps in an International Monetary fund steps and says\nYou know you got to keep up your payments in the United states you could just you know repossessed farm but you can't exactly repossessed Mexico\nSo the world bank steps in and said you got to keep up your payments um will only the money sitting up your payment this is public money this is our money by the way the world bank is a public institution\nThat's our money so public money was used to learn to farm to governments in the global south to keep up their payments to private banks in the north but you got to sign on the dotted line with this guy over here it was always a guy\nAnd he was from the IMF and the IMF said\nThere's a little thing we call structural adjustment we'll give you the money but you have to promise to remove all your tariff barriers dismantle all your marketing boards um get rid of of all your or um food crops don't worry about food look wrote in the north dismantle although if you're a grain reserves\nAnd um start growing things more coffee and flowers these things were to get your dollars so you can take back the bank is this called Neal liberalism you have to privatize all of your state services privatize all of your state run industries\nFirst and the third world the privatization of Arctic of education already happened the third world privatization upcoming privatization of a post office already happened for a\nThird world I'm so privatization is basically this new wave of capitalism I'm which we now call Neal liberalism\nAnd a complete deregulation from Minneapolis environmental deregulation um labor deregulation trade deregulation that's what the world Trade Organization is about and we had this this rush of free trade\nThe free trade mania World Trade organization and the free trade agreements of the north American free trade alliance and Central American free trade\nAgreements and you get tremendous over production the north they dumping in this in the south or putting farmers out of business within a year the signing of NAFTA over a million Mexican farmers went bankrupt and why do you think we have so many immigrants here\nToday is because these arrangements he's agreement these capitalistic\nRaymond destroyed their livelihoods that's why you're here you look at who's who's in the back of the house or the fancy restaurants\nFormer farmers whose cutting the launch those are farmers who is doing all the farm work all the stupid labor those were farmers someone farmers in this country say oh geez who's gonna you know all the farmers are disappearing no there's no no one wants to farm anymore and they're surrounded by farmers\nIt just happened to be brown so what a collapse doing well in the postwar period cops kind of you know languished but then they begin to get what I learned was another um second when\nThis corporate food regime they want to live differently they want healthy food they want food which is recognizable and they organize and they push back all of these instances of people pushing back\nIs with carpal on your call the counter movement the counter movement it's a social movement of people who do not accept what capitalism is doing to them and they push back out of necessity out of belief for out of survival ...\nAnyway we get the second wave and I like to think that the second wave was really part of the beginning of what we today we call the food movement ... but the film and what has many route\nAnd one of the roots is the food justice movement and the food justice movement comes out of the traditions with African Americans comes out of the needs of Mexican Americans comes out of the desires of Asian Americans people with a very different position and the food system but who find different ways\nOf ensuring their own food security out of necessity and so today we have a really a thriving food movement we talk about all the time Michael Pollan Alice Waters all these people talk about the Raj Patel ... pay me\nUm and I think we have to sort of cop to the fact that the food was one of the reasons the food movement here not just because we're rejecting a processed food which we should it's pretty bad for us it's everybody knows\nWhere we're also trying to deal with a contradiction that the richest country in the world produces more food than any other country except maybe China\nI'm\nIn this country one and people want is that people are going hungry we don't call it\nFertilizers and hybrids sees and pesticides on the green revolution is about exchanging one food system for another\nExchanging presidents who systems for capitalist system instill logically and historically as it always has it displaces and just possesses millions of people and drives them into the ranks of the hungry is why producing more food the way we produce food\nIn the industrial food system is never going to solve hunger\nYou're listening to W E s U eighty eight point one FM Middletown [noise]\nReaders theater return to perform for a thousand miles\nTwenty Thirteen Pulitzer Prize finalists written by Amy first off admission is great\nOn Monday October twenty second\nComedy introduce a new due for very different\nYou may already know\nI Know students who are a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in debt for a liberal liberal arts education\nWhat the hell is happened we have to\nTake back the public sphere otherwise how are we going to introduce any of the structural and social changes\nWhich we need obviously the planet has been pushed beyond its limits so this isn't just a social problem this is really is a planetary problem it is a civilization all problem um we can't go on like this we cannot consumer way out of this crisis\nWe have to restructure the whole notion of commodities and food\nPeople say you can fix a broken ... a food system by voting with your fork well those who don't have much money can't don't get to vote and that's most of the people in the world so no that's not going to work for us so I've been talking to you about the capitals food regime let's say two more thing one\nSeveral hundred years in one of the things capitalism always does it get to that goes through a period of liberalization and then a period of reform\nLiberalization they take the gloves off the market's market gets to do whatever it wants no more rules\nThink of the roaring twenties think of today Neal liberalization and this other states society but it concentrates a lot of money in a few hands\nBut then people can take it anymore and counter movements rise up and they push back\nAnd they demand reform or\nThey demand revolution which is even scarier and so then you get reform hello I didn't mean that let's get some reforms in here and remember the reforms in this country started with the food system started with farmers in started with a food programs\nSo what we need is a strong counter movements why didn't we get reforms that last market crash they've all the money to to the banks bailed out the banks what about the people because the counter movement was not strong enough\nSo what is to be done rather than to\nTake a look at things we've got about two million farmers got more people in jail than we have on the land\n\nWe have less than a million agricultural workers forty six thousand people working in processing plants but three million working in retail groceries you put all these together that's a fifth of our national workforce\nNow that's interesting from an organizers point of view from a disruptor his point of view from a reformist point of view from a revolutionary point of view twelve percent you can shut\nGlobally they controlled ... percent of the food and with that they control the world's food systems\n\nNow co op don't control much of the food in this country I Know\nAnd farmers are too weak to demand anything but people who work in retail grocery that's the biggest employer\nIn this country Walmart I think it's important is country what if we were to converge\nIn all of our diversity how powerful might we do and then by saying that the counter movement\nAs far as we're concerned is the food movement it has the progressive wing and it has a very radical wing and the corporate food regime has two wings one neo liberal and one reformist\nAnd if the counter movement expects to introduce any reform much less transformative reforms it'll have to converge the progressive gin radicals are gonna have to converge\nThink about the different types of co ops that I described there are all represented here but which ones should come together my position\nIs it the progress has been the radicals need to come together because if the reform missing the progress it's come together then to counter movement split down its back and becomes a week thing and it will never be able to introduce changes the reformers want bring us any change there too weak why because the new liberals are hedging Monica\nThis is the age of Neal liberalism what's keeping us from coming together I Would you say there are some historical obstacles we need to deal with one would be sexism\nDeal with these thing brothers and sisters we have to take them head on we have to be fearless we have to call it out I have to call out my privilege is a white male and I have to allow people to call it out right here right now\nEverywhere\nWe've got to dismantle patriarchy we've got to dismantle racist and this is an extra work this is the work because it [noise]\n\nBecause if we don't dismantle what is keeping us apart we will never come together and if we don't come together we will not change this thank you very much [noise]\nI was just a curious you said there were three million grocery workers you know uh this this statistic of service and restaurant workers that we could add in there as part of the food oh\nYes I Do but I Can't remember it [laughter] yes and there are some excellent organizations like the restaurant opportunities center that organized restaurant workers\nUm by the by restaurant workers out some of the highest levels of food insecurity in the nation and the highest within that sector or in the fancy restaurants\nI have a question about an inconsistency that me and my friends discuss brought many systems but the people in this room all respect what I'm saying about this one so we had eleven thousand members that are small co-op and upstate New York\nIt occurs to me that those eleven thousand members although they raise their hand to say they want to be part of this shift in food systems\nTherefore one case their retirement plan their stocks and their bank investments are at the same time more than likely supporting the structures that you just\nPlus demanding security in the front of a school building had not checked or on the couch to see whether or not they were supporting Remington right so how do we begin to expand this conversation so we stop eating the tale of our own snake\nWell thank you that's not a simple question isn't it [noise] I think I I really do believe that that ...\nReflective action\nNeeds to take place within the public sphere which we consciously created I think that we need a radical public spears I Need we need public sphere is deeply rooted in community um and the issues have to be put on the table and you know people are going to get defensive\nUm but we can't not address those inconsistencies\nA and I think that the only there's no easy way but I think that as we understand the structures which has driven next to this dead end end to the contradictions\nIn our society and to the violence that we experience in our society as we understand the structures behind that and called him out I think it deep personalize things enough so then we can begin to address the very personal issues as well\nAnd I think that you know there's a lot of trauma trauma um built into all of this\nSo we can't just addressed that intellectually we can't just addressed it organization like every one of us has to do some work whether it's about internalized oppression or whether it's about the guilt of privilege we can't get anywhere if we're if we have these anchors\nIt there are tools for this if you look at ... Native American communities today they have developed all kinds of ways of dealing with the trauma of genocide in constant constant work on genocide\nThere are excellent forums and workshops and um for dealing with racism in how to dismantle racism from both sides of the oppressor and the press\nAnd the same is true for a sexism and patriarchy so I think that to the extent that we can begin to bring these into our practice or social practice whether that's cooperatives or whether it's research like I Do\nWith me Joshua Johnson weekday morning to train on eighty eight point one WB yes you\nAre you\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] I [noise]\n\nDoes that change\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nDo\nYou [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nOh\nThank you [noise]\nThat was a recording of the cast to feel trails world premier performance of shadows in spider webs by vocalist and guitarist Darryl MU\nFrom July two thousand and Seventeen at the button which tree in Middletown group will be performing a free concert on Sunday October twenty three PM at the rest of the house located at three fifty high street on the weather the campus\nYou're listening to the center for the arts radio hour we will hear a few more tunes rather cast field trio later this episode first we will have a conversation about the fall faculty dance concert entitled wrapped in a way to hear from associate professor of dance hari Krishna and\nVisiting assistant professor is truly mobile hill and Dr Powell and one of\nTheir student collaborators about their upcoming performances on friday October twenty six PM and Saturday October twenty seven seven PM and the Patrick Lalley Ninety two theater\nMy name is ... Christian I Am associate professor at the ... department it gives me great pleasure to be speaking to Julie\nAnd I'm scared to speak to them about what the concert it's about and to ah create some excitement and bugs and magic\nOf what the concept of what the pizza than those conflicts entail so I'm going to start right away whereas Julie I understand that your piece you are are preventing at the ... it's going to involve a students could you talk to us a little bit of both\nParties sure and that's why I ... with us he's actually one of the um [noise] six other collaborating dance makers in the process\nAnd we also have to student musician and a student costume designer though the whole process is really student run student led I feel like you do a little bit of facilitating but perhaps oddly Shaq could give light to a little more of what we do actually from personal to rehearsal\nSure um audience on the stage for the peace at me and Steven are doing a it's called um [noise] the we are running around in circles initially which which showcases or\nA infant infinite bones Howe which\nSo um and other pieces which um the the other participants in the dark group in order to in a specific types of movement which involves boundaries but this encompasses\nThat which is all sorts of compromise between the ... the the dancers the audience and everybody right\nWe're also compromising with the space on in the nineties you theater so\nI'm for composing compromise we break we began the performance collage and the down that pavilion where you'll see sort of part of parts of the hall which is what ... getting at he's um at least had described a moment that he does\nYou're in a specific part of the down a pavilion and then you'll also see it integrated into the stage aspect of the full I'm inside the Ninety two theaters base\nAnd the the whole piece sort of bound to that way between pieces and whole and and progressive\nUm spaces and ... and I think what we've really done like a what I'll be Shaq has said\nIs a not only play with boundaries and I'm pushing them or discovering them or you know sort of exploring them but also I'm thinking of compromise as as something positive\nAs a way of I'm offering us more possibilities or other possibilities than what we create by ourselves or what we stand on if we have an agenda [noise]\nUm so our particular mission has been really to explore compromise and in many ways as possible and so\nAh the musicians have also had this really fantastic um vision for these ideas on compromise in terms of utilizing recorded moment from rehearsal um utilizing sounds that the space itself creates as well as\nUm uh uh making found in the bay um as well as like moments of disturbing the they're they're called they call them disturbances where we are pulled into something more familiar like the edge of a pop song that you might recall\nRecall um or like almost recall before it's sort of disturb\nI'm back into the center of presence in reality that we have this uh also this kind of um allusion to a compromise\nThe performance contacts is improvisational in in a way that we have some that chunks of movement that we've designed and that we've\nExplored and developed and then we also have these open moment I'm In the piece where we have to make choices and the audience has to make choices too which I think is a really nice um invitation as part of this concert um\nThat the audience has to sort of decide how and where they participate in that part of the collage experience\nAs it progressed to from the Dell Nick pavilion into the Ninety to a theater stage to be um so there's a lot of uh a lot of layers and ah I think you can take it as you know superficial or you can dive deep\nAs your own choice I'm your own level of participation as part of the collage experience\nBut it's been a really interesting process there's been some really fantastic um improvisational moment that the dance makers have sort of found\nUm and then there's been some other like challenges on things that we have to push to create or remember 'em so it's a it's a interesting balance of the creating and are living in the moment right\nIt all sounds very interesting and exciting and mysterious and magical [laughter] but I see are based on what I'm hearing clearly you are not compromise or going in college right now [laughter] I'm creativity and imagination but when you're working with\nLike obvious Shaq and the others in the interview we really have a nice intelligent groups that are fascinated with the exploration so that makes me\nAnd feeling so what movement we make or what decision happened like it less interesting to me than how we do that together and uh the honoring of each other's opinion the way we listen to each other\nThat accomplished I'm really less interested in the product altogether and I think what that does for me in the face because I Am um because I Know that I go into the space already with a charged\nSense of power you know I Am I'm older and I am I I had a whole to particular position in the room I really try to shed a lot of that\nUm but what I Do think that does is it it um it takes it takes the pressure off of having to have something particular I'm done or made and each rehearsal\nI think we accomplished a nice like task lists every rehearsal but I also think that I I care less about\nThe the the checking of the boxes of those tax than I Do on how we accomplish the task I don't know ... would have to speak to the way that is successful or not in there\nAnd also his own like sensibility in the space and subjectivity as a person you know with power in a particular way I'm so I'll I'll open up to that and yeah\nYeah I mean I have to give credit to Julie for of bringing ... voted together and like managing this entire peace because\nShe had been wonderful to cook when you when we come up with ideas because we're like poking fun it is and sometimes because like no it isn't [laughter] and then she's been very helpful like bringing all of that together and creating a piece of it um\nAnd I don't ah my experience I've been wonderful ah because I don't I did not look at a missionary case Monday when she came um\nIt was like the the gap between the student and like a professor but as as time went on the gap between this one professor diminished and like I felt like she was also like just another student like who was collaborating with lots of this\nWe're about to do um and I really have to give them credit for that oh well\nThank you [laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nUm that that is that is I'm\nReally affirming to here but I I also think that what you eat that each of us has done that to an extent each of us has\nHas opened something vulnerable about ourselves or has stepped into something that maybe might feel a little I'm less comfortable to say out loud what we think is good for the group or to put an idea on the table that can be really challenging to do in a in a group there are there are seven of us in the room every rehearsal\nPlus we have two musicians that are working that we know where where he was behind the scenes and occasionally do show up in rehearsal\nAnd I'm so there are there there's sort of a lot of of of opinions and and ways to toss those ideas around\nAnd to have an opinion on that\nAll of these really great ideas can be really intimidating and um so I think that each each of us um in our own way each of the each of the um dance making collaborators in the musicians have also stepped into leadership and follow ship follows ship\nRole in such a beautiful ways where they make these suggestions you know at the dance makers you know I could call them dancers in this base but what they're doing is making making the dance they are\nDesigning they are creating they are bringing together themselves um what the ... like the structure of the peace and how the pieces held\nI'm being wrapped in us [laughter] I don't really [noise] Ah yes and uh\nAnd so I so I I I feel that we all have to sort of um confront ourselves in\nThey are in the sense of belonging with each other and how we can help the group and push the group agenda for right to the grid and it makes it in and how we do that um becomes are because of the work\nGreat so the sense of a democracy and be a\nStudio space I find very a real farming and a progressive and inspiring a given the kind of a ... times uh we live in in this country\nUm so it's a speaking of a wrapped in that sense it's kind of a a creation of a community building and a group a group solidarity a joy yeah I understand what you're a key mandates of your company is to foster this idea of dancing with um\nWith uh the uh community at large and how you can create a much more um compassionate a treacherous aesthetic to disseminate dance to the people at large and how your um your sort of your company\nA mandate it I'm a sort of ... ... ... the aesthetic of a [noise] sharing in exchange or could you talk a little bit about that\nI'm a particularly in the in the piece a and what we can sort of um a\nBeef from that an old though a two part question already about that and the second part crash Daniel welcome [laughter] always happy I give the law of you're in the second part question is in terms of describing some of the movement vocabulary one is going\nTo see that are in the in the ... a con said like I like like a truly are you going to work in a ... a kind of improvised ... a structure or uh what kind of eclectic movement\nThat's the one I remember [laughter] so if you can backtrack to the first question after we're I suddenly well thank you [laughter]\nUm as far as the type of ... vernacular that
