at Juilliard park that's from their album Rosenbergs after dark\nFrom two thousand and six and that was their open definitely I I felt like that whole band was working up towards something and that was the one that they finally\nLanded on and every song on that record is definitely done on purpose I remember when they they released it was at the Phoenix there I'm like album released show for that and then the main theme of it was about um again the titles filled Rosenbergs after dark which was a\nI was kind of like a Walmart kind of thing that was on fourth street I'm just sort of a corner store that you can get anything at and they were very cool the young people so these guys made a record about it and the whole premise of it was and he had said this when they released the record was that it it's very easy\nTo talk about your hometown but at the end of the day where you came from really shapes who you are\nAnd I'm regardless of what your personality as you took something from where you came from even if it's completely rejecting it or if it's taking something from your neighborhood or your friends or your high school or whatever um you have something to get back to where you came from the first one we played\nThere was a banker paper son's that was sunk a fine line it was just on a burns CD that I found in my box of\nLocal bands CDs that were handed to me at whatever show openings for whoever and that's how much surprisingly good so I decided to put it on even though I have no context or who they are after that we have the song a queen in a coffin bi polar bears\nThat arm was the future king and that was their opus was well that was the record that they had been working up to ever since I started\nThere was something about they weren't going to get the shipment of those CDs and time\nSo they were considering postponing it and they changed to where it was going to go to the address of the door because they were hoping that we get there like day of\nAnd it was literally like thirty minutes before they played the box that actually got there with all the CDs so they open the box and started handing it to us and we started handing\nThe money so we can get a copy of it and my copy of it legitimately it's been what was that that was two thousand seven so it's been eleven years\nUh my ... my copy of it still smells like mothballs because it came directly out of that box and they didn't package it very well um that was kind of the the generation of independence that came from that I'm\nSo moving away from when we started which was the late nineties\nWhich was ... kind of moving away from rented and moving towards cue and not you um and what the progression of music that we're making was uh what's the maximum rock and roll radio

D. used by the effect [noise]\nThe seizure of our political system like global corporations and just depressing [noise]\nAnd I think that we have to confront what's before us including our failed democracy and yet rise up and resist anyway that's kind of moral imperative because we are responsible for the world that comes after an even if we ... we may fail\nBut even if we found a at least let those will come after us and they try and if we are passing in front of the system we are complicit in what Emanuel continent called radical even [noise]\nThat's Chris Hedges and this is the alternative radio I'm David by Sean me on this edition of a A R features Chris Hedges on rise up and resist\nWomen's enough enough in the face of evil what does it take for people to move for passivity to active resistance\nThroughout history there have been instances of people they find tyranny fighting back no matter what the odds and example comes from Nazi Germany often considered the benchmark of evil opposition to the regime was highly dangerous\nSeventy five years ago hands in so official brother and sister and others at the University of Munich said good new enough they formed the white rose movement and cold on Germans to recognize their moral duty and overthrow the government\nThey disseminated critical information through flyers and graffiti\nOne such graffiti said whatever comes out of Hitler's mouth is ally in Nineteen forty three times and so the show\nRisks can we our guest today is Chris Hedges he's in award winning journalist who's reported from the Balkans in the middle east and Central America\nHe writes a weekly column for truth the dot com is the author of many books including America the farewell tour I talked with him in the studios of KGAN you in Boulder, Colorado\nA welcome to the program consent just thank you David well why a farewell tour\nBecause this is the end of American empire a and all of the warning signs that exist when empires disintegrate are flashing red\nUh the expansion of a military machine a that is Halloween the country out from the inside\nThe erosion of civil liberties the D. industrialization of our cities the capture of our political process by a tiny cabal in this case corporate\nThat read directs all of the institutions\nThat once made reform possible towards the further consolidation of power a and amassing of obscene amounts of wealth\nThe political system no longer functions is at least in terms of\nPropel in a society forwarded its its role in that society backwards\nAs we enrich this tiny global financial elite and a which is largely orchestrated attacks boycott they pay little to no taxes remember Eisenhower or the wealthiest individuals and corporations paid Ninety One percent tax\nNow they have to extract that money from a beleaguered population that's why you get program\nOver Thirteen trillion you're late on your credit card that's twenty eight percent interest or you're going to poor communities and they're just fine to death for the most ridiculous offenses\nIncluding an obstruction on pedestrian walkway is which means standing on a sidewalk not mowing your lawn which is actually a fine in Ferguson, Missouri because with the loss of tax revenue these counties and states\nCan't fill their budgets and because that\nOligarchy Gilead has rendered themselves untouchable\nA and we can watch massive acts of fraud by Goldman Sachs or banks and nobody's held accountable than the uh the system for its pound of flesh takes it out of the most vulnerable\nIt's from the symptom of something much deeper\nYeah Trump is a symptom of a political system that has seized up and doesn't work\nUh and that's why we're seeing Trump light figures appear\nThroughout the industrialized world Viktor Orban in Hungary or ... or ... or Boris Johnson in Britain you know the polish government just destroy their legal system the sweetest elections just brought to power these are the right wing nationalist\nBecause in essence this global financial elite has seized control of national economy's we see it in Greece and it it the citizens have a lost the ability to determine both economic and political policy\nUh and so the debate has shifted in and Thatcher and Reagan were largely responsible for this it shifted\nA towards an assault on national identity um you know they're the idea that uh uh eleven million undocumented workers was somehow responsible for the economic decline of the United states is patently absurd um\nCorporate capitalism or how it works a and as we move closer towards the financial crisis and one is coming another one uh you will see that kind of language and incitement to violence which Trump has already done be ratcheted up\nWhat are the scientific coming economic crash you mentioned that well\nSo what happened after two thousand and eight is that the banks and the global speculators received at virtually zero percent interest twenty six trillion dollars according to the University of Missouri of fabricated money out of electronic ether\nWhat they did with this money was not invest it in the society they didn't build new factories create new jobs the way of traditional capitalist structure what what they did was hoard it\nBy back their own stock that's what they did with most of the money from the tax cuts because their compensation packages are tied that's why the overheated stock market the idea that that is somehow a symbol of a healthy economy is absurd uh\nOr they invested it in very risky ventures like fracking so fracking the the the value of the fracking industry is determined not by their profits in fact it's a money losing operation almost all places\nAnd they've had to borrow a tremendous amounts of money over two hundred and eighty billion to keep it going\nBut the fracking industry has value like the dot com industry on projected profits but at a certain moment that bubble burst ah estimates are that within a couple of decades forty percent of the the people who have student loans will have defaulted\nUm the system's not sustainable\nRates anymore they've already lowered them which is virtually zero I'm In fact central bank some central banks in Europe were lending money at negative interest rates they would pay to borrow money\nAnd\nThat flirt with what will be the death blow of the American empire and that is the day the dollar is no longer the world's reserve currency and why is that significant\nWell because then the dollar value collapses completely I mean it's a fictitious value as it is a but it's it's held up because it is the world's reserve currency it's remains the world's reserve currency we saw\nA ... an example of that when in the Nineteen fifties the pound sterling was dropped as the world's reserve currency\nOne of the characteristics of late empire is that it makes disastrous military\nDecisions military fiasco so ... in the the the Indian Empire the in in ancient Greece they attempted to invade Sicily their entire fleet was sunk\nWhen the population becomes distracted by trivia when cultural life is redefined does ... rounds of entertainment when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby talk\nWhen insured people become an audience and their public businesses vaudeville act then a nation finds itself at risk culture death is it clear possibility and you quote a policeman in your book as well yeah why\nWell because he was prophetic about where we were headed and the danger of essentially allowing um celebrities entertainment to infect\nJournalism I mean what our politicians are you know like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama they're manufactured personalities there's no substance it's remember the old\nClashed or\nBetween a Al Gore and Bush who do you want to have a beer with I mean this is ...\nIn America and making us confuse how we are made to feel with knowledge and that manipulation now courtesy of handheld devices just goes on twenty four hours a day or and we are uh I think\nIs a\nForce to and wrote the probably the most illusions society in human history meanwhile we are being impoverished stripped of our civil liberties or have amassed\nAn oligarchy ... elite that you know rivals that that existed I mean I think is great into in terms of income inequality is worse than what took place under the gilded age and you can't maintain a democracy in an oligarchy that isn't a particularly sophisticated\nPolitical thought Aristotle a\nElaborated on that to some three thousand years ago\nWho didn't Louis Brandeis the Supreme Court justice say you can have a you can have the two things you can have a democracy where you can have great concentrations of wealth that you can't have both right\nAnd Aristotle said that you know when you have that income inequality than you're only two choices are chairing a revolution\nLet's go back to Graham she again because you write in your book that he would have spared of the divide in the United states between our anemic left and the working class\nWell\nSo I mean we had radical union movements the ... the old CIO the old United mine workers\nAnd that\nOf anti communism or the red scare they were if this rated especially in the Nineteen fifties after World War two and Ellen ... written some good books on this\nAnd it wasn't just the Hollywood writers and Pete Seeger and\nDome trombone ah but the FBI was going into high schools with lists of quote unquote reds with no evidence or and then these teachers were fired and blacklisted they couldn't work again it really is at the all through the layers of society\nThey were purging people with a social conscience critics of capitalism\nThe effects of that were quite devastating\nUm we saw a rise of movements in the Nineteen sixties and then this contemporary ferocious assault\nOr which began in the early seventies and Louis pals memo uh attack on the free enterprise system is kind of the blueprint for that Nineteen Seventy one Nineteen Seventy one and so\nFrom that point on word labor unions were decimated and we just saw with these so called right to work laws a further attack on unions only six percent now of\nThe American workforce in the private sector is unionized at all\nBut with the right to work law employers can't even make contracts with unions are it it really expands the ability of employers to hire exclusively non union labor and so this re configuration of American society a is one\nWhere we have been left virtually defenseless as these forces role forward and and you know as Carl ... rights and the great transformation\nA unfettered unregulated capitalism is ultimately a destructive and a self destructive force because it can modifies everything we haven't even spoken about climate change it it can modifies human beings modifies the natural world in the name of short term profit\nOr until exhaustion or collapse and and there's no ...\nI'm a change reports fear or is that these elites are are orderly and capable of responding rationally to the greatest existential threat to face the human\nSpecies or it isn't just Trump I mean yeah trumps the climate deniers but the whole monitor that we can somehow adapt\nOr the Paris climate accord which are nonbinding a you know limits on carbon emissions I mean for all of this fails to confront the gravity of of what's before us\nThe question always comes up though these corporate managers they know the science then getting reports you know accurate information and they have children and grandchildren so how can they be acting in ways that aren't endangering on their own families\nWell because in order to become the c._e._o. BP um you probably have to have a psychopathic personality um these are not I I went to school with him I unfortunately I was shipped off to exclusive boarding school at the age of ten where at least that New England eagle broken and women's\nOn scholarship so I grew up with these people uh you know I went to school with Louis Scooter Libby I Know who they are I Know ... I went to I Know them all and they are are incredibly entitled incredibly narcissistic um they believe that their wealth will protect them\nAnd\nThey are in gauging in behavior that\nIn the short term makes them wealthier and more powerful and I don't think they see beyond it you know by the time you reached that level you are so winnow doubt I mean you don't you don't get I mean I worked at the New York times for Fifteen Years and there's a kind of vetting process where\nA loyalty to the institution not to the individuals who work for it or the individuals that are exploited by it and that is a very distorted personality but institutions are quite good at selecting those who who will Neal before its alter\nAnd you know and I come out a seminary I mean that it is a form of idle a tree and we were taught in seminary that the danger of idols is not just that it demands human sacrifice but in the end it ... it demands self sacrifice that your finally\nSlaughtered on the altar and that's precisely what's happening they they think they're going to a scape it I mean you've got these silicon\nValley millionaires buying empty missile silos and the mid west where they think they're gonna\n... I can tell them from from covering the former Yugoslavia that the people who rule when society breaks down or those who have the guns are and their body guards are not going to sit around and take orders from them once society disintegrates\nYou're listening to Chris Hedges on rise up and resist\nThis is independent alternative radio you can order copies of this program and the Hedges book America the farewell tour\nBy calling one eight hundred triple for one nine seven seven\nThat's one eight hundred for for for one nine seven seven or you can order online on our website alternative radio dot org that alternative radio dot O. R. G.\n[noise] he ... he ... he is eat late line Middletown [noise]\nWhat's that I hear a record there and wasn't being kept this oh yeah why of course Wu You eighty eight point one of them and you will fall record fair is happening\nW. E. F. U. N. N. dot or or on the w._b. yes you can come to an Earth Day filled vinyl memorabilia and cold hard can you there [noise] [noise]\nI Want to draw a little bit on your studies of the Christian evangelical right in the United states you you wrote a book called American fascism the Christian right in the war\nOn America large numbers of evangelical Christians in in this country are on nationalist and fervent believers in capitalism eighty one percent of them voted in the two thousand sixteen presidential election\nWe were talking about a Christian event you know the goals and magical thinking the question always comes up is how do you reach people what vocabulary do you deploy to uh try to persuade people to into is indeed for and not five\nBut who are convinced that it's five you can't the says you give up you walk away\nYou don't give up I mean so you know it was interesting I mean even when after my book on the Christian right came out there were people I wrote about 'em in the book was called American Fascists but I wrote about\nThe average person in the moment with great empathy because they're suffering was real and because I I felt compassion for what they went through\nUm no I think it's economic I I think that if they're if they're social bonds are not recreate it and they're not really integrated into the economic and political system\nThan we can't reach them because to shatter their peculiar world view is to leave them out early bereft of any foundation by which they continue to exist\nAnd so I think we have to organize around for instance you know raising the minimum wage to Fifteen or twenty dollars a we have to organize around universal healthcare we have to organize around issues that dramatically improve their lives are and that means building alliances\nTwo hours um but no I spent a lot of time with these people and ... you're just not going to our I mean the the whole I took a creation a seminar and so this was a class for a teachers and Christian schools how to teach creationism\nAnd they ... the instructor had to confront the fact that uh\nYou know the world is created in the first day of the lights not created till the fourth day so what do you tell the students will you tell the students to God created a temporary like I mean it's all in the details it's ridiculous it's not in the Bible it's completely fabricated but it shows you how\nJust connected there any allergy is from reality and that's just you know on every single level\nOn a whole range of a public issues from a protecting the environment to universal health care to having tuition free colleges and universities these are all according to polls including one commissioned by the Koch brothers majority ... use yet\nThe political class does not move forward on them why not\nBecause we don't count because we're all people know legislation we know statistically I mean legislation and laws are written by corporate lobbyists and we'd been utterly different power we've we live and what Sheldon will and called the system of inverted totalitarianism and by that he means it's not\nClassical not yet not classical totalitarianism or it's not going to stop all and death camps well\nAnd it's not a a Hitler Mussolini I mean I don't think Trump has reached that point so you have the facades like the late Roman Republic you have the facade of the republic but\nInternally corporations have seized all of the levers of power to render the citizen but a really it doesn't matter I mean it doesn't matter Kavanaugh commits perjury I mean\nOr at least for the rich uh and then you have a criminalization of poverty uh so you know mowing their lawn\nOr not mowing your lawn or standing on a sidewalk which means obstructing pedestrian traffic or or having an open container your find and jailed why because these county and state governments\nBecause nobody pays taxes and under eyes and how the wealthiest corporations and and uh individuals' paid Ninety One percent\nTax or they don't have any revenue so they're they can't get it from corporations because their\nImmune so you take it from the vulnerable so the pressure on the poor and the working poor is just getting worse and worse and worse and worse and there were powerless to do anything about it because the system whether it's the Democrats the Republicans the established elites\nAre beholden to corporate money\nGrump she used to say and it's often quoted by Edward ... and ... and others saying that he had pessimism of the intellect and optimism of the will uh is this something that appeals to\nYes because I mean people say well you know it's so bleak it's so depressing well it's bleak and depressing um and I think the greatest existential crisis of our time is to grasp what's before us from climate change alone\nI mean if we would stop all carbon emissions today which were not doing we would still suffer catastrophic climate change\nAnd one of the reasons that climate scientists are so terrified of going beyond two degrees Celsius in terms of global warming is that they know from study and other planets like Venus which ones had water and now is eight hundred degrees that it triggers feedback loops which you can't control there is nothing you can do that\nAnd they've run mathematical scenarios on those loops\nUm the seizure of our political system by corporate power global corporations are is depressing\nAh you know the fact that sixteen million hungry children go to bed in America every night is depressing is after the fact that we have to point three million prisoners twenty five percent of the world's prison population over half of whom were never charged with physically harming anyone is depressing\nAnd I think that we have to confront what's before us including our failed democracy and yet rise up and resist any way that it's a kind of moral imperative\nBecause we are responsible for the world that comes after us and even if we fail and we may fail but even if we fail at least let those who come after us say they tried a and if we are passive in front of the system we are complicit in what Emanuel conned would call radical evil\nIn Nineteen eighty eight the NASA scientists James Hansen I went to Capitol Hill and for the first time I talked about\nA ... what was happening with the climate to so and increasing warming of the earth's temperature and the potential dangers that that may pose a down the line well here we are Thirty years later\nWith the U.S pulling out of the Paris climate agreement or court ... even with all its problems are and we are rapidly hurdling toward the abyss\nWell climate change was first identified as a problem in Nineteen oh five\nNineteen sixty five right\nNo Nineteen ... oh fine yes it was a scientist in Europe I forget from Sweden or somewhere down to fight it\nUh but then you had acts on their scientist in the seventies understood the nature of global warming edits danger so it's we've known for a long time the elites have certainly no uh but unfortunately they ...\nUh and that's why I don't hold out any hope for the elites I mean we have to remove this system from power\nA we have to overthrow the corporate state and that comes through mass acts of sustained nonviolent civil disobedience such as we saw an Standing Rock such as I saw on East Germany Czechoslovakia Romania or we're finished and we don't have much time left\nAre you familiar with the recent example of arming effort yeah that's quite a story here you had this really decrepit oligarchy or ... or that was literally a overthrown by hundreds of thousands of people in the streets shut down all the\nGuns what happened in East Germany I mean I was in Alexander plots was half a million East Germans and the ... state was the most efficient security and surveillance state in human history into our own\nThis is the uh twenty fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords which Edward side denounces a Palestinian versus I\nUh since then or the possibilities of an independent viable Palestinian state has received is under both Republican and democratic administrations what do you see in terms of the future for the Palestinians and for the region as a whole\nWell I mean that's why I support the boycott divest been sanctioned movement because it's the only weapon we have left Israel's worried about it um that movement has gained a fair bit of traction in Europe um they are seeking the Israeli lobby to criminalize it here on the United states\nOr I mean we talk about Russian interference in the elections how about Israeli interference in the elections I mean they literally a pack gives money to candidates and\nUh obviously the assault is worse and worse especially cutting off funding us funding unreal\nIn the world um don't have access I mean Israel has bombed the sewage treatment plants so the whole coast of Gaza is filled with raw sewage they bombed the power plants a of Ninety eight percent of the water is you can drink\nSpiritual level that the universe is always\nA with love 'em\nAnd in my human you know meet park is self I'm having to always find that light in whatever I see is and I think\nUm I you know I I'm always in a state of resilience than they are at least I'm always in the state of trying to like a find that um and I think that's a struggle because we don't create a world ah that is like\n\nThe values that maybe you know it's\nHard I mean I you know I'm just like you know you you I you know you see your friends doing well and you should you know um celebrate that uh or embrace it and not be jealous and that's really hard like even for me I'm like oh you know see like\nI get like maybe ... minutes when I see young trans people like pitching about roles and I'm thinking like growing up it wasn't even ... you know\nYou know and I have to be like no no no this is good yeah it's good that\nThey even can be [noise] about that and and being new writers and having positions or you know like their next struggle is they don't have to think about I'm invisible or I'm not\nAn and they don't even know to think that yeah like\nI wasn't thinking in the nineties like no one's representing\nI was thinking in the nineties like how I get a job I can I get a job why isn't anyone like using the what do I do live cannot get anywhere you know like you can listen I'm you know we're not and I think sometimes that's where I get a little worried with academia because it's
