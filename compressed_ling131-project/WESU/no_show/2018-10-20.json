was Paul White man and his orchestra that was recorded in Nineteen twenty seven and we followed that up with lonely melody and that was from Nineteen twenty eight again the Paul Whiteman orchestra so moving on we're actually going to go back a few more years to Nineteen twenty four\nThis is going to be Fletcher Henderson and his orchestra so before I tell you who much\nI'm actually I've got something interesting in here that maybe you like to know so\nFletcher Henderson he had a very important career and be gone when he left Georgia\nHe went into New York city he was doing post grad work\nIn chemistry and math and he could play the piano so he earned it cheap by touring with W ... orchestra and working in New York recording studio so he became a bandleader on his own and then\nHe ended up going and uh playing roles land which obviously many of us know Broadway dance tall so he and his musicians played regularly their\nTheir recorded often occasionally they toward a team in in his ensemble with Don Redmond\nAn alpha saxophonist and composer ranger who had been trained to Detroit and Boston Conservatory\nRedmond really did most of the writing and stuff that musical standards for the group now here's the thing\nI'm all of one man Louis Armstrong in each section Armstrong with excellent playing the trumpet so Lewis and he proved to be a rare entertainer but he was also a major innovative figure in American music but for purposes here\nHis main effect we introduced new ways to teach a new reason they feel a new kind of meant to him to the music to musicians and eventually the audience is needed a new name for it\nAnd that he was doing so with all that being said I give you Fletcher Henderson and his ... this is Louis Armstrong trumpet in Copenhagen it's according to the next twenty four enjoy\n[laughter]\n\nHey [laughter]\n[laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter]\n\n[laughter] [laughter] anything and then they\nThey may\nBe the only people\nWho who knows maybe you know cell\nPhone or on the phone\n[noise]\nOr something for ... or or [noise]\n\nMaybe and maybe\nThat will take some some some schools all over the\nPhone from David [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd like [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI caught up with a man with on a little bit of a boom\nBa ba ba ba bom bom bom ba ba ba ba bom ba ba dum dum bum bump bum bump bum bump bum bump bum\nOr we're going to play a little bit of a woman but I don't know what I'm going to go back\n\nAnd forth all day long but ... but\nYou know the end of the nation from the president on you know one\nOf them are going on about ... [noise]\nOh well above above above but\nThere is no no no no no I\nDon't know much about that [noise]\nThat they can run on that day when\nThey were having to be a\nNon da da da da da\nDa da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da\nDa da da\nAnd that was what they\nDo that and then and then then and then they tried that\nA number of the beast released in Nineteen eighty two and then of course I had to play a number of the beast\nOr off that album ah this was made in the third studio album of what was the first with Bruce Dickinson and the last before ... brain came on as a drummer\nI'm so a lot of people don't know that a lot of people um don't realize that there were two albums before number of the beast where Bruce Dickinson wasn't the singer\nUm and I\nPersonally think that Bruce Dickinson is quintessential iron maiden and of course there was a stint in the nineties and I think in in the early to thousands were he was not the center for the band as well but um eighties to like Ninety three are made and\nThat is what's up that is that is like amazing pure iron maiden metal\nAnd ah and I love it and a lot of people don't know this because I I really don't play that much metal on the show but uh and longtime listeners are familiar with my infatuation with rush of course I Love bands like Led Zeppelin and all those classic ribs but iron maiden\nLike Nineteen eighty two starting or eighty ... eighty to start with number of the beast and up into\nA ... [noise] I like seventh son\nI'm open to that kind of I Would say Nineteen Ninety ... I think is Nineteen Ninety three no prayer for the dying\nI'm not sure what year that was an arm rambling but no prayer for the dying I Love that I'm a lot of people don't like that but to me that that's also quintessential Iron Man and a and that is one of my favorite blocks of of content that a band has has put out so\nFor some reason they just had lightning in a bottle during those that that decade and and I love it so I made is one of my favorite bands don't talk about them that much but I Do love them very much\nHe ... fans out there they are touring and I believe I don't know what the dates are for us I don't know if they're offered in Europe or the real world or but I Know that there is a ... so that's cool and we're about thirty minutes into the show and I think that the best thing would be to just kind of keep on going on with music\nI don't know if I'll get everything out to you guys but you know that's what happens when when you ramble um I just got really down a rabbit hole with him fall there\nAre just like say if you're sticking around for the twelve thirty to three am she bought a chicken overdrive with clients and trade it's got\nA they have bring you guys are a fusion of urban contemporary gospel music um and it's really cool and it's awesome to listen to them they're amazing people\nSo uh you know if you if you're up them please check them out because they are they drive a long way to get ... get to the station and uh it's worth it I Love us and show up\nOr that that we're gonna not listen to gospel we're moving in the complete opposite direction so uh that's kinda funny at all if you raise 'em 'cause there's ... so I Do opened her as well when I get into that but that these are two tracks of the great southern trying to roost in Nineteen Ninety six\nAnd this is ten enjoy\n\nUm\n[noise]\nTo grow\nWants to\nGo\n\nOut\nAny more [noise]\nAnd you try them some\nMoney\nAnd he ...\nHe um he had a chance\nAnd close your eyes or\nA\nShe and I try not to\nOn\nChanger struck home where I moved to\n... I\nIn a dirty\nMean I Do\nThe line between you\nA\nIs that the women\n[noise]\n\nIn in\nMany of the union and the\n\n\n\nAnd the man that\n... chapters\nMean I hear you know\nI rely on them\nAnd my eyes\nA factory she\nOut here in the\nLast year\n\nDo you need to be able to do in the in the middle and Andy\nEven in\nGood shape and listen\nWas when there is always going to be [noise]\nReally is a\nVery little to do\n\nCure law\nThat was the\nAnd so for some ...\nTeachers could oh\nThe needy\nOf soup over a\nOn what I'm looking for but I chose a hard one to fit in it or not playing heavier music that typically don't do that on air I'm so I'm really happy that I've I've been able to bring ... too I'm In a in a baby and I just think that they're so excellent\nFloods in particular I really love the way that that I don't know how quick to put it but it's it's to me it feels almost ... ... it makes me feel like or or it conjures up it invokes\nAlmost like a ghost to to me and I don't know if anybody else feels that way but that that closing segment is very ... I don't know it's spooky\nEm and it's it's it's it's haunting in a way and I think it's very pretty to listen to me though it is kind of heavy and I ... personally find myself a fan of kind of\nUh what's what's the way to phrase this non standard harmonies and and and know that you wouldn't really expect to go together or a when they're played ... sequentially they're not there during an unexpected order\nI really like that for example queens of the stone age is a fantastic example of a band that kind of uses interesting harmonies and no parents to to make a really cool down and and I ... and I believe that tend than floods both do that I'm really well their guitars dying bag\nDarryl is insane or on a lot of message boards I was reading um about about ... a lot of people said flood was their favorite um Qatar a strong for Penn Tara ah particularly the guitar solo\nAnd I think it's great um I don't know if it's my favorite but it's definitely a very good song I'm In great southern Frank ... is um an interesting album and that the two songs that I played for you guys are actually not very representative of the album as a whole\nAre there are kind of soft or or slower than than what you really find on that album um\nIt's pretty hard core in the sense that a great time and try and kill is um\nAll their ... records grand ... screaming and on every record but I'm rates have been for a return to try and kill really kind of doubled down on that um [noise] but uh yeah and I'm not really big fan of of that style of of singing although I Do think that screaming can be very tasteful\nUm and that's the other thing that I Would just like to before I keep on going is is is when when you bring up like oh yeah I listen to metal a lot of people immediately jumped to scream mow and and things of that nature um which I personally\nAm not a fan of at all\nI'm I'm really not a fan of of of that kind of scream mote thrashing metal although certainly rash and I shouldn't say thrashing ... anthrax and I do like anthrax um but that that kind of ... I'm not really big fan of that um I like there to be some sort of musicality to the music and in my opinion that's\nI'm just not well represented in screaming up except for the record my my style of of metal is more along the iron maiden route and and the black Sabbath route\nUm but that that's just how it is and I do like my artist at like ... and messed it on so that leads me into what that last on was that we listen to which was black tone by mastodon off of the the hunter which was matches on fifth album or listen to a thousand and eleven and that was a single off the album\nUm the hunter is really interesting it was dedicated to um the lead guitarist brother who died in hunting accident uh and that's a common thing you've seen a lot of mastodon albums I'm typically they dedicate an album to some sort of significant event in our lives\nUm and a great example of that is a the newest album is the seventh studio album released a\nJust a book about a year ago in March thirty first of two thousand Seventeen um this was ...\nFamily members who were afflicted with cancer and um some of them who passed away and uh and so a lot of the album focuses on law\nAnd um and disease and stuff like that so I'm really meaningful stuff and then the songs that they put our our electric they're awesome I'm the drummer I Would like to say is\nHe plays out of his mind on every song I mean it's amazing\nAnd um it's really interesting about this break before we\nWe kind of wrap up is that uh every member of the band actually contributes to a or contribute vocals 'em on every record 'em and even the drummer has has songs where he is the the lead singer so it's really interesting\n'cause that's super uncommon um and really cool um so I got about five minutes left and I have a four minute song so I think that works out perfectly\n[noise] um so we're going to wrap up the hour with um ... curse off emperor stand a which was a is the first track on the album I think it's great\nUm personally I don't have enough time to play for you some pirate metal which was which was my subsequent or that but uh that's just how it is a lot of good information came out and a lot of GOOD Music was played so\nI'm going to wrap that up and thank you so much for listening mix mixture stick around if you're interested I'm no calls the actions on air [laughter] to a overdrive with Clarence and try to Scott\nI'm from a twelve thirty to three am a and a half a safe\nGreat and I enjoy the warming weather that's it enjoy\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd on\nA\nAm I getting\n\n\nThe\nThe\nShows late on\nPlane had\nEmailed me [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nDe\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\nUm\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nBe higher\nThink there's a [noise]\nA [noise]\nA day\nThan it is too many men da da da\nDa da\n\n\nDa da\nDa\n\n\n\nFor a\nTo do that [noise]\nHe ran for governor Brownback\n[noise] yeah maybe\nNeed to be in the morning\n[noise]\n\n\nI Know Tom\nHire them [noise]\nAnd um [noise]\n\n\n\n\nBut I still love them they're great hope they have a hope to resolve the car trouble for\nSo they can be backing\nReady to get to play you some some gospel tunes next week\nUh yeah so it's kind of a last minute thing for me to be doing it's a nice so taking the opportunity to play some weird stuff that I\nWould not normally play on my own radio show and I play pretty much everything on my radio I play whatever I Want [noise]\nSo yeah I mean mostly demonstrably longer songs because the mere\nUntil three in the morning so that that will just be one wait for the time passed faster or you know we have a show that that the only earn for an hour a week it's like feel like you've got to cram everything in\nIn a short\nPeriod of time and now I have I have a two and a half hours to spread out for my legs\nMGM tea it's called ...
