know this because I I really don't play that much metal on the show but uh and longtime listeners are familiar with my infatuation with rush of course I Love bands like Led Zeppelin and all those classic ribs but iron maiden\nLike Nineteen eighty two starting or eighty ... eighty to start with number of the beast\nAnd up into\nA ... I like seventh son\nI'm open to that kind of I Would say in Nineteen Ninety I think is Nineteen Ninety three no prayer for the dying\nI'm not sure what year that was an arm ramble and but ... I Love that I'm a lot of people don't like that but to me that that's also quintessential Iron Man and a and that is one of my favorite blocks of of content that a band have has put out so [noise]\nFor some reason they just had lightning in a bottle during the that that decade and and I love it so I made is one of my favorite bands don't talk about them that much but I Do love them very much\nFor any are made fans out there they are touring and I believe I don't know what the dates are for us I don't know if they're offered in Europe are the real world or but I Know that there is a ... so that's cool and er about thirty minutes into the show and I think that the best thing would be to just kind of keep on going on with music\nI don't know if I'll get everything out to you guys but you know that's what happens when when you ramble um [noise] I just got really down the rabbit hole with him a folder\nOf just like say if you're sticking around for the twelve thirty to three am slot a chicken overdrive with clients and trade it's got\nA they have bring you guys are a fusion of urban\nContemporary gospel music um and it's really cool and it's often those into and they're amazing people so are you know if you if you're up them please check 'em out because they are they drive a long way to get ... get to the station and uh it's worth it I Love the show up\nOr that that we're gonna not listen to gospel we're moving in the complete opposite direction so uh that's kinda funny at all if you were um 'cause it's a ... so I Do a ... when I get into that but that these are two tracks of a great southern trying to roost in Nineteen Ninety six\nAnd this is ten enjoy\n\n\n\n[noise]\nOr\nWants to\nBe\nRight you're right you're\nShowering\nAny more [noise]\nYou try and some\nA\n...\n...\nMean I sure do\nThe ...\nShe showed me a chance a shield\nMarried\nTo a game changer stronger animal where I'm sure the\n...\nIn the house and she I\nMean I Do\nThe line between ...\nAnd our\nWomen\n[noise]\n\nIn\nThe union and\n\n[noise]\n\nAnyway I'm In a\n... masters\nAnd your eyes or you know\nI Would I Would ...\nAnd my eyes\nVery angry she\nOut here in already\n\nDo you need to be able to do in the in the middle and Andy\nYeah even in\nGood shape\nWas living there is always do they do is keep the\nIf he is a\nVery little to\n\nCure\nYou know saying where I'm from\nThat was the\nAnd scope for that has a ...\nClaw\nThe needy\nA\n... is a hard one to fit in it or not playing heavier music that typically don't do that on there [noise] um so I'm really happy that I've I've been able to bring ... too I'm In a in a baby\nAnd I just think that they're so\nUm and floods in particular I really love the way that that I don't know how quick to put it but it's it's to me it feels almost ...\nI ... it makes me feel like or or it conjures up it invokes almost like a ghost to to me and I don't know if anybody else feels that way but that that closing segment is very ... I don't know it's spooky\nEm and it's it's it's it's haunting in a way and I think it's very pretty to listen to him even though it is kind of heavy and I ... personally find myself a fan of kind of\nUh what's what's the way to phrase this non standard harmonies and and and know that you wouldn't really expect to go together or or when they're played ... sequentially they're not there during an unexpected order\nI really like that for example queens the stone age is a fantastic example the band that kind of uses interesting harmonies and no parents to to make a really cool down and and I ... and I believe that tens and floods both do that I'm really well their guitars dying bag\nDarryl is insane or on a lot of message boards I was reading um about about ... a lot of people said flood was their favorite um Qatar a strong for ... a particularly the guitar solo\nAnd I think it's great um I don't know if it's my favorite but it's definitely a very good song and great southern Frank ... is um an interesting album and that the two songs that I played for you guys are actually not very representative of the album as a whole\nAre there are kind of soft or or slower than than what you really find on that album um [noise]\nIt's pretty hard core in the sense that a great time and try and kill is\nKnow what a lot of other ... records and granted ... screaming and on every record but I'm rates have been for a return to try and kill really kind of doubled down on that\nUm [noise] but ah yeah and I'm not really big fan of of that style of of singing although I Do think that screaming can be very tasteful um\nAnd that's the other thing that I Would just like to before I keep on going is is is when when you bring up like oh yeah I listen to a metal a lot of people immediately jumped to scream Owen and things of that nature um which I personally\nAm not a fan of at all I'm I'm really not a fan of of of that kind of scream mote thrashing metal although certain thrush I shouldn't say thrashing ... anthrax and I do like anthrax um but that that kind of ... I'm not really big fan of that\nUm I like there to be some sort of musicality to music and in my opinion that's [noise]\nUm it's just not well represented in screaming up except for the record my my style of of metal is more along the iron maiden route and the and the black Sabbath route\nUm but that that's just how it is and I do like my artist that like ... and messed it on so that leads me into what that last time was that we listen to which was black tongue by mastodon off of the the hunter which was mass did on fifth album or listen to doesn't an eleven and that was a single off the album\nUm the hunter is really interesting it was dedicated to um the lead guitarist brother who died in hunting accident uh and that's a common thing you've seen a lot of mastodon albums I'm typically they dedicate an album to some sort of significant event in their lives\nUm and a great example of that is a very newest album is seven studio album released a just a ... about a year ago in March thirty first of two thousand Seventeen um\nNumbers um family members who were uh flipped it with cancer and um some of them who passed away and uh and so a lot of the album focuses on law\nAnd um and disease and stuff like that so I'm really meaningful stuff and then the songs that they put our our electric they're awesome I'm the drummer I Would like to say\nIs he plays out of his mind on every song I mean it's amazing and um it's really interesting about this right before we\nWe kind of wrap up is that uh every member of the band actually contributes to a or contribute vocals 'em on every record 'em and even the drummer has has songs where he's the the lead singer so it's really interesting\n'cause that's super uncommon um and really cool um so I got about five minutes left and I have a four minute song so I think that works out perfectly [noise]\nUm so we're going to wrap up the hour with 'em both ends cursed off the emperor stand a which was a is the first track on the album I think it's great\nUm personally I don't have enough time to play for you some pirate metal which was which was my subsequent or that but uh that's just how it is I buy a lot of good information came out and a lot of GOOD Music was played so\nI'm going to wrap that up and thank you so much for listening mix mixture stick around if you're interested I'm no cause the actions on air [laughter] to a

E. S. U.\nPenn so until next time this is Jimmy curator Santa Barbara sang remember\nThe root of rock and the root of stole is Nineteen fifties rock and roll so long everybody all\n[noise]\nA a\nHow\nGoing to buy\n\nKnew\nAnd making money\nIt he\nBut if we are all giving in a fair in a fair way I'm not necessarily even way but a fair way and everyone understands how we've come to those solutions to gather\nThat's what ... what do you can look like in my eyes um and I think the best example is an education at that as a parent advocate I find the way that we fund education is unfair oftentimes you're a ZIP Code is the number one way to recognize\nOn many different measures one of them being a standardized test is often predicted by race or by gender [noise] that's not fair so if we recognize that different races\nAre behind that may need additional resources it and all of our best interest to provide those in the capital and fair way so I Would say what does that look like specifically are looking at the education cost sharing which is the the formula that we pay for public education outside of your local property tax\nThat should be based off with students need 'em and not to be Frank politicians\nAnd so what made you adopt approach you know equity versus the quality what let me know what what street to adopt that approach of governing a in you know into your line of thinking\n\nIt's very it's very clear that are in many in our community have a need 'em and we want to address those needs in a set of what's going on in the ... and a fair approach but that doesn't look like it doesn't look like ... even like so for instance\nUm I I bring a lot of back to sports often because I think that's a good uh allegory\nI'm I Am terrible at basketball in many ways would never be good at basketball\nA butterfly suddenly we're a little bit taller that would be something to be helpful for me right but if I if I told people that would have to be extra tall is not going to help right so how do we meet people where they're at 'em to get the things that they meet\nI see oh that's a that's a good example and so um you know what skills experiences which you bring to position how the skills to help you represent Middletown for example you know you'll be working or you know perhaps in a divided journal suddenly depending on elections and\nYou'll be starving on committee I'm like ... you know people the others\nThat kind of gets facing and then\nA representing Middletown the number one is listening I'm as a leader I'm not trying to go to the capital to I there's some things I may have a little bit more expertise and others will think education is one of those business principles are another\nUm but there's a lot of learning that I have to do\nAnd I think our our residents and our people in our state are vastly resource rich\nSo we need to go to the experts and many times with people or their own experts of their own story so it's my job and my role to really listen to those stories and share those stories back with every one of the capitals so we can find solutions around\nUm those stories but for the first the ... the number one thing I think I wanted to bring us listening approach I'm not there to talk I'm not there to share really they're taught to listen first and that's how we're going to find solutions to I've been working I'm In a very diverse community that have lived in the middle of town I don't think you get any more diverse than that in the state of Connecticut or I Would say it around the country\nUm I live in I grew up in a neighborhood that I talk about fairly often and I would I say that I'm seeing Jesus on the walls wasn't unusual and Sunday dinners a where every one of the family was there we had big lavish meals that were high in fat but often very tasty\nAh we're all part of the experience\n[noise] now my talking about the sort of like southern roots in my own household or my talking about my best friend house Damien oh I'm In the polish household um there was so much in common nowadays\nThat there it was really hard to to focus on the differences I still being able to find that commonality is something that Middletown has taught me really well and I think we can take that similar approach to the Capitol um [noise] okay\nAnd then you know suppose you're an elected member now the general family in the ... Nineteen much life session it's humane right now and then really well discuss than an hour\nIt's an office in the legislator the state will face it protected to play one billion dollar budget deficit for the fiscal year twenty twenty you know ... you know and then explain how what you can find this problem or you know how would you what pushes you would take and how would you ... how would you oppose how Connecticut can fix it fiscal problems\nAnd budget you know the priorities you want to have\nA foot forward I mean as you mentioned I'm going to take an equity approach um how does everyone get what they need um as a in a fair and equitable an equitable way so some of the things I think we're in we're gonna have to look at revenue I'm a ... what's going to the expense side of the ... the revenue side and I can say is the one that has served on that several nonprofit boards\nAlmost served on the YMCA board the circle society are currently serving the United way board and hospitals playoffs are small children's theater\nUm I'm In the central part of a middle town over and over and over again I hear a not not here I felt I've seen the budgets were a lot of state funding has been taking away\nWe've cut before was cutting the fat and then we heard it was cutting the lives of the Muslim the lean and now it's I think we're kind of I mean I don't there's not that much more we can ask for a nonprofit community that are serving our most vulnerable to give up\nThey've ... they've given up as much as they can now it's time to go back and reinvest uh those that are are serving our community so I think we can still you can find\n'em inadequacies and things that are um ineffective we're gonna have to be data driven as we're looking into a very abilities and things that um they need to be either remodeled or or cut or\nUm reevaluating those things are going to be part of the process but I think a big part of it and is going to be about the revenue side so we're going to have to provide a more progressive taxation model we're going to see those were going to see those that can invest more into our overall system would have to look at additional revenue streams of the\nThose funds to go back and invest in our community um through the food business or through education I think that's going to be part of part of the solution [noise]\nAnd so you mentioned you know looking into new sources of revenue for the state and one of them wanted which you just alluded to was the legalization of marijuana by now it's a hot issue about highway imposed do you support highly polls Institute in them\nThat the tolls we need more information on um I saw you asking for like a cost benefit analysis or what what information you need\nWe're I think we're we're going to need because it's a complicated issue I think many of our our community think that if we can just put 'em on as we're told\nThe feds have clearly ... said that there will be severe financial consequences and doing that sort of measure\nI personally travel to work all the way in Stanford\nSo that means each and every day or many days throughout the week I'm On ... nine I'm On Fifteen about Ninety five Ninety One that that's a ... that at the end but also the one that fits in hours of traffic every week I can say firsthand that we need to invest in our infrastructure system that brings jobs\nThat's going to make us more I'm competitive as we're trying to compete for a high quality students in a compared to New York in Rhode Island and Massachusetts we clearly need to invest in infrastructure is a huge it's a huge part is also going to be a way to help make our environment a lot more safer and green\nWith that said when we look at tolls we also want to make sure that we're not unfairly charging our own residence we want to make sure that those that are getting the most benefit from it are paying their fair share\nAnd we're going to have to look to see where the best place to do so I wouldn't want our community here in Middletown to have to pay an exorbitant amount to be able to go just go to work from Middletown to Harvard or middle towns in New haven I wouldn't want us to necessarily pay just to be able to go to the beach we have to we have to think\nA culturally um and it's been an awful theaters or racial impact too\nAnd then also so which so would you be supporting the Connecticut transportation revenue lock book lot lot lot bucks amendment saying that all whether I'll ever knew but typically look are allocated for transportation will be in this locked\nBox I Would have to get more information generally speaking I'm not in favor of locked box type a budgeting I went to I don't want the legislators hands to be tied up in the future\nI mean for instance I Would personally love a lock box for education I Want to reach me be invested in our children I think\nThat's the best way to protect our future those are the best way to invest in our community that's sort of locked box I Would want\nA but that's not an option because once again with all the legislation needs to be able to be flexible and adaptable to the current needs I'm of the community\nAnd I would say that things would have been tallied would apply to to transportation\nI see so uh yeah it's you know you know if it's not just another big issue right now that both ah both
