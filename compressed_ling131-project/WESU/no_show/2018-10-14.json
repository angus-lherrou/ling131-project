earlier part that we have a mission department here I'm at the church for a whole bunch I've got um led by a sister a dress that we have a big team working on this where\nIt it involves a lot of things getting sponsors for the event model bottles um closed for a food we are going to have food there to coordinate in that piece as well so very very involved\nMhm so you would have been modeling some of your own people or the judge people coming in on drifting are your mention of the you know which\nYes I'm definitely they were going to be members of for a whole bunch modeling as well including myself and the other members of the team um but we are open to other churches and and people outside of churches to just come in if you want if you're an aspiring models want some experience I Want to get involved in this event you can give us a call that the church to to be a part of it\nAll ride on what Jim this lead to because you know without modeling is a big career a new job as its own industry I mean people might be oh they're thinking well you know this might be a way to get my foot in the door what is going to lead up to read the drugs are one time event you monitor your when you go down to it I mean\nNo absolutely not everything we do is with meaning and purpose we do have this modeling event every year um\nLot of poverty and we as a church one to really go out and extend the hand of God to our brothers and sisters so all the proceeds from this fashion show will go towards buying food clothing\nUm Bible for new converts toys for um children providing medical support so that people have signed a dash as a matter of fact we're\nGoing on a mission stripping twenty Nineteen so all the funds from this event will go to war I'm supporting the people in Bangladesh\nAnd ... and um you your server been on a near the mission\nI have been um last year twenty Seventeen we went to the country of Haiti um to provide mission support and it was really a life changing experience\nOn what kind of programs are you seeing you know I'm British or you know to be a beer Homs Ruben word expecting you know people from America you're you're married very regarding\nWherever you know it's our grid here but of course very strict in a bar and you know people to them with their different needs or during the programs are used in\nWell you know the biggest thing to do is to bring hope and to bring love\nWe know that you know sometimes even here when we're here going through our our different um different challenges in life\nSometimes you just want to see someone that shows concern for what you're going through because\nIf you don't you just keep on thinking down down and you you you surround yourself with darkness but we are led in the light of Christ so shine through us so that others may see are good work and really come and have an interest I desire to know who is this God who send these people\nTo come and help me so we definitely have seen progress you know building hoping people and we have to supply the basic needs of people right you have to live on food and clothes yourself so we're doing both\nOn providing needs to the spiritual man and the physical man\nSo who is not a big part a big part to hope and love\n... what kind of tell us a little bit more about your voice I mean apart from\nHelping to you know put the pressure on shore together what other what other roared through your blood in the church I Know your purse or you know pretty much you know we had him on this program before ... all the good things are here a boat in with their lives about yours to avoid a roll your really blue in the church uh it's of\nWhat I Am one who would love to get really involved in any way I can with the times that I have I loved keeping myself busy in the church though\nI'm involved in um the single parents ministry there are choir we have an administrative a great administrative team that really um gets involved in all the activities in the church providing the different ah ministry departments with support as they put on their different events that I'm involved in that as well\nMhm and I'm a you mentioned bongo dashing next year I Know you're you are the charges came up from one mission or didn't probably two or three weeks back or what have you heard about that one I Know you're actually didn't go to that one but whatever you heard on we're we're did they go\nThey went to Jamaica in\nOrder to do the ... the reason was Jamaica\nOh well actually we went to Jamaica and there was ...\n... you know or whatever you heard of that those\n... and many people are more serve their they prayed for many people people came to Christ\nOr the similar to what we're doing in Haiti meeting the needs of the people they're bringing hope and bringing peace bringing love bringing joy\nSo many I mean the path of preaching the stadium there he said the stadium with full you know people are hungry for the gospel so where where they're really just be in the hands of God so it was a very successful trip boat in Peru and in Jamaica and as a matter of fact we're going to Jimmy again still collecting items for that as well\nOr are done as this group just as much now live by the law and order by his\nKnow does a lot of community an older each event on that's a great thing that's what we want to see the churches do not just\nGathering in four walls every Sunday our Wednesday in the week on just having a good time by themselves the Charlie is with the community and that and that's that is certainly as sometime we tend to get clothing or or instead of and we\nFigure once we are in it but that's not what the church is about the Charles ... churches about reaching out\nTo others that are you a little less fortunate than we are you know we have to remember where we were before we actually got in and then you know so we got to reach out for those that are less fortunate and bring them into the fold you wanted to say something or you\nKnow it it's just a social thing I mean I I was just reading um ... the other day a first John three Seventy through Eighteen anything but whoever has the wealth good than these his brother and me and shuts is high fun hand how does this\nHow does the love of God biting him ... let us not love in word our tone but indeed any truth and and that's certainly what we're trying to deal\nIn stride and you know I'm an\nEver be the word is in the scripture their problem is that a lot of course a lot of times you know we tend to\nYou know kind of just to be I probably would say it's selfish you know always you know once we get there and we see it in there and then natural random also you know you have good friends is is socialize with people I Know it's a step up in life sometime\nYou can you relate to them again you know so it's I don't think it's just very Charlie but it just I'm not sure all the way we progress also some of us I Would say not all the force but you know we should always ... open and reaching out to others\nI was brought us into the forwards or the commission or to do with the very same you're a man or ride All right so I wanted to give out the venue or scores we've been doing ... ...
