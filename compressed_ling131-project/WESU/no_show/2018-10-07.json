in America would call it soccer is a is a very good example that that all\nAll of their national teams very often they they they don't a little traditionally best country you know so um and and of course the French team that won the world cup last summer several of them very good example of that\nAnd and this is just a this is the thing and and it's a kind of like one of those things that you kind of hope that the situation\nSports and um and entertainment in an art those are the kind of places that have uh the\nFirst place that I needed to penetrate from the people an awful likes to

seem to recall that there was that they don't say a contentious issue I round main cinema highlighting their country of origin during after the world cup yeah I I think\nIt might have been a situation that uh that was um [noise]\nThat what the that was a little bit emotional because they have the the country had just won some things that it's essentially very very difficult to when they they had achieved a great achievement and I think that's a lot of emotions were kind of life on top and ended with the situation with Trevor Noah are\nAlso very famous you were talking about this or that when he's referring to the African ness of the French national team as as many of them are coming from the African back on almost all the majority of them are kind of stuff in the background\nCelebrating

people they need to understand that when we're saying\nThe things we're saying it as a thing where and I say it's not a way it works\nFor ... does does Africa me like it's not like when somebody\nFrom this and that European country butter the African country of origin we're not saying that that would be a negative thing in in in his or her life we're saying that that that's a beautiful thing like I mean we can get to we can get too much deeper into the conversation and about the globalization and about the reasons why people are moving and and\nMike racing around the world all sorts of things uh\nAn an and that's a very different kind of one of those but we can't really talk about that than an individual level with metal hearing about like a human being with time say that oh you know or or

N. A. P. people need a these food stamps more than ever this apps especially after the flood refuse um refused a living wage the reviews of living wage many of these people\nWho are flooded they are work hourly jobs they are not getting paid right now I'm even though they're\nFormer John might have been seven dollars an hour now they're getting zero dollars an hour 'cause it's a flood devastated area people don't have the resources and when the governor and others said evacuate they couldn't even evacuated because they don't have money or they don't have cars they don't have the ability to\nTo give federal money but this state has refused federal money that would have helped the up poor prior to the storm so\nThat they would have a buffer against its own that's the real true buffers against the storm and now everything\nThat was already tougher these people has been exasperated that's the story we must keep our eyes on because some people are looking at what happened on the coast we actually dodged a bullet on this coast because\nUm you know if you remember as a came into us we're supposed to be a category four and a it slowed down quite a bit and let this devastation but by the time it leads reached a inland it was a tropical storm and all this devastation so imagine if it was a category for\nBut if you come inland now when you see these rivers are mostly the poorer live along these rivers in these rural communities they are completely devastated and when you add\nThat the environmental devastation the coal lashed hog farms bacteria the poison that's being put into the water table and put in the rivers this catastrophic and tremendous tremendous catch the cat is his out catastrophe I'm Sorry\nBut some of it could have been buffered it could have been made better if our state particularly people um in Congress would help the poor in advance of this storm and would make sure everybody has health care living wages and we have cleaned up\nA these coal ashes and coal ash ponds and we stop using fossil fuels if those kinds of things would have happened in advance of the storm there wouldn't have been so much damage to the poor into a least of these after storm so\nI Want to read you a letter from a resident of hadn't in North Carolina who wrote to the New York times quote unfortunately many families or do not have the resources to put gas in our vehicles I myself came here to the city to care for my father who was diagnosed with\nAnd a double wide trailer that was a just one letter so talking about the situation so I Want to turn to the small towns of ... in eastern North Carolina the first town chartered\nBy a freed slaves in the United states in Eighteen eighty five originally known as the freedom hill it sits on unwanted floodplain along the tar river that's flooded many many times the towns\nWebsite notes quote the flooding like the threat of white supremacy has plagued prince ... since its settlement major floods occurred two years after the communities founding and again in Nineteen Nineteen Nineteen twenty four Nineteen twenty eight Nineteen forty and Nineteen\nFifty eight the Army Corps of engineers eventually built a dyke that helped reduce the flooding but in Nineteen Ninety nine heavy rains from hurricane Floyd submerged parts of print spill under twenty three to twenty three feet of water once more uh they did have a dyke built up at the water\nActually went around the dyke and it came up behind\nHouses and destroyed everything I've been a lot of water also came up to the sewer systems\nSo many residents many residents asked a you know where they worried about whether or not or there'll be allowed to rebuild on this land and the answer is yes I you know I Am they said trying to do everything so they can make sure\nThat they will be able to stay in the same land\nThat there for a father bought so that they could have a somewhere to live\nIn a it was after\nThat the north Carolina extremist politician said quote we don't need healthcare we don't need a living wage we don't need a deal with the environmental issues if anything they are deregulated and here they are again in the uh the state where fifty six percent of the children or\nAnd lo wealth so this is something people also don't know the majority of the uh poor people in North Carolina are are white and um even in eastern North Carolina while those counties are the county's with the highest percentage\nOf African Americans a majority of the people in those counties are a Caucasian and a majority of the people who are poor are also Caucasian and so it's a it's a race question\nAny class question at the denial question it's a question that after these storms normally happen people go back to business as usual or we get something like we see the extremists of Trump where you are denied things that people need\nA then when the storm hits you come in and you visit and you access so your concern\nBut policies prior to certain created these problems for these people in a way that they wouldn't have some of these problems they have now\nAnd if they hadn't been so vicious and so mean and so we're gas were aggressive in policies when\nThe days were sunny we're going to have to learn how to do this better and people are suffering and people are afraid all over eastern North Carolina and you know the old saying goes the time to fix the roof\nIs when the sun's out now when the storm is upon us and once again that's proven with the north and South Carolina storm and Hurricane Florence\nWFSU record fair is next Sunday a week from today eleven AM to four pm Beck and call a great place to go and find on [noise] treasures that you're looking for in record collections [noise] and so let's continue on with\nTopic today so we were going to talk about Krystle Mason\nCrystal meth and I'm an African American mother of three went to the polls and voted in a this was a new member aids to thousands sixteen\nHers was a a provisional ballot however as she hadn't been to her a polling place\nNear Fort Worth Texas for several years she had been in prison for tax related offenses\nAnd was under federal supervise released quote I went to the local church where I went before I went to prison to vote she said I'm and basically when they looked up to a on the rocks are they realized her name wasn't there\nAnd ah so she got ready to walk away they stopped her and they told her hey you can fill out a provisional ballot provisional ballot\nIt's something that's filled out when they can't find your names on the rolls and basically your your vote is set aside and then afterwards um they verify your credentials they verify you do in fact lived there and they are in the ballot count so she kept it a provisional ballot at their insistence\nAnd if you're in the right location it will count if you're not it won't so I'm there wasn't really any harm and casting that fire ballot so she went down and uh the the the lady helped her fill it out so when Krystle didn't know\nWhat she didn't know was that in Texas you can't vote while on parole or supervise released what happened next is kind of hard to believe she was charged with voter fraud convicted convicted and sentenced to five years in prison on top of that shock\nAdditional ten months in federal prison on top of the uh five years that she was already a sentence and of course she's appealing that sentence 'em but there's absolutely no reason Krystle should have been prosecuted um\nShe was not aware that she was not eligible to vote provisional ballots exist precisely for people who are uncertain about they're eligible to vote and they uh allow a person to vote for visually until elections official can check out\nAfter election day what are the voter was eligible or not if not the ballot is discounted is basically that simple\nSo Texas state law is clear a person can only be convicted or a voter fraud or if he or she intended to commit the offense crystal Mason clearly did not and\nKim coal ah by writers stress the point saying that quote her supervised release officer testified on the stand that he did not tell crystal that she was not eligible to vote 'em so uh ... county is very proud to be the largest urban or red county in a country\nAnd they the local Republican Party wants to keep it that way so according to the sense of seeing\nA project felony disenfranchised eyes meant prevents over six million people from voting in us these laws vary from state to state in Vermont in Maine for example convicted felons can vote from jail Marilyn Connecticut in Rhode Island now permit people on probation or parole to vote so\nCompared crystal masons case with that of a\nTerry ... wrote a white woman in Iowa who is ... ... a convicted of voter fraud trying to vote for president Donald Trump twice wrote was sentenced to two years probation and find seven or fifty dollars felony a disenfranchised and ... ...\nWith one and fifty six for non African American so Latinos are disproportionately impacted although statistics\nI'm really weren't available to to discuss so that that jury is still out there was a growing movement to reconsider these policies Marc Mauer executive director of the Sentencing Project set in Florida for example over one point four million convicted felons\nHave been permanently stripped of their right to vote Donald Trump won Florida by just one hundred and twelve thousand votes emir one point two percent of the total vote given that I'm African American vote\nTraditionally democratic by a very large margin it's not surprising that Republican support laws that increasingly restrict\nI'm African American voter turnout voters in Florida will have a chance\nTo change the law to share with a ballot initiative amendment for\nDriven by quote returning a citizens and quote as the Florida writes restoration coalition calls formerly incarcerated people if it passes all formerly incarcerated fell into a excluding those who have committed murder or felony sexual assaults will regain their right to vote so\nCrystal a Mason is appealing her voter fraud conviction\nFor which she has been sentenced to five years in prison despite this she must turned herself into federal authorities\nAnd she uh I'm Sorry she did turn yourself into federal authorities on September thirteenth to begin a ten month sentence after which she will resume twenty six months of supervised release when asked if she ever plan to vote again she replied a quote I Do\nI Do and that's what I'm encouraging my kids to get out or there's\nThis is the only way we can make a difference right now and quote\nSo people of color are losing it seems the right to vote\nRoad tracks in South Florida and quote I was waiting for the train to come so I could jump or in front of it in my life and quote he was homeless unemployed recently released from prison and addicted to drugs and alcohol to train never came he cross the tracks and checked himself into a substance abuse program\nHe went on to go to college and now just months away from receiving his law degree meat however I Will not be able to practice law in Florida as a former felon he cannot joined the bar that is one of his\nRights that has been stripped permanently by far Florida as draconian laws\nIn a democracy if one wants to change the law you vote for lawmakers who represent your views yet as an ex felon and Florida meat has lost the right to vote for the rest of his life\nIt's called sell any disenfranchisement tribesmen and it's a a and is permitted in eleventh states ah the states are as follows Alabama Arizona Florida Iowa Kentucky Mississippi\nThe brass kind of out of Tennessee Virginia in Wyoming\nIs enforced in different degrees like a a patchwork across the U.S in Thirteen states and the district of Columbia you get your right back upon release from prison and others you have to uh get through your probation and parole in Maine and Vermont prisoners retain the right to vote while they're incarcerated\nUs attorney general Eric Holder address the issue this week at a legal symposium at Georgetown University quote across the country today\nAn estimated five point eight million Americans that's five point eight million of our fellow citizens are prohibited from voting because of current or previous felony convictions that's more than the individual population of thirty one us states close to six million Americans\nDenied the right the basic right to vote and because of the racial\nDenied the right to vote a holder continue quote the current scope of these policies is not I'm not only to significant to ignore it is also to an jumped to tolerate in quote\nThe Georgetown event with co sponsored by the Leadership Conference a coalition of civil rights legal and human rights groups last September the group released a report titled democracy imprisoned\nIn it the group writes Florida's disenfranchisement a rate remains the highest and most racially just a parent in the United states it's no coincidence\nThat this key swing state is home to more than one million of the nation's nearly six million disenfranchised and former Florida governor Charlie Crist\nUm ease the laws making the application for the reinstatement of rights automatic but in two thousand eleven his successor Republican Rick Scott impose a waiting period of at least five years for anyone to apply to the clemency board meat told\nAbe's basically had told the group even after applying the processing time for application takes up words to six years so in reality and individual will have to wait anywhere between eleventh uh Thirteen Years just to see if they have

I watch the trailer and I laughed throughout the whole ... I'm going to check it out when it comes to check it out watch actually\nThere's three teen titans cartoons and not many people know about the first one the first one was from Nineteen sixty seven and it was done by Phil ... with Ted night doing you know the narration like he did for a Superman Batman Adventures and my hero acclimate\nBut the teen titans I guess there was like seven or eight episodes those are awesome check them out by Phil or even heard of that yeah\nYeah I Hope that if you check out if he chickens anger each show an extreme [laughter] you'll you'll see some photos that I put up from the DVD that I watch it I still watch Saturday morning cartoons rose my wife will make me breakfast all sit in front of the TV before we are you and your Jamie\nYou know because they can't find any in my die by ... those types fourteen no [laughter]\nEvery time every time we we went to a store and they had like a Superman Wednesday she was on my God I'm going to buy this for us to please [laughter] and now my my damn it close enough [laughter]\nI have a limitation tee time to go to the movie is worth seeing were oh yeah definitely um Cody uh my son and I we were the only adult father and son a couple of ... per se or in the theater when we saw it and we're laughing nurse inside jokes there about Joan ... swamp be\nUm there was stuff about ... and and where laugh and laugh\nIt's funny and you see like the fathers and grandfathers just turn around and I were giggling and this was the one that Nick Cage play super Manhattan right yeah yeah okay and we only get to play [laughter] but yeah we're laughing at all these jokes\nAnd then of course there's cuts being at the end in a movie about the serious teen tightened cartoon they come up and we're like oh my God that was awesome and again the other parents like\nWhat's wrong with it I'm not I mean I definitely want to check it out now this morning I told you are and knowing from talking to you on on a Facebook Instagram off stuff\nYou're a huge fan obviously were what two months away from the movie that nobody ever thought would ever get me Deborah what twenty first I think the twenty first on early Christmas present for you ... a ... and um what's her name um [noise] the one place Mira\nAmber heard ever heard ever heard thank you very much and [laughter]\nSo we got we got to the ... we had a a a trailer like about a month ago or so get a little bit more than that and then yesterday or ... or friday I think he's right at twelve ... they put out like it's kind of like not really a trailer it's a trailer slash seen almost an extended scene I'm about five minutes long\nBut I didn't want to be spoiled um what are you going to get spoiled I just I don't want I don't like when you see too too much of something but I Want to I got to stay\nWith one thing that impressed me the most\nAnd I didn't see it live in New York ... but one of my friends got a picture of it I thought was the black man the costume oh he is ... is really really comic screen accurate ... you know I I don't mind when they do things a little differently I Know\nAt the end of the trailer they show Arthur in his full golden now in the kingly arm armor\nI don't mind that and the just the movie he was in that other outfit you got to change things a little bit for these movies well\nIt it it's in my opinion\nThe Justice League outfit was just a lengthy and armor right 'cause if you remember he goes up to mirror and he says I Need a favor he doesn't even have a nephew tried it that he just has a regular tried and if you watch the trailers you'll see him in a warm a ocean master when they start fighting there's two different ... that go on\nTo the trident that he had it definitely I'm from Atlanta but I don't think it's neck tunes tried and he is able to control the water and stuff but then that could be something to do with a mirror and her magic because she's a water bender actually fry 'em in\nThe ... what a shame how she's ... she's from a different the measure was different from a different\nDimension in our originally or harassment were supposed to get married and it was through Atlanta him all that he had to marry in Atlanta and so she got all pissed off and like trying to kill him in ... so it was coming back I think it was I commend thirty five volume one thirty five\nI'm so she always wanted to talk of man talk [laughter]\nChina oh enough of them she always\nWanted to kill our command throughout all I mean not just because of baby Arthur dying at a spoiler alert um [noise] they have a kid and of course\nIf they really going to go with mirror wanting to kill the man supposedly she loved\nI've got a question for you as a D.C fan D.C movie fan now this is going back a few years mhm but there's a decent movie that I've always felt is maligned way too much and John and we actually agree on this I Want to know your opinion on it\nSo I agree I Know you're a fan I think that members your rent is not a good movie that's my opinion Justice League I enjoyed I actually had a fun time with it it was a little bit shoveled from the two director thing there was you could kinda tell there were some teams that might maybe than lined up\nGreen Lantern what Ryan Reynolds not that bad of a movie I'm going to say right now I Want to know what you're going to say about it\nI have it on my phone so far as me you watch it I watch I can watch it all the time I Know it the dialogue there's a few movies in my life in in in my head rather um no one knows me better than me because I live here I'm playing at my head\nOr that I Know that dialogue for one will be smoking in the band it another another it'll be a new hope Superman Movie and Ryan Reynolds dream lantern I I loved it I thought it\nMay mainly because there was something I Want it ever since I was a\nKid I thought they did a really good job the special effects yeah I it it was ... it can look great yeah if you watch the extended cut from the director had never even seen that\nI have the Blu ray I've never watched it I have to check it I'll check it out in the theater okay well the movement of the well in in the movie the first thing that he does he ... he construct the race car truck right which I thought was great okay do you know why he did that because he plays with his nephews race car track in the in the in the extended cut\nThat's what he does he walks out of the room he hits at the card that everything that he constructs was right there why didn't they should have kept it in\nI always feel like that movie has a bad rap and I also think as much as he likeable I think Ryan Reynolds plays into I bet you if you really asked him I bet you he would say it's a good movie\nFun of it and you know if you did that pulls yeah oh yeah I thought that was great it was a fun joke at the end how he goes and killed\nYou mail [laughter]\n[laughter] that's a lot more like me who branches out every little no company that well I I mean if if if it's\nUm I Do have independence inside a my collection now Joe saint Pierre at the new ... Chris campaign and at first world digging that stuff\nBob Sally and salvage ... yeah I I met him at ... last year and that's a very cool book Bob Bob is an awesome awesome guy um you know that there's two college players you might know from the ... community or Tim O'Reilly and scarlet fly\nUm they're actually in South measures to contest and their likenesses or and also of I play the bad guy by Alex ...\nAlex is a Alex is a friend of ours really he's done a couple I just saw him two days ago at at a African American ...\nAsk him I play the bad guy issue three ask them who the character that got his license plate robbed was based after\n... wasn't you know I ... I read the book it was ... I read that book that was what was the name of that press um because the work I'm mostly knowing him for\nIs oxymoron for comic tribe and the one he's doing now bank thinks thinking you think is a book I just picked up the first five or issue trade\nWhich I had had a couple of single ... uh but I wanted to get the trade and I picked up issues sex\nI started reading it she takes a village to have I just kinda was flipping through it I don't know if you've seen it yet or not it is it to the book is about this area and Scotland ... this terrible town uh this one neighborhood and there are these\nClowns that it's a it's a book about urban legend urban legend but uh this whole issue is done in multi panel pages and it's done during a rainstorm really it is ... honestly I I ... yeah well I don't know what I'm saying every page is done it\nGoing through one of the most memorable single issues will comic I've seen a long time a Cormac is awesome he did he did a Batman for me an alien from alien I had a couple of shows he's just the friendliest dude and that was one of those guys like he does such great work and I can't wait till he blows up ...\nWe had um indicate glare two or three times him in Andy who worked on it was blood on tap and the or the or not and you are not yeah we had we had them in the gay glare um I think Andy only came does whenever we have ... when you guys come down would bring yogurt and he goes\nPizza we always sit down and have you with us and ah they were talking and then we were I think it was that massive comics on I think it was something like that they came over to me goes hey why don't you don't open up the book and I open up the book\nThere and I'm like holy cow again ... of this is pretty awesome and ... like ... where am I in Alex goes or you're in the fire but it's not going to be up behind know behind the ... all the panel [laughter]\nYeah that was that was pretty cool that they put me in the book I was about an awesome yeah yeah\nI'm going up the autumn either for the U.S [laughter]\nI think is the first book that he turned me on a long long time really I think you think it's a really good at it it just the idea of it being an anthology\nAnd you get all like each issue was about a different character or group of character and all ties together no but that's what I'm saying if if it ties together but it's in the anthology of that in one place\nBut you're not and if you see characters from one issue Mr dig the Fox I dressed like a Fox News like vigilante instead on an issue too even though he's not star you see him in the background like you know like dang a body or something\nHe's Mr Degas I'm like a lot of the Congress and you know I think that he is the ... yeah it's a yeah Alex is just man he's just he's a great artist he's agreed to have you ever read future proof Alex To work\nA um subway train and doesn't realize that she's a ghosts and it's like a year later and she's going through her life but it it turns out she's actually ghost\nAnd um I've been waiting for you to to come I think he said it's coming out soon so but if you get a chance I think it's called I think it's called crossing it's crossed a it was for a different company altogether and I asked him about the other day and he said this is the second issue will be coming up soon\nI'm we're getting close to the end so ready yeah I Know is why we ... it looks like today I don't know I stuck it out records here I guess maybe he's doing that air looks like it looks like he might be doing that average on what they might not be here if not\nYou'll either be hearing that air from a seven thirty nine and then it's like you know Rick with like a dog has been from nine on what are you doing that air All right what are we got the night [laughter]\nThis before the show this is the kind of felt that happens here but at W.
