have one more for you guys are but a fantastic song the entire album if your acquaintance donates fan if you're a Iraq than\nCheck that album out from start to finish because I think the first time I listen to us into the first four songs and I was like okay this is awesome I Love it but I just never finished it and then like a year later I went back to and I was like oh my God\nWhat is wrong with me I missed out on like eight songs that just blew my mind apart [laughter] and how to handle or up is one of them so you enjoy that\nI I actually have you can't quit me baby a also back when the Senate job same album ah and then [noise] folks folks\nWere ah were stepping into new Greta Van fleet territory we got a we've got to their new singles ah in preparation for their uh their debut album which just feel so weird to say because they've been around for over a year now\nUm which is coming out next week on October Ninety eight so stick around for that if ah if any of that interest there ah [laughter] and ah and yeah so let's just let's just get stuck right into this again is you can't quit me baby by queens in the stone age uh sit back relax and enjoy the tunes\n... ... our our\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] Mm\nWe knew them thank you very ... very well thank you very very who were very very uh well I mean when you\nDo the free flow mhm\nThey\nDo not\n... you know\nYour baby\nThe one thing that you've seen some ...\nAnd you go\n\nTo the immune cells thing Neal around we all have their ... year old\nMom on\n[noise] then they read\nIn life so\nWho don't want to\nWait\nSo we're\nUh okay got it off my chest how can I can go to sleep now without uh you know having to worry\nPat and what we have right now is it pretty exciting new Greta Van fleet and that's what we just heard\nSo you guys heard a anthem does that first song by Greta Van fleet that I played for you guys today is that nice acoustics all\nAnd then you just heard watching over\nA both of these songs or at least a single for the upcoming uh Greta Van fleet album that is it's going to be released on October nineteenth which is exactly one week from now there'll be excited all hard rock fans rock is not that I promise you\nI didn't have a whole show actually I think uh two seasons ago about rock is not dead and I I I should do something like that I'm I'm thinking that theme shows but we don't have to talk about that because once I got an athlete\nA and a and the and the so what's this new album called well\nIt will be entitled anthem of the peaceful army uh and this will actually be their first studio album just kind of bizarre because they they kind of they busted out on the scene into a public consciousness\nUh when they're released from the fires which was a it was a ... I Believe it was eight songs because there was a double E. pi and that was I Believe is November of ... of last year\nAnd yet didn't count even though you know songs is effectively an album I've looked into an album with four songs are granted one of those songs or twenty minutes long but [laughter]\nI think that it it kind of illustrates the point that like I think they can just call that an album like what's the point of releasing a WPN just not making an album I dunno whatever\nLike an e P sure if you had the four songs out of whatever that's not my place set aside or maybe they just weren't ready for the commitment I don't know they're young they're my age\nI think I heard a story that they are one of them missed their prom 'cause they uh they had to go play it they're sold out North American tour\nIt wasn't as great as they're doing I mean I definitely wasn't playing sold out arenas or I don't know if there but no I think they are playing arenas I I Know they were at a few music festival so [noise]\nAh Jake that as you will opposite anyways I'm super excited about the about the album ah I think that are just kind of 'cause I I feel like it's impossible to talk about Greta Van fleet without people asking\nAbout the Led Zeppelin comparison\nAnd just a based on what I heard well what we heard listen to this you know this this night um I have looked into all the new stuff\nUm I think watching over which is that last song we uh we listen to that was new that was that didn't strike me as Led Zeppelin at all I thought it was original I thought it was fantastic I think they're carving out down if that's what the rest of the album sounds like\nA be excited because I think that that's fantastic\nUh when the curtain falls which is like their first ah their first big release the reverse first big single from this album ah which I Believe it played on a few shows past that was definitely more than doubling ask and I also think that the song I played before anthem this was tonight it's just that acoustics are\nThat had some up and ask vibes to it ah the with the guitar is being played I'm kind of just tonal stuff um [noise] so you know look I don't think that you can escape once once once the community at large has painted you as like you guys are the news Dublin ban\nEvery time you come out with something that sounds remotely similar to Led Zeppelin which now let's be honest if if you're making music and people are saying it's like let up on that just means you know it might just mean that you make music that is in that genre you know but people latch on to that and hey you know this is what happened\nUm the point being and I know that I ramble on I ...\nIn others and so I think you you know give them a chance for anybody who is\nYou know on that team who is like ah they're not as good as apple and so yeah I'm not going to listen to give them a chance I think it'd be pleasantly surprised and hey if you come to the conclusion\nThat they are just a sampling rip off bad then that's fine but I think that you won't disagree with the fact that the music does sound good and I think that is the most important thing at the end of the day [noise] okay\nDylan's twelve twenty five AM preaching is now concluded and we've got four minutes left so [noise]\nHow boy four minutes left and I have with the one two three four five six songs I don't know if I'll be able to uh to do that [laughter] everybody wants to you guys and all of a push the rest over to the next time I had a show I don't think I'll have a shouldn't actually because it's a fall break at ... university so\nHave to wait two new two more weeks before you get to the rest of the pilots but uh\nIt was going to write off the night with a worldwide jet song there have been out of LA and literally I Wish I could tell you more are up and coming but uh I literally couldn't find anything interviews now\nI found that Twitter page um I found a ... a website that says like ... of the ... and it just says the word lea jets or rock band out of LA\nI was like OK so nobody nobody knows more than anyone else that's good I I guess uh the bare minimum\nUh but uh they're great I like him a lot I'm I'm be honest I found a planet video game data they got a song in a video game and I was like whoa these guys\nAnd I looked him up and uh and I listen to the entire album and they got good stuff good stuff so I figured a victim of free form a ideology of the station where uh\n... song for the night is going to be a a sheep shift or by the world with ... uh if you like check 'em out try one more call in or something 'cause I don't know anything about them\nAnd uh\nEnjoy it I think the goal and you're going to be hearing more from them because they're they're coming

you're\nLike er it's a lot from Little Mermaid and you just wanna like steel\n[laughter] I'm just getting um [laughter] yeah I um I\nTrained with a woman for a long time her name is Daphne Bolden and she actually lives in Massachusetts now um she has a PHD in ... so when I was like Thirteen I was like blown away by\nAll of her knowledge and her skills and I would just like sit there like almost\nLike timid she'll be with us from her but five years of very ... very like good times sense\nDoes it so you're doing worthless and I'd like that young an age at Thirteen\nYeah I started um when I was Thirteen um with like theater and and singing more but I my background was mostly in Dan from when I was three and I took like modern ballet\nAnd I also found out a few years ago that that I have this thing called synesthesia oh here which like when you hear a tone ones and you hear voices you can kinda see colors and your head\nWhoa really yeah that's awesome but it was mistaken for ADD for very long time [laughter] I'm like interest yeah it's very strange um but I I was on like a bunch of different like ADD meds but then I stopped taking them in college and\nI don't know I was a way better student\n[laughter] um but yeah I have a lot of questions about that well I guess my my first question was going to be um I get to see your voice lessons but when you were younger did you think of yourself as having a good voice or did was coming you kind of always wanted to improve it how did you feel about it\nUm I think before I was like Thirteen I don't remember having a good voice or anything but I like to write a lot like I like to write stories and\n\n[noise] what's new W E s U ... than before we continue our interview with dandelion we're going I Want to do a quick plug for the W E S you record fair which is tomorrow October fourteenth from eleven to AM to four pm in Beckham hall at Wesleyan University there'll be vinyl vendors from all around\nThe great the of Connecticut throwing some ... um all day I'm I'll be there to hopefully if you come I you can say Hi to me [laughter] um but yeah just quit like tomorrow I'm there'll be some Wu emerged as well as record than DJ spinning vinyl a day\nAddition so you know you might just did interviewed everything's pretty cheap too yeah yeah a show out um you know it's going to be so\nUh what do we just hear Jeremy we just heard\nIce cream and mean and I thought I'd written title and a girl like me are from dandelion off the gold plated or two more great song um do you want to tell us a little bit about each of those\nShirt um ice cream and means a is kind of about um [noise] our generation and how everything's on social media now and uh when you kind of lose touch with somebody the last um the last\nLike form of communication is kind of sending each other means and I think that that's kind of funny if it's true and it's it's good and bad in in different ways like at least you're still keeping communication even now it's really little and maybe back\nIn like the seventies eighties and nineties you you would have to like send a letter or something [noise] um if you lived far away but now we just have I mean I can talk to my friends and like Holland and my friends in California at the click of a button and so can you but um\nYou know you still lose touch and your last form is like kind of communicating through I mean\nI remember when we used to send letters [laughter] yeah\n[laughter] [noise] um and um the other one of the girls like me and that kind of goes along a little bit with having lost touch with somebody who did move far away um\nSo I guess the songs kind of go hand in hand together I'm Glad they're on the same A. E. pi [laughter] um but yeah it's just about um you know\n[noise] um so usually I just like write poetry and then sometimes or hopefully it gets turned into a song\nWhen they're thinking about the writing process when you're writing a song um I guess for this ... specifically do it all can really faster to develop like over a couple of months or years um the tongs I Would\nSay we're all written within the same two years of each other and if you look at my pay John's bought a fire in like the bio I kind of\nTalked about how I was writing this E. pi during a midlife or not midlife a quarter life I'm not that old I promise [laughter] um and\nUm so that's just kind of what came out it's just kind of autobiographical I suppose you want to talk about the quarter life crisis [laughter]\nUm why not [laughter] um [laughter] ah\nWell I was with somebody for a while we live together and I thought that I wanted to get married and when I was in the deep of it I realized I wasn't ready to get married\nTo my quarter life crisis led me to uh wanting to travel and so last not this past summer but the summer before I spent three months in Europe\nUm ... a six week seven maybe eight weeks of it I spend in Spain and I was learning Spanish a little bit and I saw a lot of Spain and it was I Love medieval like history in fairy tales so I was in heaven\nAnd it's very adult all they've all that stuff has been [laughter]\nYeah and then I went to Athens and Santa rainy and I love Greek mythology I listen to like Greek mythology pod cast a lot of the time one of my friends told me that I'm a psychopath because I like go running and listen listen to reckon with allergies\nThis um and then I went to Holland and that actually is a big part of my like future endeavor is is that I really liked the music scene there like the electronic music I like the artist there aren't pushing to like\nMake a dollar with everything in there that there's um a lot of quality and the music out there so I really would like to spend a month out there and learn a little bit more about DJ in producing so that's kind of my endeavor for next\nYear who were you doing any of the writing for this um for the VP on that\nTrip [noise] no I actually recorded the holy pie before the trap oh yeah and it was kind of funny like the second time I ever met a thin he was like yeah like we want to you know promote this at this time and blah blah I'm like\nYeah I I'm not going on here [laughter] really gone all summer in traveling Europe so\nBut you know they they were gracious and they worked with me and I came back and we got back to work and\nThe ... he was being mixed at that time when I came back and every mix that would come with me I'd be like it sounds great great but\nThen every time I get another one it would be even better [laughter] do you know it just goes to show you working with with people who know what they're doing is\nIs quite a great thing in a luxury I suppose cool\nIn terms like influence what ... what are they are kind of like John her music do you see all your British Influence on you or that you had to do the most maybe of influence this project\nWell I I really love the beach boys I don't know how much influence they had on on this album but some of my stuff has this\nLike kind of vintage [noise] ah you know\n[noise] I grew up listening to like a lot more is that I loved one a del ray I'm In Cuba s and Damien race or or two of my top people I've seen like most of them live and they're amazing as well\nWhere were your was your family your parents were were they listen to the day when the when you were younger um my degree oriented you know kind of my grandfather was\nJazz musician and he played piano and he actually played for like at a Jane's once or twice they are like ... when they were younger my God and at least according to my mother [laughter]\nUh and he he showed us a lot of of about jazz and soul and stuff like that and then um my mom really likes classic rock Rolling Stones nice she's pretty dope love her and my dad\nReally likes female vocalist [laughter] like ... wedding Houston and Celine Dion he loves 'em I've even gotten like messages on my phone where\nAh if he's not even talking he might have like ... and it's like the entire like song of my heart will go on [laughter]\nLike that [laughter] cool yeah so and then my sister is I have two older sisters and my older sister listen to like Wu\nTang and like the food you and my middle sister like Nirvana and boy bands and I loved the spice girls [laughter]\nAnd he very eclectic array of music and not a family\nYeah and I think that's why I have I've had such a hard time figuring out what my genre is I just kind of say it's like indie pop because I Love\nLike taking different aspects of all my influences and trying to mash them together but\nThat's very true yeah we've\nPretty much as the question to everyone who's on the shows here so we may as well as do um what what else do we listening to this summer this summer I'm\n[noise] wow\n[laughter] well I always really love line at all raised first album born to die I think just like the beach and everything are amazing that's just kind of on\nContinue on um continue as a ... um uh\nWhat else I'm since I listening to\nAnd some people's voices can be really annoying but look really cool in your head right someone has like the beautiful like\nYou know nice voice and it's like fireworks and ...\nIt's a yeah I Can't really explain it but I Do paint some of it huh ... ...\nUm but it's never really comes out is what it looks like in my head to\nThe new ... is it like ... or ... I don't know I'm trying to imagine what it's like like is that\nThere's a lot of like like ... and like ... so you're seeing kind of yeah and I I Would say when I drank more [laughter] I can definitely get more colorful [laughter] um and I can never really see the colors of\nMy own voice but I um when I drink to kill a [laughter]\n... [laughter] returns little turquoise [laughter]\nNot live claimed that as my favorite color [laughter]\nUm but yeah if it you know it is what it is [laughter]\nDo you know I mean I sure like do people do all people with the Miss USA\n[laughter] still doing better than if they've been ... [laughter] I think I've had it right [noise]\nUm the every one of the the same colors like through the with the same things I Would think not\nDon't think so I actually when I was ...\nSomething called synesthesia for math oh and like he said that like the number three is always blue I've actually like\nI've watched like a who's very late one night and I watch Youtube video about cars and there's some guy who's like there's some child prodigy at math who likes these numbers of colors and can just do like calculus and he was like eight years old yeah but the the colors numbers like combined with each other and get the answer somehow yeah though interesting to me I ... I haven't really\nMet that many people with it but when it 'cause it's kind of a weird thing to like bring up on last year like in a in a situation like this [laughter]\nLast year on the street yeah Mike hey Tennessee I don't know what that is pretty blue [laughter] yeah\nUm but he was one of the first people that I ever met with it but it was a different kind and he he said only the first ten digits he knew how to color code and the the answer in\nColor or something like that I don't really know how to explain it but it wasn't like he can't do like Einstein calculus\n[laughter] with ... and had which is pretty cool for anyone who can read it you should get them on your age [laughter]\nDo you get to talk with problems no I Am like the opposite\nOf anyone who understands now [laughter]\nMiserable [laughter] Germans not [laughter] oh lucky you [laughter]\nOkay cool I'm All right so yeah let's say a break for the computers and ... and then we'll do a lot of performance cool All right we'll be right back no problem\n[noise]\nFewer now listening to eighty eight point one at the end W pets new Middletown the listener supported\nIndependent local public affairs and free form community radio\n... live at W.
