thanks for joining us Huron mixed media tonight we are talking\nFaces for talking bases that starts theme you got something you want to face off a bit about\nHit us up at eight six six eight five seven seven zero zero that was in him with yes I thought I saw your face today not just about as a bleeding we're going to get with her music this evening I think unless maybe I'm missing something over ... we\nHave is keeping it real off the nose off the nose and they say oh boy All right\nWell I'm\nOnly downhill from here really um Iraq I guess\nA bill that was confusing to me though because\nA pill harder appeal harder but also the upward trajectory is like an inherently positive\nThing right yeah it's confusing\nEr [laughter] good in twenty Nineteen that's what I'd like to do in legal knowledge eyes up its appeal 'cause it's going to be harder to make it better but also we will have yeah\nDefinitely okay\nJust seeing them make for good [laughter] yeah yeah [laughter] good\nI'm all our listeners out there it's only a pill from here so maybe a little difficult ended up to ... but the feeling of accomplishment of the day changes from October sixteenth through October seventeenth\nOption it's going to be great\nUnlike any other I'm like any other day in October yeah except for the switch from October seventeenth Dr Bridget\nI'm well given all that let's talk a little bit about faces we were going to start as we hinted with movies about face transplants magnanimous hit me with one\nWell we just saw a movie about a face transplant we did at the white playing other and yeah I wasn't even on a Japanese from the Nineteen\nSixties um tell me a little bit but this film well\nHard to describe I'll be honest okay one of the things you've got\nTo the guy while they were playing with ... so\nIt's about a guy who um loses his old face that some sort of traumatic accident in which we don't know because we walk in a little bit late but I think we walked in not that late that we missed I think it actually wasn't disclosed ah okay\nOr that's my impression yeah little uninformed [laughter]\nBut I live in the state um goes to the doctor um that I guess I could call them in experimental plastic surgeon but all the the neurology really call them um to give him a new face\nTransplanted the there's a really great scene where they get that stays put on their face\nYeah it was right on there and the highlight anything that you can spend your entire special effects like ... we're talking about spectacle you're like there's an inherent spectacle in face transplants\nYeah which are thing now in real life but only in for a drastic medical situations I think what's interesting about the other movies will talk about is that the face transplants that those movies are not\nOut of necessity well threat I'm starting to study but they're not out of life well they had the patch life or death face off I we can't even talk about the stakes in that movie there so [laughter] but it's like the\nFurther ... like a make overseeing though oh that's true like it that's the you know I'm going to get a new face through hair cut and make up\nThat pushed so far I'm going to get a new face by literally getting a new face and funny enough they take place in in strange you know action movies are\nAll on guard that um are you know no we have yet to mainstream eyes the female friends but however this is what I was going to say which is that the suspect it there's an Harris bicycle to write but\nAfter you\nPast the first special effects sequence that one special effects sequence of the of the transplant you're you're you're running free you just switch the actors that you that you're just in the kind that really yeah\nWell that this is faced off the fake yeah but how often yeah yeah but yeah well yeah face of another has been theory like some serious how did they do that moment yeah we're like half your ... your knees on yeah and half here ah other faiths show and I we could also bring\nWhy why ... why do we see the face transplant exotic fide exotic sized I should say other than it hasn't been done at least at the time of these movies respective production\nAnd then my second one I forgot to wear night like not a Jersey right I forgot to where it's something that was not like an NBA Jersey right\nReally a problem it's a third grade I had it down what about you I\nI think I was always there unfortunately or but if you weren't if you weren't there then you go to like make up a day\nOr they would have like a ... or at least in my school where they have all that and they would call you down or how do you go and I remember that people being a little mean the the little people although my full with the way that you had to stand which I get it\nBut yeah but also yeah ...\nIt's interesting 'cause like like portrait disposition I feel like hasn't changed or if anything it's just quit\nNow the portrait takers or the or or that sort of the tea a job but it yeah it'd be if you were sitting for a portrait that was the tedious job yeah you'd be sitting there for\n... hours so tonight I was ... I was remembering the class that I was in ... ... ... someone brought up reminded me of a class that I that I was in er which I obviously will not name\n'em but we're looking at a portrait of Frederick Douglass and\nThey were the teachers were sort of knowing that he looked like apple alternately they were saying how attractive he was yeah and they were also saying that he looked kind of cross which is like you know that that gets really thorny and when you really think about it and we can do a whole other discussion about the ethics of\nYou know policing Frederick Douglass was facial [laughter] but [laughter]\nI'm the most basic level stuff the the the friend of mine who was who is a noting that whose remembering that said well yeah I mean if you would just sit there for twenty minutes you probably would pick of rather neutral and maybe even crossed facial expressions\nOtherwise it'd be a slow drip of your face going from miles around\nDecided I don't need to have enough pictures of myself would be I Wonder photographers actually we we could of resources for this yeah\nI mean there's some inconsistent about that and even the schools the schools that are graffiti ... which is the the time between when you take it um and when you get it back\nMaybe not the same amount of time but like I think especially to think now that all our photos are like very and then\nAnd people in middle school and high school are constantly taking photos of themselves on their phone it's like month when between when you take it and you're not allowed to see it and when you get it back and not like little frankly folder\nAnd see the the copy the like Eighteen ...\n... folks magnets an eight by ten for your mental side of the stops to adopt after I don't even know I don't think I had him in middle school yeah\nAnd then you get your your senior portrait without the fate of black thing on you I don't know they just said oh the fate what what is a it's like a fake dressed so you just like this is just a top yes the ... you just pull down your shoulder shop\nAnd they put on like fake down that just like covers to your waist\nAnd you take this photo makes you look like\nYour fancy or and then the option was bringing a prop that mean writing ready to the end and take a photo with the prop\nThis is interesting because the ... the portrait is supposed to be about your face right bringing or theme like this is something that it's supposed to\nHighlight you know you're most prominent feature right and then they you know give you ... there's a little blue ocean backdrop or whatever like neutral plate backdrop yeah they give you object I actually not to overload with anecdotes however\nWas framed to me at least by the person taking the portrait was oh yeah everyone's doing something funny so I like put and I didn't think not that I thought this was funny but I like put this stuffed monkey on top of my head\nAnd I took the photo and I thought well you can look really dumb everyone's going to have really funny ones and we had this senior dinner and they had they projected onto the screen dying tires in your classes there\nProjected onto the screen everyone tortured and I [noise] where every single person all one hundred and fifty people that I ... that I that I read where am I going to high school\nHad just looked right into the camera and smiled straight up you know whatever and here I Am with a monkey on my head no the juvenile unsaid seriously ... to Larry and everyone was coming up and going oh that's so funny like the ... these parents that I've known since like first grade\nI'd miss my porch or what a clown name what what anyway\nMaybe I was just trying to detract from fish but we're we're we're off raw fish\n[laughter] now where we're on the wrong place wrong fix we're ... we're all about fish than it\nWell I mean I think it's it's a funny thing because people were really into their senior Porsche it and really into all the little like add on you can pay like eight dollars more and they would get rid of all your acne or they would like white in your teeth\nAre we talking about acting probably too is that going on yeah um yeah that's wild I I had young of an age\nTo like two and that's the only time that I had ever like\nHad not presented me rate as like an option here's their photo we took it will make you look way better and then that will be the image of used solidified to all your classmates and to you and probably like your grandparents or at least some relatives who then to the the year\nTo check off and then to think about yourself like how how am I going to be you know solidified in this moment this is like and I don't have that many photos of myself so my senior project actually is one of the nation from that Europe and I live in the time that I look back and I'm like yes this is what I\nI guess is what I looked like it was right before school will burn [laughter]\nThat's kinda cool what was what I Do I Can't even remember the last summer\nAnd I had yeah who knows it gets put braces when it [noise] um\nBut I but I think the interesting also in just like the experience of having your photos taken of of someone taking your photo you know in\nMy heart attack that their indict yeah directed on how to sit for a photo of just you're fit that that that were the pretense is this is going to be primarily my face right like I have to get if we because only methods to be highlighted\nOr like you know you're practicing maybe in the mere um maybe or how you're going to look in fact but you you don't look silly look in the mayor\nYou slept high schools very face centric also yeah I mean obviously but if if we're to think of it is like the self conscious time like a lot of that stuff is directed at that level yeah like a couple of ... can be a week\nRuined her right for real so that like I don't know that\nThat is probably partly why there are no high school [laughter] [laughter] yeah\nBut it also like when you're in high school when you wake up in the morning and you've got like you know four or five temples maybe or one or two I don't know what the you know everyone's got to do whatever [laughter] um that's like\nYour your metric for what is apocalyptic with regards to your faces do out of whack I feel like yeah when you're that age\nYeah you can't see past that way and so he is\nA lot of schools I think the faces no favors none none at all like what is the default light under which is a someone's face should be looked\nAt really really damn really damn how like they like that we're in right now yeah interesting yeah maybe natural though\nNavy I mean I think it's really interesting because there's there's a whole thing about what lighting they'll put in dressing room\nAnd in different stores and the the dressing rooms of tobacco lighting got until tax yeah yeah I think it's crazy it's like they don't have clocks in grocery stores yeah center where would they put\nClocks grocery stores and they were on the wall\nAlong the ... the freezer I don't think a lot of work I my vision of grocery stores clocks everywhere and no mirrors and no ... well all natural light a dog was like on your little shopping cart there's the bar yeah yeah so it oh that's so good so everyone's walking around\nYou set a time or twenty minutes to a yeah kids got to get picked up her full yet from their school picture it again you can hang in my freezer burn chicken [laughter]\nThat's right um okay so we we talk a little bit about portraits yes\nAnd I hear something I'm curious about ... like like\nThese are where we are talking about portraits where you know the person with a person's like yourself or your grandparents have your picture and they know what you\nWhat about\nPortrait that get a for lack of a better term famous eyes the get [laughter] yeah that become\nThe sea and say well I'm just too easy\nAnd the clothes that show and they are\nOn the planet I Love all the colors from Louis before but I Know that I was never so then you are oh\nI\nCan make a big thing look\nOn July ... to Judge Hannah are supposed to use the\nUsed in close to me like if she chooses exposed to the people in the grocery store in the\nChanted\nMusic on and on and on the news and I didn't really use the word I mean\n... ... ...\n\n[noise] or going back to mix media only on WB if you really point one Middletown I'm due to a pig in the city I'm DJ\nMagnanimous we're talking faces [noise] um previously we've been to portraits and transplant and now let's talk about movies because as much as we don't like the harp on one medium for a whole episode\nFace visual thing yeah so ... do you have a close up or a movie faced that\nStands out particularly or resemblance at all for you well it's not a close up\nBut um I guess an idea\nSort of introduced to me by my mom is it like actors who have\nLike a face for movies like the ... the data face and one of the true me it's always been Robert Redford\nYeah like that's the case yes you know so any time I've seen especially you know even like old Robert Redford young Robert Redford it's like a face\nThat dominates the green deserve to take up so much space that's the real thing is to have a face that's not always just signify on what the ... used to look like yeah like he does his his current phase does that but it also is its own entire\nYeah thing um\nCelebrity right you know and I think that's particularly Robert Redford like\nThere are a lot of distinct faces\nBut sometimes they're so distinct that watching them you're thinking about who they are in like all these other contacts and you're like bringing those contacts and pushing them together and that's part of your viewing experience but I think that some of the best Hollywood\nLike true Hollywood actors whatever that means to me which is probably the specific um\nThey have they have like a face\nYeah right I always thought like\nSome actors have faces\nWith all this potential in physics you learn about potential energy you know the only thing that I ever\nRetain from physics yeah and I always that's something I always think about in terms of a face is like the potential and a fish could be for good could be for evil yeah that is very simplistic but like yeah Marlon Brando as a phase where something we've always happening\nYeah like there's always something rippling and the only time I felt like I wasn't sure it was about probes now yeah and it works there yeah\nI mean and and people have like so many things let's face it we're like particular actors places will annoy them and just some like undefined them all away ... you know upon shovels interesting to me that I got to go to critic critique of a face and it's like a violent\nI Want to punch that faith and I honestly foot like push back on active if up I think I think that that's often that they remind you of someone else true and you can't disconnect from not\nSure I'm\nThat you know you can't help it it may be unfair to them seem particularly um I think that Christians do or like her her face\nAnd how like specific her expressions are and how she uses the expressions like across film I think a lot of her yeah not that it her acting ability is limited but that it is\nUm like very specific to her it was all a little bit of a tangent but that that is something that someone finds annoy annoying but she's not ten malleable that's odd yeah someone else you know\nWhich is interesting because people are always looking for consistency with with famous people with right I mean I also we don't criticize I mean I don't hear that criticism carried out for I hear the opposite with musicians it's like you want a vocal take that you can wait for\nRight you know but I but at the same time there's the whole thing where if someone transforms their face completely for a movie it's automatically you know\nRight out of time you get into the right thing transform their faith usually is a process of transforming their body yeah and then if they're transforming their fate independent movie then they're probably getting shame for it 'cause my logic surgery\nUm which is a whole other can of worms rate but they you um I Know we're thinking a little bit about\nThe close up the coast at the history oh right right right I Know we have some listeners out there who are really really hanging on the notion of of the more history and being sold out over the course as I've said so for the for for those those valiant a tutors and benefit um\nWe we didn't we we didn't have the technology to do because up until I don't I don't want to play dates 'cause I'm gonna get I'm wrong but for a while there we had movies completely devoid of close ups you know we couldn't put the camera and especially once then we solve that than wide screen film was invented yeah and then they're the\nI've taught all that I actually think that shows with people it'd be very didactic and very strategic about where the cost up was going to be yet once they fixed it\nBecause they were very certain specific conditions under which you could get the actor in there get the camera close enough you know you have long when is the camera to be right up on them yeah but I think now if you look at movies now\nWe don't ... I think in a lot of ways the judgment of a of an engaging on screen presence is can they hold the close up yeah and we don't I don't even think we see them in a lot of ways I think that people find some of these faces ... because\nThey haven't been granted the luxury of a ... beautiful close up\nI yeah I don't it's way more rare\nNow to go to some to go to a movie and get one of these like heart wrenching moments where you've been waiting for that ... stuff and you get it and they give it to you\nIn the close up but here here I'm sure you've just seen looks like you've just seen a great close and I haven't seen\nOh no I haven't actually I I was just going to say do you have anything particularly odd because I thought you might but\nNo I mean I'm ... I'm sort of thinking about comedy like New Hampshire\nOkay continue [laughter] [laughter] I'm not going\nYou've been All right let me come back we'll be back next week with another episode of mixed media now that we're both\nAt the height of our powers magnanimous was all ... powers and always will be um a shock yeah all that all that and they tune is going to be great our with album reviews WC ... point one Middletown\nAnd or here's a little bit about that\n[noise] this is James ... is the host of fusion radio if you're an F.

I had no idea I like literally just looked at it\nAnd just kind of crazy I can respect that though I like yeah I ... I don't know I was like I was like a weird find it honestly just came up on my spot if I one day and like I had never heard of him before a spot last year like spot if I didn't even doing doing that is yeah have you heard his father fi spot of 'em [laughter]\nSo that you know never into a fight but not far from it um but this is the album reviews and W. Middletown idiot for when I'm at twelve twenty two in the morning or so what did what did you think the album Pittsburgh give it an eight when we got it means to you\nTo me that kind of means nothing I'm happy to take for 'cause it's kind of diversifying their sound like I never would've expected them to even like yeah I didn't expect to have a review for this and I'm like I was in it was like oh what yeah but um\nI don't know someone I guess kind of doing their job [laughter] finally\nBut um I guess I'd give it like a like a\nSolid seven point three\n... three crazy I think he's I I think it's only going to go up though I see a lot of a stopping them I see a lot of the oh yeah a little bit around the almost ... yeah\nDefinitely true um\nThe year but like I don't think that's true but I Do love it a lot um\nI get a like a seven seven or something like seven eight\nI Wish we knew it was up in our name because I feel like it was my new name was seven four seven three I think I Know I I think it was ... and I think I I definitely like the more the NO NAME but no names as far as what we've only played good albums far we sort of need to diversify in that sense I guess I'm Sorry that we're\nFinding better for you but we're also now sort of have finished up the Octavian space man portion of the show a damn do with that that clean clean score [laughter] and\nNow we're going to kind of delve into more of a different John or different sound of music um I think the two sons if\nThere is a strongly of next is a a goes drive\nRight by it kept the song with a set up a rocky and I think it's up to all the time is it I'd probably [laughter] yeah I think it's also it's not solving anyway but yes it does not allow for the harder songs on your like right in the last we played right like you see it was was there you see it\nWas very similar to um this this town I Would say so it's kinda cool that I don't know I think like I Hope that this out in the kind of like ends up making it over it as as like a like a UK artist to get love in like rap in like a real way that'd be really cool I think\nI totally agree with you I think it would like actually like changes you know that you know like\nThe ... people need to try some new things man and a down to I mean but like I mean if it's out there for like but I I I don't know I think\nIn some way Octavian has this like kind of different sound that it's more like appealing maybe but we'll see yeah but I think it it's access affects how would you change that is true and pitch for reviews on that\nI'm not sure I Wonder if there's a correlation you think there's a correlation I mean people definitely read them and go like oh yeah that must be GOOD Music and okay what are the people that do it right so I usually goes right up to get the Mississippi you yeah\nI never have a book on one day paper taping\nRunning getting\nNever never\nGoing to re route within a not a rubber everywhere I go\nOut when I go to think about how come they might have a job that we don't mind being a human being a guy like\nJohn Robert I'm\nWrong murder so\nDo for giving me put this to the\nGame but you know when people\nI mean he came down\nIn the street and teach you how justified\nLike Freddie Krueger American trial [laughter]\nLike you like movies like like low\nIn New York they would ... that was part of being ready to get rid of them are so why are they are counting bank\nLot of swearing and made a\nAnd beans yeah hand\nSay they'd be willing to at least ... yeah well she started to get the big challenge people\nBit\nBy the uh the money to\nDo\nFact that they're going to be seen in the\nThat get a copy the fact\nThat the\nOther side you\nJust use it would be that social Shadi we can be that\nWhen you see the scene in the past two families don't jam Abad\nSays I'm already a blanket ban civil my head that you're in\nThe navy ...\nSpeaking in bad taste\nI've been going through a lot behind his\nBack and talk back back back that I Know they told you I mean you've\nGot your money cause ship while I was in a tattoo\nNews back on the topic being replaced and all the\n\nTime the noble show of\nTrust in\nThe national book\nI have a need to get your thoughts are usually the the Utah\nJazz I was reading your oh is that there should only be you know\nThose who need it and then was\nWas closed ...\nEnded up at the new pope is laws ghost\nShip value into a bar\nFight you know you'll be in my view of the pie nobody you'll be\nThey are all these things\nAnd\n[noise]\nWell come back to W.

to ...\nWell no one no one knows that but that but I Love being that I I understand\nYes yes it's it's pure speculation no no one knows whatsoever who knows who threw it maybe maybe it was you know a ... a Proud Boys themselves or the Republicans themselves or maybe it was about four hundred pound a guy on a bed of New Jersey\nI'm could be anyone you know I'm so\nAfter a ... this is talk is over the Proud Boys a a file out ah you know there's a ... anti fascist across the street or maybe about like a sixty or Seventy 'em and they're going around the corner\nAnd the thing you have to understand about the NYPD is it is an army they\nHave a TV audience when I mentioned that we're playing video that was captured in just a warning it it it's pretty violent um where they're caught on Cape kicking just a single person go ahead and\nYeah that's the Sandy Bachmann video I saw it and I've been in touch um I'm actually in New York and I've been in touch with the Sandy who felt that shaped horse who took the photographs that went viral so they are\nI are walking down the street the Proud Boys at ... or actually following the documenting this the hallway\nAnd the thing you got to understand about the New York city police if they are massive military force I've been on demonstrations where there's I was on a labor demonstration New York once where there are about a thousand protesters\nAnd I kept at Thirteen hundred police they can absolutely overwhelm any demonstration if they chose to do so so what we have here is first of all it's a case of ...\nAbout this because these Proud Boys go round the corner and apparently there there's some confrontation um I've heard difference\nI've I've heard similar versions of the same stories so what seems like happened is some er AT T paw folks did kind of a sneak around the corner and perhaps knock someone's hat off one of the ... got hats off one of the Proud Boys right so\nThat's probably not the smartest thing to do if that's what happened but what happened in return was absolutely brutal and criminal um it this is why you know for their responsibility for the NYPD\nThat they didn't provide proper policing in the first place and secondly\nI the Proud Boys than I dozens of 'em start running towards these few antifa folk 'em and they start brutally assaulting them and that's what you can see on the videotape\nThey're kicking they're punching what you can't really see it you could see the photographs one of the people is being held down at choked and later there's another videotape or by a journalist with the Gotham this who he is following right after\nUh they left at someone is just\nTotally hyped up gloating one of the Proud Boys say did you see that I had their ... had a and I would smashing it against the F ing pavement and they're like woo yeah so they were I add one of the people um audio was a I the cops are where are\nYou know the body cabs and that the Daily Beast which I've been writing for a they got the transcript and one of the people who was assaulted said that they got punched like Seventy times and so meanwhile the cops are right there there right around the corner of and they are slow to roll up\nOr when they finally do roll up I I talked to I interviewed Shay about this she said\nDo something and then finally the cop gets off his scooter so there's a real question here is why they were so slow\nSlow to react why they were not a modern ring or that much more closely especially when you see left wing demonstration in New York City it is just saturated with with policing and so this is part of a disturbing trend also that we see around the country and I don't I think it's very important to\nSay this is nothing conspiratorial but what we've seen in cities like ah Portland in Berkeley in Berkeley in Charlottesville in New York where the police take this kind of hands off approach\nTo these violet white supremacists neo Nazis and proto fascist and they they basically let them get involved in this brutal violence\nTwenty four hours later we see the Proud Boys\nAnd patriot prayer in the streets of Portland basically engaged an outright open gang warfare and the police and and the political leadership in Portland is basically saying well there's nothing we could do about it this this is their their free speech rights\nAnd what did it suddenly become free speech rights to engage in gang warfare um so the\nWay in white leap on are the ones perpetrating [laughter] right right and that's\nWhy I said this is not conspiratorial well we ... what I Want to make is what we have to understand is that there is a social there is a cultural\nThere's a political and there's an idiot logical affinity between these right wing of white supremacists and neo fascist organizations and the police basically they're in a lot of ways kindred spirit the complexity of it is is police really are not going to give up their monopoly on power\nBut they are not unhappy to see these right wing elements beat the crap out of a a left wing\nBecause of these ... these affinities\n[noise] um I Would not doubt if there is friendliness towards the Proud Boys are within sub elements of the NYPD but then again you have to remember that might pd has thirty eight thousand a sworn officers\nThey've got forty five hundred auxiliary a police um and then they they have like twenty five thousand a civilian then they there's also all sorts of other police like transit police it's it's a a force of or something like around fifty five thousand\n[noise] my uncle Bloomberg ... when he was mayor boats that I have the seventh largest standing army in the world that he was right\nNow are there is news emerging that nine people in connection to the Proud Boys are going to be facing charges regarding that particular so we've just been discussing um why do you think that eventually happened I understand that\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo a hand instructed the NYPD to investigate the matter further with the bomb or do you credit or some of the anti fascist activists for pushing for this well\nI think what it really is is a a a this is the media this is a the photographer videographer\nIs Shay horse and said he Bachmann who where they're filming and recording it and that stuff just what a viral um shade took the picture of the Proud Boys I are celebrating afterwards um the group photo that's been circulating that's been\nTens of thousands of of shares on Twitter and Facebook and that's the one that that the anti fascist used to figure out who every what was I was actually working on the other story for the uh about this um I where we were tried to match up uh all the people in the photos with various uh\nSo they definitely did play an important role um but it was really a the video at the photos that are really made everyone sit up and take notice that I think also there's a very important difference right like you know Cuomo is in in many ways a center right Republican\nBut there's also this notion that the idea that you can have this type of mob violence is not really going to be tolerated by the elite in in New York City um that's bad for business it's bad for tourism it's bad for the image and and then you also have\nIt's a city that's forty percent immigrant that it has very large religious minorities who were are being threatened by the alright Muslims and Jews\nSo I think there's kind of a lot of social and cultural and political revulsion at what's going on and so that makes the politicians like yeah they have to set up and say something where's the Portland\nThe politicians are completely quiet there was the extraordinary story that just came out during that August fourth the demonstration\nThere were members of patriot prayer on a rooftop with long guts and I'm so rifles right that they could have potentially I\nBeen killing people and the police found them and they said and they uh it sounds like they took their gods but then they gave them back\nBut it wasn't just that the police did not inform the mayor and in Portland mayor is the police commissioner they kept it secret for him for for two months and you have a political leadership in Portland that's been completely cowardly\nThey are not speaking up at all against this and so the police are basically letting the Patriot prayer at Proud Boys come into the city and repeatedly rampage as bad as uh the events were friday night\nKind of music that this was a show for you right here at W. E. S. two eighty eight point one of them middle\nThat's what's bad about twice a day I\nMade a few changes to our due time schedule in an effort to bring listeners are diverse daytime talk radio programs sooner than later with them for some of your favorite we support the programs at nine AM and two PM and don't miss rising up so now we've had a few times one\nRight after democracy now you can find a fall program on line or W. B. S. U. of M. topped work we can also find two weeks of our private programs to catch up on any shows [noise]\nUrban and you're listening to the middle [noise]\nHi welcome to food sleuth radio where we help you think beyond your plate I'm Melinda Hamel guard a registered dietitian and investigative nutritionist on a mission to connect the dots between food health and agriculture and find food truth\nAnd say I'm honored to walk on my guest Dr Joshua what speaker he is an assistant professor of sociology at Colorado State university where he conducts research and teaches about the intersection between food and agriculture social inequalities and social movements\nHe's the author of a great brand new book just published twenty Eighteen by the University of Minnesota pressed titled food justice now deepening the roots of social struggle and we'll be focusing our conversation on that today\nThe book explores food politics food and social justice movements and social inequalities within and beyond the food system and I was especially curious about his new project that will be exploring food in prison politics doctors speak a welcome\nThank you so much for having me on the show and\nI think that your book is just what we need right now to further understand\nThe justice and inequality in our social system\nI think it really began as a college student so I went to Santa Clara university which is in Santa Clara California it's a Jesuit university with a social justice mission and\nWas exposed to a number of different campaigns are run by students\nAt that time period and one of those campaigns was to support the coalition of a mock Lee workers boycott of Taco Bell and that was their first nationwide campaign where they were going to university campuses\nAnd drum up support from college students to help boycott Taco Bell to push farmers to pay a penny more per pound of tomatoes picked out in the field of a mock ally and so I began to learn about farm workers struggles and the roles that people can play and supporting those efforts\nAnd then on a different level I started college in September two thousand and one right after the twin towers fell\nAnd so the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq looms large over my college experience and one of\nMy experiences was to engage with a number of other college students and a five day fast\nTo protest against the pending invasion of Iraq and I began to learn about actually the denial of food as a tool to bring people together to raise awareness and build opposition to what we saw that and we know now to be a baseless war\nAnd so all of that combined push me to think about the relationship between food and social justice and perhaps a different kind of way and when I started my graduate studies at the University of Florida in two thousand and\nThinking about food as an environmental good I was learning a lot about environmental justice and all the environmental toxic Sinbad and our environment and begin to contemplate well perhaps there's environmental goods that people don't have or people can use\nIn really strategic ways and food became that lens\nFor me and I also had the luxury of\nSome friends in Oakland some some dear friends of mine who I talked about actually in my book who started planting justice that we're\nBeginning to think about for justice and some really creative ways and so that pushed me to also learn more about what they were doing and to support that kind of work so\nI think combined those experiences of shaved my perspective of what food justice is and what food justice can be\nLoved that you went to a university that had a social justice mission I'm sure you go to parties and you're standing around with a group of people and maybe your field is different from others and you say well I'm writing a book about food justice\nDo you think everybody understands what food just this is and how would you describe it\nThat's a great question and a question I've been asking myself for close to a decade\nAnd I think really simply food justice is the idea that we need to have equity at all points along the food supply chain and that food can also be a mechanism to advance equity\nIn other sectors of our lives whether politically economically or socially and so really simply those are the ways that I understand for justice and when somebody asks how\nBecause I was thinking to myself how does it just it\nSo that everyone has the ability to produce the food that they want and consume culturally appropriate foods similar I Would think that food justice is very much a part of food sovereignty\nYeah I I think you can't have food justice unless you have food sovereignty and for me food sovereignty understood as having self determination and autonomy over the production and consumption of food or whatever scale is appropriate for a particular group of people but the lineages are really different and\nIf you look at the lineage of food sovereignty it really stems from the global south and\nInternational peasant movements like Libya ... which are operating and unique locations within the global food system\nIn that a lot of livelihoods are being stripped away due to the nature of global capitalism at this point for example the nature of\nStructural adjustment programs requiring countries to for instance engage in export commodity production of food which can strip away land for presidents and so that experience\nI think is really particular but it's been integrated into the United states and I think merged with this notion of justice which has a different lineage and I think stems from racial justice movements in the United states and economic justice movements\nType point to in my book and I think that particular historical lineage is important to trace but then also to acknowledge that movements melt into each other and I think we see that happening here in the U.S with food sovereignty and food justice movements\nYeah I agree thank you for explaining those two terms now in the introduction of your book you say that the major problems confronting activists committed to the justice revolved around mass\nBut in the eyes of active as they are an opportunity and I love that he recognized mass incarceration labor exploitation and immigration as being key to food justice\nTalk to me a little bit about why you chose those three areas to look at the food system\nSo when I developed this study originally it was a comparative case study and it's a typical qualitative method to try to understand both similarities and differences in a particular area or around a particular topic\nAnd then thinking about designing the study I wanted to be intentional about picking the cases that were unique both in terms of what organizations were doing and how they were understanding food politics and practicing food politics\nBut also had some similarities and in this case similarities in terms of general commitment to social justice I'll be defined in different sorts of ways\nAnd I went into this study spending time with the different organizations at the book highlights\nIn about two two and a half months doing participant observation and I was an intern actually at all three organizations and so they put me to work as well in their day to day operations and so I got to see from the inside out what it meant to do food politics\nAnd what I discovered was that\nFood in many respects wasn't always the most important topic\nAnd I didn't know that that was going to be the case going into this study but as I was listening to people and interviewing people and hearing their stories I began to discern that for instance in the case of planting justice and their work with\nThat were high in poverty high unemployment and that we're criminalized you know in Oakland it's really typical for law enforcement to spend a disproportionate amount of resources in low income communities of color and it's not that there's necessarily\nYou're going to find something and then while in prison a lot of these men talked extensively about labor exploitation ... some of them talked about the poor quality of food in prison\nBut what was most salient for the work that planting justice was doing by providing living wage jobs Wednesday reentered was the experience of prison labor and being paid really poorly somebody mentions that they were being paid Seventeen cents an hour\nFor work that outside of prison would be paid anywhere from Seventeen to twenty seven dollars for\nAnd so then upon re entry a lot of these men oftentimes end up back in the same neighborhoods where they were first arrested and so then the question in a context like California where ending on the year fifty five sixty five percent of people who've been incarcerated go back to prison\nThe question becomes how do you prevent people from going back to prison and for planting justice\nThey real lives by working both inside San Quentin state prison doing horticultural therapy with the inside and garden program and\nTalking to these men that it would make a big difference is upon re entry folks had good jobs people had living wage jobs that had health care benefits\nAnd that there were support networks and mutual aid to assist in the healing process from the trauma of the prison pipeline\nAnd I think what's really telling from what I saw in this case is that only one of the men who've worked with punting justice out of roughly thirty have gone back to prison and so there's something there that's working\nAnd I think it's important that we begin to think more strategically about restarted\nIn trauma to others how do we think about it as a process of healing instead of just a punishment right where there is no hope to break out of that pipeline and the statistics I think bear that out that in California at least re incarceration is the norm ... and I'm like that for a long time\nRight [noise] well I agree that all the data that I've seen shows that these types of horticulture programs reduce recidivism rates significantly I was really curious about individuals who are producing food in prison systems\nYou know I look at food as a true healing modality so not only for mental health but physical health and individuals who enter the prison pipeline are coming from communities where I Know what they look like they're soda there's junk food there isn't healing food available\nSo suddenly they're in a a system they're allowed to work on a farm and they're not allowed to eat the food\nYeah it's a bit of a conundrum you would think that if you're spending the time to grow food saying a garden inside prison that\nFood would be made available and I'm not clear enough exactly on what some of those restrictions are beyond\nA claim to sanitation and food safety issues and perhaps a violation of contract if\nFood is being provided by say a large corporation like Arab mark maybe those are some of the justification my prison officials but it seems on the face of it that that would\nBe secondary to trying to feed prisoners who well documented have really poor food in prisons the food that they grow\nI mean if we want to\nOr that they were well nourished should be at the top of the left and of course I'm looking at the ... but I just know how important food is to making us feel well and again it's mental and physical health so I Hope that in your next project with President and the food system that you will\nInvestigate this a little bit more I sense that there might be some injustice involved and I'd like to know more about it but anyway I'm just planting seed there\nWe just have a couple of minutes and I was hoping maybe I'd give you\nA little bit of time to bring forth something from this book that you want to leave our listeners with\nOne of the lessons that I took away from doing this research was that we need to think a bit more carefully about how to politically engage and and I think through the process of learning about the immigration politics\nLabor politics and cars for all politics and each of these cases that there are a few take home points that perhaps are worth considering\nThe verses around this notion of need to be building collective power and thinking about collective power through the lens of movement and building I think when food justice activists think like a movement that they strive to collect devised their struggles in ways\nThat can better tackle large structural problems like say an immigration regime that racialized those\nPeople coming across the border from Mexico to work in the field to California and I think too often the impulse is to act individually with charity or with our wallets\nThe impulses to give food to the hungry or to buy food from the local farmers market and I think bringing up for justice analysis\nInto for instance food policy councils or starting food policy councils with an express commitment different ...\nAnd those local spaces or an entry point for us to do more of this kind of work I think the second thing that I Want to talk about is the need to be advancing diversity in the food movement and this requires much more than inviting underrepresented groups into preexisting white middle class spaces\nI think there's a need to push against this token form of diversity and think more about creating inclusive witty and decision making power representative leadership and an equitable distribution of resources within the food movement and food organizations\nAnd I see this happening around the U.S you know it's just that community food systems conference in Boston last year\nAnd a leak ... gave a really powerful talk where he is talking about diversity in these kinds of ways and I think it's important that we continue to do that but strategically speaking to justice activists could also diversify their strategies and tactics and find a way to link up with other social justice struggles like\nClimate justice movement threat to the city movement\nAnd other kinds of racial justice movements like black lives matter and the dreamers and this is already happening you know the black lives matter or in the movements black lives\nHas a food justice policy platform the parts of the climate justice movement have integrated food justice and so there's really unique opportunities to diversify our struggles and work together\nWell we'll have to end their and direct people to your terrific book Dr ...\nEnclosed saying I Want to thank our listeners for joining us I Want to remind everyone that foods with radio is produced by Dan ... studios and beautiful downtown in Columbia, Missouri\nAnd I want you especially thank my guest Dr

da\nDa da da da\nDa da\nDa da da\n\nDa da da da da\nDa\nDa\n\n\n\n\nThis is building bridges\nWith Ken Nash and Mimi Rosenberg\nPointing immigrant labor fighting for their rights\nWhether immigrant workers documented or undocumented seek to hold crooked and exploit Tate of bosses accountable for wage theft\nAnd pay that are below the prevailing wage or we're just too many hours for too little pay and benefits\nAnd are subject to abusive treatment to their percentage such a sexual harassment or want the freedom to push for decent jobs and organize unions without risking arrest\nThey deserve legal protections\nNow with Trump threatening to bring a rain of lawlessness to American cities the most precarious workers are subjected to more militarized an extensive workplace raids mass arrests family separation and extradited deportations\nThen there is the all too familiar story of scapegoating immigrant workers and deliberately pitting them against American workers and big corporations cut wages that they speak to reap bigger benefits\nThey replaced one set of workers with another from other regions to other countries or by automating work\nMeanwhile CEO pay and bonuses continue to rise while workers' wages fall when yours scrambling to find work or getting beat out of a job by someone willing to work for less there's been a lord to an anti immigrant status\nContract talks but it's safe fair workplace regardless of immigration that he's cheat social inclusion promoting economic fairness and helping community exercise the right they do have\nA specially those without a say in who gets elected to office\nMigrants seeking asylum and immigrant workers are pulling the strings are rigged economy\nWas making the decisions that cause economic hardship can be more likely founded mar a Lago not at the border\nIf we don't focus on holding the ultra rich and greedy corporations accountable workers will continue to losing all the raids in the world will not help native born en documented workers with job security that false notion that we are in competition with immigrants limits on the ability to see each other\nEven when the collateral damage as children\nAt this moment wealthy corporations and billionaires not immigrant children and their parents are sacrificing workers for profits were just see this as a warning when people are so to human eyes the forcing kids to sleep in kennels becomes acceptable\nThe value of life for everybody goes down instead of scapegoating children mothers and fathers wish you reconnect with our humanity and demand change from the truth source of our hardship\nAnd how to control corporate class let's be clear we have found the culprit and that's not our fellow workers and certainly not children\nAnd I felt the need to stay there sweeping long overdue in\nJustine what our thoughts are on the horrifying attacks on immigrant sisters and brothers immigrant workers and with that two of the people who work are Jewish play who labor in the field in support of workers the working class\nWe're and can one director the UCLA labor center and director of the UCLA labor's center and founding president of the Egypt to depict American labor alliance\nAnd I think you both so much for joining us and why don't we begin with can't long and maybe you can give us the lay of the line now if you will on what immigrant undocumented workers in particular are facing\n... thank you so much for having me on the show and for\nHighlighting this critical issue a there are currently eleven million undocumented immigrants living within the United states\nThey play a critical role in many parts of our economy or they plant and pick the fruits and vegetables that we eat every day or they care for our young for elderly they are in dispensable part of\nA mini manufacturing and service industries throughout the country um but because of their status as undocumented immigrants they are subject to a extreme abuse and exploitation\nHow many people talk about how our immigration system is broken well in fact it's working for those who are reaping the benefits of exploiting immigrant workers\nAnd it's also working for those who are trying to use this as an issue\nTo divide workers along their common interests and so uh what we see today is that there is amazing organizing that's taking place among immigrant workers all across the country some of the very strongest union organizing campaigns and worker center organizing\nCampaigns are being led by immigrant workers in spite of uh these very harsh conditions are but they cannot win this fight alone and it's really critical that other people I'm In the community in unions in um\nThere's probably a little broader executive director of the national day labor organizing network which is one of the groups to one we ask you who are the workers that you represent what did they do in one of the obstacles to see these both in terms of the employers and in terms of the government denies\nSure thank you for having me well I'm you know\nDay laborers are people who defy the odds every single day and they offer the only thing that people say that is their labor they do it\nYou know standing on on sidewalks a defining police officers security guard unscrupulous employers a white supremacist\nOrganizations and individuals that come in and harassed and every single day and despite a\nAll of these obstacles that they face a after they are there\nAre waiting for an employer who's willing to offer them a day or\nYou know a day at work and they are ready to do whatever a job or is available to them when the day they were not organized when they are not when they having comes together could decide what their minimum wage she's going to be when they are\nAre isolated from each other\nThat's when unscrupulous employers come in and take advantage of their circumstances\nAnd uh you know they often time sometimes hire a\nOne two three days oftentimes weeks and then the ... with a promise that the employer will pay perhaps at the end of the month in the entire at the end of the month will come and tell them hey wait for me you're tired of them not being check up and you pay a at the time that they never showed up\nOn what the abuses that uh\nHealth and safety risks that people face and a employed most employers say by even though on da da da da da di\nDi a personal protection protective equipment gear and um that doesn't happen\nSo a workers are forced to work and they're very dangerous conditions these are some of the abuses but also a wild folks are waiting a they face vitamins and they faced persecution by\nA local police officers\nUm you know the the um in terms of the immigration debate or any or something the pressure and all the the uh the federal government has the exclusive I started watching the ... university and blow up in the past they keep that our story as a dean transfer\nTo some police departments\nIn in some places in the name of the way that in some other places in the in the\nFull blown a participation in all ... of course many in immigration law enforcement\nSo um you would see oftentimes a police officer come in and interrogating workers about that document and again I mean I Do all that the uncertainty that people leave every single a day you know\nWe are going to get back to when folks are coming to New York uh but I I Want to just to move back first second to uh uh ask Ken long or some of his thoughts on this and of course Pablo as well it recently as recently as a Wednesday\nThere were a number of raids in Thirteen different locations that we know that were conducted by ISIS fish will serve warrants on through the different locations eleven in Nebraska for example interested roughly a hundred and thirty people now the rain\nEmployers who hire undocumented workers your thoughts on what can be done about that or do you know of canned Juan actions that are being taken by organized groups of laborers in conjunction with community\nOr to stop these ever more militarized and aggressive raids on people who are trying to survive and maintain their families\nUm ISIS playing a horrible role in many communities throughout the country and terrorizing immigrants in a rating workplaces where we have a immigrants who are contributing to our economy or working or\nA helping to produce the wealth in this country and yet a in a very populated political move the current administration is going after workplaces Tareq habits within these communities to a strip family is from there I'm\nA parents from the um wage earners in their families and to plunge immigrant families further into poverty\nAre so these raids are doing nothing to ah improve the lives of anyone there doing nothing to improve our economy but there were a way of uh targeting a immigrants and I'm a\nStirring up more division and fear\nUm what I see happening throughout the country is that uh there is a tremendous outrage and there's a new sanctuary movement that many um faith communities are embracing there are\nPeople all across the country who are expressing outrage at families being torn apart at the border and children being held in cages or when the administration tried to implement their Muslim ban we've got thousands of people rallying to an airport\nTargeted ah so ah the reality is that uh the vast majority of people in this country do not support the current administration's a vicious attacks on immigrants and\nIt's important at this critical time to stand with my immigrant families to stand with immigrant youth and to push back at these very um\nA racially motivated and politically motivated attacks\nIt's you're actually any specific legislation we don't have that much we have a minute or two left that is being proposed and then of course ... although we want to find out when you folks are coming to New York so that we can build support\nFortunately given the current political climate in Congress no progressive immigration legislation has a chance moving forward\nThe November midterm elections are critical it's very important that people\nGet out to the polls and that we can hopefully a unseat the a Republican majorities in uh the uh house and Congress because um there are a major obstacle in any hope of a passing\nA progressive immigration reform\nPablo Alvarado when are we going to see you folks in New York I Know there's something planned tell us about that yes\nI'm a desert TPS older stay calm on them or they laborers from all of\nThem are neighbors among them are construction workers they are members of like ... members of issue you're either union members have worked a member of worker centers the labor that must be workers for PBS holders are working in all the different things that you can think off\nI include in the field so there's a bunch of ah there's a\nA group of about twenty holders who are in the ...\nAmerica that uh is plenty three is that separation of twenty three hundred kids with the U.S Mexico border created such a a you might tiring immoral prices for the for the country doesn't match and what will happen when when the gifts that is and and and then two hundred and Seventy five thousand\nUh kids are separated from their moms and that that's what they're standing in the country they're also been in the country for over Twenty years I pay taxes that ball and everything but they'd be an actor and that they should be\nIn a package citizenship not apply to the protection and the third thing which is very important is that ah obviously these are nutrition seemed the ancient is to disseminate fear across the board they want to make sure that immigrants a\nFew government a police institution cetera uh you know and they won also American here in America so it's essentially an agenda of fear that these ... spread and so they understand that\nThe only folks that can actually we moved up here it's actually the people that the effect it back to the communities themselves or they're going to I Would like we have about ten seconds please\nThey were telling people there's no reason for you here in America so that's what people to support this this journey for justice which will be in New York on ... on uh September Seventeen\nAnd we'll give you more information as we get closer to the seventeenth and we want to support\nAnd say thank you to ... although that all the ticket is director of national day labor organizing networking can one directed to UCLA
