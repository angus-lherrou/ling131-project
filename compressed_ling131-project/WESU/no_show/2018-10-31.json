{"month": "10", "state": "CT", "station": "WESU", "content": "[noise] you're listening live to a W E s U eighty eight point one FM Middletown I'm Sherry and just the voice of the city so happy to be here with you on that fine Tuesday mischief night is it mischief night we've been off the air for a couple of weeks had done some uh\nSome experiences I don't want to get into too much detail to respect the privacy of my family but as a broadcaster and somebody who feel\nThe need to express what I'm going through in real time um I just want to say I got an education recently about something I never realized that he did it and if freaks me out you're going to hear me talk a lot about it because they think\nAt the community we should really be aware of these things especially if we all have teenagers\nAnyway so I learned something about instead of drugs and something called the research chemicals and how popular they are among young people I learned the hard way and they are popular and easy to get and I'm just a little\nIt's not a judgment that's just the truth and I think in our drug education we have to honor that and I thought oh you don't do that it's terrible you know yes you want to explain to people the reality of drug usage\nBut we also want to be open minded and teach people what is out there and to understand and know the risk and benefit ratio of one can say that about research chemicals but these things are truly toxic\nUm and I think we need to educate our young people but there's one thing and particularly that scares me a lot of that young people think they're getting something which a lot of us are familiar with it is a drug that's been around for ... years called Ellen de\n... is very uncommon in United States right now because it's not pure so any time a young person thinks they're getting out with your anyone thinks they're getting Ellen de they very well could be getting to five I\nAnd B O N e that the chemical name also known on the street is embalming some people the typically choose to go out and use embalmed\nAnd the ones they are choosing to go out and they know they're using embalm are there are a little more educated how dangerous this drug is but the folks that things are getting al and she don't know that they're using something that as a thousand times more potent and LSD and can kill you\nSo that's my public service announcement I'm probably going to do a whole show about synthetic drugs that are on the market how easily accessible they are for young people teenagers who may think oh I was just going to a party with my friend everybody's doing it is going to we're going to dance and have a good time\nThere was also sold to you young folks on teens and early twenties and you didn't stop there on on a link campus to the public service announcements be safe\nOn you know what you're using and injecting their test kit available you can look on line if you're like I really got to try that you could get a test kit you could test to test your stuff there's all kinds of information and know what you're getting on these things have toxic talk\nAttacks and it's just not worth the night of fun and I think that um people just don't ... know about that so we kept me out there for the last three weeks it's been quite the education and I'm Glad to be back at the end of my public service announcement for now I'll be talking more about that as I\nGleaned more information and arrive at a different place from this but I'm very excited tonight because we have um we have a local group in our local duo and a local honey right look at the local honey\nTo I'm going to take a real no I'm not that I was going to I'm a little to organize them on the air for me to go to public service announcements but I

the features of local honey incorporate them mandolin ... string guitar\nNice so tell me what what is the political honey project to the Disney river band as a band that you guys play and then you've

war\nPeople don't like most people are there's a crowd so there's the problem there is where there's you know I'm\nSomebody recently said to me and I thought this was interesting that like the peace movement in our country is kind of fizzled out and why and I wonder about that and why we we got to like revived that kind of mentality again I think we just got so\nWhat's the word I'm looking for your time today maybe because let's think about it\nThan a thousand and one since the terrorist attacks of nine eleven we've been at war for Seventeen years so one of my children the only thing in her life that she's ever known her steam and you know collectively in our country\nIs war what is that what is that hey I've got say to our children\nWhat does it say about our country and how do we change that you know Seventeen years\nAnd it certainly would be the place and it's been said they ever know\nIt's all that they really don't just normal and just you know there there's only one and\nThen you look at what's on TV and all those exposures whatever you're doing is all very violent and\nA lot of violence so her as\nWell I got to stay and to counteract all that because you know

I'm a computer science math student recently graduated and\nIt's something that I've always you know I I feel like I'm a very or I Try to be is you know objective\nIn my in my own mind with certain principles that you know might aligned with simulation and I you know at some point like given the possibilities of everything and everything had like than experiencing in my life right now like\n[noise] it's so hard to say I mean I I don't even know how to find the words honestly as\nYou know what just just the fact that you know I'm able to listen to you guys through the air you know what I mean and interpret them in my own mind to contact you guys are now being broadcast it over some you know a very primitive in a sense\nRadio waves like that to me is enough evidence to\nFully validate that the possibility of a simulation is viable\nThat's right well we'll take that are jumping off point thank you awesome thank you so much for ah for calling in and we hope you stick around\nOh of course I'll be listening you guys you guys have a great night\nAll right thanks so much in all of them [noise]\nHow 'bout that\nReally love started off the night with a caller you know there's really nothing like it I think we have\nSome direction for our show now so so this is we're going to get into this I think at some point but but I think when most people just when you heard our theme for the show what where does your mind first go when you or in general than when you hear the term stimulation you know without in conversation where does your mind go\nMy mind went to a lot of crazy conspiracy to in my mind also went to um this new person that's nothing new anymore called bloom and Kayla um do you know over I Do I Do know Wilma Kayla um for those that do well actually why don't you explain to our listeners\n[laughter]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nWhat do you make it makes me the only on WB if you idiot point one Middletown we are talking about stimulation and we're also joined by special get DJ Joe borough so I Want to start it off because my ... my fabulous co host earlier on the show while I mentioned something that she mentioned to me earlier\nAnd we were talking about the difference between not feeling like yourself and the more contemporary for not um but now I'm a non excuse me of not viewing yourself period\nI think they're closer then they initially seen\nI think one is in the realm of the other\nYeah I think not feeling yourself well usually people say it when they feel themselves which I think it's close to feeling like\nHome and your body like ...\nElse I mean that in a way of like I don't like how it feels to be me right now which I think Dan traumas tenth of like detachment which is not feeling like myself this is a following\nYeah you've got me into another anyways [laughter] excuse me um yeah\nSo which one would you say the umbrella and which one is under the umbrella\nNot feeling like yourself as the umbrella underneath which cannot fill yourself in the in the debate of all\nDid you ever okay did you ever when you were a kid have like an out of body like that of hours or day where you just felt really odd like generally physically odd like you were almost watching yourself\nI mean it's funny you say that in relation to being a kid 'cause I felt that often like recently\nYeah I just feel like when I was a kid it was more like my reaction was wander and now it's horror yeah associated with this very specific ... will ... will tell me about a wonder experience out playing soccer\nAs a kid I at recess at school and not feeling like I was in control of any of my movements and for a second I had this tendency that it was going to make me like better looking like it was you know crazy the Disney sports movie where like my body was going to have some divine\nEmpowerment um but no I you know I was just sort of flailing around but I remember being kind of wondering it that that like I could do things without really or I felt as though I was doing things without really considering them um it was it it felt more like auto pilot and it was likely dehydration [laughter]\nAnd now when I get that way I'm like I I it's absolute ... I also probably associated with some degree of altered state thinking yeah um which is its own\nLike like self generated virtual reality [laughter] [laughter]\nReally hot take I'd say thank you I'm going to stop talking for a little to what that where uh yeah I don't know did you have any childhood did either of you have any like and all that experience with your own like like some separated I don't know if I'm being if I'm clarifying as well well\nI guess I don't I don't totally feel what you're saying and the closest I can think of from a kid perspective\nIs like doing something in front of other people like being on stage or giving a presentation and feeling out of body like I was watching myself like I actually but I think that that actually the trauma of the memory and nice separating myself from it after the fact\nUm\nBut I Would say that I didn't I was never aware of my odds aware of my connection between mind and body until more recently and the feeling of like feeling like I was in a simulation or just like far more back loaded into the most recent years of my life\nWhen I'm just like all true aware of how I feel in any given situation I Would I wouldn't say that it was a kid thing for me which is interesting\nI think as a kid for me there are moments I'm less of a simulation in some ways but more stuff awareness and being yourself in a scene in stepping outside your body um\nAnd maybe that's looking at yourself through a different lens that you may not be used to 'em and maybe you could argue that that's a simulation and some factor um but being able to see yourself in a scene as if you're um performing in some way or being theatrical um makes me think\nThat maybe someone who is in your brain tenure grants looking at you as if you're not there early\nYeah okay\nHe hacked into my subconscious so I'm going to take us on a little journey really quite by accident I'm here with the main stimulant or experience of my youth\nAnd I still do it on a less like theatrical level to this date but if there was ever someone that I was infatuated with any degree and uh like I Want to be friends with your way in a like I'm In love with the way in a year my favorite teacher that I've ever had in a I Wonder what my piano teachers up through right now way\nI Would whenever I was doing anything whether it was of Notre completely Monday and I would imagine that I was doing it with them watching in like some ... like ... in some wired in like that but that they were the ones with the superpower yeah but the unspoken super power that they could like why are themselves into my brain\nAnd they were watching a first person feed of what I was doing so first it was like they have to discover what exactly I'm doing 'cause watching someone do something from a first person standpoint is kind of weirdly fusing\nAnd I still do it I Swear to God that I still do it I didn't know area and I can't believe that I'm here now do you do with that is not the information I was on the air but I I appreciate you out [laughter] so anyway I just wanted to share that because I was way more relevant than the place that I started from\nBut I'm curious for either of you what have you had like an experience with with a synthetic like non with like mechanical virtual reality or or digital virtual reality recently\nI'm actually just last week I got to go to the exhibit um that it was\nWhere it's not only your visual sense as being stimulated by your your visuals there's um sound there's you even get a smell over and it it just kind of visceral experience of\nAs if you're actually I'm In the throughout the island on where you're flying over land but isn't really there and it's all rejected by screen 'em and going off that seemed\nExclusively site um and sometimes it's down to not but there's a lot of other central experiences are being represented\nI'm giving going with that like you can looking at how like I'm trying to think about um how you could represent tasters simulation or touch 'em or even experience of stimulating emotions\nI Can't wait till he can virtually eat food [laughter] yeah\nThis is reminding me of that yeah of maniac actually of of an episode of maniac that deals with sex virtual reality and really funny way but it's like an extension of the women in Minority Report deals with it but um\nThis this is just a brief there's also reminding me of like rare projection and movies and how that can be like intentionally worse oh yeah like intentionally trying to make it look a little fake\nI started out in effect semi recently saw something that is period with with purposefully garde ... reproduction\nThem like once she just seemed like such I mean a lot of like Hitchcock than watching is a lot of reproduction it's like\nOh the rear projected you know ... like wants that it wanted to be like so fake that it is beautiful it's obviously fake and it's harder sometimes to to do that from ... from movies that were actually made in the period when they didn't have the technology yeah and you don't know if they go in or out of all when you can extract that because it's like\nThey also couldn't probably couldn't do a whole lot better sort of still have that going to have it be read is that way that's ... that's what the ... like ... trajectory will be it'll come back to having it be a little\nWorse than reality and it'll be if you are in effect but right now it's just from the beginning where they they need to use ...\nThat's true I ... it's been spending the last two years creating a a VR I think that this is the most compelling be art project to me because it's\nBachmann was traveling was at the Cannes Film festival and most recently it was a lock them up in LA and um they it was in a space with what physical not really ... like ... explicit props but\nThe ground was dressed to feel like a desert and there were very specific like there was air being filtered in there were so that it wasn't like here's a here's a you know plastic Rockville used up on at this place but it was it was an atmosphere I think that that is compelling to me\nI mean and that in comparison to\nA stimulation of the border crossing experience in the show dark tourists that was just absolutely distasteful have you seen that yeah you have a ... like let's simulate what it's like to cross the border\nCan you tell me a little more more of an audit so dark tourist is like a show all law I'm like what the ... a show with his friends\nAre where they short now where where they go and travel oh oh round idiot Ron it's like they needed abroad type humor and I'm forgetting the host of the show\nBut essentially he goes to like dark tourism around the world like places that are so busy with death or like something a little odd\nOr like people who like to go see the houses of like a serial killer for example but one of them is this toward that people pay like big bucks for an stimulates it's like what it's like to cross from Mexico to the U.S and they have fake people come out and like\nRob you and a year like traveling all night for and it's like a bunch of people who are a little they're trying to be like well intentioned like I Want to really emphasize with people who have to go through that in real life\nBut ultimately it's just like I think one of the most sensitive\nAnd you know that versus the are maybe tasteful version of you know a migrant story that you know not as exploitative\nBut then there was a yeah this is interesting you bring up dark towards 'cause this is where medium dictates tasteful mess like or some skewed idea of yeah too 'cause\nWhen you say when you mentioned like a ... a really putting you in a place and you are here type thing that's what a lot of like doc you fiction movies are doing but in the wrapping of send them out so it's not yeah in a way I I Wonder if that like if they're getting off\nSort of clean or they're like when a movie like the cardio to stay in that middle you purports to be really real purport like this is the reality but it's also super stylized\nBut then you put that up against the movie like\nOr or or work or worked at the ... supposed to be like ... like ... son Jonas made a movie called busier too which is both which has shot like really and held and greatly and not composed but it's also a intense border narrative I don't know it's interesting like\nI Am calling that this particular innovation virtual reality that I think there are plenty of things that are virtual reality that get sort of not labeled as such yeah agreed\nAnd on that note renting quick break because we've been at it for for quite some time here but stick around we got a quarter of our show left here next media um and uh

S. U. eighty eight point one Middletown, Connecticut listen I'll bum reviews I read your host DJ and the when\nI'm DJ Merlin a we just played you three songs off of Stevie Wonder album music in my mind is the first three on the album\nAbsolutely the first two you heard were uh a lot around super woman or to really likes dogs actually ones like seven ... a little over seven minutes the other ones are kind of a crazy way to start the I'm very uh\nWhat'd you say I I'm\nVery very what what were you going to say I know that like okay I didn't like very ambitious attempt to say I'm going to put these dogs I like the first you've got to talk of Albert twenty minutes yeah I feel that I I think I'm a bit like it makes it makes a liquid dinner ship for it in a way just because\nLike the songs are longer like seven and eight minutes respectively and like especially the end like songs where you know\nFrom our listeners perspective it it keeps you in on the whole time like there's no Oh absolutely so I Am like super woman is like is basically to separate song right the second half of it is just wildly different different course dinner and everything\nSo like he can do it and he did it so it came out incredibly I think um and\nI don't know it it's pretty crazy though I was listening to it or yesterday morning just to sort of like refresh my mind of everything and it was just wild like walking around um I was in the middle of of like buying groceries and stuff and just like walking around and I was like bop into it I'm like wow this is still going on like ...\nLike the long and how would you like what is going on um but ah yeah we'll we'll see how it progress is\nYeah so uh this is a TV fourteen studio album which is pretty crazy to considering that uh he was Twenty one when it came out\nUh and it's kind of considered like the the song and it took him from being like a child stars singer or he could be called like little Stevie Wonder uh got payment of the song called I Want to say it's like fingertips fingertips yes fingertips yeah\nAnd er he actually so this is the first album that he got from Motown he's a Motown artist or where he got full creative control over the entire album so you'd literally made every sound in that in that song like every instrument those played every like Vogel is Han except for I think\nA trumpet player and a guitarist and one of the songs it's it's really crazy like he just literally made everything and kind of broke away from that little towns down that was consistent and formulaic before\nYeah yeah it's pretty sweet and he also like broker I feel like there was a long time when he was kind of I'm\nMore of a musician for other people in a way like a ... at Motown like there was a while when the label find him and he was because he was still young you know I mean he was writing things of course but I feel like he likes applied a lot of sound in other people's songs and was very\nIt's super cool to then like at twenty Twenty one years old ... like ... like split off and just like everything yeah it's pretty sweet yeah so a next step you're going to hear\nA sweet little girl which is a crazy song you're kind of a it sounds very country it's a mix it a couple of different styles I'd say a father by girl blue and keep on running were playing a six dogs have a nice nice hung out him since he got the majority of our time here\nUm so what did you guys right into sweet little girl\n\nI'm you know\nI mean\n...

I'm a consistent\nPrimary source of drinking water what happens is that consistent primary source of drinking water has become more inconsistent says the hurricane and now\nI'm things have been restored but during the times of inconsistent service people resort to secondary service secondary sources of water and those secondary sources of water\nOff and I'm certain that that come directly from the earth that are unfiltered and untreated rivers are wells that might not be regulated and um water that they're storing from the rain in plastic\nJunk bonds or water that they store prior to to service being interrupted\nSo basically anywhere they can ... I mentioned the widespread distrust\nWater might be safe to drink can you comment on that little bit [noise] um well what I hear\nWhen I go into the field and working humidity is is that people really desire to have a home use filter that they feel will serve them with potable drinking water so that they\nFeel they are sure assured that they're providing\nAffordable drinking water for their children and their families oftentimes people will tell me they\nPrefer to buy bottled water than you'd tap water 'em and more than sixty percent of our respondents\nSay that their primary drinking sort it bottled water but oftentimes people in that community comments they cannot afford to buy bottled water that serves their needs efficiently and so the ... still chasing units are very desirable right now\nRight I mean it would be buying only bottled water can get very expensive very quick and I understand some of the um an effort to uh to providing aid in the aftermath of the hurricane of course included bottled water but there was that horrible story about I'm\nA huge uh pilots of bottled water just lying on the used an on distributed\nOn a remote to a part of the island of the you know I've been sitting in the sun now for a year and our own green ... is just terrible to even think about that waste I'm so uh what as far as you know what are the contaminants that to a Puerto Ricans are having to deal with in the water I mean when we\nWhen we look at the the issue of Flint, Michigan there was very specific type of contamination of the lead contamination of had to do with the chemical lining of the pipe what our Puerto Rican or what does Puerto Rico's water supply dealing with in terms of\nContamination [noise] ah well that's a good question I\nTo the hurricane that was a concern um flooding causes you know the spread of bacterial diseases through water and so that was our main focus however and now since it has\nIt been well over a year since hurricane happens the bacterial logical contamination has definitely been redo 'em and so that\nIs good news people do also need to worry about things like lead and on arsenic so we did a small pilot had 'em in at about forty five homes of\nMetals and this data has not been published yet but the preliminary results from this small sample show that arsenic in particular and particularly in the western area of Puerto Rico arsenic is I'm a main concern and in ... led also\nWhile so we're talking about very toxic substances and especially children are quite vulnerable now here in the U.S many people are depending on where they live here on the U.S mainland I should say many people depending on where they live um can comfortably drink drink or near the water that comes out of the faucet\nUm in other parts of the country with recommended to have a filter many bridges now just come with filters attached [noise]\nUm what do you be a on the island how what access to people how to personal water filtration systems because it seems as though having one's own filter could really offer a low cost to measure of of independence\nSure okay so our in our budget project I wouldn't have yeah we focused in areas where the government service water utility does not um [noise] reach those communities are often times most vulnerable for water contamination and for a sanitation issues and so we provide home used filter\nBut every Saturday Night from ten to twelve am\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter] and you're listening to middle\nHi welcome to foods lose radio where we help you think beyond your plate I'm all into Hamel guard a registered dietitian and investigative nutritionist on a mission to connect the dots between food health and agriculture and find food truth\nAnd said I Am honored to walk with my guest Dr Sheila stuffy on Iran or she is an associate professor of pediatrics and an adjunct associate professor within the department of environmental an occupational health sciences at the University of Washington her\nResearch interest focus on exposures to ... disrupting chemicals including salads and ... you know a and their impact on reproductive development she's one of the leading authors of a new American Academy of pediatrics policy statements titled\nFood additives and child health which we'll be talking about today Welcome back to stop the honor run a it's wonderful to have you here thank you for inviting me\nWhile I was really intrigued by this paper because I have been a dietitian for close to forty years\nAnd I remember very early on in my career there was great discussion about how children's behavior in particular was affected by food additives and it's time we were looking at different diets that would restrict coloring\nThis particular document looks at a variety of food additives and how they impact child health before we dive into the president a paper I'm curious to know how you became interested in this area\nI was an environmental science major and I was an undergrad and I had always wanted to combine environmental work with human health and\nHuman health and specifically child health outcomes\nAnd have focused ... disrupting chemicals for most of my career and what we found over time as the a lot of these chemicals tend to be in our food supply\nAnd so that's why we're here with this current study which really focused on highlighting food additives in the foods that we eat today\nMhm well we've been looking at this topic for a long time and our regulatory bodies that are really designed to protect us and I'm going to focus on the food and Drug Administration [noise] seem not to be doing their job as well as possible and I wonder if you could talk a little bit about\nHow our regulatory structure is designed to protect us and what isn't happening\nSo the food and Drug Administration is a really large administration they're in charge of food safety as well as drug safety and if you just take the example of prescription drugs they go through many clinical trials\nBefore they come to market and that's how they determine safety so there's really strict guidelines for how they determine safety for something like a prescription drug for foods it's a little bit different and so there are some regulatory loopholes that allow companies to add\nAdditives and other products into our food supply without adequate safety in toxicity testing so the major regulation which was created decades ago\nDid requires some foods you eat and toxicity data but it has not been updated since then and so there are a number of chemicals that have been grandfathered in from a long long time ago that are added to our food supply\nWhether they may now be harmful to human health so that's one category of chemicals so then there's another category of chemicals that can enter the food supply through a loophole called generally recognized as safe as it's called grass\nAnd the grass loophole allows companies to determine whether an additive is safe and then added to the food supply and just notified the FDA that they have done that and\nThis loophole really allows for some chemicals to come in that really don't have any\nAdequate safety or toxicity data so I think we have three different groups of chemicals that kind of enter the food supply some that have some safety in Texas City data but it hasn't been updated um that have\nNone at all and we really need more data and some that enter into this loophole\nMhm [noise] well it's interesting because in your paper you're right that the government Accountability Office conducted an extensive review of the FDA grass program in twenty ten and determined that the FDA is not able to ensure the safety of existing or new additives\nAnd you go on to explain that most of those assessments were done by individuals who were either employees of the manufacturer who were hired by a consulting firm that the manufacturer hired or\nThat they were made by someone or an expert panel that was selected by just consulting firm in other words none of the evaluations were made by an independent third party\nThat's correct yeah and so some of these food companies will hire consultants to help them do their toxicity data or to provide information to FDA and I think that what this part of the paper's really getting at\nAnd of transparency so industry is able to provide any data to FDA and FDA well accepted under this loophole and what would be better is that there were independent third parties that were\nEither evaluating safety or Texas City data or determining the safety and talk to the themselves\nExactly and we should just let our listeners know that today there are more than ten thousand chemicals\nThat are allowed to be added to food and food contact materials and we should probably explain there were two categories of these kinds of attitudes one is called direct and the other is called in direct can you explain the difference\n[noise] [noise] yeah so direct additives are added directly into the food an indirect additives are things that can enter\nThrough contamination process and so for an example one of the classes of chemicals that we talk a lot about our satellites\nAnd Sally it's our synthetic chemicals that are in plastics and there are a lot of food packaging pieces like cardboard or other that had plastic linings or there may be plastic coating on a frozen dinner\nAnd Sally Yates can be used in any of these plastic uses and so they're not directly added into the food but they indirectly get into the food supply because they are contaminants in the whole manufacturing process\nMhm you know it's interesting some times during the summer\nI'll see that there will be a food drives and I will see crates of processed food sitting outside in high temperatures and the first thing that pops into my mind is oh my gosh the you know there's got to be compounds that are migrating from the packaging into the food is no one else concerned about\nThat would help protect the innocent especially children who are more vulnerable [noise] have you seen any kind of policies along those lines\nAny policies that would specifically protect children's health right mhm\n[noise] in terms of this specific area on food additives\nI have not seen the civic regulatory policy coming from the government that would adequately protect children's health I have seen a number of consumer groups or nonprofits who's put out some nice recommendations for family\nRight such as perhaps the environmental working group the natural Resources Defense council those are good places for people to go and we can provide some additional links as well as this excellent paper [noise] why the focus on children you know what is it that makes children more vulnerable\nYes the children are not little adults they really have developing brains developing Oregon systems and what we know now is that what we exposed children too early in life can really affect their later life health outcomes\nSo that period of development especially in utero during pregnancy as well as early childhood zero to five is just so important for the rest of their lives and this is the period when very important Oregon's are developing and being programmed\nAnd so that's why we are really concerned about their exposure at very early ages\nMhm and you can correct me if I'm wrong but it's my understanding that yes these chemicals are tested they are tested individually but never in combination\nYes that's usually the case the toxicity testing paradigm\nIt's interesting when we talk about what people can afford and why not the you know that goes back also to economic policies and how people are paid for their jobs or if they don't have time to cook why is it and you know\nWork to sometimes even three jobs just to stay afloat so if this much larger story and economic picture and regulatory picture that we really need to get to if we're going to solve child health problems that I Can't imagine what could be more important\nYou mentioned that our regulatory system is really not designed to\nProtect the population against some of these additives and I think about some of the policies that are set up say in the European Union\nWhere there's a much greater emphasis on the precautionary principle for example can we not simply model our system by using some of the regulatory actions that the EU has taken to clean up our own food supply\nYeah I think the EU is certainly at the forefront in some areas of doing this and I think what has seen from what they've done is that it's not very simple these are complex questions and the regulatory action is also a complex so it does require\nA lot of thoughtful\nInterpretation of data as well as forward thinking in terms of protecting human health so I don't know if it would be mirroring what they've done there but certainly learning from it and moving forward but it would have to be a priority for our rule makers\nI Know as both an educator and working with populations have children and parents one of the ways in which I Try to reduce demand for these kinds of processed foods I recommend that children not spend a lot of time with media\nBecause if you look at what is advertised to children just stay on Saturday morning cartoons we see a lot of products that fall into the range of products that you're actually recommending the children\nAnd especially around candy season we see so much more of this kind of product on supermarket shelves\nHow do you help parents in your own practice navigate this world of products that are highly processed\nYeah I think it's not easy I think that there is a lot of marketing to our kids and families but I also see some positive from the obesity work that's been done\nWhere we have really focused on creating strong positive messages to families and to really have them understand the consequences of\nEating a lot of processed foods in law especially foods that are high in sugar which Halloween often has a lot of foods that are high in sugar and we also try to give messages to parents that are reasonable so it's not reasonable to say that your child is going to be trick or treating and\nGet all this candy and you're going to take it away from them and maybe give them fruit instead\nAnd tell them they have a sugar substitute that's not realistic it's not going to happen but you can have a discussion with them at the beginning\nBefore they go out and trick or treat that we're going to go out and have fun and get all of these trees but we're only going to\nEat a portion of them and we're not going to eat them all at once\nWill have a little bit one week and maybe a little bit the next week and that's it and so I think really creating clear expectations and creating some kind of balance in terms of the foods that they are really excited about eating but also trying to help them be excited about the others as well\nI always recommend that parents feed their children to good healthy dinner before they go out and start trick or treating so that the candy doesn't replace the dinner the healthier food that might have been consumed I Want to turn the program over to you\nI think that one of our main planes as first just education\nThat we wanted people to know that there are regulatory loopholes and that our food supply isn't always completely safe in the way that we think it is and there's certainly lots of things that we're being exposed\nTo the current regulations do not account for and\nIf people are concerned I think they really should bring this up with their local policymakers I think we're in an era of learning more about politics and our political systems work and this is\nOne arena in which you can contact your own policymaker and give them your opinion on this issue as related to the food supply not only for children but for all of us\nMhm and you've got some recommendations for policymakers in this particular paper and will make the paper available on our website\nYou have recommendations for government and you have recommendations for parents so in addition to prioritizing the consumption of fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables you also have a warning about not microwaving food in plastic\nAnd avoid putting plastic from the dishwasher so often we the labels on plastics that say dishwashers face and I don't know of any plastics that are dishwasher stays\nRight I actually don't either but I also don't look for them because I don't watch any plastics in the dishwasher right\nBut in terms of the heating of plastics lots of these chemicals can migrate out of the plastics into who'd through a heating process and so that's why we really tried to focus on decreasing heating plastic containers with food\nAnd you also have a warning to look for certain numbers are recycling codes on the bottom of some of the plastic containers you say to avoid plastics with recycling codes\nWhich indicates that the females are present you know it's interesting everyone I speak to who does research in this area does not use plastic materials in their home they use glass container store in ... food I'm sure it's the same in your kitchen\nIt is and just to clarify one of the things he just said that\nRecycling code number seven is actually a catchall term it could have a number of different components in it so ... may or may not be in products with seven okay but that is the code if it does contain this and all the way it is likely to have that code so I just wanted to make that clarification\nAnd yes in my own home I Will say that I have almost universally glass containers there are a few leftover plastic containers that may be storing some things but they are never heated and rarely used\nRight okay well thank you so much for all of this good information\nAs I said we will make this paper available on line to all of our listeners and closing I Want to thank our listeners for joining us I Want to remind everyone that foods with radio was produced by Dan ... studios and

informed tune in every weekday at five to eighty eight point one is um W E s U Middletown\nMay be an answer in a different genes that people carry you know and there isn't a any sort of clean line that you can divide really between nature and nurture because\nI'm way your genes work often is controlled by the environment and likewise you know your jeans they actually a cause you to seek out different environments to shape the environment around you so um we can't think about a survey either or thing\nWe're speaking with Carl Zimmer multiple award winning science writer and all through numerous books including his latest she has her mother's laugh the powers perversion\nTalk about CRISPR technology in its impact on our sort of general landscape and I'm Wondering what your thoughts about\nThat type of gene editing process that has a wide variety of applications including Houston some basic biology research tool I think that's going to change it revolutionize\nHow we think about curing diseases in a survey on mortality\nWhat I'm most excited by our our some trials that are actually starting literally right now where scientists want to use this technology for editing DNA to treat maybe even cure inherited diseases that until now\nHave had no good treatment at all mhm sickle cell anemia in my case in point to me\nIt's an it's an inherited the disease it's the result of mutations in genes for him a globe and and there are treatments that people can get that can extend their lives but still today you know people are living in to their forties and\nFifties or at most on average and and it's and these diseases caused a huge amount of pain and suffering along the way\nAnd and it's a single gene mutation right sickle cell\nThat's right so if you have a mutation on both copies of this gene you're going to get this disease and so what scientists are exploring now in a clinical trial is using this technology CRISPR\nTo crate molecules can go into cells and can cut out a little piece of DNA or alter that that tiny little bit of DNA very precisely and what's going to happen is that these cells are going to be able to start making\nHealthy michelob and again because their DNA has been altered now it's a completely open question whether this is gonna work or not the devil's in the details in these sorts of things\nFree and so on suggested this could work so I think there's a this is a really potentially revolutionary a treatment um\nNow what gets people really riled up is not what I just talked about what gets people riled up at the idea of using this on on human embryos because if you do that then that person develops from that embryo is going to have that engineering and every one of their cells and will pass that down to a future generations\nI think that's a separate discussion that we we do need to have I think that uh you know the what what you've seen from a lot of\nAh ethicists and scientists have talked about this is you know we really should not even be talking about this kind of procedure except for things for which there's no other alternative ah it\nIt would really only be an incredibly rare set of circumstances where you could medically justify this sort of approach on embryos\nThat being said I'm sure there would be some parents who would love to use it to make their kids taller to change their parents to give them genes that they've been told will make their kids are more successful so we really have to withstand that's adoption\nCall that in many ways a great segue into the next question and that is given this phenomenal world changing set of tools a ... and soon to be increasingly at our disposal\nWhat the best way to think about getting ready to teach them prepare the next generation of clinicians in healthcare so they're ready\nTo adapt to a all of this bombing scientific discovery that's going to lead to a better way to treat and managing diagnosed maybe even prevent the onset of duty\nYou've written some important textbooks in science education what do you think about preparing or clinical workforce for the future uh which increasingly in our health and health care is going to be moving more\nPractically start over with their education because\nSo much has changed so quickly and the patients are gonna be coming to doctors with results they're getting from direct to consumer services as customers and they're going to say look twenty three means says I have this what are you going to do about\nIt and I already are exactly and\nSo you know you you need to learn how to talk about for example risk you know what what does it mean to have a variant that raises your risk of a disease is a big difference between a mutation that guarantees are going to get Huntington's disease enemy\nOnly on average increases the risk of heart disease and yet it's hard for people to to recognize that if it's there on the report they think it's all the same\nAt the same time I think that ah clinicians are going to have to really get to understand lots of very common diseases are influenced by hundreds or thousands of different genes and that can sound like a nightmare if you're trying to look at ... at each and every gene but [noise]\nYou know there are these these ah approaches a known as ... scores that are going to becoming more and more into practice where you'll sequence a patient's whole genome and then come up with a score which then translates to a real different kind of risk depending on what category are and\nUm and actually with heart disease is has already been demonstrated pretty effectively and just some recent papers from Harvard Medical school so [noise] what scientists are starting to do is develop a way to look across the entire genome at lots and lots of different variants and figure out\nHow do they add up in each person to a risk for a particular disease scientist at Harvard Medical school have been pioneering this with heart disease\nAnd you know their scores are pretty ...\nSeeing how many people in each category are going to get a heart attack or not so this stuff is coming really fast and it's going to be a communication challenge and it's also going to be just a learning challenge\nYou know it's interesting I think your book that sort of talks about this hopeful promise but also the cautionary tale about science\nAnd how it could be misused in advance certain agendas and then the other side of the equation you got people who were talking about and I ... the climate change deniers are just sort of a larger question of what is it going to take to bring science back to its proper place in our political discourse\nYou understand the fundamental science are important for you know in some ways should be settled matter that we have some faith and trust in science and yet it seems\nThat we have a dream since ... thoughts about that\nWell you know certainly within medicine and beyond I'm pretty much every major improvement in human welfare has had something to do with scientific research and and discovering things through science\nI Do think that people do have a great respect still for a scientist and and for doctors and so on but there are these certain areas where people will want to reject\nThe findings of science you know because it somehow feels like a challenge to how they identify themselves or the way they look at the world\nAnd you know I think we all have to sort of recognize or are owned by a sees and to to learn how the scientific process actually works and how science is an ongoing process\nAnd that way we can make sure that uh with genetics for example that that it doesn't end up being used for justifying racism or other really noxious\nProblem so I think we have to be very clear in terms of education and in our own experiences and conversations to recognize what science really is and the benefits that it can give us\nWe've been speaking today with Carl Zimmer multiple award winning

bridges\nWith Ken Nash and Mimi Rosenberg\nReporting immigrant labor fighting for their rights\nWhether immigrant workers documented or undocumented seek to hold crooked and exploit Tate of Boston's accountable for wage theft\nAnd pay that it's below the prevailing wage or work just too many hours for too little pay and benefits\nAnd are subject to abusive treatment to their percentage such as sexual harassment or want the freedom to push for decent jobs and organize unions without risking arrest\nThey deserve legal protection\nNow with Trump threatening to bring a rain of lawlessness to American cities the most precarious workers are subjected to more militarized an extensive workplace raids mass arrests family separation and extradited deportations\nThen they're in the all too familiar story of scapegoating immigrant workers and deliberately putting them against American workers that big corporations cut wages that they speak to reap bigger benefits\nThey replace one set of workers with another from other regions to other countries or by automating work\nMeanwhile the IAU paying bonuses continue to rise while workers' wages fall when yours scrambling to find work or getting beat out of it\nThat's ... that's ... yeah it's very far the issue may not come up in contract talks\nBut a state fair workplace regardless of immigration that and he's cheat social inclusion promoting economic fairness and helping community exercise the right they do have a specially those without a say in who gets elected to office\nMigrants seeking asylum and immigrant workers aren't pulling the strings are rigged economy\nWas making the decisions that cause economic hardship can be more likely founded mar a Lago none of the border\nIf we don't focus on holding the ultra rich and greedy corporations accountable workers will continue losing all the rates in the world will not help native born and documented workers with job security this false notion that we are in competition with immigrants limits our ability to see each other\nEven when the collateral damage children\nAt this moment wealthy corporations and billionaires not immigrant children and their parents are sacrificing workers for profits were just see this as a warning when people are so to human eyes that forcing kids to sleep in kennels becomes acceptable\nThe value of life for everybody goes down instead of scapegoating children mothers and fathers wish to reconnect with our humanity and demand change from the truth source of our hardship\nAn out of control corporate class let's be clear we have found the culprit and that's not our fellow workers and certainly not children\nCan and I felt the need to stay there sweeping long overdue in to just seeing what our thoughts are on the horrifying attacks on immigrant sisters and brothers immigrant workers and with that two of the people who work are\nWorkers are Pablo ... executive director of the national day labor organizing network and canned Juan director UCLA labor center and director of the UCLA labor's center and founding president of the Egypt specific American labor alliance\nAnd I think you both so much for joining us and why don't we begin with can't long and maybe you can give us the lay of the line now if you will on what immigrant undocumented workers in particular are facing\nWell thank you so much for having me on the show and for\nHighlighting this critical issue or there are currently eleven million undocumented immigrants living within the United states\nThey play a critical role in many parts of our economy or they plant and pick the fruits and vegetables that we eat every day uh they care for our young for elderly they are in in dispensable part of a mini manufacturing\nAnd service indices around the country um but because of their status\nAs undocumented immigrants they are subject to a extreme abuse and exploitation many people talk about how our immigration system is broken well in fact it's working for those who are reaping the benefits of exploiting\nImmigrant workers and it's also working for those who are trying to use this as an issue\nTo divide workers along their common interests and so uh what we see today is that there is amazing organizing that's taking place among immigrant workers all across the country some of the very strongest union organizing campaigns and worker center organizing\nCampaigns are being led by immigrant workers in spite of uh these very harsh conditions are but they cannot win this fight alone and it's really critical\nI'm stand up to speak out and I'll defend the right to workers\n... executive director of the national day labor organizing network which is one of the groups so why don't we ask you who are the workers that you represent what did they do and what are the obstacles let's see these both in terms of the employers and in terms of the government denies\nSure well thank you for having me well you know\nThey neighbors are people who defy the odds every single day and they offer the only thing that they ... that is their labor and they do it you know standing on on sidewalks\nOr defying police officers security guards unscrupulous employers a white supremacist organizations\nAnd individuals that come in and harassed and every single day and despite a\nAll of these obstacles that they face a after they are there are waiting for an employer who's willing to offer them a day or you know a day at work uh and they are ready to do whatever a job or is available to them when the day they were\nNot organized when they are not when they having comes together could decide what their minimum wage she's going to be when they are are isolated from each other that Glenn unscrupulous employers come in and take advantage of thought there are circumstances\nAnd uh you know they oftentimes oftentimes hire a\nOne two three days oftentimes weeks and then the ... where the problem is that the employer will pay perhaps at the end of the month in the entire at the end of the month will come and tell them hey wait for your time today I'm nothing check an opinion pay or at least\nUh in the workplace or when people get to the workplace and there are\nA lot of health and safety risks that people face and a employed most employers say why\nEven though all under the law of employers as opposed to provide the a personal protection protective equipment gear and um that doesn't happen so a workers are forced to work and they're very a dangerous\nConditions this isn't really abusive but also while folks are waiting the they face violence they faced persecution by\nA local police officers\nUm you know the the um in terms of the immigration debate or any or swimming the pressure of all the the uh the federal government has the exclusive I started watching the immigration and blow up in the last decade that I've already has a theme parks or\nTo some police departments\nIn in some places in the name of the way but in some other places\nIn the in the full blown a participation ... bone plus many in immigration law enforcement so um\nYou would see oftentimes a police officer is common and interrogating workers about their documents and again I mean that I Do all that he'd be on certain people leave every single a day you know\nWe are going to get back to when folks are coming to New York um but I I Want to do to move back for a second to uh uh ask Ken long or some of his thoughts on this and of course Pablo as well it recently as recently as a Wednesday\nThere were a number of raids in Thirteen different locations that we know that were conducted by uh I used to fish will serve warrants on through the different locations eleven in Nebraska\nTrump to administration is being carried out ever more high\nProfile enforcement actions against employers who hire undocumented workers your thoughts on what can be done about that or do you know of canned Juan actions that are being taken by organized groups of laborers in conjunction with community\nOr to stop these ever more militarized and aggressive raids on people who are trying to survive and maintain their families\nUm ISIS playing a horrible role in many communities throughout the country and terrorizing immigrants in a rating workplaces where we have a immigrants who are contributing to our economy or working or\nA helping to produce the wealth in this country and yet a in a very populated political move the current administration is going after workplaces Tareq habits within these communities to\nA strip family is from there I'm\nA parents from the um wage earners in their families and to plunge immigrant families further into poverty are so these raids are doing nothing to\nAh improve the lives of anyone there doing nothing to improve our economy but there were a way of uh targeting a\nImmigrants and I'm\nA string of more division and fears um what I see happening throughout the country is that uh there is a tremendous outrage and there's a new sanctuary movement that many um faith communities are embracing there are\nPeople all across the country who are expressing outrage at families being torn apart at the border and children being held in cages or when the administration\nUh expressing their support for um Muslim for\nBeing unfairly targeted\nOr so or the reality is that uh the vast majority of people in this country do not support the current administration's a vicious attacks on immigrants and it's important at this critical time to stand with immigrant families to stand with immigrant youth and to push back at these very um\nA racially motivated and politically motivated attacks\nThere actually any specific legislation we don't have that much we have a minute or two left that is being proposed and then of course ... of of all we want to find out when you folks are coming to New York so that we can build support\nBut fortunately given the current political climate in Congress no progressive immigration legislation has a chance moving forward the November midterm elections are critical it's very important that people get out to the polls and that we can hopefully\nA unseat the a Republican majorities in uh the uh house and Congress because um there are a major\nObstacle in any hope of a passing a progressive immigration reform\nPablo Alvarado when are we going to see you folks in New York I Know there's something planned tell us about that yes I'm\nA desert TPS older they're almost literally laborers\nThem our neighbors are more than ... construction workers they are members of like ... the ... member so if you're either union members have worked a member of worker centers the labor that must be workers for PBS holders are working in all the different things that you can think off I include in the field surveys or\nGot an discourse putting a human face\nTo to the separation of families and they're telling America that are you planning to me is that separation of funding three hundred kids with the U.S Mexico border created such a\nA to money tiring immoral prices for the for the country doesn't match and what will happen when when the UPS that is and and and then two hundred and Seventy five thousand uh kids are separated from their moms and that\nThat's what they're studying the country there always has been in the country for over Twenty years they've paid back to the ball and everything that they'd be an actor and that they should be\nIn a package citizenship not in a plot to deportation and the third thing which is very important is that ah obviously these on the expression seeing things from east to disseminate fear across the board\nThey want to make sure that immigrants are\nFewer government a police institutions cetera uh you know and they won also American you're\nImmigrants should be an agenda of fear that these ... spread and so they understand that\nThe only folks that can actually we moved up here it's actually the people that the effect that they in fact the communities themselves or they're going to I Would like we have about ten seconds pleased\nWith that data people there's no reason for you to see here in America so that's what people to support this this journey projector which will be in New York on ... on September
