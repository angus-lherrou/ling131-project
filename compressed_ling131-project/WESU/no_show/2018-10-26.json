information that's relevant is that I've been invited her\nTwice which means that this is no official either trust\nYeah so I Know most in a who if you would so kindly obliged to give yourself and on the spot DJ name if you\nUm so most seen most bean it's a it incorporates my name with ah with with the words the English words scene and there's also a slight dig it will who who thought that was my real name for a for a little over a month and I didn't go back to them so I think that's all right I was going to mention that he didn't correct me for the first month that I called him\nSuch a heinous Mitch pronunciation of his beautiful name of the rose me any other name\nMost seen what are we talking about tonight Lebanon was six we haven't told our listeners\nThat that's true uh it's it's really upsetting topic how deeply contentious um undoubtedly I'm it's what's been going on around in the news and plays mister postman is there some is there a package for me yes there is it's a\nHorribly constructed Bonn aimed at a member of the liberal elite let's name the I'm not so victims so far the one and only Iraq Hussein Obama\nBill and Hillary Clinton a two for one situation Eric

necessarily reflect the view of ways when university or the Wu si management but you know it's not it's really just you know it's crazy to me it's crazy to me how poorly constructed these bombs were more than anything else yeah\nIt's um well it's fortunate that they were true and it's also you know if I if I\nJust it just changed just the change that start out for a second it also seems like it's possibly intentional that they didn't\nGo off ... same or\nWhere do you think okay I Know that there are a lot of conspiracy theories going around and that's the ... and in the room and I'll just say it um I don't I don't know if I subscribe to them um I don't I mean that's the thing with conspiracy\nThey're not necessarily a conspiracy theory in the sense that which is which we were going to talk about later is the fact that some people are actually claiming it with a plan\nBy Democrats I Know you're not necessarily what I'm arguing oh okay so you think it was purposely miss designed some sort of\nPotential ... for a greater oh education potentially oh my God I mean come on like well then again you know the screening process for obviously none of these letters were actually you know delivered type person they were intended for your point\nI mean but also so I read that I'm On one of the packages somebody misspelled somebody's last names so either they're being really really clever and they're bluffing or in the sense of like you know they're just messing things up to make people believe that this was all just a poorly designed planned interesting or they're actually just really stupid\nUm I you know that's a really good point yeah yeah I think\nYou would look that up before I'm trying to heal that person I Am personally\nYeah originally yeah like no no they're name that's yeah I guess so I mean I I I I don't know much about the process\nBut I Would imagine yeah it's confusing to say\nI have to you know take a musical break to really gather our thoughts on this subject and come back to you with you know but like some more it's more thought provoking discussion\nOr we're going to get back to um you know what I think about this fella you know whoever may be who's doing these bombings I think at the end is they they just really want to be a door they really wanted to be a door and that's what the Joan rose is wanted on their song I Want to be a door check it out\n[noise]\n\nYou know I mean we've in so many ways we've just come to expect like Barry minimum some people are like from the president like Brian minimum from the from the person who's responsible for the most of which is which is that in itself um I agree yeah personally I agree I just feel like there's a standard that needs to be mad at\nCertain times yeah and uh I think people should be held to that standard I mean this might be like the unpopular opinion but I think you know jobs are designed by expectations and the president to use a job and\nI like to think that this country's a meritocracy don't you isn't one of the things that you love about this country and I\nThe among the many things that I Love about it that's one of them in comparison to say your home country my country is not a meritocracy now ...\nWhat is your home country for those listeners out there that are curious\nOr it's a little place called ... and it's it's definitely not a meritocracy um although it I mean the funny thing is that a lot of places that appeared to be ... ended up not being meritocracy is because you know they're like that's that's the way people like that so we nepotism probably functions like right and it's probably probably\nOne guy here to get in any way a large nation George is very hard to define in any way shape or form due to its sheer you know\nDivide in in ... and say it's a it's um it's it's ... it's like a it's hard to hold its like water rice\nTrump the boy sorry I don't know I call now there's no such thing Trump and then there's just really feel you're giving them too much when I grow too much too much respect you know he started even on his rally which he knows rally doesn't exactly you know restrain themselves anyway he first said any actual threats a political violence or an attack on our democracy itself\nCalling for people on all sides to come together in peace and harmony which you know\nI guess his speech writers a second grader or just you know him going strictly often don't but that's really that's not really approaching MLK level now right there I don't know it's very very basic very rudimentary\nUm and it's just you know [noise] I'm uncomfortable by how how this\nIs just you know so easy to to look over um I mean this is I'm not saying and that's why we're discussing it tonight on the jazz just then yeah I mean one bad thing about this do that but this by this I mean Trump\nOr or like the general rhetoric surrounding him is that people have talked about it so often and so much like every every every late night show mosquito is just yeah I was just tackling actually there's literally no there's nothing else to talk about right now and fortunately which is I mean I suppose there is an I suppose it might be helpful to do that but\nI mean I think there's a right we have to I guess I should have added this subject with him for him but you are my guest after all I guess I Am I Am known to be a ...\nNo I'm not um [noise] well yeah yeah well um what do you think about\nHow he how he went further oh why\nYeah well no that was totally normal I really didn't get to the ... now that was fine he still is you know he was saying nice things I yeah we keep I keep forgetting that I mentioned your start to shift\nFirst he says you know and this is kind of risk frightening just in the way he says that it's like he's taken off I'm asked do you have nice I'm behaving tonight Trump's that we're all behaving very well and hopefully we can keep it that way right oh my God like he's talking to a bunch of dogs in a cage ready to let loose on this\nAnger seated in our society has caused by the purposely false inaccurate reporting in the mainstream media but I refer to as big news really Mr President I did not know that you referred to it as much of it you know gotten so bad and hateful that it'd be on description mainstream media much cleanup attack fast or else\nOr else maybe they won't be able to keep behaving very well we'll leave will be no ... no more than girls no stranger to like a kindergarten teacher with a an evil past\nYour and accept that it's not and [noise] it's just it's terrifying because you know like it's ... it's invented lightning but it's also scary I'm\nLike you know this is this is how people talk to people who they have like explicit power dynamics with in which there like I Am stronger than you I Will I have the power to to to threaten us things and I will and that's what he's doing\nThat is exactly what he's doing it it's bad and the next song

C. yet you chose to attack and divide America should unite against schools for medical violence\nShe turned it around and then I don't know how I found a way to blame them and I'm ... doing the same thing\nThe Syrian blaming the media\nAnd their expert gas later said what they do um and there are not alone in that I'm actually one of the things that we first observed I'm In the right wing media response as it unfolded I'm\nAt the news and breaking on Wednesday um that these pipe bombs were being discovered um we've got the the media or they want a couple of different routes there were a group of a right wing media people who are figures who are like we're on the far right you know the lord of the world like Savage and so far away um\nRush rate will you know of a Rush Limbaugh they they were started in the\nFall flag narrative for instance there so there's one idea that like this can't be real ... from the migrant caravan that we want everybody to talk about and the violent lap and how they're coming and bringing people to invade the country and steal the election et cetera et cetera\nUm that has been the narrative that the right has been pushing on with Donald Trump will support on for the last week um\nAnd then the other narrative that we saw emerge pretty quickly where people who are trying to turn it around and say well you know what really the reason why this happened is because the Democrats' fault the first place and then they would that specifically attack Maxine Waters are for Hillary Clinton for comments that they were they had made 'em and other far right and the race\nA few Middletown, Connecticut\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome to another edition of carnivores radio I Am your host Jeff Sherman\nBack again and speaking of back again is Chris ... studio big Chris glad to have yeah\nWe in a row and I am on fire now if you are um you're in the presence of greatness make no mistake about it it's an honor to be here with you [laughter]\nAnyway um do you get a lot of you know important stuff in the in the news\nBut you know I'm not a big fan of the fall because I Know it leads to winter and\nAll this stuff I like to do Ninety nine percent of the stuff I like to do is revolves around good weather but and we talk about major league baseball Chris or from from time to time\nWhat do you think of the series LA Boston Good for you it's got to be good for baseball right I mean do do we do a lot I think the biggest market not just people\nAnd the super bowl same with like Green Bay I Would say Boston is what would you rent for a second I'm most influential ah franchise\nSure I think you got to do with the top five franchises ... for their first for ... what would you name the first the top five\nThat you've got to put the Yankees at number ... and probably Boston at who I don't think\nAnd Chicago Cubs three three St Louis is up there for and probably LA very well done so I think it's good for baseball right\nI think it's very good for baseball and for our a fellow citizens around these parts that are by and large Red Sox fans in a wonderful time for them\nWell actually you know it's funny it's a ... zone is that like Bridgeport sliced up to Dan Barry is kind of more um obviously it's not rocket science what I'm saying but he was more a Yankees\nYes here is two thirds Boston one third Yankee yet actually\nAlso I had a job was really weird uh in um around the baffled area and you always weird there's like a huge you know it's weird like pocket of Mets fan\nYes I Am actually met fan and I grew up and graduated from high school down in the mail for which is not for example at all so yeah in a ... are met fan like me\nIt's a weird franchise because they always right it's like loser loser loser and then they'll have a bone there in the playoffs you know like going back can store ugly like you know we had already in sixty nine there that ...\nThey talked for two years in their in their series again in Seventy three and then you know in the eighties they talked and then in mid eighties eighty six they go to the ...\nFormer world they have a rich leave I mean you had good that had a lot of what else going on like a Rolling Stones\nOf major league baseball yes I'm OK so under invite our callers to call and you're listening Wu You eighty eighty eight points ... FM in Middletown and you're listening to carnival or radio the views of carnival radio or not the views of\nW E s you or was leaning university now um the news item is the um that case obviously you know we were in a politically correct world\nYou would have to say this guy is absolutely not to send all those bombs around the country to essentially a primarily I early to leading liberal Democrats or\nYour analysis that when your analysis of the individual what kind of mine that would be and your analysis do you think it is indicative yes or no of where we're headed towards in terms of the great divide in this country that people aren't ... let's say respectfully disagree but they actually\nPretty much hate each other at this point versus the your your little bedside psychoanalysis of our buddy\nWell I think it will turn out to be a guy that's on the fringe of society probably mentally unstable just your general cuckoo clock\nAnd it appears that he's a good cook a clock that is that Trump supporter just like it's been done if I did he's a Trump supporter but it seems like it only because I should I saw pictures of his van which had prominently displayed Donald Trump and a vice president Pence pictures\nSo you know I'm speculating a little bit later taking\nThis is the problem I think there's going to have repercussions in the mid term\nI don't I don't think so um do you say that\nAnd there was nothing there they're right there you could say a year already know that okay I'm gonna ask you what is the narrative well\nThe narrative that the media is going to portray is that this ultimately is Donald Trump's fault because of his fiery Reddick rhetoric\nIncluding talking about the press says the enemy of the people and they will pitch that story a lot I don't think it has legs in the sense that they've already been saying that and I think most ... I was getting any\n... any rubber on the road\nThere hasn't been any rubber on the road and perhaps it would be different if there was actually explosions and people getting hurt but I think because it was thankfully a near miss were Daniel\nBombs you know that they were real bond von ...\nOkay I Wonder what our listeners have to say about that is just indicative of a great divide in this country is it going to hurt the Republicans in the mid term and short it eight six zero six eight five\nSeven seven zero zero eight to five seven seven zero zero um is it indicative\nThe bombing who the suspect has just been arrested\nIs that indicative of the bigger picture in America that we're headed toward\nNot I'm new to the civil disagreement but at this point I'm has been going on for years now but the combination is the Trump election that now we're at a point where we actually despise each other critic do we despise each other about you and I worked for ...\nThink I think most Americans you know uh I think I think in the echo chamber and you know the media center of New York city and and the Washington DC and perhaps out in California\nLiberal than me I have other clients believe it or not that a more conservative than me and we get along just fine and I think it's\n'cause you're a real nice guy there but I I actually I have tons of friends you know and most of them are liberal those are fine but it every day just meeting people who don't really know how to describe it but uh it's their hatred that did that a little extreme but\nUm yeah topic of conversation is you don't like Trump do you\nYeah I don't come across that is true there is there is more of that then there's never been so I I think\nI think there are actually I'm not just talking points I think they're just siders like if you're meeting someone for the first time it's going to have an effect on how they the relationship involved\nRight now I'm not saying that it should be the yeah but yeah they do you like Trump and you say yeah I'm a\nGreat fan um you might have some backing off\nIt's very thought provoking because you had me thinking now I Know in school I have a um\n[noise] I have a business a\nReason to be in Florida regularly and where I Am in Florida\nIs a much more conservative place on balance Jeff than here in Connecticut so in in Florida it would be a completely different dialogue be much less likely to play out the way that you're describing in Connecticut because it's\nA more liberal state much more Democrats registered I'm much more voter registration to the Democrats than anything else\nSo yeah I think you get more of that\nBut I don't know I I think it I still think the media sensationalize is more than what happened day to day you know\nI think I think you look at 'em you know like people like Maxine Waters she's actually calling for you you see a Republican at a uh\nUm people are calling me on this unbelievable\nWas a play you a clip and could you you know humorists and also pull you have up to the um up to the Michael ... played his first\nI said it's just because your child gets across the border that doesn't mean that child gets to stay so they'd be sent back well first of all we have to provide the best emergency care we can provide we have children five and six years who have come up from Central America\nWe need to do more to provide border security and so they're mango they should be sent back now well they should be set back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults and their families are because there are concerns about whether all of them can be sent back but I think all of them can be ...\nBy the way the retirement of flip flopping but I'm as I'm listening to Hillary she is so full of it like you know she's okay we're going to be a ... am and poor is a very you know liberal ah I'm a reporter beating color reporter\nSo as soon as she starts pushing back then would you like the talking points Chris if we can find out who their parents are like do you think you can never have how do you find out what he called Western Union\nYou know I mean so and as long as you know so basically she'll say any she's that's why she really lost because he comes across as so disingenuous do you think I Am incorrect Mr ... absolutely and he comes across\nShe is like you know and then there's other clip I think you have a clip of Mr Obama President Obama don't you yeah let's hear that\nFor sure for those who tried to immigrate legally barred stopping those to try to get below on the right thing to do\nSo what happened between that three years ago yeah I don't know exact date but yeah a couple of years ago and only point two years ago President Obama was not that far in the past\nClearly flip flop why\nWell they are pursuing a strategy of identity politics and they believe that their future is based on um the vote of 'em let the nose and Hispanic and and they have they claimed to that and they've abandoned thing that\nBill Clinton it said in the past Hillary Clinton is believes there hat's\nTrue that the liberals just like socialist global socialist\nWill say drug trials skis handbook will say and do anything to get elected absolutely got there I mean they know it's not good for America to have no borders sure they know they've lost middle America right they have lost ... lost middle America that's yes they are a lot of completely lost any average\nHardworking Joe or Jane out they're gone they're awful hawk they're they're off the\nHook and I think they need\nThese new voters that the only reason they want them in if they were Republican tiny in other words all these uh let's say from Central America they couldn't wait to vote ... bad Trump flags\nDianne Feinstein Hillary Clinton said this is outrageous we need we need to and and let me ask you another question\nIsn't it true that the Democrats are always used to stand for the working man and woman yes so if you have open borders who does that hurt the most working men and women\nEspecially at the lower yeah actually they live our lives our runs and they are going to I'm a ... yeah and it was definitely a contradiction\nIsn't it isn't that the real reason why they've lost middle America and looked like blue collar America because they're out of touch\nI think I think though I mean union leadership is still super supportive of the president but if you're a blue collar union worker you got a question\nPeople coming into this country that are not in the system in a legal way that are changing the dynamics of the particular industry and the Democrats\nBesides a nut case bomber which they might benefit from are scared to death that even some of their core constituencies gives which we can do three groups like it's panic blacks in particular and Jews are leaving the reservation\nI wrote I think so\nBecause if you're African American and now you have a great job you really need the Democratic party around your neck\nAnd that is one of the points Kanye West made when he met with the president then proceeded to get absolutely bill died by uh you know what it was a liberal\nAfrican American and went to let's say Obama's White House right and started just whatever talking whatever and Fox News called him let's say a minstrel show Sharon ... do you think people would be calling for those people to leave here\nOh yeah I mean listen the contradiction to this stuff just makes me want to throw out a Megan Kelly got fired this week\nBy the way I Can't stand or I'm Glad oh I'm not a fan of all sometimes life critter sometimes in life and their eyes shine you she got\nSo frigid lucky I mean okay I have to say on Fox she's you can kind of she could kind of pull it off yeah kind even though her rating started dipping depicted which he got into prime time like the big she got nothing got nothing to\nDo you agree or not I taught a couple of like a Dunkin' Donuts they'd ever know CSI right I'm not looking at or I'm going oh God\nI'm not a fan of hers and if you just suppose what he said what a couple of things\nWhere black face as part of costumes and was kind of not justifying bad behavior like we're making fun facts that you said they were talking about one of the um people on the housewives of New York city I'm sure you watch that show weekly java crime went as\nA drawing of stress that Diana Ross and war darkening makeup I don't think it was literally blocks pain but that's what they were talking about it she said it was okay when her day ... was okay and her day and I'm not saying I agree with you very ...\nWay of creating you're telling me she got fired for yeah but yeah see I live for observing something I don't like her by the way I'm Glad she's fired she got fired for that\nIt is um I think again you compare that to what they said about Kanye West about being a minstrel and being um you know a black person to doesn't read yeah\nIt's it's it's crazy but I I think though that Megan Kelly then be the one in Megan Kelly ally needed then excuse robbed a hammer on that and if you're if you're cleaning up race did you have good cover and the media will not\nGathered every day you get that one out of the park to use a bidding on if you did because that's what they do they were saying what the hell did we do correct yes so anyway so if you're looking at the phone\nI was going to look up exactly what she had a hard drive not worth of 'em so yeah we're neither one of us are fans of hers and it's just that hypocritical people get all breathless because they um they say they're offended by stuff but then one of their friends do it and they don't blink and I I'm just tired of that kind of be ah\nLet's see if we maybe have a caller to like to comment on some of the sky was eight six zero eight five\nThat could be part of them getting very deprived can I ask you a question of if you can ... what happened to the\nMueller investigation and why is the media dropped that\nLike it never even exist\nAnd he's really funny of course it in a dome pattern run every\n... I think that there's a lot of leaks yeah and the leaks are saying we got nothing\nI I think that that is that it is accusation\nWell we we have both a game today with no call yeah can't have it all in life that is what were\nYour entertaining me hopefully I'm entertaining hey like the very least we have one another\nWord to gather together through this is going to play I got you may go that far\nAnyway um [noise] yes so if you're a hundred percent correct on Megan Kelly and you're correct on this other search\nYeah because listen I Know there's been other news the Kavanaugh hearings the\nIssue with the bomber and that\nAwful act again hopefully that guy get put in jail for a long time so they are stuff that's kind of knock that off the front pages but it didn't really exist anymore when it was twenty four seven for a long time\nAnd I agree with you they must still leaks they get ... and they must not want to report on it because things I'm speculating you are too must not be going their way and maybe at the end is a land with a whimper\nKnow what tell us why because isn't going to be played on the press I mean you're going to have Jake Tapper you you're going out of what's her name rats Rachel Maddow basically\nLet's go back to you do to start at a glass house last year when school is shot it almost killed playing baseball\nNobody boy the Democrat ever be the people are waking up enough that I Believe if the Democrats start calling this out as a Republican the rubber or a Republican issue\nI Am tired because I'm a supporter of Donald Trump and a Republican I'm tired of being told that I'm a rapist that I'm In Texas that I'm inciting violence and when that\nAnd that crime was committed against college and he got shot I didn't blame the Democrats so now that some ... tend to bond do me a favor don't blame me\nHold on both of your caller I ask you you you know at least no one blame the Democrats because it was it in their best interest of the press the liberal media to do that now within their best interest to I think it's going to be at least a week of this what do you think\nFor whether you're you're just going to be some time I don't think it's going to really affect it and I think what's gonna happen is a lot of people and all that all we have a lot of people if you look at the polls Republican\nRegistered Republicans went up we're all Republican people would have done early voting higher than the Democrats people are waking up you have the uh walk away movement what ... can this old zoos but out there pushing\nFor going to start working out speaking\nOf waking up I said I don't know if you heard of talking about this do you think the Democrats is kind of a rhetorical question because I think they are I think the Democrats I liked your comment on this are terrified with their ... or or traditional core constituency that is African\nAmericans Jewish people and panics leaving the reservation I think they're terrified and that's why they won't open borders\nBecause I think black African American they're not going to vote majority for Trump I Know that I guess but I think it's going to make it would be as high as ... percent would you be cataclysmic wouldn't it\nSeven percent of blacks\nThis makes thirty seven percent of blacks are supporting Trump when he first started to what was it sixty Seventy hours so\nBut but to be clear it's not that they're going to vote for him is that they approve of the job he's doing I Believe will happen\nTo them and even half that that's a big has not yet so do you think enclosed in color that that's why the Democrat to flip the role for some of them were for a wall only six years ago are now for open borders because they know to get up for them\nYeah I I really think that is the case and believe me I was at JFK Democrat until they until two thousand Thirteen I loved to party while the only way although it was heading JFK\nWould be thrown out of the Democratic party on his ear\nNo argument there\nCan I ask you a question Jim so you you you you change your party affiliation right so do you change or did the Democratic party change over the preceding decade\nThe party is changed to what I did not want to see\nWhat how would you change your mind I mean and they weren't before you go I like a once in a traditional Democrat what exactly alarmed you about the change like two or three salient point\nI could see the the handwriting on the war was a socialist movement called me they were pushing too many social programs would never ending but never at and that was caused their country dearly and\nPlus they started completely walk away from the constitution\nAnd I think you're walking walking away from working class people thank you so much for the call You're welcome taking well you got to good cause let's see if we can get a third to zero eight five seven seven zero zero eight five seven seven zero zero and you're listening to carnivore radio\nNot to use a W E as you but the views of critical and\n[laughter] so he mentioned to walk away movement you could find this on YouTube and other social media platforms but at the movement where people identify themselves as walking away from the Democratic party and posting videos or blogs about the region\nAnd there's been some higher profile I'm a black individual that have left the party and I've got kind of viral attention just walk\nAway for blacks only\nOr no no actually I heard an interview this week on the bench Shapiro show and it was I'm someone who was a homosexual and talking about why he had walked away and I guess he's gotten some\nYou know stuff has gone viral or whatever so it it it's not specifically for any particular group other than folks that are leaving the Democratic party OK speaking of a\nParty or you're gonna miss her actually with a straight face say that the great recession was call was caused by too much regulation on Wall street they actually say that [noise] you know I remember\nWhen you know I supported my husband's role of his races in Arkansas\nAnd I one of my favorite favorite political ads of all time was a radio ad rural Arkansas where\nThe announcer said it'd be great if somebody running for office that's something we could have an immediate reaction is whether it was true or not well we've trained this dog and a dog if it's not true he's got a park and then the dog was barking on the on the radio\nAds do you know people were like barking at each other for days after that I Try to\nOut how we can do that with the Republican you know\n[noise]\nA lot of their uh their claims\nAre you going to miss her [noise] uh I I\nWill miss her because I think she gives an opposition people that I tend to agree with much better opportunity you get stuff done she completely ineffective like Nancy Pelosi is\nI Believe that like Mitt Romney will run it ran a crappy campaign and we have a couple of minutes left so the caller wants to call in to zero\nSix eight five seven seven zero zero six eight five seven seven zero zero I Believe unlike Mitt Romney unlike John McCain they kinda got over it their life went on she's or life is not going on\nYeah and I think come you agree with that Mr Clinton I I think that's true and and we talked to a fair about President Obama\nI'm wanting to stay in the spotlight uh I Know you're not a fan of George W. Bush but I have tremendous respect for him that he was president for eight years he left he walked off the stage he went on with his life I\nWonder if he's going to write like Nixon even though he was described by the way of love and affection we probably would not have lost the Vietnam War Nixon did not getting the upper lesser crimes and some other administrations believe it or not but yet you know you wrote several books I Wonder if George W wrote a book pure it'd be like flip run flip run\nYeah to be like pop up book flip the flip\nUm he he was a morals and the only reason he's probably out of the public because no one no one wants to tell me someone that would want to hear the insides of the great the great\nKnow I I understand that that he wouldn't have an ... an appeal but it's more about his [noise]\nThey they just are not ready to leave the stage and President Obama I don't know if he really has an effective role in the party and the party might be better off finding new leadership elsewhere I agree\nWith that and I also think that it is a thing you do see he's Steve how does this do I want you to comment of he know not just not a dumb per se that if the midterms go Republican\nAnd\nFrom when the second term easy for you know in his\nYeah his biggest accomplishment at that point will be the first black American elected president nobody could ever take away the fact that\nAre going to complement that veterans achievement\nNo no but ... but it's a notable historical event and it's a great moment for the country I Would\nAgree but in terms of a compilation men I don't disagree I'm scared to death I think he's scared to death and do you think he's\nOn Saturday the Wesleyan RJ Julia bookstore in Middletown offers kids family story time and ten thirty AM Saturday Night is philosophy night with an event starting his six PM WWW dot ... dot com now here's a rundown of send them off the beaten track in central Connecticut\nTonight real art waves will screen five count them five films including Leon a an animated film which is rare for them about an original African tale created by orphan children in Switzerland and said he\nA story about a teenager who uses worst strategies to sabotage her mother's relationship with new man while her father is away serving in the military\nAlso screening tonight is the great buster a celebration a documentary exploring the legendary life and career of actor filmmaker and comic genius buster Keaton\nMonrovia, Indiana documentary of the same documentary about the town of the same name and the American west and the wife of film crossing decades to tell the story of married writers Joe and Joan ... beginning right as Joe was about to be awarded the Nobel\nDown of tonight's brought up here on WBFO you idiot point one Middletown\nRight after the job at five stick around for a while but I live with me and Egypt stomach we generally we uh we talked to was in bed but er\nThis afternoon we're so lucky to be sitting down with um some of the wonderful people from circles and snipers and there'll be sticking around for until six thirty when it's the middle tiniest radio project a weekly radio program featuring the thoughts voices creativity in town of kids in the w._b. su neighborhood\nFrom seven to eight thirty at universal sound wave with the queen T wide range of music including African reggae gospel R. and B.

evening while you were tuned to why why live only WDC radio point one middle town in the city and I'm DJ ball comic\nAnd we are so so so lucky in great with the president today I've sort of the divers were here all the\nWay from right on man we're so excited well I think they can do the explaining better than we can do is that right absolutely alright so uh let's hear a little bit about your from from you\nName is treat the greatest I always do that out there you know to get to face I Am a part of strictly fight for this one issue the up being a part in it\nWith a good way for\nUs up yeah my name's Evan open I graduated from a a school in Middletown back in twenty Thirteen so shop metal town to have the right now feeling however that I'm I'm Glad it's friday and I joined circles by president it was a one program a week type organization a small circle happening in the basement of a church in the north side of Chicago\nAnd ah then and now we have about six programs a week and what those programs actually looked like I think more shocking honestly do a better job explaining that I could for I got my name is Marsha I ...\nI've been a circus fire for like two years now I first got an induced to spokesman cipher through my probation officer\nOr the circle welcome to is when they started who is ... freestyle circle\nMay when you come in there and just do let you get the free strike how about like everything like it just so crazy you get to do like rap about all you'll feel and how you feel and then when you leave you just leave with so much energy\n... felt with some ... everyone is a marine brown I'm I Am the newest member of circles and apply for it\nAnd I joined in about January I work with the ... um oh like two summers ago but in January I took on this job to help us be a part of the dope initiative called in Beijing justice where we partner with six other husbands Chicago land area\nTo basically get the word and create conversations in our community about the impact for ... incarceration alone with that we and and put the arts because after all that stuff\nI'm I'm happy to be here and we\nNow I'll tell you real quick just in case you tuned in and you're not sure whether to stay tuned in an organization is a prison abolitionist organization which means we imagine and ... and ... are speak to activate today\nMoment when people are comfortable maybe an hour into it you might ask who someone who hasn't affirmed you who hasn't complimented who hasn't given told you that they were proud of you that you kind of really expected that and you feel like maybe you need that right I mean that when you asked that those type of questions that were not asked there's a new texture that arises between all the hearts that are in the room\nTotally and and it's interesting because I always feel like what I'm trying to control in my life is not controlled but like have a better understanding of is how I Need to be less dependent on affirmation of others in the happy kind of\nLet myself uh for myself like real good about that and I feel like it's encouraging to me lately that I've been thinking a lot about what my younger self would have wanted because I feel like that is like\nMe like almost subconsciously like looking for my own affirmation which is an interesting change that I'm looking at right now ... ... ... ... ... ...\nThat's interesting you say you bring up you yourself 'cause I was gonna say I was thinking like I've been having trouble sitting still lately with the first thing that came to our mind ... like I not like I can do it but uh but I I find myself\nLike thinking a lot about it while I'm doing it why am I doing it um when I went on I could be moving around when it could be doing something and and a lot of like abstract my mind goes to an abstract plays\nUm and I think when you're young you're like encourage to be restless whatever that means in in a certain way or you're actively discouraged from being from being but that that's such a topic\nOf conversation and then the minute you get older you get sort of walk into a rhythm and whether that rhythm is is restful or restless you're not you're not in

I Love the way the phone number so I memorize it\nYeah I mean imprinted on my memory but that that circle was was about policing\nYeah I'm the difficulty but there were the shift that happened I remember so vividly and this is like the kind of learning that you always want from any level of cool from high school from from college which is to\nAn end up being the most broad term think outside the box and and the box in this case which I get that word that word is a is a youthful metaphor here um was the whole circle we've been thinking about policing strictly in in\nA like a governmental context guns bags yeah gun battles all those poems write all those signs of policing 'em and you mentioned something about putting yourself\n... about ... the thing about about self control gone wrong I'm about\nKeeping yourself when when keeping yourself in check turn to you know forcing yourself into a place that you don't need to be and that was you know if not if that's going to shift I don't know what is um and I I felt that like I felt that immediately\nUm yeah so I I just wanted to mention that yeah\nI remember that once you reminded me the circle I remember it being such a powerful sacrifice we've only ever done it once I'm as a unique group that came out there a shot at the whole crew there came there noodles became Luke man or myself\nAnd we were traveling the east coast of the time I remember that circle I remember that question or something along the lines of after talking about police and the system as you said we then as a whole circle and has been talking to drown asking\nWhat does one way that you police yourself that doesn't feel healthy and then having people answer that I remember a few people broke out opening them a lot of people cried\nUm and I want to shop that Sharif was put into my right right now has been talking to you 'cause he's helped me tremendously with that I mean I left was being a lot kind of free but a lot of times they'll telling myself that I'm weird that I'm awkward\nJust like the police on the street badly do not have ever have our interests at heart um or for the most part and so I Want to shut up Sharif do any words of wisdom what are the things that you see you've toured the country now going from east to west coast across the Midwest I mean obviously in Chicago what do you see about our people policing themselves what does that look like and what his freedom look like Sharif\n[noise] um [noise]\nTo be honest um [noise]\nI see a lot of white people policing themselves into police in a in an urban neighborhood is kind of hard we're not policing ourselves we're trying to get\nHere [noise] [noise]\nThe policing is trying to police us put like that trying to get on board to something that they were not really comfortable with\nYou know what I'm saying and I'm to be honest in my\nFirst knowledge that up first thing that comes to mind is that\nUm [noise]\nIt's like where I'm comfortable where they ... even if we get we express how we feel but then at the same time it's like it's like having a ball during that ball at a at a Wal the ball's gonna come back\nSo we're we're used to that you know what I'm saying but rather than if it was the up and we think of a goal without the net you know what I'm saying that ball not going to come back so\n[noise] oh man I'm so when I came to New York um\nI've seen the difference a big difference um specially in Manhattan neighborhood and coming to Connecticut um usually I didn't I didn't see I'm normally white and blue\nTo have in this culture or did not now in my president to go it brings back a lot of memories are like demos in Chicago and I'll be trying to get police by police or\nI was trying to be police by white people in kind of have an opportunity to be in it varies community of university I've I feel comfortable about so I wanted to be more on the ... when it where policing come in handy\nYeah I was thinking it could could maybe we could drop a beat right now we ... about police in oneself and we can be honest about the ways maybe worried and police and ourselves right now as we wrap live on the air\nUm big fact yeah the facts new track it back to [noise]\nReally [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] why you want me to go straight to you I'm a black do now\nBelow ...

Chicago\nUm and so just them coming tourist basis dangerous though if we can have some form of transportation for them so a lot\nPulled down because of this chaotic that they just caused in Chicago for global too as well\nAnd to speak to something that Sharif does um in circles as well this is Hi fi speaking um there's value in agreement often in circles or where\nThe community together the entire circle not just a facilitator is deciding on the values um and cut the principle that circle is going to operate under so that means that\nYou know some people are going to step forward and some people are going to step back that's what's gonna happen there if that makes more people feel comfortable or if that means people are going to turn turn off her songs or cell phone\nSo that they can respect the person who speaking\nThat's going to create a safe or space and that's something that\nThose or and everybody in sort of Cyprus really committed to\nAnd um what's that might be a cyber quick question for you time what is I Know you just spent the summer in Oakland working for one of our sister organizations are are joy restored justice for Oakland you shot that are are joy\nOn what was one personal experience that you had of healing in yourself just being around them\nWell straight to the big questions always [laughter] ... [laughter] I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna try to make this a a a pretty quick um [laughter]\nA summary of I guess the biggest feeling process that I had um but I guess one thing that that are joy really allowed me to explore which I'd never felt comfortable exploring with my sexuality\nUm and I was coming to an end to kind of a nuclear sexuality over the past six months or so um and then I was introduced to restore to justice broken youth um incredible restore to practice based organization that was pioneering resort adjusted in schools and elsewhere in Oakland since the Nineteen nineties um\nAnd I was introduced to that bait 'em with tons of people from completely different\nYou know up in West Oakland in east Oakland and other people from all around the country um and felt open enough especially with people who are running clear circles to really explore that on and be vulnerable in that um\nAnd really coming to an idea that I didn't have to decide immediately about what my sexuality was um or or identify myself with one kind of um of identity regarding that um and I was actually able to go into a juvenile center and discuss sexuality with about eleven or\nTwelve I'm like teenage boys as well\nWho had their own ideas about sexuality um and it was really really incredible to get their opinions on that myself and them I'm questioning exactly what\nA masculinity and and masculine sexuality is supposed to look like and then also be with other members of our joy I'm who have their own sexual identities 'em in there as well discussing this with the boys frequently I'm On a weekly basis [noise]\nUm so that was just one snippet of a really incredible healing summer for myself\nAnd I thank you for the question yeah that that kind of brings up a potential closing exercise I have um so I'm Wondering does anyone have anything to say before I proposed as smooth as close as an exercise of foreign please do lead zoo yeah\nI'm I have a quick question for the J piggy and also ... ... did it yeah\nPig and then we got boss I'm EJ bumps on a bus bombing\nIn where it was thought to ... and I'm here yeah here where we spoke to Justin's misty how is the way they operate in ... in the city of Chicago and also in Oakland um where are some places that you want to just to be used it\nAnd this is like a herd of mostly restored of justice in the past couple of years so I Would definitely nothing I I was ever like raise a kind of considering and so that has been really important and so on and obviously in like huge institutions sweat in the U.S I think it's incredibly important to happen but I think also\nHaving restored of justice and like your inter personal life like can I um I think that there are a lot of things that happen or her um where like forgiveness and kind of having conversations that are restored of or just like\nHaving that perspective I've been thinking about a lot lately that I I Need to let myself do and like others to do\nThe idea of like holding 'em grudges or like not allowing for people to work past\nMistakes made and I think are like a real like that they're very very important part of doing that um so I think it I guess the answer your questions at the cat that it's just like ... like um I think we're sort of justice obviously needs to happen in huge institutions but also needs to be understood on a\nFundamental level like in in our personal level and\nYeah I um I it's interesting when you say location 'cause I\nI mean there are there are plenty of physical location to think of but but restricting location to to just that I think\nMakes it easier to to forget things like age and and um and anything else as little as ... as a as a location ... um I think what did your boss told me it was really profound and true and I think that\nThe the modes of restored of justice that we'd be that that you know the media and the that like the largest platforms of many allow us to the tend to happen with adult like that's what that's what we get ... that's ... that's what we're allowed to\nThink introducing it as early as possible like that that's something that that is compelling to me it's I mean this component about about the mindset behind circles inside for it\nI think doesn't have to be concrete and it doesn't have to be in response to something to some to to a grave injustice I think applying it on a variety of scales is the only way it's going to succeed on a large scale\nRight and that actually that really makes me think so I I'm a good friend of mine um who isn't she's out to dinner right now well I'll let her know that I'm going to references but she's writing the says about um\nAbout in high school like about truancy and high schools about these kids get to school and why that shouldn't be and punishing kids for skipping school like that the the idea that you're punishing\nAnd kind of um punishing these kids for chemical and what you could do and that's like well how the school system should be changed and so I've been thinking also about education system this idea of like having people know and have a different understanding at a young age\nAnd that schools are so incredibly get folks like you have to go to school it's like a state wide thing I'm institution and everyone has to participate in and it's so influential like I feel like school systems are really important\nTo ... I had to choose the school ... school um education to be exact DJ picky um is there anything as far as education wise\nUm that you would like to bring into the urban neighborhoods so that we that drop out is not really too high in the mid ...\nThat's ... that's a good question that I'm not sure I'd be able to answer right now but I'm really interested to see kind of the time my friend is doing like like tons of research and going in and I'm into\nObviously no one change happens to be general I Need to have some concrete things um but I the idea of like not condemning people for skipping coming up they can like the isn't working for them um that everyone else like you know there's like a path\nThat people keep on thinking of falling but just a general acceptance I feel like or just toleration of of people going in different directions and with\nThat certain types of things to protect and if everyone would just take a deeper than [noise]\n\nWell\nThank you so much for joining us because really this has been it's been fabulous and an rare I don't think you high fee for for facilitating this ... um [noise] it's been wonderful to sit and chat with you on and we wish you the best and the rest of your time here and and when you go back\nAnd middle kind of extra lucky because we get more of them later they're staying on for the show after for the middle of Youth Radio project this was just wild wild live 'em and you're listening to W.
