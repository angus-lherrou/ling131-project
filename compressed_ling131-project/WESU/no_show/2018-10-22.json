also from the Internet\nPeople will just write down their feelings and post them and people read them and\nSometimes they commented that cares most times they just kind of goes uh goes into the ...

radio this is rising up with a tone on it you know I'm your host on on equal hunger you can watch this program on free speech TV and listen to it on Pacifica Radio stations and affiliates nationwide\nPresident Donald Trump who has aggressively been using the issue of immigration as an election campaign tool how'd they knew convenient target for his higher caravan of about two thousand largely Honduran migrants heading north from Central America to the U.S border\nEarlier Trump threatened the governments of Central American nations tweeting we have to be informed the countries of Honduras Guatemala El Salvador\nThat if they allow their citizens authors to Journey Through their borders enough to the United states with the intention of entering our country illegally all payments made to them will stop in an exclamation point he'd been went further and threatened to send the U.S military to the border\nSaying I'm watching the strongest your terms that Mexico to stop the owns flawed and unable to do so caught up on the U.S military\nAnd then he capitalized the next part of the sentence close our southern border joining me to put to the Honduran migrant caravan into perspective is Hannah Haftar senior grassroots organizer over the Unitarian universe lip service committee welcome to the program how to\nThank you so much for having me here thanks for joining us well this isn't the first time that a caravan of people has headed to the United states I understand that the reason why\nI'm these folks are crumbling in a large group is to protect themselves um because the safety in numbers that they're often preyed upon and they're very dangerous journey from Central America to the United states is not crack\nThe organizing of caravans is a really intentional political strategy on the part of people who are in the caravans the journey north is dangerous under every circumstance I'm writing on the top of trains um\nA border patrol even though they are entitled to request asylum and so by organizing a larger caravan a book the safety in numbers and the attention that they receive a doing more to ensure that international law is actually applied and that they can pursue asylum and through the due process that they deserve\nTo this particular caravan has been making its way off from Honduras up to the U.S border on ... just a few days ago they reach Guatemala on I Want to pay for you in our audience a knowledge is the rubber ...\nI'm a of the caravan in Guatemala um because it really helped to a shared the perspective of some of the people in the caravan all with us and give you know they are direct voice to 'em and make it a part of the conversation about why they're coming to the United states\nCaravan of thousands of Honduran migrants is on a long journey north to the United states [noise]\nThey say they're fleeing violence and poverty in their home\nCountry your guard give us support and help us in this ... moment we are in Honduras killing us without cost of electricity with health care with all of our worries about security where instead of protecting us they are killing us in her door boundary one Buddha [laughter]\n\nSinging the Honduran national anthem and chanting yes we can the migrants head north\nPolice stopped them for several hours of the Guatemalan border but eventually left them continue\nTo live off of them\nAre going because Honduras is making us go why because how yours is one of the poorest countries we have a government doesn't support all of the people we have to leave flea leap from our country where we have to be able to get ahead and that's not happening we have to look\nOn Central American countries to salt mouse migration and US President Donald Trump threatened to cut off aid if the immigrants or low to continue their journey\nFor these people they they won't stop [noise]\nThey vow to continue marching will be make it to the United states and hell of a chunk of brutal was also drawn out\nAnd out of the knowledge of Iran news report from Guatemala weird the migrant caravan of about two thousand largely Hondurans\nPasta through how not Haftar is my guest with a Unitarian universe was sort of can be Hannah in Guatemala and you're just showed a there was no one can point to where\nThe Guatemalan ... leave their military ah it's actually stopped the caravan but then they did let them pass through as far as you know what happened in Guatemala [noise] um\nWell what we're seeing is the Trump administration's call for action resulting in increased militarization on the southern border of Mexico and Guatemala in a way that really has no benefit to those countries or their people and it's really an exporting up the dirty work of the United states\nTo the southern borders on and so ah watching that video I was incredibly moved by um the people who stood their ground and understood that they had\nA right to pursue a a better future and freedom for violence and ultimately I Believe that the um [noise]\nBoth in terms of the overpowering numbers and in terms of the moral authority of those are seeking a freedom from violence um they were able to make it their into Guatemala and do we know that there is a\nRiot riot year being prepared at the southern Mexico border um we know Trump has made threats of sending the military to the U.S Mexico border [noise] um\nWell are asserting that um if the conditions at home are not livable they will find a way to be somewhere that they can have a future\nPresumably ... these folks know what a week some of the United states I mean I'm I'm ... the the family separation gambling here in the United states over the past summer made international headlines\nI'm are these folks willing to risk being separated from their children I mean even though technically now that has\nStopped or leaves the government is saying it's stopped um they are detaining ... miners there's basically on Trump even very clearly said on his Twitter that you will be arrested at the border and detained before being deported I'm sort of like you would have them going through that is pretty high you're still coming\n[noise] yes absolutely so I have worked with dozens of families are just south of Mexico border that were in the process of preparing to cross um I've met many families that were separated and then released after being reunited and I've worked with families a detention and one thing I can say emphatically is that\nPeople who are taking this risk know what they're getting into it's not true that they expect it to be easy and they know about the\nInternational outcry on family separation and I'm ultimately they're forced to make a very difficult choice among very terrible options and if the option is that you've been threatened for your life\nIn the place that you live and there are no economic opportunities or you can take a risk to potentially get somewhere where you and your children how to future there people are going to take that risk and we talk about this and that at the border crisis\nI'm we talk about this and if the crisis begins I'm asked people are entering the United states the truth that this is only a symptom of a crisis the care of that as a response to a crisis\nThe degree of violence to a degree of impunity um one thing that we haven't talked about is the um corrupt uh\nAnd fraudulent election re election of President Juan Orlando Hernandez and the instability that that caused and so people are leaving not because they're making a choice among um [noise]\nA choice to potentially pursue something better for them but because they\nSee their really being no other option for their lives um\nHow the um response from the Trump stirs a you solve problems in your own country instead of coming to ours um you know keep your because they see people waving their their flags on doors flags when they're like why aren't you solving your problems in your own country does not\nCompletely um ignore or or show and ignorance of the U.S role in making the situation in these countries pretty appalling doesn't the U.S have a long history of training military leaders in countries like Honduras\nUm is it then have especially repressed Hondurans\nAbsolutely yeah um you know it's\nInteresting how the Trump Administration has suggested that in response to this day will withdraw aid when in fact the vast majority of aid from the United states to Honduras military aid\nAnd activists in the country I've actually been calling for years for a suspension of military aid when the Hungarian government is using it against its own people with non violent uprising related to corruption and the government\nAnd so um [noise]\nThere is absolutely a long history and up and we think about the history in terms of things that happened in the mid Nineteen hundred um but that history is continuing today ah with the military coup that overthrew um president's ally in two thousand and ...\nOn pursuing their asylum claims are there opportunities to offer host homes to fundraise for bond\nWas rural to keep families and the tension long term there's an opening comment period and lawsuits in the works so uh this is something that we can really be doing something about uh not just a wondering what's going to happen and sitting back to watch\nOn a thank you so much for joining us today Honda after their website you'd like to share it with\nAn absolutely our latest on line action which is related to the comment period a to stop the unlimited expansion of family detention or you can find that on our website at W.

article he recently wrote about personal responsibility and global responsibility that is how can we make sure our personal values are reflected in what we do in life and in society\nWill take an inside look at how the two corporate parties in the U.S support militarism environmental disaster\nAnd economic inequality white claiming to be for peace a clean environment and justice ... also give us numerous examples of how personal and social responsibility is trumped by ignorance in greed\nWill even explore the evidence that history is often created in the streets by average people instead of in a suite of the powerful so stay tuned for why personal and collective responsibility matters or why stop worrying and started to believe that ignorance its strength\nRough Mara welcome back to our show thanks for having me again like one\nIs the ... version of reality now reality are we now in a hall of mirrors in which we and I look back so therefore we cannot look forward and our stories are narratives are being created for us rather than being reflected\nI did states think to a lesser extent in Canada is that the U.S is obsessed with the new with the novel because this country has been historically such a locus for invention over the years we're just hung up on whatever the next big trend is\nAnd this can really lead us astray just a couple of days ago there was another stock market crash and I'm not surprised that one of the\nSegments of the economy that just really imploded was the tech sector and if ever there is a\nAn aspect of the financial world\nThat is built on a house of mirrors of expectation and the cult of the new it's certainly the so called tech economy all this business coming out of Silicon Valley and in any\nCase in point that eyesight is the experience of a Elizabeth Holmes and the people that invested in our company if ever knows how she went under a couple of years ago but a journalist working at Wall Street journal he worked on for many years about this company which is\nProducing what was supposed to be a revolutionary way of testing blood at home or in an office environment that would use the capacity of blood drawn from the arm to be able to test for a variety of ailments all sorts of conditions using just one drop as opposed to you know an entire vile\nSo this is ... supposed to develop types of machines that you can even take when he went home and just use one drop\nAnd have it connected wirelessly to your doctor if you were in some sort of a cute state either because if some condition that had to be monitored or because you were having side effects from some sort of medication how this woman started this company has a sophomore in college he was a in Stanford University and she quit and started ... for this idea\nAnd started this business and it went on for Fifteen Years it was founded in two thousand and two\nAnd she got all of these prominent people back or you know the typical fashion where the companies making money revenue not be\nPeople are kind of taken in by this rather young charismatic woman\nAnd she was obsessed with the idea of the physicality of the price it has to be very small and has to be very compact but the engineers just couldn't make it work the way she wanted to do there was this obsession with the appearance the concept of it being different from what was done before and that's the\nBiggest stumbling block is that she was so stubborn about this and it didn't go anywhere\nSo this married to rather aggressive business practices and culture of paranoia and a constant threat of lawsuits towards employees whistle blowers eventually brought the whole house of cards down and so much of our economy needlessly rests on this kind of mystique\nWrong when we talk a little bit about something we talked about on earlier show the idea of disruption and that new technologies to disrupt old technology\nAnd that there can't be any sort of we use of older technologies\nWhy do you think that we're so then the tech world with this idea of disruption why do you think that that idea is somehow a prominent today when it comes to looking ahead in terms of economic development\nI think it's a mistake that goes back to the founding of apple computers you know these people that have developed for something that was truly transformative in the way people handle information opportunities for creativity that just started out out of two guys building something in their garage\nBut if you look at uh read the book fire in the valley or the film version a TV film version of his called pirates of Silicon Valley you find that actually what Steve Jobs is doing side by side with gates when he developed Microsoft is that they saw an opportunity for rearranging the way things were already being done\nIt wasn't really a matter of innovation also a lot of these people\nHer business practices\nAfter Steve Jobs and she was always wearing dark turtle necks and so on\nThe irony is that over the decades apple computer for its part with they come up with things like the iPhone and so on and they've actually stepped away largely from truly creating new inventions a long time ago things like the iPhone the iPad they the access to the ingenuity of developers in Asia\nAnd buy the rights to them and then package them in marketing that's the wrong so a lot of people are infused with this idea of being disruptive but you know if you look at the larger picture about capitalism capitalism is completely antagonistic to true innovation to choose the true disruption like look what happened with Tucker with his automobile back in the forties\nWas the first American car I believed to have seatbelts\nAnd it had an engineering the rear\nYou had what is now I guess considered a standard type of a transmission system that was revolutionary for each time a lot of these developments we did see some of them come to pass by the the fifties and fifties or sixties\nBut it took a heck of a long time for the established from all the GOP ally of the American auto industry to embrace them because these shifts are these developments there were so many\n... introduced at one time and one vehicle it would require too much we working a pre existing company in General Motors Ford to have to keep up with them so they use their influence from the government to literally they got to the point that they were blowing up this man's car factories because he didn't want John genuine innovation\nAnd this is a false narrative in that basically what you're saying is that you can only have one or the other you can't have\nClean environment and have jobs so I Know maybe we could talk about how how option works and how it is changing our ability to speak clearly about what's going on in our lives and how we can change it\nI guess this would constitute one of the methods were kind of a real issue is embracing this stuff and of course you know provides an opportunity for people to keep things the way they are they getting people and stuff about what's really a false issue for instance with automobiles\nIs to get around individually but what people don't realize is that they've been accustomed to a certain standard of performance and typical automobile back in the nineties Greenpeace I guess you'd call it an act of culture jamming they broke into an expo in France supposedly environmentally sustainable automobiles they took a compact car\nAnd they took it over and how do we engineered to run on gasoline as with all that he was making twice as efficient by turtle charging the engine\nAnd they hired some Swiss engineers to do this then they brought it back the next day\nAnd it was kind of an officer shelf approach to doubling the efficiency of an internal combustion engine automobile\nAnd they offered this a proprietary approach to all the major car manufacturers in that provides okay you can have this\nWill sell it to you on the condition that you have to implement and you can't just sit on it and of course nobody took him up on the off in the following year they did the same thing with an SUV so if people are operating from starting pay position about an issue that in itself falls\nOf course there are always going to be behind the eight ball\nAnd I feel this is a good technique for business interests politicians and so on if there's a scandal and issues going on\nLike for instance like above the Bernie Madoff business a couple of years ago he became sort of like the show piece about the financial sector corruption of the economy and what isn't really talked about is the fact that he was a rich person preying on other rich people so that's the only reason he was a big deal because primary target for the wealthy people not the general public\nWas made off really someone they hung out to dry what was really going on is that over six million people have lost their home many of these people had been given fraudulent alone and the entire problem went back\nTo the banks and of course ironic that not one single banker went to jail after two thousand\nThe name of the show which is that the government will not take personal responsibility or making it possible to stop this kind of activity and use the courts and the laws to enforce it\nAnd what we really have is a form of moral laissez faire is him which says if you can get away with it and make a lot of money I'm really doesn't matter if you hurt a whole bunch of people are killing a lot of people because this is the only way that we can have an economy in this country how would you respond to that kind of a now\nQuestion rests on the idea of all what do you mean by the economy every time you watch the news and there is a portion of the show devoted to the economy much of the time they bring somebody from Wall street could talk about the economy people that have a financial background aren't necessarily economist for the financial sector essentially profits off of the function of the economy\nAnd yet we're told to believe that somehow the tail is driving the animal the dog is wagging tail is wagging the dog\nAnd this is a good example of it is everything would apply to a halt somehow with Wall Street shutdown and yet you know the economy is still going on you know people are still you know they're buying their consuming they're producing and consuming\nA market economy is not sustainable in our president world stain ability of it is questionable this is kind of a catch words staying ability everybody talking about the inability but we don't really have in our minds and in our government and in our\nBusiness world a concern about what Dana bow and really mean and how we can recycle aren't Honda me into a kind of me for everybody in other words an economy\nNot run for the for the wall street but an economy that includes main street\nAt what happens every ten years or so there's a big collapse can make the argument that it's engineered or not the point is that is a functional characteristics uh over economic system and then it gets\nControl of what's going on in the private sector balancing that with meeting she's a collective human needs healthcare education and things like that and they have better outcomes these societies are often criticized for other species reasons but they don't tell the whole picture\nWhereas our system keeps collapsing regularly it has to be good at work so well but why does the collapsing and every time it collapses more the people that were involved in engineering it\nHave more and more control of the economy once it gets rebuilt\nWhile the collapse is directly related to pop it in other words there's a lot of economists who talk about the fact that his pocket and without that you would not have we have to have indebtedness\nIn order for these corporations to be profitable especially in the financial field what's your view on that\nYou've ever read sons of value of having credit to buy things\nI was in college at school I guess I was the last generation that was able to get a college education and take out loans before these ridiculous onerous rules came into effect\nThat allow lenders to eventually put a whole generation of students into debt for a lifetime but I was amazed how every day in my mailbox I kept getting these overtures from credit card companies they were you know everybody was being inundated with these as these fliers and so on because they wanted to get\nOnce you're of a certain age they they want you to get plugged into\nLiving beyond your means as a way of life because you need to build credit in order to get tight and it's like I don't know appliances or buy a home or things like that well the countries where housing as of right\nAnd we also have ads on TV which\nSeen in recent years in which two individuals are discussing near future financial development and they're more concerned about your credit card number or score than they are about how much money they have in the bank or whether they're\nClick relations or through advertising\nYeah absolutely I see these hats too and I don't understand [laughter]\nThe logic of it on this kind of ties in with the whole concept of the American dream than eat half of the car garage house the high life is dictated by I don't know Robin Leach or whoever have have gotten all this sort of\nThe American dream was a term coined by doing that you wrote a book in the in the depression and expressly stated that the American\nDream is about helping her name it's about living within your means not keeping up with the Joneses and that sort of thing somehow it's become twisted exact opposite of what it is this is what's driving the economy people's lives and to the ground\n[noise]\nToday a new focus we have interviewed writer Ross more any opinions or use expressed on new focus are not necessarily those\nOf

[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nNo I think I can just hear you know like you know my book though you know I might I might like to debate with about that particular a model of farming thing you'd be its mission they gonna give you the same product\nA what's happening now my the ideal agriculture\nRight well I think the focus was on the increase the efficiency and as I've told people and I've written on many occasions I supported that kind of approach the agriculture through the first half of my thirty year academic career isn't that good culturally economist because\nI thought it made sense we're going to improve the efficiency of agriculture will bring down costs to production it'll lead to reduce costs for food then\nWe're going to have good food for every one that was basically what I was working toward it was a\nNineteen eighties whenever I discovered it certainly wasn't working for farmers that was another period where it wasn't just a ... you know their their livestock producers dairy producers now but we were in a real crunch him we may be headed to something summer for agriculture in general with the farmers going broke his we moved to the\nLarger more what I call industrial kinds of operations and so when we come into that but at that point isn't it it seemed to make sense at that time and there was a period of time through which we at\nDeclining a percentage of our income spin on food basically cut that in half between the seventies and the late nineties\nBut for the past Twenty years more than Twenty years food prices have risen faster than the overall consumer price index and what we're seeing now is even though the farm level production costs may be going down not not significantly over what we could have produced before are not significantly\nLess than before but even though those continue to go down then at the same time we're seeing the processors and retailers taking larger margins what they're doing is basically turning the cheap agricultural law materials whether it's going soy beans or whether it's ... you for chickens or whatever\nThey're they're turning a those into kind of manufactured projects which give them that much higher\nBeing higher priced and that they were at at earlier times and actually rising faster than the overall consumer price index\nAnd and I think the the thing that I talked to more and more um is is that whole system basically failed to do\nWhat it was intended to do a and that was to provide as I said with food for everybody it was basically justified the basis of domestic food security and all of our foreign policies basically supported\nThis industrialization of American agriculture but it was supposed to provide good food for everybody but making food less expensive well it didn't it didn't work we have a higher percentage of people now that it in this country that are classified this food insecure are hungry\nAnd we had back in the Nineteen sixties before you know these final phases began with investor rising agriculture we've got about\nA one in one at eight people in this country about Thirteen percent are classified as you can and secure and about one in six or almost Seventeen percent of our children in this country live and food and secure homes\nSo cheap food didn't feed the hungry people and I think even more important particularly low income people but all of us to a certain extent in is the food that there were getting out of that system now where this focus on just maximum out all out production\nThe nutrient and there are studies that show as soon as the nutrient density of the food is going down we're getting foods that are higher ... hiring calories but they are lacking in essential nutrients that are essential for good health and so as a result we've got an epidemic of obesity and diabetes and high blood pressure and heart disease\nIn a whole range of other issues a whole range of other health problems that are associated with the American diet when when we the period of time when we cut ...\nIt's being just glad it's being more economically efficient it is a very narrow mile ... view of the fish and sea doesn't take into effect\nThat the the account the fact that we are providing food for those people that need it most in the food that we're getting out of that system is not as healthy food we will get\nCool and you know they shouldn't do that we could have produced just as much or even more at the main trading very independent family farms and paid them but they simply turn\nDing ding\nYeah if you're just joining us you are listening to talk radio and I'm Teresa Marquez and I'm here today with Dr John hiker who is a professor emeritus of applied agriculture in economics but also is\nA real family farm advocates on John you know I also know that you um have been working in Iowa you're still in Iowa are you in Fairfield in that little corner of Iowa right yeah and the last time we talked on you or I think on the board of the former neighbors\nAre definitely on counter your neighbor down the farmers neighbors yeah yeah that are kind of talk to you know local people how is that going\nYeah yeah I think ah you know I Want to want to point out that uh you know the continents I make are basically my comment is as an individual because I I'm On the board of directors and the Jefferson County farmers and neighbors but\nAnd I am very much impressed with what's going on in Iowa and you know people organizing in opposition to what's happening to Iowa agricultural ... large confined when I'm eating operations but also\nNegative impact of the monoculture bicultural whatever corn and\nUnity in a local group seem to get organized than in shape than the other organizations work with them but now there's a collection of almost thirty different organizations now that have come together to form the Iowa alliance responsible agriculture\nAnd probably half or more of that there was thirty organizations are these you just local groups that have organized within their communities to fight back and protect your communities from industrial agriculture and so I think that's a\nThat's a good sign because we're not we're not in my opinion yet again we're not going to get the changes that we need from the state and federal level because that large agribusiness corporation was in an organization started organizations that support industrial agricultural such and the\nAmerican Farm Bureau federation the corn producers soy producers are producers producers\nOut of those single commodity organizations are in support of this industrial approach because it's about specializing in particular commodities rather than have diversified family farms\nSo these are the people that control the political agenda and agricultural policy state level and at the federal level USDA\nAnd so in order to address these threats that are being posed bought our rural communities and have written papers recently about our colonizing the rural communities with basically\nExtracting all of that wealth and leaving the pollution in these areas\nBut these people at the local level are organizing and I think that's where it's only going to bring about change because Boko people participating local democracy and they're standing up and saying look I'm nobody else is going to protect our community so we're going to do it and if we build\nAn enough alliances if we get enough people at the local level and involved in in coming together and building alliances and networks then we can begin to them\nBut proponents of the uh in in the family farms and\n... and the basic justification if you get right down to it is that that traditionally farming family farm which not just the business was it business but it was also a way of life\nIn and there was a commitment on the part of those farmers to take care of the money on them to pass it to the next generation or you know the land is productive and healthy as it was a clean the natural environment there could be passed on\nAnd there was a commitment to those family farms as a responsible members of the community they wouldn't go in and build an operation that was going to destroy their neighbors quality of life or threatening that the quality of water and polluting neighbors will get relief thing like that the traditional family farmer wouldn't have done that\nAwkward see now in a new place in our fall program season here at the movies yes you Middletown [noise]\n\n\nTried upon off on you and there'll be no

so you know Wesleyan is a um break right now so uh we're going to get to some particular details about what's going on this week in case you didn't go anywhere\nI hear the most a shot after a break destination for Wesleyan students there's Montreal I don't know why that everybody wants to go to Canada all of a sudden but that's what it is\nUm if there's some big concert or something up there you know maybe that's probably why I don't know\nUm I got some reviews is sports we have some very exciting match is coming up this week got to tell you about them before I Do a one a hit on to a twenty five year anniversaries or this weekend and\nIn this program or the views of the individual broadcaster and do not necessarily reflect the views of Wesleyan University or the W E S U management\nUm they're just my rambling says what they are so take them for what their uh but uh this weekend in New York City marks the first time\n\nIn twenty five years that um [noise]\nUh there were no shootings [laughter] got shot in New York City the first time in twenty five years\nAnd that's congratulations New York it's been a long time coming but um we're very proud of you are\nThe murder rate in New York is right where it was last year pretty much about seven hundred and fifty seven hundred eighty five burgers so far this year that's pretty high you know it's scary\nAh but ah\nShootings are down I Believe that's what it is or maybe I have that backwards Seventy five shootings that sounds a little low for New York but no shootings for an entire weekend last time that happened was twenty five years ago in Nineteen Ninety three also twenty five years ago in Toronto\nOr tomorrow would mark the twenty fifth anniversary of the Toronto blue jays winning or not just the world series but back to back World Series with a walk off home run a by Joe Carter\nUm [noise] I Know that I I I it's like I was there because ah my son was being\nBorn at the time and I kept going out into the lobby to watch the game [laughter] what\nA great game\nWe'll be with Charlie Sheen about the wild picture that they had or Mitch Williams who was the wild is pitcher\nIn major league baseball or otherwise why would they have named wild thing I'm Mitch gave up that home run too bad for him [noise]\nThe last big time something like that happened a was a walk of home room was bill ... skis a home run to beat the New York Yankees in Nineteen teens sixty or the year before much Roger Maris broke Babe Ruth's home run record\nSo um do you have it uh that uh the uh\nTwo twenty five year anniversary so I'm sure there are others\nUh Nineteen Ninety three are probably had a lot of stuff going on but once my son was born I probably didn't notice much else except what was going on with him so I'm Wesleyan\nSports let's get right down to it okay and I'm Free usual\nI'm gonna start alphabetically which means that means we're gonna talk crew and um\n[noise] men's crew had a great um regatta at\nThe fifty fourth annual head of the Charles you might get for that is Charles River in Boston\nUm the men's collegiate eight boat or had another strong finish or\nTwelfth out of thirty six wild best in all other ... teams so although twelve out of thirty six may not impressed you\nUm\nThey are the cardinals will conclude their fall campaign next Saturday at the head of the fish in Saratoga in New York so I'm\nA ... I'm a name off the players because uh\nThey're probably not here today are hardly anybody is here to somebody in Studio be high high or got somebody working in Studio be otherwise all the lights would be out here it'd be very dark and because it's very dark and quiet it's almost conducive to sleeping so I'm here in my ... today\nUm there's you know nobody around everybody's gone to a Montreal\nAnd um\nBut I Will name off a give some highlights and I don't know there\nI don't know what class there in but it will name off the eight both varsity men's a crew team and they include a CEO simco at Cox Hayden Lucia stroke will Humphrey Brendan Joyce bend Lynch Sam Pratt jak Schaeffer Harrison Malik\nA stroke and ah and then Andrew the gun bag and ... a show um\nGood luck you've had a pretty good seats and I got to congratulate you\nUm you know I'm I think we should have a a a a\nLottery here you know talk about lottery a little bit later to uh in in a ... W E s U and uh the winner of the lottery would go and have to a stroke with the uh by a team you know up and down the Connecticut River for\nA few blocks see if they could make it out of Middletown\nThey placed a at the same regatta head of the Charles\nIn Cambridge they place six out of twenty eighth and the women's collegiate eights so a very impressive um and also the women's varsity a four by four or competed placing eleventh overall you know forty team field\nUm and that was just a half an hour later after the by age ... and if somebody's some of these by eight\nUh uh uh\nAthletes are also on the by for boat that's gotta be grueling because you're talking about uh about twenty minutes worth of rowing\nAnd um\nIf you say well twenty minutes that's not too much go to the YMCA get on one of their rowing machines and row for twenty minutes and then come back and tell me oh that wasn't too bad\nI'm next up for the women just like the men had of the fish and a good luck to them as they go up to Saratoga\nHey okay um [noise]\nMen's cross country they are headed to the next ... championships on Saturday and that's it stops\nAnd ah so are the women talk a little bit more about the woman because ah [noise]\nAh the Wesleyan women's cross country team ran to eighth third place finish out of thirty nine teams at the inter regional border battle hosted by Rowan University on Saturday\nAnd ah that would have been\nI Would expect or the soccer teams to a split those decisions on Tuesday\nThat'd be tomorrow with the women winning and demanded losing but anything can happen we'll see let's hope that the women can remain undefeated at home for the season\n[noise] okay um let's see what else we get ten and all the ball\nYou know what I'm going to take them out of alphabetical order and talk about volleyball first because\nAh this is the biggest weekend of the season for was lands volleyball team let me explain Wesleyan ... is\nNo in first place in the conference six you know at home\nIs very important because tied with Wesleyan in first place at eight no his boat and will be the next ... champ in volleyball no other team can overtake them in the last two games with\nThe season they will finish this season I guess a nine in one or tennis no\nBut if they're nine and one if they lose their final game and and go nine and one uh no one can\nCatch them [noise] um it's possible that ah they could play each other\nOne team could win and then the next game it'd be tied at nine and one but probably not\nA I'm a ... to ... ... and that the two coaches are are coat and\nThe Johnson and Wales coach I Believe are know each other very well\nAnd uh uh it's like a blood sport when they play each other ranked first Bowden is ranked second Wesleyan is ranks eighth and the only other ... to be ranked as ... which is currently in third place and they're ranked twelfth\nSo um that game is friday night at eight PM and it's up and vote and but you can go to\nAh the Wesleyan athletics website and pulled down the sport of a women's uh volleyball and go to the calendar and\nThe day or do this when it's happening eight eight pm this Friday and go ahead and a\nOn the little video camera and it will play the game for you live right there it will probably be the most exciting\nYeah the class is just going crazy for you this is gonna be the highlight of your semester is watching this game if you can't make it up there to vote and uh this is for the ... championship need I remind you\nOkay that is ...\nWell that leaves tennis [noise]\nAnd ah gonna\n\nGonna a chat a little bit here about a both men's and women's team\nOr they just wrapped up a fall play at the ita cup in Rome, Georgia well that's where I'm\nThe women were and we'll talk about them first and we'll get to them in a Wesleyan wrapped up play at the IT cup or were\nFreshmen vinita young secured a third place finish in singles and Victoria and Christina you did you see I was in my Japanese\n[laughter] talking laid back here today what yeah a little challenge right now to get me something they're cute are they they're made for radio\nYeah I've got my stock monkeys on\nA show um\nThe sisters Victoria the elder and Christina the younger you won their match the finished fifth of the national championships so\nBig big weekend for the women um\nAh\n[noise] I won't go into a much more than that but the IT a cup\nIf Paul rankings for young and they use with the team will not be back in action for completion for competition until spring when their spring season will kick off in Florida during spring break in March\nAnd so now you have a big decision to make a march would you want to be in Florida during spring break or would you rather go back up\nTo ... tree all you're going to think about that one you really are [noise] um the men the men um\n[noise]\nUh [noise] it's called the tough days [noise] ah I Hope I said that right invitational [noise] in Boston I guess it was at tops [noise]\nAnd in their first tournament together junior Princeton Carter and freshman Noah Lillian thaw emerged as a flight doubles champions at the imitation all on Sunday defeating Sean way and Zach but set of emerged eight to five in the final if you go back a couple of weeks to my interview\nWith um our a luxurious tennis coach is a there was a long explanation of how the scoring has done but eight to five is the final score or\nAnd or in singles action freshman Peter ... had a quick turnaround for too long matches the previous day still played tough in his client in his a flight singles semi final against adverse way that's Sean way\nAn NC double a semi finalist last season in the end and per se suffer prevailed six for six due to advance to the final\nUm\nYang a boat and the first sent went to a tie breaker but in came out on top and got through in straight sets over the Wesleyan freshman seven six six three\nI'm also in the backdrop on Sunday was sophomore jak Fleischmann who lost to be single six for six to a but I'll tell you what we've got a a a very healthy tennis team here at Wesleyan\nAnd they're playing really excellent tennis both the men and women\nAre just this tournament or for the men which featured number one Middlebury number two boating number five Williams number seven Amherst number eleven\nBrand of Wesleyan number Twenty one Brandeis and number twenty two tops at one of the strongest fields of any fall tournament in the country making the doubles crown for Carter\nAnd Lillian fall fall that more impressive\nSo congratulations to our\nDoubles teams\nOf junior Princeton Carter and freshman Noah woolly and fall and thank you Princeton for not going to Princeton but coming to Wesleyan instead to play tennis year we really appreciate that for\nA and a men's team is off now until march until spring break when they will uh play against Kenyan\nMarch tent in Florida [noise] and ah can mark your calendar and the Senate to that date for\nA but before they were deleted lots of people you know did screen shots and Josh of course\nA has gone to sensitivity training or per the brewers and uh he has admitted he said stupid stuff and he was younger uh he's still young he's like I don't know early twenties um got a fastball won't quit guy\nSomeone who might uh you know if you're going to pick 'em out of a lineup who's the guy that was tweeting racist stuff that you you don't see them when they tweet but you'd pick him that's how what he looks like he looks like that guy uh he doesn't look like you know\nA a keg chugging or you know\n\nWhite boy of privilege he looks more like he came out of a trailer park\nAnd and uh a is a troublemaker\nBut he's not going to be in the world series man he's going to be in the world series now if many\nAh well the regardless of how many behaves and and and frankly I Hope he behaves really badly I Hope it really gets under Boston's in some way\nI'm I'm willing to bet that the Boston pitchers will hit somebody from the Dodger infield within the first two games and hit hit\nThem not in their head but\nUh send them it'll be a message shot and I mean I guess it's either going to be their third baseman or their shortstop uh and uh you know that's the way baseball should be played\nA between the lines and not we shouldn't have to worry about what they do off a off the field\nBut I'm managed been called out for a kind of like a nasty slides sliding high\nUm these fights Dustin ... who's a very very popular player and guess what team aids from so you can imagine what it's going to be like when the Dodgers come to Boston\nUm I think you'll get hit probably in\nIt's gonna be like for the series\nUm\nI'm not saying these teams don't like each other but the Dodgers want to win this World Series very badly ever coming up short last year the red Sox have to prove that they're really the best team in baseball this year having the best record of course goes a long way until you don't win the world series\nSo I'm should be a good match up um I think the\nDodgers are slightly favored I don't know why I'm a both teams well the Dodgers especially\nA play a lot of um a\nWhack a mole with their players moving them around just when you think you know who the second baseman is\nHe's now out in left field and they've done a double switch and it can get very complicated when they're going to be in LA so the heart heart some of the games will be a little bit hard to follow 'em a nightmare if you're trying to actually score them on a baseball scoring cheat\nBecause of all the double switches that might come into play or a you know the Milwaukee Brewers play to a picture of the pitch for one man to one man and they pulled him and then he pitched the next night instead or you know a gamesmanship like that has been going on\nA a lot this season with the new idea of starting relief pitchers to start the game\nUm Clayton ... comes out of the bullpen now um it's it's a whole new concept um what the game is all about certainly not what it was like twenty five years ago [noise] um [noise] but the thing to worry about\nIs a duty grew glorious\nAnd uh\nIt's going to have a\nA Tommy John surgery this or the off season I Believe and he probably will miss all the uh two thousand Nineteen season which means the Yankees are shorter shortstop\nAnd ah if they were to get a shadow a\nThere would be a lot of controversy about that but he may be the best playing shortstop available so it'll be a um do you swallow your pride and take a player that causes a lot of controversy you take a player who can't talk to the press in the Bronx that is going to be a problem we'll\nJust have to see wait and see a but it'll be interesting both for the world series and for the play offs\n\nUm money money or I promise to talk a little bit about money because um\nI personally blue four dollars this weekend\nI'm On\nTwo lottery tickets I don't go in for the\nUh um you know a\n... an array of different uh numbers to pig or I just did the quick pick and I didn't ask for anything extra just give me the cheapest ticket you can give me I just want one ticket want to be able to ... I don't want to\nHave somebody said to me well if you don't play you can't win because that is true you can't win if you don't buy a ticket or the your chances of winning are about the same if you do by\nOne ticket but I'm I'm why not you know why not buy something\nGetting into the billion dollar check pots now and there's an actual reason for that they changed the rules\nUm as very subtly to um you know you have numbers to pick 'em you gotta pick five numbers and then this six numbers kind of like a mega multiplier\nI'm so I'm making millions used to work that you would pick five numbers between one and Seventy five\nAnd then I'm Megan number from one to Fifteen and the odds of winning the top prize in that configuration or about one in two hundred and fifty million\nBut then um they were noticing that sales were flat and they decided to do something about that and what they did was they changed it to pick\nFive numbers from one to Seventy so oh now there's only Seventy numbers to pick from well that's good that's not you know there's five less numbers but the mega multiplier number is not from one to Fifteen anymore as from one to twenty five\nAnd the odds of now winning the jackpot are one in three hundred million so\nReducing the balls for the first five numbers increases the chances of winning a smaller price\nBut raising the number of mega balls that makes it harder to win the jackpot you have to win all six numbers for the jackpot so that's what's causing these big humongous jackpots to keep growing and growing and growing because it's harder to win [noise]\nWell what does this mean well it means that there are a lot of players like myself who don't play the lottery weak in and week out don't buy you know don't go pick up their gas a six pack of beer some Cheetos\nIt's people like me who wait until they see oh wow it's really big\nUh I I you know two hundred million didn't really interest me because frankly I Know that I could spend two hundred million inside a one year no problem but\nOne point five billion that would be harder for me to spend that I could probably have some leftover give some to loved ones and friends\nIt makes more sense now that it's up to one point five billion for me to throw in and buy a ticket and I usually just by one ticket [noise]\nUm and so when you think about it why to most people lose or if they win why do they have to share it with so many people well there's a couple of reasons one is a most people pick their favorite numbers and when you think about numbers from one that Seventy\nMostly your favorite numbers are between one in thirty one because their birth dates\nWhich means you're eliminating thirty two through Seventy as picks and that's more than half the numbers that might come
