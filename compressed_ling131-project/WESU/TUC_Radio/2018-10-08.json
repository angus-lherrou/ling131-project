and also rockets Jeanette the University of Colorado in Denver welcome to the program guy\n[noise] they use on all it's good to hear Columbus Day was founded as a national holiday here in Denver Nice you know seven and before that it was a put forth a night you know five or by Italian Americans down in Pueblo and so this is kind of the birthplace of this holiday\nAnd um the people that are put in for the Italian Americans that important for us we're part of the knights of Columbus\nWhich actually was an organization that was started by Irish Americans or Irish immigrants to kind of blend in and assimilate with ah American society and when they first started coming over and so there's kind of this policy about the history of Columbus as some of the organizations that have\nA huge Columbus in a way to a push towards a certain kind of agenda and so I you know I [noise] I\nJust feel that there's a lot of misrepresentation going on here within even the Italian\nThat has that's been you know kind of\nBroadcasted throughout our history and the struggle is that it's a tie ins versus Indians and that's not what we're saying if they wanted to change this holiday and say and call it you know a tally Italian pride day you know or Italian history day we would be fine with that and we've told them that are on a number of occasions\nThe the problem we have is the celebration of a genocidal maniac such as Christopher Columbus\nWhat duck Columbus mean to you Jenna fighting maniac is a pretty strong term and I mentioned he'd never set foot in North America but actually the Columbus Day is marked in\nA lot of America in a different way as well different to the U.S how how do you and your family I Know your family at the end our family's been involved in the in the struggling Denver your community how do you view Christopher Columbus\nI think like you said you know he is just use just one man but the legacy of Columbus and what we have really recently and throughout the past couple of years have really tied what Columbus his legacy is truly about is the doctrine of Christian discovery a domination\nAnd I've had the pleasure of getting to know and collaborate with I'm Steven nukem who has written a an excessive amount on the doctrine of Christian discovering domination and he just recently came out with a documentary about it\nAnd we think that that is really what we talk about Columbus and we talk about his legacy\nThat's what we're talking about we're talking about the legal justification that has come from Europe in order to displaced and commit heinous acts against indigenous peoples from turtle island as well as in the Caribbean um obviously\nAnd of course they needed at some point to be able to legally justified that and so if you refer to Robert Williams juniors book I'm American Indian and western legal thought he does a very wonderful job of eloquently described being\nYou know since the arrival of Europeans how they have been able to your justify whether it's through federal Indian law whether it's through constitutional law or whether it's now through international law how these things and how Columbus his legacy of like eminent domain um the papa bulls have\nHeld land in differently they held land privately I'm as individuals so that\nWhen the United states government removed other American indian nations in the south east\nThey were not able to remove my ancestors um partly because their land holding relationships didn't unable to the federal government to negotiate treaties with our our um tribal leaders\nSo that type of history that the relationship to land that we possess a somewhat different than other tribes in the United states though of course there are now many many American Indians to own land privately tribes who live on their lands and and care for their lands in ways that\nAre different than what the federal government um imagined\nFor them\nA reason why then did it just it you know if there's such a distinctive miss what her um hampered the struggle for federal recognition why did lumpy Indians have to struggle apparently longer and harder than other tribes\n[noise] well it's partly because of that distinctive no so one of the um one of the conditions for federal recognition or the criteria is that the ancestors of this community would have made agreements with a government federal or state government and um\nIn question comply with a certain kind of stereotype or or cookie cutter sort of a notion of what makes it a try because the ... is our ancestors had I'm fairly different types of relationships to land as well as different\nTypes of relationships to leaders ... relationships that the federal government didn't always recognize as distinctly Indian [noise] um we don't really fit that that stereotype or that cookie cutter um\n[noise] that's kind of a fatal flaw in federal recognition policy I think many scholars who study that policy recognized that\nUh it suffers the same laws as as all policies that this can't be a one size fits all solution because\nNot all tribes are the same size [laughter] era you know not or they the same shape or they don't have the same histories are contours so I'm federal recognition is not an especially an adaptable\nIdea um though there are ways in which the lump each have had recognition\nAnd from the federal government actually since the Eighteen eighties\nThe federal government has said you are Indians but we are not going to afford you the nation to nation relationship that we afford to other federally recognized tribe so when the ancestors of a tribe or that that is going to be recognized such as the Navajo or\nThe um public tribes are any number of others in the United states when those ancestors signed a treaty with the federal government um\nThat was a form of recognition that indoors to this day in federal Indian law when lump Columbia ancestors didn't sign such a document and so we don't have we don't have that automatic or that sort of um we don't meet that particular criteria of what it needs to be a trial\nUm the notions of of what\nWhat a political community is is is different for indigenous nations than it is for the United states and the United states federal government has some work to do to reckon with all of the distinctive ways in which American Indians think of themselves as political community does nations with citizens\nNow I'm just I tried that a very um prevalent throughout to the eastern I'm not doing the United states I'm a college is um you know the history of the of the house is one that has kind of become\nFodder for political controversy these days um and we of course know that um\nThe the the Scots history's very much intertwined with the history of slavery in the United states we get the ... the\nTried but they love me Indian figure into that history not just during slavery but after slavery aftermath patient and the Jim Crow south I Know you've written a book about ... and the Jim Crow south\n[noise] yeah I'm so slavery is I'm\nPart of the larger imperial project that European Americans have carried out here\nBoth um of course\nChattel slavery began with American Indians American Indians were the first in slave to\nPeople in the south before Africans or the ... riots here but I'm Wendy African slave trade began to take over the economy there there there was a reason economically\nAnd socially for European Americans to assert their supremacy over\nA group of people that they were trying to hold as property and um that desire to search supremacy involved in our in our case in the case of this region the south the eraser of native people at the same time so\nYou know Americans who want it to assert that supremacy\nTo rationalize it um when you have one group attached to a racial identity that isn't slate and another group with a different racial identity that's free it makes it really difficult to have a third group where do you put them in which category especially if it's a non white group\nAnd a a free non white group it that um it's particularly difficult so then the stand the idea that all African Americans should be enslaved in all the European Americans should be free I'm so for a long time ... especially before the civil war or thought of as\nFree people of color that identity at at Indian to label as of Indian did not\nA company us in the documentary record and so I'm well lumpy families have always thought of themselves as as Indian as native I'm there had not always been regarded that way by outsiders by governments or others and so the part of the reasons for that is this desire to perpetuate\nSlavery and in particular race based slavery the idea that if you're black you should be enslaved\nThey could not of course make that true in every single case\nBut part of the strategy behind erasing the identity of native people in this region has been to support slavery and then after the civil war after emancipation I'm white supremacy again McCain\nI'm there had to be a process to to uh ferment to uphold it and and design it and so it was segregation became part of that process\nCommemorating the Confederate caused became part of that process and in the in that it was there was another reason for Indians to either be raised which\nIs what happens in some region of this out they were kind of a legally eliminated\nFor us to to assert our autonomy and so they took advantage of segregation in particular to separate themselves from white then from blacks and whites in the case of Long Beach forming their own\nSchools and churches um in order to sort of take segregation and turn it around into something that would support their self determination\nThat's ... ... talk about where\nThe community is to date or just stinks try but by the for reasons we've discussed is still waiting to get flu federal recognition does that mean that um there is no sort of whom beef in terms of land owned by the tribal areas controlled by the tribe\nOther tribes may have reservations or me half political relationship and specific treaties with the U.S [noise] um are lumpy Indian some sort of disparate Lee geographically um scattered throughout the United throughout the eastern United States\nWell now we're quite concentrated I mean we're we live all over the United states I used to live in Berkeley for awhile and northern California there's actually quite a\nCommunity of ... in California and elsewhere Baltimore Detroit lots of other cities oh you'll find Long Beach but our homeland is in South eastern North Carolina and Robin and county which right now it's underwater most of it because of\nRain you and I are speaking of the time that Hurricane Florence is I'm Still pounding the area yeah\nYes and the river is rising today and and make the flood may get worse um that is our homeland so when people see those images or think about that hurricane it's impacting us the most heavily our homeland has been sustained over time not because it's reservation land but because it's probably\nOnly owned land though our families our ancestors\nAcquired deeds to their land the to their farms I'm back around\nThen some of those I called them founding families in in in the book and those founding families acquired titled to those land their descendants still have title to those lands and um [noise] we are have no intention of leaving or abandoning it or otherwise I'm", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TUC Radio", "city":
