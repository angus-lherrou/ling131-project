Sunday night's debate starting with the ...\nI look at what Andrew has done in terms of aligning himself with groups like the dream defenders but one of their he stood on the debate states that he stood with them he stood by them but one of their main playing for their platform is to boycott divested sanction the state of Israel\nOr they want to they say Israel is a genocidal apartheid state they attack a law enforcement and the police\nSo that it to me is very ... I don't think he should have signed that dream defenders pledge I think he should disavow them because I can tell you this if you want to unify Florida are taking positions about Israel like that that may be a unifying if you're running for the mayor of the guys the surgery didn't unifying here we're pro Israel state and we need to do that\nAfter Mr Mayor well let me just simply say my relationship with Israel is beyond reproach I'm the mayor of a city that has a sister city relationship and Israel or with the city of Ramadi ...

Florida City official has been charged with murder after the state rejected his defense under the stand your ground law\nThat law has been terribly contentious and was discussed in relation to George Zimmerman killing of Trayvon Martin incident that bird the formation of the black lives matter movement\nIn this most recent case a white man named Michael Dunn the Lakeland city commissioner shot and killed crystal ball Lopez at the entrance of the military supply store that done owns done had accused Lopez of shoplifting he now faces a charge of second degree murder\nIn our country and of course the symbolism of being asked to get off of blood on top of all of that\nJust to me showed how critical the story is that we are unfortunately seeing what feels like a return to a very um distribute chapter in our nation's history right\nSay this about the thing you know it's really interesting um I was deeply deeply disturbed um what was really interesting is when cliff who is ... who's the co founded black voters matter because he actually got the information I was I was in the back leading the pep rally and\nClip when he came back he said well I've got some bad news one of the seniors you can actually hear it on the ... one of the thing is that\nUm we can go right\nAs as it was almost as if they really weren't completely shocked that someone had interfered in the process right while we were while I was really mad\nAnd upset they were just fired up they were like oh they were going to vote we're going on at a vote the day\nRight and so they felt that what what was so beautiful about them and their resolve right that they had so much resolved and resilience around you know what we're going to do is we all but they're not gonna stop us from voting and so okay and so what we for us\nWe did not want to push the we didn't want to change the dynamics we had come off such a high that well we didn't want to do with the get into a of a power struggle with the local official at that\nThe leadership the local leadership in terms of what their advice live and so we had made a decision that we would deal with it that we would make provisions for the seniors we were really get to the bottom of it and so\nUm two days later we actually drove three hours uh we went back down to um Jefferson County one to do two things I Want to check in with the seniors who did not um who got off the bus to make sure that they have provisions to vote and that we can go organize\nTaking them to the polls on our own and then secondly to go well actually three reasons secondly we knew that there was a voter suppression rally I asked our voter suppression rally we wanted to be in support of the community around\nAnd then the third thing was to actually go to the county commissioner's office and look at the county administrator in his face and ask him\nPoint blank what was he thinking what was the purpose of it why would the bus um stop what was the denial about and get to the bottom up really where that was and so we did those things and what was really interesting\nAnd that process was when we talk to him is he spoke at if the seniors were children now people have looked at\nThe video this is about a nursing home this is not a residential facility this is a a ... this is a a community center where seniors and other some of the thing is even drive themselves there these are not people who are not able bodied people even able bodied independent living active\nSeniors some of them some of them are all Walker some of them\nUm healthier than others but none of them are\nUm either a ward of the county um or I'm In a resident\n... ... ... that's how they have the right to step on whatever they want to step on and go wherever they want to go oh\nAbsolutely absolutely so it was this paternalistic you know it's really interesting and it was just ... tunnel lifted kinda raised in ...\nHe actually said publicly in a statement and he said it to us and there were many around he said that\nHe didn't know who we were that he needed to better now now now I just want you to think about it these are forty grown adult who has spent two hours with that trust it us enough that they were willing to rock not only were they willing to ride with that they actually requested to ride with\nAnd somehow that's one official this white man\nThought that he had to do that in\nWay he could discern and make a decision which would be best for them that they in some way you were not capable of making\nRight all of this of course that in ... paying off a black folk ... years old so part of the disturbing racist history of our nation I understand in the days after that happened a mayor in Georgia of the town of bark Barreto\nUm has been posting on Twitter\nUm these bizarre claims that of course it's obviously what what really scares some of these folks is that\nYour organization called black voters matter the bus has a face on it with a symbol you know if a powerful a fifth of resistance on it so this is what Robert Morris to smear posted he said it's utterly was reprehensible that you're broke maintains that all black motive should vote for a black candidate\nJust because they're the same color as you a man named Jim Jones once ran that organization like that\nBetter check that Kool Aid you are serving up [noise]\nWow I couldn't believe that your response to that\nI ... it ... it it it's so\nUm it is so ridiculous what he wrote but it's problematic on some on on on so many levels um run just in the substance of what he'd vote wrote and which we responded to your average monitoring one um our organization is we're stand that\nWe've never publicly requested that\nOur personal belief that the only people that could represent that we would ever support for public office would be black people that have not been a track record we currently\nWe in the past we have ... the ... white candidate that we think we're out in the uk where the best interest of us and we've supportive black candidates as well so one based on his own racial bias he made enough function that is completely contrary to who we are\nAnd the work that we're doing a second laid the fact\nThat he is in the position of leadership here is a mayor of a town in a county that is fifty three percent\nSo this is jeopardizing how there's been three percent black so here the mayor in a county that it has a majority black population that he clearly you can hear this late and he clearly has an issue with with black self determination that in itself is a problem and then the\nPiece I think is really interesting that he would actually equate I'm Jim Jones and cool late as if there's something that\nSome way we are trying to mislead our community radio play cult that but he compared\nA so called right so that in itself is just extremely problematic but I think the deeper issue that we really got to deal with and we've got to see it and and we're taught in clipping I talk about this all the time\nTo black voters matter is around\nThe structural racism that have gone undisturbed and unchecked particularly when we're looking at\nIn the deep south in the rural communities that even the progressive community in many ways have abandoned the south and completely abandoned the rural communities and pretty much if it's not like an urban centers they've not really been a been making any investment or even in put any attention\nIdeas and thoughts and just like this mayor did write and feel justified in doing so because they're not being a ... a concerted\nTo check him and to hold him accountable so for those kinds of things\nLook let's go to the higher level this was the mayor we're talking about but at the state level of course we have this\nIncredibly blatant conflict of interest taking place around the gubernatorial race with secretary of state Brian Kemp running for governor of Georgia\nThe same person running for re too has the of especially overseas voting matters in the state Brian Kemp I'm very problematic candidate Trump a supporter of Trump loved him he loved Trump who has\nNow are we find out then she'd been responsible for attempting to suppress the vote of hundreds of thousands of Georgian are disproportionately tending towards black voters um we've heard many numbers though the most blatant one is a hundred and seven thousand people\nWhose votes were purged from the rules the I understand by a Georgia law\nThat they can't they they're registrations are invalid somebody because they didn't vote in the last few elections or can you explain that a little bit\nRight so he had a purging profit so here it is a person that's at the top of the ticket it's like my grandmother would say I love ... I'm I'm a referred to my grandparents they used to have these wife saying that\nYou don't put the Fox on the chicken or over the chicken coop right so then surely what you've got the top of the ticket that has been making the decision to actually perch voters saying that they haven't participated in the last\nElection cycles maybe do we have the right to do so on one hand do we have the right to vote do we have not the right to decide\nWhich elections that we don't want to vote and he's made a decision to use that\nTo actually per hundred about\nSleep they lead different new registration profit one you have to think about it why\nWhat's the harm in it too why\nIs he doing this at this time and why you been doing that well we all know the answer at the end of the day he had his he there is an attempt to marginalize", "show_name": "TUC Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "22"}
