and listeners will your shared this on Monday on what uh\nWhat is stunning leaked it has been on friday a we're speaking right after the Senate Judiciary committee voted to advance Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for a floor vote\nBut it's possible to not vote will be delayed by a week not sure what what happened during that delay or do you have any sense of what a Jeff Flake requirement sort of conditional vote was all about\nI mean I Would like to believe that the you know the women who caught him in the elevator earlier today and you know asked him point blank why he was not\nThings to do with a his decision to ask for an FBI a thorough FBI investigation I don't think we'll ever really know but um you know I I'd like to take away from it that our our efforts to share our stories and you really call on\nYou know people with power men with power in particular to account for the way that they are treating the issue of sexual assault and sexual harassment and and the survivors themselves\n... and actually let's play a almost a video of these women confronting Jeff Flake the top and try to understand as he was entering an elevator\nThe story that you eat that that's\nAnd a woman\nAt the same court did not tolerable\nMatter quiet because\n\nDots of video of Jeff Senator Jeff flake who sits on the Senate Judiciary committee being confronted by a couple of women um basically urging him to vote no on Capitol and of course it's interesting to the place has been one of Trump's strongest critics from the Republican side\nIs not running for re election and has nothing to lose\nExcept for perhaps they're locked patterns of parties reputation um why wouldn't he have to be if he had voted no on the committee hearing that would have been the flight of the life or Kavanaugh's nomination\nSharing it with such a remarkably carrying a study in contrast with the first part of figuring being home\nI'm very poised and vulnerable women sharing her truth and then a followed by a belligerent angry man who was just so upset that his rights to the job was being questioned oh what are your general thoughts on what transpired on Thursday\nI mean I think you're summing it up really well it was absolutely a contrast I think it was a an unfortunate lesson for all of us are reminder really not ... not a new lesson in\nThe way that um that and you know entitlement and privilege and uh the establishment power functions and our culture where the you know default is um to him to his benefit to believe him\nAs long as he denies that loudly enough um it seems that people throw up their hands as if there's no way to know a no way to possibly um use what Kevin himself a brought in his testimony as the common sense rule and I think that\nFor women of this country for whom uh the experience that\nA doctor for described brings lots of bells and then a cabinet own testimony in his behavior\nIs familiar and a rings lots of other bells um you know just said to us the common sense rule is why how can we not believe her how can we what reasons do we have not to believe that she is is telling the truth uh I think\nYou know unfortunately um\nDispel all cheap the millionaire chew a lot most I'm American women and women are watching 'em I don't know\nKnow what this looks like they know what it feels like we have experienced it I'm over the course of our lives in one form or another and um to me the common sense rule would say um to believe Dr Ford\nIt seems as though now the conversation is um more about Brett Kavanaugh's character I mean we have to have really high standards for the people that that the nine justices that fit for the rest of their lives on the Supreme Court handing down decisions\nI'm On the ... incredibly important aspects of our lives but Brett Kavanaugh has shown in the past few days it's first of all very hyper partisanship which used because I'm going to you know it leads to other justices that are liberal or conservative\nMakeup were tens of showing them to be nonpartisan please ... extremely hyper partisan\nCan't seem to control of the motion and seemed to be a sort of pathological liar um\nOur guest pointed out earlier Rachel ordinary Carmona pointed out that\nHe even lied about something as simple as when asked whether he saw Christine Ford\nTestimony he said no and it turns out that he had to watch it so he's ... and you know what\nHe's obviously lying about his behavior in high school instead of doing the right thing would've which would have been to say I was a teenager I did some terrible things and I feel horrible and I apologize for my behavior\nAbsolutely I completely agree I think that\nA lot of what has been lost in the conversation is why it matters so much focus on who to believe and I think that that serves um people who would like to see Kavanaugh confirmed to the core served their purpose is to keep the the conversation focused there but really we need to be having a conversation I'm Wyatt matter why\nAnd believes that his ah you know he's entitled to", "show_name": "TUC Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "01"}
