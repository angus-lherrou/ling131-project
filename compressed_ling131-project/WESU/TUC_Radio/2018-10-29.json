gathering where party leaders will decide on their direction or any progress observed that that the parties were first of all of a ban on a big money from fossil fuels corporation DNC chair Tom Perez justified the move\nUsing workers right at the pre tax my guests are Jeff Cohen has just Penn State's think this country needs a serious opposition party that can defeat both corporate power ended the GOP nothing else will do Jeff Cohen of the media critic writer in journalism professor who founded the\nIt media and he is the editor of autopsy the Democratic party in crisis which you can find online at democratic autopsy dot org welcome to the program Jeff\nGreat to be with you ... so I'm sure the Democrats feel that whatever they've been doing so far it's working if five thirty eight dot dot com is projecting that ah they're very likely to win a bat Tom majority and\nUm that's an interesting definition of it working um because for working people and people that have been\nA on the receiving end of the abuse from our current government the Democratic party is not working\nUm [noise] the important figures I sure hope that the Republicans get defeated in November but the real figures to talk about is during two thousand and the dirty the eight years of the Obama administration\nThe Democratic party lost one thousand legislative seats in statehouses\nI'm at the end of the Obama administration\nOr two out of three governors were Republicans at the end of the Obama administration\nFor uh there were about twenty five states that had Republican governors and control Republican controlled the state house and they're only about a half a dozen democratic state Democrats control the governor's the governorship and the state or\nSo and then put on top of that\nThat the least popular candidate of a modern party one against the Democrats in November twenty sixteen and that's Donald Trump so no ah I don't think the we should be I'm excited\nBut certainly the Democratic leadership that has had led us through ten years of defeats in election after election that should've been one that democratic leadership does not deserve a lot of praise\n... do you feel that there needs to extend the party you enjoying may actually be due to the younger I'm more progressive\nUh members that are basic ... leading insurrection within the party some of the\nUh the new um nominees for house races that have one in spite of not getting establishment parties support it there was an interesting piece in the New York times on Thursday paying a Nancy Pelosi under threat in our own party\nIs scrambling to build bridges with some of these new leaders\nAh you've hit on it so now they there is this incredible insurgency debate of the party is progressive the base of the party the activist base wants bold programs from the leadership which they do not get\nA bus in spite of the establishment having to get some on the scales\nAnd supportive usually\nAre the more conservative or more corporate candidate within primaries\nA lot of progressive or women or women of color a democratic socialist had been winning the primary\nAnd it's often in spite of the Democratic establishment or so you have the victory of New York city against one of the most powerful Democrats in Congress is the victory of hoax Andrea Ocasio Cortez in New York City\nYou have the victory of a rush it that's why you need in a in Detroit yeah or the victory in Minnesota and ...\nOh I'm so you do have\nThis incredible ferment and it's not because of the leadership of the Democratic party it's usually in spite of the leadership\nAnd an actor Jeff there was record turnout for the primary reason he was confident minutes coda earlier this week I'm among Democrats which looked to an indicator that the party's base is excited about voting for some of these new candidate\nYes the obviously the party's base was more excited about these young progressive female candidates than the party base was for Hillary Clinton who got imposed on us so um I think that uh there is exciting things happening in the Democratic party\n... what they call moderate Republicans I didn't even know those people still exist that I thought it was extinct the moderate Republican but they're spending millions of dollars on the persuadable\nWhen what we need is an agenda that brings out people's color and young voters and progressive voters and excites them that's how you will defeat the Republicans we want a democratic Democratic Party because we want to win elections we've lost too many in the last ten years\nJeff uh many have pointed out that voter turnout is critical to the Democrats' chances of winning so obviously you need candidates that actually in fire a those voters that you just mentioned a turnout younger people people of color et cetera\nUm and then you actually need to have very strong effort on the ground to get out the vote to help people registered to vote\nBecause of course those voting rights are very much under attack in state after state controlled by the Republicans those very um you know those kinds of ah a grassroots effort that require a lot of people power on the ground knocking on doors those are the things that you would hope the party would put effort into\nWell again you're exactly right the ground game is what can win these elections and the ground game is cheaper than the expense of money spent on ads of course the consultants get rich based on how many millions of dollars of ads\nWe pointed out in democratic autopsy Dr work how how tiny was the operation of the DNC the Democratic National Committee in confronting voter suppression state by state\nOr so clearly we need to orient the party toward its base and the only way you can do that is if the party leadership is not afraid of its banks I mean think about it or the head of the DNC the chair of the Democratic National Committee is Tom ...\nIt was basically a you know appointed by the Clinton Obama wing of the party to head off\nThe chair a person shift going do Keith outlets new endorsed Bernie Sanders Congressman Ellison at the time\nAnd I'm ... press has said repeatedly\nWeek after week through the beginning of this year that the dmc and this is a apparently learning from the mistake of twenty sixteen when the DNC had its thumb on the scales and behalf of Hillary and it caused so much controversy and anger\nA temp arrest said the dmc I Will not be participating in contested primaries and then weeks after saying that\nHe shows up in my state in New York\nAny endorses that it adds up on the stage to endorse the incumbent governor Andrew Cuomo\nWho is facing and insurgent challenge from a progressive candidate the activists and actors Cynthia Nixon and so we keep having these somersaults at the head of at the leadership of the Democratic party we're not going to intervene\nAnd then they ... ... per as endorses Cuomo we're not going to accept fossil fuels donations\nIs that the leadership of the Democratic party is are oriented towards corporate donors in corporate media\nBut the base of the Democratic party who are winning these elections um the base wants progressive\nPolicies and the party that oriented toward the base and you can't have that when the leadership of the party is sort of afraid seems to be afraid of its own baked ... and that's why you have this circus these flip flops from the leadership of the Democratic party no\nYou won't you know you don't hear about it on on rising up\nBut you won't hear about this cloud dish flip flopping on the part of the Democratic leadership\nOn CNN or MSNBC they just focus on the even more clown fish Trump antics\nBut frankly there are two major parties in this country they both deserve scrutiny corporate corporations have too much power over both of those parties and and what we really need and the reason we will be they're picketing in Chicago this next weekend\nIs because we\nBelieve that only an energized and democratic opposition party can not only a defeat corporate power but defeat the Republicans at the polls\n... Jeff I'm Wondering if uh finally if you think that Tom we need a a a different mind that cultural shift in the dynamics between\nA politician and voters and I we call in the wake of the election a lot of individuals who had backed Hillary Clinton\nBlaming critics of Clinton for Trump when basically saying that if we had all rallied behind Clinton this would never have happened with the understanding that politics to work in the way\nPolitician meet them when they're ... you are\nAnd and you know we a lot of people seem to have it backwards I mean if ... if if politicians are looking for a the literally public servants they need to meet voters rather than the other way around right\nYeah you're describing a democracy um and uh you are right that the Democratic leadership blamed the voter they never blamed themselves they wouldn't even do an analysis of what happened in this monumental calamitous defeat of twenty sixteen as I remind you\nWhen the British Labour Party went down to a bad defeat in twenty Fifteen the leaders of left\nAnd the voters labor party voters were able to relax their new leadership which was very much more progressive and Jeremy Corbyn\nAnd even though you had at the top of the British Labour Party and by the way there's so many parallels between us Democratic Party and British Labour Party\nUm but uh you know when the a progressive led by Germany carbon become the leaders of the British Labour Party all the corporate ... within the Labour Party over there said oh he does left wing he'll never win it's got to lead to the destruction of the Labour Party\nAnd then in twenty Seventeen or with carbon at the leadership that the Labour Party gained thirty members of parliament they gain ten percentage points it ended up voting and they nearly became the governing party of Britain\nUh so it's my belief that if the Democratic party was not controlled by this illegal corporate friendly corporate oriented leadership and allow this young base this energized Bates women people of color a democratic\nHappening within our Democratic Party instead of resigning in November twenty sixteen they seem to want to put a a a tougher stranglehold on the leadership of the party\nBut if if the bait could flourish and take over I'm very optimistic about how this country's future and the future of the world would look but we have to dislodge\nOr this leadership of the Democratic party which seems to be from an old movie one principal\nAnd that's to make sure that the progressive base of the party gets slapped in the face kept out of power or make sure there's not democratic participation of debate that's used to be the one from principal they will hold on power even when they lose so many of these elections that were winnable\nWell Jeff good luck next week I Want to thank you so much for joining us today\nThank you so now my guest has been Jeff calling and media critic writer in journalism professor he is the co founder of fruit action dot org\nAnd the editor off on top of the uh the Democratic party in crisis who have been discussing the DNC ahead of its meeting next week I saw an article online at ... dot com where you can kind of fighting newsletter subscribe ... what do you ... and our video chat on their meals [noise]\nYou're listening to W.
