about a Mexican American or Mexican immigrants or none of that and so it's as if right\nSome people some people were troubled not not the fact that his election led to some of the largest demonstrations this country has seen\nA among the things that ah they discuss in this book ... the author discussing this book or earlier in the book about Trump's business or a record in\nNew York is a page about woman rink in by Nineteen eighty the loving woman ice skating rink and New York city Central Park was falling apart it was closed et cetera\nCrump of offered to rebuild woman at no cost to the city to drink reopened less than six months later Trump got a lot of good publicity a New Yorkers once again that is Central Park skating rink to enjoy this page\nMakes it sound like Trump swooped in and did something wonderful for the people of New York makes literally no mention idle about Trump's role he his in his racist attacks against the Central Park five\nRight I agree yeah\nThe the skating rink and not mention the fact that when he had no political elected role that he took it upon himself to take out ads and the four major New York papers against calling really for the death penalty against\nAh the Central Park five who were as we all know later a proved to be innocent assumed to be innocent by many at the time and were teenagers he was calling for the death penalty of children\nUh and that and you know there's so many ah and then he was responsible for the whole birther movement so so many examples\nAggravation that President Obama was not born in the United states tried Crump continued to harp on that even during his campaign\nAnd so we we know that all of those races planes contributed to through you know for decades let alone during that his candidacy\nContributed to his popularity and support and so to insinuate that he was elected because of his ah you know even if we considered him a good businessman which I think that also should be called into question given his\nPractice is this really celebrates vulture capitalism is that it doesn't matter what you do to become rich it's it's it's okay and look you get to be president\nBut that isn't why he got elected we can think of a lot of wealthy millionaires at the time that they ran for election would not be elected based on that was\nIt was his campaign statements that he made over and quite proudly I mean what they are hiding with scholastic is hiding is statements that that that Trump had no qualms about making and continues to defend and so they've really\nI've created this campaign package for him there's even the um the books for older children has a a line you know the true but it says a big Larchmont Trump is never smoked drunk alcohol or taking drugs well for one thing we don't how do they know um and we we\nIt's it's a concern not just in in this book about Trump but it's a concern that a major I mean we're talking about a major\nLike as you said or you know as you talked about earlier that the widespread a pervasive in this uh scholastic throughout our schools that they're normalizing they're normalizing hate and they're causing young people to think that if someone is that hateful if they are elected than we need to ignore all that and just revere and respect them\nUm a number of we've been attacked on Fox and friends and brave art and by Fox News\nAh they've said that we don't want to buy a book by Trump's in the schools and what we're arguing we're not arguing for censorship were arguing that young people deserve the truth and they deserve the truth and age appropriate way\nWe would not what the first and second grade book to actually repeat most of what we he says I'm it would not be age appropriate language um but they it does need to be communicated that his platform was based on saying very demeaning thing about all the people that we just listed\nBook aimed at younger kids are part of the rookie biography series um is also deeply deeply problematic and they've written by the same person joined modern so it's not surprising but they basically follow the same theme um and and I'll just sort of read the summary of Donald Trump from the first page which\nWhich reflect the um what these books portrayed Donald Trump in the famous entrepreneur he's also a television personality in two thousand Fifteen Trump surprised many people when he decided to run for president\nIn November two thousand sixteen he won the election Donald Trump became the forty foot the president of the United states but the the gate right it was a businessman he was a reality TV star he made a surprise decision to run for president T one end of story walk away I'm with ... book is kind of um bizarre in that there's a poem\nAbout Donald Trump in the\nOh I'm trying to find it here in our here it is a poem about Donald Trump his buildings reached into the sky his businesses just grew and grew\nThan ... than Trump became our president people wanted something new I thought this was the most ... where the section of both the book Deborah\n[laughter] yeah and I think the palm really summarizes the tone um and the level of\nHim and available in both books uh so now we would uh in fact we've been getting a lot of the letters that have been written to scholastic includes suggestions for alternatives that pollen that are quite witty\nI think it's a good assignment for young people because what we're hearing from a lot of teachers have young children is that\nThey're really concerned that if their students came across this book that their lives that have already been threatened with then also be invalidated um and that the children would feel\nUm you know even more concerned that their own reality with not being and troops as they know it would not as not being reflected in the supposedly non fiction book um and I should point out that this is a concern we have not just about these these two books about Trump these don't come out of\nUm you know not anomalies that uh textbooks the media children's books for way too many years have\nA you know created a a a a a rosy picture has have elevated political leaders regardless of their policies and practices and that's I'm\nWeak coordinate with rethinking school something called as in education project and they're our focus is to teach outside the textbook\nBecause really we need to look outside the textbook for the resources that the people's history of the true stories um or the stories that reflect allies of her children and help them make informed decisions are moving forward we're also part of a collaborative um\nLook at children's literature um and fight for not just diversity in children's literature but for also for for truth and honesty um so that there are books that reflects the the real experiences in the majority of people in in the world\nA little bit about the ... step up to ... to campaign I understand there's also teaching a to scholastic what are some of the way the people who have been outraged by what we've been discussing and want to get in touch with scholastic would have some of the way that they can take action\nYou know well it if I say it's okay I'll give it a little bit of background on that\nIs this actually not the first time that there's been a campaign to hold scholastic accountable and I should also point out Scholastics not the only publisher that that uh needs to rethink how they they produced children's books but this one because of how a widely they're using the schools and how egregious this\nParticular pair of books are we're focusing on but uh it was actually about four years for five years ago that scholastic had a partnership with the American coal foundation and the American coal foundation\nWe include American coal foundation wow okay so far so damn company oh a lot of the road industry group\nYes because they um scholastic has a great reputation and it shows that reputation it's a brand that they sell and so that through that partnership they were distributing a curriculum to fourth grade classrooms across the country\nThat talked about clean coal and did not make any attempt to be balanced to say but on the other hand there are these environmental concerns it was a commercial for the call company just like these children's books are commercial for Trump\nAnd and not just Trump and his administration and his policies so thankfully a it was actually in that case it was re thinking schools got a hold of that they partnered with the center for commercial free childhood and a lot of environmental groups a story was released in the New York times and scholastic quickly had to\nYears ago a they released a children's book\nCalled a birthday cake for George Washington all about how the um Hercules was a real person who was a slave to the Washington family um and there's the children's picture book and it said that his biggest problem that he had a was that he had run out of sugar to bill debate George Washington's cake", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TUC Radio", "city": "Middletown", "day": "15"}
