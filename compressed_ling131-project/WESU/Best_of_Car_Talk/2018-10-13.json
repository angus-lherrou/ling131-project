{"month": "10", "state": "CT", "station": "WESU", "content": "Oh\nThe ... World Trade center in Manhattan this is the New Yorker radiolab co production of the New Yorker\nWhen we first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen he was often said that Russia had hacked the election\nWe quickly learn to more specific more accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages on Facebook and so on\nBut they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems an altered the result not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be and you can say that lightly an existential threat to American democracy\nBut what we've learned since twenty sixteen is if somebody really did want to ... election it wouldn't be impossible not at all to help and has been writing for the New Yorker about election security in what she's found should scare us all Logan lamb\nIs a security researcher in Georgia I'm generally a curious guy I enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time in August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election he started poking around Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems\nWhich ran all the elections in Georgia\nOr in the course of doing that I did a very very simple Google Search um I did for the ... elections can solve dot edu or Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website\nAnd generally that turns up reports were public presentation\nAnd the the particular search\nDidn't turn that up in that I found a very curious link and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or name in some sort of identify her next to their name and I immediately thought while that seems a little strange and then\nAnd what he found in all of that data astonished him\nThese documents contain supervisor password to be used on election day\nThere were all the windows programs that are placed on electronic poll books\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected\nImmediately I thought to myself while this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server in total\nLamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems [noise] this by itself will be a huge story but on top of it lamb also found a security hole through which you can download the entire database of the state's six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their full name their address birthday last four\nDigits of their Social Security number and their driver's license number\nAnd then there were also Jim database and a gym database they're used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate or with the final vote count\nIs Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would have been a bonanza that is\nThe scariest scenario I could think of would be an attacker implanting malware on the programs that are placed on the electronic poll books were all terrain be voter registration databases disenfranchised voters\nAn attacker could have compromised the Web server than you did at the beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks [noise]\nThis is right around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system to protest\n\nIt wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally patched\nThen more information started to trickle out\n[noise] the intercept published the NSA report that had been hacked about Russian cyber attacks election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise]\n\nLook we have no idea of the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election system and twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know but this is a critical moment we know that foreign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms\nA few months ago the director of national intelligence that the warning lights are blinking red some states took this seriously but others seemed to have left themselves wide open\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand that they need to run elections that their authority but they're not cybersecurity experts Susan green hall is the policy director of a national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right\nUm so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere says the same machines are used a across the country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia are computerized touch screen voting machines Georgia is one of five states that entirely had machine that don't have a paper ballot and then there's also other machines which cow papers\nBy having the paper ballot it's so crucial because it is that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what's counted correctly\nElection security folks are on the ground and people who are the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet and I wonder if you just explain\nWhy it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWhile many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location whether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet\nIt how to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop or regular laptop computer that program here are the candidate here the races here's how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing the programming get infected with malicious software it it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that debunked that version which is that many of these machines that are in the polling location\nAre equipped with wireless modem to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night and those wireless mode and go over a cellular network and those cellular networks are part of the Internet\n[noise] we spend a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines were hacking\nWith the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio North Carolina and Georgia that purge voters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base [noise]\nPersonally this has been a concern for me because uh on election day and when he's sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names weren't on the voter rolls are they in German Kennedy used electronic pull books\nAnd people were showing up and they were being told you're at the wrong polling location or you've already voted during early voting or you already voted absentee or you name it than here or your address has been changed the vendor\nFor the electronic pool book was a vendor named the our system now the arts and had been targeted by a Russian intelligence spear phishing attack\nAnd um the state board of elections did their own investigation or at the county\nTo county report has been made public it wasn't very in depth that didn't consider a cyber attack 'em and concluded that it was a poll worker our malfunction [noise] but I think that's an open question as to what happened in North Carolina on election day\nAnother way\nI Need to know the play will there peas and need to know the world [noise]\nThis one nearly\n... I'm going on in the ...\n\nThing and all that oh\nSo long [noise] another\nAnother well\nBut otherwise yeah\nMhm\nThat's the beauty of beauty isn't that you do you ever you or you say you were texting within only about the songs that they do how much do cheese out what the song is about\nOh I didn't really dry I didn't need to I mean for me it for me it's mostly about climate change you know\nBut you've you've been through a certain number of political moments [laughter] sixties and in many moments in between ... and just how does this seem similar a different\n[noise] um it just I couldn't have dreamed up all the stuff I've been through and all the countries no dictatorships and ah you know I'm In through all that if somebody is hits said can you write a story about how bad can it get I couldn't have written it nor could anybody I Know\nThat it's just you know what we are facing in the administration is evil\nAnd it's it's cruel it's there's no empathy zero empathy so um it leaves you release me thinking how am I gonna conduct my life\nIt's you know it's the year the bully and um to bully people now seems to be okay the lying no problem no perjury yeah not a problem\nUm that that that is the new normal\nHow how does it change the texture of your life day to day waking up in the morning\nThe form of this terrible anxiety and you realize that it's real I mean it's not some neurotic anxiety [laughter] anxious about the state of the world which is terrible and so one thing is to one of my things I suggest spend a lot of time in denial\nThat the great advice yeah and um don't expect much time and keep the bar really low yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary ... forget which one it was\nBecause this scene appears in so many documentaries of using it the march on\nWashington and I I I just wonder how you visualize\nIn your mind moments like that in your life which are now distant and their iconic in the minds of other people but you were you're there you're holding the guitar you are in a microphone and it's kind of lousy sound system and seen it was a half million people or whatever it was do you think about these moments in your past and\nYou know I think as I get older sometimes I Do or somebody to show me a photograph I think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said um and sometimes going into a quote historic moment you know it and other times you don't know it\nUm in that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah yeah\nYou you mean there's some there's some terms that you're in the middle of an event that turns out to be iconic and you have no idea\nI think that of all a political moment\nYeah I'm just thinking about Woodstock and there was a little bit of both because I took the last ... and looking down and seeing these people are like and you know they're just jobs that people\nAnd so I had a hand then of that this is going to be something very big but it was after the fact that you realized oh my goodness that's made a dent in people's lives forever\nAnd in yours and mine yeah\nIt's not just days after the shooting to write about these families and these\nThese ... relatives of people who lost people in the church there in his in his slaughter and it it was extraordinary and then the funeral that followed um that President Obama a when too it seems like a million years ago it does the idea of a\nOf a president I'm capable of showing empathy just such a degree that\nNot only is the crowd with him and feel they feel like allies but he's able to sing the song I Begin the song yeah that lift people up as opposed to issue a tweet that depresses hello [laughter] um yeah how do you remember that\nThat terrible incident and why did you decide to I'm covered the so\nWell covering this song was a no brainer I mean it was whatever feelings I had them or in the future that song just dropped out of the sky is written by the way most offered I did not know and most people\nDidn't know and I need to tune that didn't get to Africa\nI mean if I Would Quaker tune you can only be knocking that guitar and you're killing I knock any or hearing loudly\nAnd just go ahead yeah okay Mm Mm\nMm\n[noise]\nYoung men came July ...\nThan they did\nNot have brought him [noise] he was not friend he was not keen by the tail\nJeeze that he's that with them many teams to print maybe but\nThen a young man do God and nine\nPeople weren't on yeah\n\n[noise] ... ...\nIn Charleston in the month of June Mm the mourners gathered in ... the president came to speak some were and the cameras roll and the nation on ...\nOne could say what must be said for all the living and\nSo on that day and then later\nPresident saying\nI'm raising gravy the president\nOh maybe ...\n...\n... ... ...\nWe argue lay the blame 'em one man's hang around age ... shame some sickness but the minute or so and how\nMight be made oh\nNo one could say what must be said and for all the living and they need\nTo go on that day and now that he's the president saying\nI'm raising ... my president\nYou know a ...\nWow yeah the last line is my president which is this just switch yeah for that President and vice president he says is the only president you felt of is in that way but\nUm yeah and I had to decide whether it's going to use that are not ... do we wrote it um my president I thought ... [laughter]\nAnd all of them they have to lie cheat and steal do all of 'em but yeah these states money was smart he was carrying in spite of whatever the wars were you know and there were some Afghanistan you know I'm border crossings [noise]\nUm a lot of it it was just somebody I liked I like\nUm ... uh yeah I met him\nIn the middle of a snowstorm and it was just ... and I went and I met him when I had was freezing out on my feet has shrunk\nEverybody else\nIn life grazed across to others [noise]\n\nHe was incredibly good looking\nHenry met his wife Joanne at a party in London in Nineteen eighty nine\nMost of my friends friends they are wild and we also that someone in special forces with very very glamorous than I Am actually I like contentious paper\nI think it's great talking to people who are adventure as\nHe had recently completed his election course for the special IRS service or if they ask a legendary elite commando unit\nIn many ways he and Joanna were opposite uh she hates\nThey shared similar sensibility\nReally was a tree romantic love to penetrate he loved uh he\nHe did tapestry\nHe gets the most wonderful tapestry\nTastes like just getting across the snow\nHe'd love to travel is old explore as then\nHe glamorize that lives that had\nA fit [noise] no no [noise]\n\nHenry worshipped Ernest Shackleton who in many ways that was a failure as and explore on his first expedition that he commanded himself he set out to reach the south pole with three other men\nThey got within Ninety seven miles nautical miles to the poll but he feared that if he kept going his men who were already fading would not make it back\nAnd forth for my\nDog\nAnd pony to decision that always the Amish to Henry worst plea\nHe decided to term\nThat we of it\nAnd on his other uh most famous expedition a Shackleton\nHad wanted to walk across Antarctica he thought it was the last great prize to be achieved but before even reached Antarctica ... ship or the difference that frozen in the eyes\nAnd Shackleton found him in all his men were ruined on an ice flow more than a hundred miles from the closest I've been with any contact with civilization\nWhat made it to amazing what she was able to guide all the men in his immediate party\nAnd get them back all home alive\nI can say I know that\nI was very interested as a version of it is your story ... ... cars are very very devoted expeditions\nHe began to burn with this very peculiar ambition which pretty future which was the kind of suffer these misery have become a polar explorer or on the model that he lived by with a Shackleton family motto which was by endurance we conquer\nI should have had warning bells when he came back from a trip to as Georgia just stuff Dr ... and was incredibly excited because he had managed to sleep beside Shackleton grave\nIt wasn't until\nWhen he was about four to say that he does it really talking about ... photo and Shackleton footsteps\nSo by the time or Henry was talking about doing his first expedition he had two children back at Elisa initially when he decided he wanted to do something that you know how many people say suddenly wait a second I Want to go walk to the south pole I'm\nA you know his kids were a little bit will dirt but a joy and it was very supportive\nBut it's about well huge believe as that and trying to fulfill dream and most of the time my ridge to you from fulfilling you're an individual dream\nBecause you feel you have to get permission from the other person and\nI felt that three my twenties I had fulfilled a lot of my dreams that had a lot of fun and he went in the army when he was Eighteen and I felt that it was his town really so for his third trip\nHe wanted to do it alone\nExcess Oprah's journey to me\nBut the one time about seven or on the trail or not I am\nEach day with similar I mean Henry would get up early in the morning hike up his lead that usually took about an hour as harness we'll be connected to the black eye and he will begin to haul it does not unlike a mule\nBluffing skiing for Ninety minutes taking a five minute break\nAnd he would walk with his keys burning as much as eight thousand calories than a day\nOr every craving food fish fry Banderas double statesmanship small chips potato exploiting\nHe will do this particularly in a time can challenge day after day there was something almost primal about it just cold warriors\nHis singular purpose became to just make his mileage you've had to achieve so many miles a day if he was the ultimately accomplished physical\nBond coal fields ... because I mean everybody in some say\nThe nine point seven million ... little hard won a credible longer today just ... miles of the funny\nThing everybody Twenty one and point ... was like this so called ... but she knows come all there's all I can do them I went to trial a day\nHe would track for fourteen Fifteen sometimes sixteen hours across an alien landscape is covered with a sheet of ice it's possible curve Austin\nFor actually Chochenoff facilities are always a good story it was a very tough day for this or and take a breath\nDuring the day and it was eleven and will set him but I checked again was twelve festival non\nNot enough [noise]\nI to to him I don't know it\nWell he was that that on the satellites that\nHe'd stand it much harder than other expeditions and at least if you're with other people you can take time to be at the front\nWhereas that feel the need scare\nCriticized miles [noise]\nHeath timed it could take my God [noise]\nHe felt the constant strain of making is mileage so that he could reach the end point of the expedition before the end of the month of January because in February begin the winter season in the dark to cope with the temperature drops even further it can reach a mine is a hundred degrees Fahrenheit\nEven A L e a shuts down then and at that point there would be no exit\nFuel off a little\nTown called it was sort of not being except the wheel which says to them old old man would have goals recognize those loans or jokingly\nOn getting your feet all day job but we'll which says July ... years old\nI listen to his blog every day and they were pretty good they were pretty out beat but uh I was just very concerned that was the ... miles on it\nShe could hear him growing more tired\nBut you wonder what she should do [noise]\nHe was alright constantly constantly that he was staying tonight [noise] I was in a terrible position as to whether to stay\nIn right to just a lesson from minute you know it's going to make and [noise] you cannot make the end or say\nHe'll do die [noise] to re and it difficult one [noise]\nMy tennis to say I'm sure we'll be fine [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Best of Car
