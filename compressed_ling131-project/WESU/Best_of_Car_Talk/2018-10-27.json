I wanted to be Dorothy hope\nYou're still mad about it\n[laughter] I'm I'm kind of deal but I understood it but it crushed me growing up it really crush me\nNow at what point did you think I can have a big life like something that's beyond being ...\nSomething larger than that\nI don't think I registered until I went to New York post high school I went to the American music on dramatics academy and I started to learn more and I started to grow and\nWhen I realized that there was more potential that I hadn't tapped into there was just an accident potential that was there and that led me to leave I left school because I realized that I wanted to tell\nFresher story we're heroes with utter Lauren Hill Lauren Hill was my biggest inspiration and I love Judy Garland arguing Judy Garland were were my my my hero look different performers why those two\nThey were women that I felt really use their voices you need to have a first of all unique tone\nUm and they just came across as strong I didn't know a whole lot about Judy Garland obviously I'm from Kansas and the wizard of Oz you know in her being in that um I felt like she was a dreamer and she was a strong woman I Know she had a complex life but Lauren Hill in particular I resonated with me as a black woman who\nDid an album and made a career\nFully being herself she did not shy away from her religious belief she didn't shy away from\n'em you know being a mom during a time where people say that she could not have a child who were ruined her career um she she was an actress she was an actor she was his finger ah she was a producer she was a poly math and that was how one model my career\n... ... ... what's your song from an early album is called violet stars happy hunting and this was from an album called metropolis the traits we [noise]\n\n\n\n\nYou know violated I haven't heard it in a long time now that sounds like something out of out of a musical is that what you said after right [noise]\nYes [noise] you know what well I wouldn't say a musical what I Want us to do was figure out how I could sing songs\nHalf concepts for them if I wanted to talk about science fiction which was a huge inspiration to me after I watched Fritz Lang Nineteen twenty seven German expressionist island found\nWhen I watched that metropolis Oh yes it it it is our all of my work really it was the birth of metropolis the rights that by the stars heavy hunting that we just heard but what I wanted to do is figure out how to you take\nHow can I take all of me onstage like am I Am theatrical I Love thing I Love ... love rock and roll 'em I Love you know dressing in black and white tuxedo to pay homage to my family I Love David Bowie I just got into bully at that time I loved pink Floyd the ... the wall I Love\nA

may weather ... not that you were hiding behind her but you were projecting this self which was um\nA a complicated thing which all that you were um why use her as it were instead of being yourself and as you are now in in the in the latest um dirty computer\nWas saying that Cindy Mayweather represented represented aspirations for me that's who I strive to be more like I'm not so she is in the future\nShe's able to master those\n... it so this is a ... a self critical expression by having an alter ego yeah somewhere absolute what were you being self critical about in your in your younger self\nWell my younger self I just felt a misunderstood a lot of people will call me weird they relied right oh that's not commercial enough they didn't under they just did not understand how they were going to market or what it was it I was doing and\nWhat do they want you to be [noise] I don't think it was about\nWanting me to be something I think it was really about not wanting to do the work in the development that it would take to figure out how to bring something new to the industry it was like the quick thing would be well\nYou know change your hair one change your outfit need is to actually be appealing a the songs also that you know they shouldn't be so then they should be more simple and acceptable and but\nThe temptation to fold must have been something financially and in terms of fame and all the things the rewards that the record industry can bring the temptation to kind of compromise a lot must have been significant\nOh yes oh my goodness are you kidding me I'd just been fired from Office Depot because I was responding back to one of our ah three fans that I had at the time I was thinking on the libraries that live in the house with six other girls in a boarding house um you know driving my Mitsubishi lot filling my CDs outta my trunk I needed\nWhat could have happened\nYou know thank you so much ... thank you for having me\n\nDirty computer is the title of
