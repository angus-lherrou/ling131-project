deal\nFirst of all um I Would clarify that we're not diagnosing judge Kavanaugh and uh we don't ah purport to be able to make any assessment other than we can\nThe letter itself was actually a\nWritten by a group of us and the national coalition of concerned mental health experts at the same group that are also called for an evaluation of the president [noise] um [noise]\nSome of the troubling signs that we saw were\nA poor regulation of emotion evasion of questions um exaggerated entitlement which actually make someone more likely to be capable of violating others right um other troubling signs that we've seen where paranoia\nConspiracy theories and an inability to have empathy for others um those are some of the sign that we feel as mental health professionals a it is our duty to call out signs that\nSigned that indicate possibly a troubling a condition on the part of a miniature\n... who is she\nSorry who um are we found how many people have signed onto this letter\nSo far about a hundred fifty has signed on a our group is actually quite large uh several thousand in number but ah it's often hard to get everyone mobilize within just a couple of days [noise] so ah we issued the letter\nI'm sent it out to the FBI to senators and\nUh to the media\nI Want to turn to judge Brett Kavanaugh giving part of his opening statement last Thursday obviously this was right after Dr block the Ford obviously enraged\nEffort as an actor\nGene election fear that has been unfairly stoked about more judicial record\nRevenge on behalf of the coins and millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition groups this is a circus\nI'd like to go back to judge Kavanaugh chairing last Thursday when democratic senator Amy Clovis your question him about his drinking she addressed revealed her father was an alcoholic and still goes to a at the age of Ninety\nWas there ever a time when you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened or part of what happened the night before\nSo I Know I remember what happened and I think you're probably a beer or um and so\nYou're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much but you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened\nIf you're asking about your blackout I don't know if you\nCould you answer the question judge it just to you that's not happened is that your answer\nJohn I'm curious if you have\nI have no drinking problem nor too are\nYour thoughts Dr bending lay on that interaction of judge Kavanaugh with a senator club sure\nWell denial deflection and annoying sat criticism about one's drinking are actually symptoms of alcohol use disorder it comes with psychological signs as well as the physiological dependence\nOn and and even just looking at him there are a sign such as drones Asia or reading at the central areas of his face um this does not mean that we can diagnose alcohol use disorder but\nUh but they certainly point\nMakes one a vulnerable to alcoholism later\nA later in life so it would be important to us just a whether he suffers from it and whether it it would affect his functioning\nAnd are you meeting would you just came from Washington recently\nUh recently yes I was invited to a speak about the twenty Fifth Amendment a immediately after some concerns that were raised a after the un press conference as well as\nUm uh there was the letter in the New York times by an an anonymous White House official and a and a Bob Woodward's new book\nA so for various reasons I was called by the Aspen Institute to speak about the twenty Fifth Amendment\nAnd we're going to get to the twenty Fifth Amendment in a moment um you are part of that movement um called duty to warn and if you can explain or you started it if you can explain what that is and how you feel about relevant and judge Kavanaugh case [noise]\nYes ah it's it's quite parallel to the concerns that we've had about the president in fact\nAh when the president was about to a issue or a or a nominate the Supreme Court nominee\nWe issued a letter to a Senate and a house members expressing our concern about the sign that the president was showing of you know a lack of a\nCapacity to make important decisions and and so we actually thought that it was\nIn judicious to allow\nA meeting and nothing really came of that that was actually a different group a group of prominent psychiatrists and myself\nUm but in terms of a duty to warn I Know there's a group out there that took the name and ah and call themselves duty to warn but but it came out of my conference which I organized a year and a half ago at Yale University yeah that's right\nOr about the ethical question of basically the the professional responsibility\nOf the importance of restricting what waste day which uh has revolved around the Goldwater rule with respect to a public figure\nAnd our societal responsibility to educate to promote public health and to warn when necessary and we came to the conclusion that there are instances where we do have a duty to warn in fact in psychiatry we have a duty to warn on a duty to protect when it comes to a patient\nAnd this team should also apply\nWith respect to society because the editor ethical guidelines make clear that we have a duty to patients and a separate duty to society um\nIf I may I'll I'll explain a little bit about the Goldwater rule which many have heard of a it has been\nAdult traded in a sense tune to mean prohibition only but uh the original Goldwater rule actually fall under the principle that we contribute to a the improvement of the community and the betterment of public health\nAnd so it's actually a mandate to act and explain who Goldwater rush the Goldwater rule came about because uh the psychiatric profession was embarrassed during the Nineteen sixty four\nThousands like high trust and about less than ten percent came back saying ah that Mr ... Goldwater was unfit to be president and gave all kinds of diagnoses and because of that the magazine was sued and they went out of business but the American Psychiatric Association\nBecause of the embarrassment to the profession decided to ah to instituted as a an ethical rule not to diagnose a public figure without\nA personal examination and without authorization which I actually agree with that it just falls along uh the general principles of good practice\nBut the Goldwater rule out the data says that one sure when you're asked about a public figure a educate the public just don't diagnose that is what it says and and under the principle that it falls that falls under\nIt's actually a mandate to act I'm not just a prohibition\nBut two months since the presidency ah two months after inauguration the American Psychiatric Association actually changed the meaning of the Goldwater rule\nNot just a ... diagnosis but to prohibit any comment whatsoever about a public figure under any circumstance even when the nation is thought to be in danger\n\nWe just sat in the ... here on democracy now I'm any good and then as Brett Kavanaugh object to being held accountable for his behavior and high school\nWe look at the criminalization of black and brown student that's led to what is known as the school to prison pipeline on Sunday California Governor Jerry Brown vetoed a bill\nThat would have expanded a state wide ban on suspension for students in kindergarten to third grade to include for through eighth graders the band focused on suspensions for quote disruption and defiance\nUh recent UCLA steady found black seventh and eighth graders lost nearly four times the number of school days to sex suspension than whites getting\nJust last week at ... school in Decatur, Georgia\nMother spoke to W. S. B. T. V.\nHas really shaken for the call she said that one teacher taught her up and the other ... and she's a mommy I was scared to kill you because I thought I was going to get in trouble for I Want them\nI Want them to not have any license to teach because they don't need to teach who would do this I mean were they like this to happen to their own kids\nWill for more we're joined by a roundtable community activists engaged in the fight to state schools and push for alternative to punish mentioned privatization their voices highlighted an incredible new book titled lift up don't push us out voices from the frontlines of the educational justice movement\nAnd Chicago G to brown joined us national director of the journey for justice isn't an education activists for the past quarter century in two thousand Fifteen he let a successful thirty four day hunger strike to ruin the closing of diet high school on Chicago's south side\nAnd Washington DC\nThat casts encourage a bar is cofounder of racial justice now field organizer for the dignity and schools campaign became active when her\nBlack son was repeatedly suspended in preschool in Dayton, Ohio she then campaign for dating public schools to adopt a moratorium on pre K. suspension\nHere in New York in ... and mark with us to restore it of justice coordinator in high school teacher and board member of teachers unite also with us mark Warren\nAll along with my brother journalist David Goodman coauthored lift up don't push us out which brings together these voices and many more markets professor of public policy and public affairs at the University of Massachusetts Boston founder and co chair of the urban research based Action Network we welcome you all to democracy now\nTo brown I Want to begin with you and positive that issue I'm Brett Kavanaugh and many\nHave there anything that involves at camp kid right that ... can you talk about\nWhat is happening to black and brown shell trying not sat down and sex texting energy I had four years old school\nAnd Amy thank you for having me on um I Would just say that we don't have a policy problem in public education we have a values problem\nThere the belief system that is rooted in the hatred of black and brown children that fuels education policy think that parents are the key here had to fight because her son was being suspended in preschool\nI've seen this story over and over again in Pittsburgh parents had to organize to stop the suspension of kindergarten through third graders I'm In New York this has been a fight in Chicago young people fought to adopt a top ten basic pensions and Chicago public schools\nIf the discipline policies are administered to live the hatred that they ... that often these policymakers would not apply to their own children\nUm and that's why the numbers are around the suspension of black brown and white students for the same infractions I so glaring that there is a belief system and and we know research says is first\nThat are that are black and brown children up new that's older than their white counterparts\nSo I think we have to challenge that and not just challenge that I'm strictly around discipline but outdoor around just to starving of neighborhood school I'm I've experienced in the journey for justice alliance a across the country a black and brown schools not having pre K. services\nBeen in the same city their white counterparts having a completely different experience\nNow we're we don't have any acrimony towards the baby that happened to be white or will be having a you know the thing they need but the fight should be to make sure that all children have with the not punish those schools will be star so along with the suspension policies\nBut policy of clothing garment you'll be closing schools\nThat's had a disastrous impact in our communities across the country\nAnd why don't you go now to cast Shankar at Jabbar hilly now in Washington state that I'm Talking about what happened cheer child on when he was four years old in Dayton, Ohio to care [noise] [noise]\nAmy thank you for having me on a yes I began organizing organically a as a parent pushing back ah when my son was actually three\nUm ah what is now known as a pre school to prison pipeline or as you mentioned and one of the things that I I did as a parent I'm you know not thinking initially that it was a ... a race issue or a class issue that I just question\nUm their their policy their practices or question what was the actual normal behavior for three year old to be exhibiting in a classroom or some of the things that they you know would complain about was you know oh he has problems you know transitioning or you know he's having temper tantrums into what I what I saw was happening\nAnd began to realize that there was a a pathology ... normal childhood behavior\nUh my son I then began to take a deeper look and um you don't notice that he was the only black boy a out of only two black students in a class of Nineteen um and then just overall a teacher representation or as well at the school was overwhelmingly white ministry\nA black women or black parents asked the\nAt the school if they were having similar experiences\nI'm In uh once I did that I you know went to my co founder of racial justice now professor of renew your Randall 'em and talk to her about what I was experiencing and that was basically how race will just as now was founded in her living room\nA saying that we needed to really have a response to this to organize and began to shift and change policies and practices\nOf how I'm young people particularly black students and our families um were being treated in the school at that time and so that has led to a deeper analysis and until just recently because of the work of working class a poor and working class black parents in the city of Dayton\nOhio just recently passed a law how to build three Eighteen\nUh to ban um most of out of school pre K through third grade so it's been since across the entire state and so that's a huge victory for a small organization a community based organization like racial justice now\nA in a very conservative they are like Ohio but it took years of organizing um and being supported by national organization like dignity and schools campaign and even journey for justice alive and being supportive\nOr on the ground to be able to get that get that work done and be able to give something so be accomplished in a very conservative state\nMark Warren you have written ... ... ... he's edited a book of essays that include our gas today\nOn TALK about the study has been done that show what happened in the pre school I mean it's hard to believe pre school to prison pipeline how I'm much more kids are just spend it what happened to them and they move through that\nSure um thank you for having us [noise] um\nSeeing as pushing them out of out of the classroom getting rid of the so called troublemakers\nAnd you know this start up a a train of labeling and you know harsh discipline that carries on through elementary school and into middle school and many studies have found that students who are repeatedly spend it in elementary and particularly middle school [noise] not very likely to fail", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "city": "Middletown", "day": "03"}
