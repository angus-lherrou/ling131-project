Do appreciate the call should do in attributing any blame at this point there's a lot of work for the FBI and other law enforcement partners do ah before we can do that um but obviously just look at the target list this sort of a prominent people in the in the recent culture wars\nAre and you I think what\nTroubles me is is how our perception of\n... a far right violence since I work these cases in the early Nineteen Ninety eight states to choose to law enforcement\nThe way that these groups were mobilizing and we saw that through a number of violent protests from\nAnaheim to Sacramento to Portland a poor Charlottesville and continuing right here in New York City um and and it just is troubling that law enforcement is just teeming now to get to understand that this is organized criminal

doesn't mention the targets are just to say that CNN which one of the targets that attacks the mania again\nRight and I do think again you know it's important to have cautioned we're very fortunate in this country that the terrorism is very rare rare\nUm and you know the connection between rhetoric and violence is not really a strong as a lot of people suggest but it's very different when it is an authority figure who seems to be shut sanctioning the violent\nAnd whether that as a matter of the police not responding to this kind of violence as aggressively as they do other kinds of political violence or certainly when\nA position in the ... in authority like President Trump is saying things that seemed to suggest to people that this is okay that the government's support cheer\nA violent activities when political parties are inviting\nThe far right fight club to to speak at events and to appear at events this is the kind of sanctioning that makes these groups much much more dangerous and my concern is now that we're starting to see a so some enforcement actions taken that these groups have have had two years to Oregon\nMike German what about these allegations have found that the far right conservatives talking about this being a false flag operation and if he could explain even what that means\nSure a false flag operation is when somebody a target or a specific entity that will automatically cause people to think it's their opponents that have\nEngaged in violence I think it's entirely irresponsible to be suggesting that and again only ramps up these culture wars a and would only encourage more violence in retaliation I mean one of the big problems you have after an event like this is not just all the false alarms\nUh and how easy it is to to trigger a false alarm if somebody wants to cause trouble\nUm by copycats and to the extent [noise] these groups are getting any kind of encouragement whether it's from the the figures of the culture wars certainly whether it's from the government figures authority figures\nAre ... the chances of seeing an increase in this kind of activity I think goes up ...\nWant to go to the conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh speaking yesterday\nWe have this series of bombs that were supposedly sent today exclusively to Democrats and it just there's a smell test that this stuff has to pass\nAnd so far a lot of people's noses are in the air not quite certain what to make this Republicans just don't do this kind of thing\nA professor paint Samy when he sang cast a Rush Limbaugh's comments we have no reason you might\nSay thanks for having me first of all of but it's incredibly irresponsible for folks to me touting his kind of ...\nTo suggest that doesn't pass the smell test them we're not I mean we're not sure exactly what that means um\nBut what this does is it it does further a much larger narrative that suggests that there is some kind of deep state conspiracy is trying to undermine\nA President Trump and is trying to ultimately a really just empower individual citizens that and it's a it's an idea that a stems from ideas about the second amendment trained to be abolished essentially so that people can harm and defend themselves and\nAnd it really is you know that this is really part of this larger kind of right wing conspiracy theories that have\nIncluded things like pizza gate and ultimately a you know when you have seen\nThat yeah the the false a contention that a pizzeria in Washington DC involved a child sex labor a ring that Hillary Clinton was involved with and ultimately lead one individual to to go there to investigate and open fire so\nYou know these kinds of a wild accusations involved these kind of conspiracy theories um\nYou know they're they're they they do a you know have an influence on people in a lot of different ways of old fortunately not not necessarily um directly lead to violence most of the time but but on on some occasions there do see a new seemed to be an influence in so words matter\nUh and especially people in authority positions they have more influence and and so uh you know I think there's just a real lack of responsibility when folks are touting these kinds of a wild theories\nTo turn now to a very big story here in Southern California the leader and the California Neal not the gang the rise above movement was arrested today

Angeles and San Diego has remained staunchly Republican for eighty years Orange County produce president Richard Nixon who was born here in New York Linda and retired San Clemente\nIn orange county last voted for a democratic a\nPrecedent in Nineteen\nThirty six with a with FDR but dissatisfaction with Donald Trump and changing demographics in the region have challenged Republican dominance in and around Orange County now Democrats are hoping that the mid term elections will turn Orange County blue\nDemocrats need to win twenty three Republican seats in November to regain control of the house of representatives and many of the tightest races um that couldn't determine\nHouse are in Southern California and California's forty eighth district longtime incumbent Republican congressmen Dana Rohrabacher\nIs battling to keep his seat after Thirty years in office were backwards and anti immigrant climate change skeptic who is known for his close ties to Russia\nClosely aligned with President Trump and his voted repeatedly to repeal Obamacare he said that people should be able to refuse to sell their homes to gay people and it's called California century law an invitation for

tight race in the thirty ninth congressional district Republican young chemists South Korean immigrant is running against Democrat\nGil Cisneros well for more we're joined\nThe weekly welcome to democracy now trucks for having me that I don't go through the left on a lot of focus more so than ever I mean this was definitely read country now is Orange County turning blue\nIt's a place where Reagan said all the good Republicans go to die and obviously anything wacky and horrible about Republican politics in the United states came from Orange County you can even draw direct line between Orange County and Donald Trump and so of course there's going to be a lot of attention paid can Orange County actually\nDeliver the white or Congress to the Democrats and I I still skeptical again born and raised here in orange county have been covering Orange County my entire up a career and so to think that we're actually at the at the cost of revolution I'm Still a skeptic\nSo talk about Dana Rohrabacher versus Harley road\nSo we got to remember the district and the main district split up between two cities Laguna Beach in Huntington Beach Luna beach\nBoth they're both on the coast both historical ah Laguna Beach in more hippie dip your whatever Huntington Beach though it's filled with a bunch of uh I don't know what if I could say it on the air but let's just say a bunch of racist and so\nThese are the people who have been electing Dana Rohrabacher for Thirty years and Dana Rohrabacher and be loving in his district all he has to do is just to go on a surfboard once a year\nHe calls himself the surfing congressmen and that's it hardly route a brand new millionaire was a Republican not too long ago so that said a lot of people do not like the ... so this district really depends on how many people like him versus how many people hate him but that said\nI Do not discount the fact that the ... the people who like Dana Rohrabacher are going to go out in droves just because they despise anything that even reeks of liberalism\nCan't talk about the political culture in orange county why answer Republican strong\nUsed to be all agriculture so used to be orange groves there's an orange to Orange County so the dots before the Nineteen fifties after the Nineteen fifties it becomes suburbia so you have to places where farming\nOur structure forever and ever all of that has slowly been changing it's still big parts of Orange County that remain that way it's it's like the deep south except we don't have African Americans we have Mexicans and especially where so close to the border so you just have a lot of race it a lot of middle class racism just building upon itself again and again so the Republicans were able to\nBuild this political dynasty and that said the Democrats ruled Orange County as recently as the Nineteen seventies\nYou had Democrats in Congress yeah Democrats on the board of supervisors the problem with those Democrats ... they were all corrupt and they all went to jail and so the Republicans came in there are smart enough to not put themselves in jail but they're still dominating all the local races in until now all the congressional\nRaces talking about the thirty ninth district where it is a hero of two people of color who are running against each other Republican young can Democrat guilt scenario\nSo that they're in a congressional district is going to be north east Orange County so we're talking about Fullerton Yorba Linda also a little bit of San Bernardino riverside county is a that was some parts working class a lot of parts wealthy more importantly it's about a third Latino a third of white and a third agent so very much you want to talk about the future of Orange County everyone hated than it's into the Dana Rohrabacher a\nRace but that's the one that really shows how Orange County is nowadays young came to longtime staffer for a long time congressman ed Royce who's retiring because he knew he wasn't gonna when former state assemblywoman then lost then became a state assemblywoman again\nAnd now she's running for Congress guilt is another one of these are\nFirst time candidate once Republican now a Democrat became a multimillionaire because he actually won the Powerball a couple of years ago so\nYoung Kim she's the one with the name recognition to the same thing how many people hate young horse he Trump versus how many people actually like kill I Can't really tell you many people who really truly like deal because no one knows who exactly he is\nBut this process to be ... it's close all around but you know this narrow says oh well known political activist and saying that and I I've been here\nAnd that this can come to Orange County the Democratic blue wave can come to Orange County again do not underestimate the ... and the horrible lists of Orange County voters until election day I'm not trusting anything I saw this as Democrats all the time and frankly the Democrats\nThey never expected to be here is that even for the past twenty five years and they had even expected hey maybe one day we could actually chose the Republicans they'd be at a much better position than they are right now to talk about\nThe growing Vietnamese American community I mean it's the largest Vietnamese community outside of Vietnam is that right yeah little Saigon around Westminster garden grove\nSon Donna up but it and it's interesting how these politics these demographic Baltics player in orange county because the Vietnamese community is still resolutely Republican there are a couple of Democrats out when we talk about Republican we're talking about Donald Trump supporting\nFlaming right wing whack job Republicans and so the running for city council there's a lot of attention being put the oh twenty eight of them are running this year and Thirteen of them have the same last name when he ha ha ha", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "year": "2018", "city":
