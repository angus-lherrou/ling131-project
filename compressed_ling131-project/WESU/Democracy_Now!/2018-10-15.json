Press investigation has revealed parents were deported from the U.S after being separated from their children\nMay lose their children to adoption without their knowledge the a P found holes in the system that allow for state judges to put children of deporting Central American immigrants in the custody of us families without notifying the parents\nMeanwhile a tent city in the desert outside El Paso Texas that was set up to hold migrant children has expanded its capacity by nearly ten times\nTell you immigrants' Rights Project the lead lawyer on the stand your national challenge to the Trump administration's family separation track that also presented the first challenge to President Trump's travel ban order known as a Muslim ban\nHis argument resulted in a nationwide injunction welcome back to democracy now so many great to have you with us we've been trying for a while I Know you've been traveling back and forth around the country particularly in California where you were intimately involved when the negotiation I'm Around getting the kid back\nTogether with their parents to meet the judges deadline right but many were not brought back we got to have and got them all back what are the numbers\nYou know the numbers are shifting because the government's numbers are shifting we believe there is somewhere between a hundred and two hundred kids who still needs to be reunited and that the crazy thing about it is that they're talking about a new family separation policy haven't even got\nAll the children are together from the for separation policy these kids are so traumatized little children are going to be a potentially permanently traumatized and now they're talking about having new family separation\nThere is going to be such an outcry just like there was the first time may be bigger we'll be back in court I mean I I cannot believe that they're actually talking about another family\nSo impossible to do it I mean after you have the judge's ruling they have to be reunited defying the court\nWhile as to what they're going to do is tweet gets a little bit and say this is different whatever they want to call it will be back in court\nAnd what about honesty is number ... ... thousand families right afraid\nWe have been concerned for a while that there may have been more families separated and the government was really I don't know whether I Am the numbers are exactly correct or not we'll ... we'll have to see what we're waiting for is the government to respond to all the government's doing a circus\nPacific sent and wait to see we have no reason to distrust amnesty is numbers but we'd like to see the government respond specifically to them\nAnd you talk about for example the hundreds several hundred children right now so where are they\nThey're in government facilities and the U.S the biggest ball what we've been fighting now for about eight weeks is they deported roughly four hundred parents without their children to those parents are all over the world largely in Central America so we have been trying to track those parents to find them to ask them\nWhat do you want to do these are legal options and I was in Guatemala a few weeks ago talking to some of the parents it's an agonizing decision because the government's saying we will bring the parents back we're going to still try and get the parents back but if they can't come back\nThey're having to make this brutal decision do I leave my child in the U.S to pursue asylum\nAnd keep them safe or do I bring them back and reunite them in about two thirds of the parents are leaving their children in the u._s. which goes to show you just how dangerous it is there and conservatives are saying well look these parents don't even care about their children they're abandoning\nNothing could be further from the truth when I looked in these parents eyes\nThey're such agony making this decision but they say to me I Can't bring my child back here it's just too dangerous I'm old my life's over farm killed I'm killed but I Can't bring my child back here\nI Want to go to the top health and Human Services who told lawmakers that it can be hearing that he

about the best interest of the child as well as about whether that will be operation Lisa portable with the ... we had\nDuring the hearing Connecticut democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal also question China than white about the psychological impact of separating children from their parents'\nSeparation of children from their parents until significant risk of harm to children\nWell it's traumatic for any child separated from his or her parents am I correct I say that as a parent of four children\nThere's no question there's no question that separation of children from parents until significant potential for traumatic psychological injury to the child\nJust by Jonathan white cat money a top official ... immigration and Customs Enforcement agency trying to defend the Trump administration's practice separating catch ... parents comparing that child detention facilities to summer camp and this is not all that had been forced removal operations for I\n... I think the best way to describe them is to be more like a summer camp these individuals have access to twenty four seven\nFood and water they have educational opportunities they have recreational opportunities bill structured as well as a unstructured there's basketball courts there's exercise classes or a soccer field that we put in there\nA veritable summer camp right I\nThink when we see the administration's own kids\nGoing to summer camps will know that there really is I work as but I'm so glad you played that clip of commander why talking about the trauma because in some ways\nIt's just starting the or the next phase is just starting these kids are so badly and the government's doing nothing to provide trauma really we're going to try to get doctors to see all these children pro bono\nBut the children I mean when I talked to a mother of foreign ten year old separated\nThe four year old just keeps asking now that the reunited are they going to come and take me away again I mean that's the vulnerability that's set in for all these children the government\nSo what they're they're basically saying oh you have a choice you can keep your child with you that in a century immigration jail\nOr you can lose your child your child go out I mean that's no choice at All right and so the government knows very well there were another choice which is to release the family under supervision even if they want to take the harsh step of putting your ankle bracelets on the Trump Administration are better than the ... the Obama administration's\nUse of a program that was Ninety seven percent effect diminish shoring appearance and now they're saying the only choice we have is to keep them in immigration jail or to separate that's absolutely wrong they can release these asylum seeking families under supervision\nWhat do they pay you are in Guatemala what are these kids and families face in why apparently make the excruciating decision to remain separated from their child um because they fear for their child to live\nI mean absolutely so take this one father we went to see we said we want to come see you will see anytime during the day that I Can't get off work with a farm come at night he said no ... closed down the title and have a curfew I'm not allowed out of my house\nYou certainly can come here I mean that's the kind of danger these families are in what what parent would willingly give up their child they're making the kind of decision that know parents should ever have to face\nSo you were in San Diego a lot of negotiating with the documented in court right and ending court right trying to meet that make the government meet the deadline to release than children the first that under five and then the others are going up and to their teen years\nUm what was in the government giving you and what can be even admitted now they didn't when it came to giving information that we connect the parents when they came to information in fact they had said you will look for yourself\nSo it was like pulling teeth every single step to the first step was look we\nSeparate them the judge said absolutely not his parents are not panic at their own children rather than when we say we can't find these parents without information they said no you go find them the judge said absolutely not it turns out that they get phone numbers for the parents were driving around Central America looking for the parents\nThey were sitting on the phone number is finally we have the phone numbers we're calling the parents\nAll but ten of the parents at least out of the last report have been reached but only because we of how to do this legwork\nWhat has to happen now like\nWell I think all the children have to come back we'd like to see the children get relief we'd like to see the children get fair asylum proceedings\nAnd we certainly don't want to see more separations and we don't want to see a substitute for family separations be long term indefinite detention these families the medical community said if you detain these families that will cause severe harm to the children long term ... we don't put four year olds in long term detention in this country", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "city": "Middletown", "day": "15"}
