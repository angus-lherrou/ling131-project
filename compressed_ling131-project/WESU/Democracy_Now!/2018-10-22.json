be dissidents Saudi voices on Twitter as part of the effort trolls would harass and silence critical voices including\n... post critical of Saudi Arabia is military attacks in Yemen would be reported is sensitive which can result in the post being removed by Twitter\nThe report also detailed the grooming of a Twitter employee Ali ...\nWho was convinced by the Saudis to access a number of target Twitter accounts all to borrow was fired by the tech giant and two thousand Fifteen\nAnd in New York Times reports the U.S consulting firm McKinsey and company carried out research that the Saudi Government used to target dissidents\nUs and European and Russian security\nAnd it does absolutely nothing to bring in Russia back into compliance with the treaty ah and it opens the door for Russia to deploy in greater numbers this missile of concern which is known as the nine and seven to nine if Russia wants to\nWhere we'll be gone and then Trump does uh you know if if Russia and China don't abide by the treaty or we're gonna have to build missiles of this type that kind of logic\nSimply doesn't make any any uh any sense given a few basic facts one is China wasn't party to the IMF treaty\nOr the U.S and in Russia have been ah the United states doesn't need a ground launched intermediate range missiles to deal with China in fact the vice chairman of joint chiefs of staff\nLast year said explicitly we do not need such missiles to counter China and\nThe only state doesn't have any such missile in development and there's no NATO country that would accept any such ground launch cruise missile\nOr to be deployed and their their territory the last time that happened back in Nineteen eighty three there were millions of Europeans in the street telling Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev to get rid of those those missiles so\nFor a number of reasons to counter productive in the dangerous and it does a open the door\nTo the possibility of renewed nuclear competition in this area and it could threaten another important treaty the new strategic arms treaty the main treaty limiting the two sides strategic arsenal which is due to expire in twenty Twenty one if Trump imprudent don't extend it\nWhat let's come back to the Nineteen eighties haven't found that when President Reagan and president Mikhail Gorbachev signed the intermediate range nuclear weapon treaty ins Reagan talked about the ...\nDemonstrate vicious [noise] on the show is over Fifteen hundred deployed war will be removed and all round\nIntermediate range missiles including the ashes sluggish will be destroyed our entire first\nEdition of missiles on both sides will also be\nA President Reagan speaking in Nineteen eighty seven about the importance of this agreement now you folks down about the fact that Russia was violating the treaty but Russia I don't know to the U.S of violating the treaty or is there any truth to that\nRussia has said they have deep concerns about whether the United states convert\nA defense of missile interceptors that are part of the U.S missile defense architecture that are now in Romania and will be in Poland for offensive purposes so they have a a said that that is a problem they have\nA it's a look if we look at the situation the United states has serious concerns about Russia's compliant\nAh the Russians have concerns about us future compliance or what it really ought to happen as there should be a arrangement by which there are trends parents they visit by technical experts to examine these missiles of concern and the two sides could conceivably work out an arrangement by which\nAre each side's concerns are are addressed and if Russia does have missiles\nThat can fly in excess of the the treaty limit\nOr they could be a called upon to stop deployment but they haven't the two sides haven't gotten this far there have not been discussions are at the detailed expert level\nAbout how to resolve that's in fact the only been to meetings on the IMF issue between us and Russian officials since Trump came into office\nMean can you talk about how many um [noise] uh how many weapons [noise] does the United states have how many does Russia have um is this just a gift to the weapons manufacturers just no holds barred\nYou know even though the Cold War is over so to speak or the weapons that were created during the Cold War still exist and the the nuclear strategies of the United states and Russia had at that time are still very much in place so\nAs we sit here this morning chatting about this uh the United states deploys about one thousand four hundred warheads on long range bombers and missile that on land and on the\nUh the Russians have equivalent numbers about eight hundred of those could be launched on an order from the president within about twenty minutes\nSo that means that both sides remain on hair trigger or if there is a warning of an attack\nOr the nuclear strategies call for um the immediate launch of eight hundred or more a nuclear warhead or in retaliation so that creates the chance for miscalculation so we have massive overkill\nOr we have a situation in which the fate of literally a hundreds of millions of people rest in in the hands of a of a small number of people specifically to a gentleman Trump and food and uh so\nUh we're talking about making the situation worse by removing one of the treaties that was negotiated in the eighties by none other than Ronald Reagan or that health and the Cold War so this does reopen the possibility of\nA a new arms race which of course would certainly benefit or the weapons contractors or that or would build or any any new weapons\nAnd you can I can count on the floor we conclude what state with a new start treaty and get that given indication that Trump will pull out in the Republican had been opposed to that as well\nWell uh yeah Bolton before he came into office he was he wanted to plotted I enough treaty here that are negative things about the new strategic arms reduction\nFive twenty Twenty one just a few days after the next ... inauguration day a Trump including could however agreed to extend it by five years along with the trends parents think verification provisions that are very important\nUm and right now John Bolton is leading an interagency review about whether to extend the treaty trash the treaty or try to renegotiate some new treaty and the the little amount of time left between now and twenty Twenty one\nSo you know if we if we look at this I enough decision I'm very worried that John Bolton is headed in the same direction with respect to the new start treaty and if that's the case we would not have legally binding limits on the world's two largest arsenals for the first time since Nineteen Seventy two\nSo it's very important for Congress or to step up\nA Republican or Democrat who support the new start treaty too proud a Trump to extend this treaty to bias the more time so that we can at least have these limits in place and pursue further negotiations with Russia or to further reduce the bloated and costly arsenals of these these two\nAnd finally we just have thirty seconds even though this is an agreement between the U.S or was and is it actually Trump saying we're pulling out meaning we have pulled out\nIts sell a message to China that President Trump is pending\nWell he may think so um I don't think the Chinese are particularly perturbed or you know China has most of its arsenal on ground launched missiles or with a a a medium or intermediate range just has to do with geography\nUm they're under no pressure to join the IMF treaty um and uh they have a relatively small about three hundred nuclear weapons arsenals that they feel is sufficient to deter the United states so he may think he's sending a message to sign up but I don't think it's\nBetween John Bolton and the Russians today in Moscow I think will be key\nUh it is not clear whether a Trump is actually pulling out or it may be that they're trying to threaten that they will pull out if Russia doesn't do something in particular\nThat's not clear ah my Russian contacts has not yet heard anything like that our European allies have not heard anything like that but I think it's quite likely if we remain on the current track that the INS treaty will be terminated by Donald Trump sometime in twenty Nineteen\n... thank you for being with us director the arms control says previous Les ... nuclear dangers\nDemocracy now democracy now for the war and peace in front of course we'll continue to report

say these lip function to people of course they exist\nBut if the other argument to puts forward than perhaps people who aren't persuaded of this will be persuaded\nThink the concern is that we're hearing a debate about ... existence that not being led by trans people and do much of what we're seeing is an understanding of transmit that\nReally in trenches that notion that there's some biological truth to that and something else that's ideological called gender and that really is a false dichotomy and what we're seeing is that by\nBy saying that there's something called science

the men have certain body but it's a political choice to make that definitional to say men have to have certain bodies are in order to be men and I think what we have to understand is that\nThese are political choices that are part of a long legacy that is very much connected colonialism white supremacy and efforts to exclude people from participation in where I think is the best place to get information on transition\nI think the best place to get information on trans issue it's from trans people so we can look at publications that have trans writers whether that broadly I invite them ...
