because the activists had not intended to damage the pipeline this is Emily knows but Johnston speaking just after quit on felony charges Tuesday\nI'm very relieved the state of Minnesota acknowledge that we can do damage and no damage\nA I also admit that I Am disappointed that we did not get to put on trial that we hope that we very much wanted everyone to be able to here's the for the jurors to be able to hear from our expert witnesses uh we did this action to almost two years ago to the day on Thursday will be a second anniversary\nBecause the problem of climate change is so or just that we have to start cutting the tar sands pipelines down now\nLater in the broadcasts will go to Minnesota to speak with two of the valve Turner's their attorney and former not a climate scientist James Hansen\nIn immigration news and Associated Press investigation has revealed parents deported from the U.S may lose their children to adoption without their knowledge\nThe a P found holes in the system allowing for state judges to put children of deported Central American immigrants in the custody of us families\nThis could also affect immigrants who crossed the border during the Trump administration's zero tolerance policy which routinely separated parents from their children as they enter the United states\nAnd appeals court has sided with a federal judge has ordered the commerce secretary Wilbur Ross shouldn't be deposed over his role in adding a citizenship question to the twenty twenty cents is\nThe addition of the question is caused widespread condemnation by immigrant rights activists who say it will deter immigrants from participating in the census and could help Republicans win more congressional seat last month Mother Jones reported Wilbur Ross lied under oath\nAlso interesting that timing uh she just said I mean they were saying that it didn't they didn't want to look like after the midterm elections but they say that last week the resignation letter was put in which was right after I'm a judge Kavanaugh at the time testified\nThan the Trump Administration around that um she didn't say anything about that at the time but of course if she ran in the future she could refer back to the period of time that she actually resigned\nRight and she just sort of self from the president during the campaign by saying any allegations by women should or should be heard and to be investigated so she's a very ambitious woman if she's planning Iran should Trump not run again and twenty twenty or twenty twenty four this throughout perfectly I mean it it's it's perfectly that\nThe the ambitious calculating nature of the truth or show at the un and in South Carolina\nI wanted to go back to um\nNikki Haley said sitting next to President Trump and the White House um about her relationship with both Trump's daughter Ivanka and son in law Jared Kushner during the news conference she's single them out for praise\nJared is such a\nGenius that no one understands I mean to redo the NAFTA deal the way I'm what I've done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so unbelievably well done an office in just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the scenes\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're a better country because they're in this administration\nThat with Nikki Haley again speaking in the oval office next to President Trump talking about Jared Kushner um this is your expert teacher a Palestinian American professor or the Edwards professor at\nColumbia University um talk about Jared Kushner and what she described it is remarkable are incredible role in uh\nIn dealing with the middle east\nWill you would only consider remarkable if you think the denying that the Palestinians\nJerusalem is the capital and should be a capital for Palestine [noise] um the policies that she has put forward it advocated so effectively in particularly uh our policies that are\nAbhorrent to most of the world most of the Arab world many Israelis are realized that this is leading them down the path a to a situation where no compromise is possible\nWhere Israel become a the golden rule of everything um and Trump seems to be very content with the\nUh the Palestinians are should accept whatever replaces offered to them in the process and that is what does what Christian or has been doing systematically on Jerusalem on refugees on the idea of a Palestinian state um they have dismantled all all the elements of what I've always considered a very bad American policy has become much worst\nOf times to her so Jared Kushner is a genius\nIf you believe that Israel has one and can impose any terms at once on the Palestinians who should not have sovereignty self determination statehood if you believe that and it's a wonderful ball\nOn may fourteen the Israeli military massacred late sixty one unarmed Palestinians wounded and this one day twenty seven hundred more for protesting in God's against the Israeli occupation in the opening of the new U.S tend to stay in Jerusalem at\nThe United nations US ambassador Nikki Haley blocked up call for an international investigation into Israel to action\nI asked my colleagues here in the Security Council who among us would accept this type of activity on your border known one with no country in this chamber would act with more restraint than Israel has\nSince March thirty at the beginning of that right of return campaign protest on Israeli soldiers and snipers have killed at least on an area of one hundred Ninety five Palestinians wanted more\nThat shot thousands of people\nOn the other side of the border in a situation in which none of its own citizens were hurt one Israeli soldier actually was killed\nBut without exception would be would be free of condemnation in the United nations imagine if the United states shot down hundreds of Mexicans killed two hundred and ... wounded or maimed thousands across the border inside Mexico\nIn the sovereign territory of another country it would be completely unacceptable the Palestinian clearly don't have rights they can be the victim can be vilified by people like Nikki Haley but it's revolting\nAt the very the very the very description of the Palestinians as the aggressors and the Israelis are the victims Israeli snipers are targeting these people one by one\nAnd the Israelis are being defended by Nikki Haley at the United nations\nJust before the U.N General assembly denounced Washington ... station to move it to end the in Israel to Jerusalem\nA new U.S ambassador Haley tweeted a warning to other nations she wrote quote\nAt the un were always has to do more and more so when we make a decision at the will of the American people about where to locate are and say we don't expect that at least we helped to target us on Thursday there'll be a vote criticized in our choice the U.S will be taking names the ambassador famously that professor housing\nI mean this is the most vibrant expression of American exceptionalism I've I've ever heard um the United states is not bound by law the United states is not bound by convention the United states does exactly as it pleases the issue of Jerusalem is a\nComplicated legal issue but it's not that complicated everything United States has done his credit or seven decades and it's like a little more of international consensus uh as far as the treatment of Jerusalem and they don't care a lot of the United states under Trump but at the United states has always done more or less\nAmbassador to the United nations Nikki Haley um I\nHad to say the least Ben whatever's happening behind the scenes in lockstep with uh the administration she announced in June or that the United states was withdrawing from the un human rights council accusing the council's being biased against Israel\nFor too long to human rights council has been a protector of human rights abusers and that's full of political bias regrettably it is now clear that our call for reform\nWas not hated the significance of this\nWell you're young you know the the the proclaiming but only its views count um the views of the entire world on these issues um um or or simply irrelevant as far as the solution is concerned\nThat has run interference for Israel protecting it in the United nations of production now um and I expect that to continue a irrespective of whether Trump stays on after twenty twenty unfortunately but this is the most egregious example that I've ever seen\n'em I Want to go back um to John Bolton they could tease the powerhouse there now um last month the national security adviser announced the Trump Administration would close the Palestine liberation organization mission and Washington in response to a Palestinian effort to push the I said the the international\nCriminal court to investigate Israel for war crimes this is both making the announcement and speech at the federalist society\nTrump administrator should will not keep the office to open when the Palestinians refused to take steps to start direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel\nThe United states supports direct and robust peace process and we will not allow the eyes to see or any other organization to constrain Israel's right to self defense\nAt the ... going to a close watch shows that are and what is the technical stuff that\n... it's once again ... ... ... ... a diminution of the idea that the Palestinians can speak for themselves permission to married that they can have a voice in Washington that they can that they are a party to the conflict in fact there was a main part in this conflict and what the United States and Israel has had been doing\nIs to sideline the weaken them divide them\nUh and and and essentially tried to dictate terms and this is part of the whole a whole process ... taken to a new level of knocking out the pillars that have formally been assumed to be absolutely essential for for any any approach to peace in in Palestine refugees Jerusalem\nRecognition of Palestinian self determination\nNot talking about refugees the Trump Administration sat in September would end all us funding for ... the un agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinians the move is seen as an effort to undermine Palestinians right to return to lands that were ... plants from by Israeli settlers that she's Palestinian

three anti pipeline activist who broke into an oil pipeline facility intending to cut off the flow of tar sands oil coming into the United states from Canada\nThe so called vowels Turner's Annette clap Stein and Emily Johnston along the support person Benjamin ...\nAre part of the group climate direct action\nThe activists mounted a coordinated campaign on October eleventh two thousand sixteen and which they cut trains and turn the manual safety valves just stop the flow of oil through the Enbridge energy pipelines and four locations this is ...\nCalling and bridge from the valves site to warn them of the action\nDrunk or ... we're going runner in Minnesota and\nWarned them from orange born seven miles from the verbal version one majority\nGoing to be on the phone and we're losing so dumb that you want to know\nYour journey\nThat was ... in a clip from the film without Turner says she called Enbridge energy and all ten and all ten people were arrested as part of the campaign that's similar actions in North Dakota Montana and Washington state\nThree other defendants who took part in the effort have lost their cases in faith short that in that community service mandates and deferred and present the Minnesota case with the first and only of the four valves Turner cases where a judge allowed the defendants to\nUse the necessity defense the activists say their decision to break the law with necessitate by the clear and present danger posed by climate change later the judge ruled expert witnesses including three fifty dark founder Bill McKibben and former top notch a climate scientist James Hansen would not be allowed to testify on their behalf\nThat the defendant Emily Johnston speaking after her acquittal Tuesday\nTime very relieved the state of Minnesota acknowledge that we can do damage to the end of this no damage a I also admit that I Am disappointed that we did not get to put on trial that we hope for that we very much wanted everyone to be able to hear the for the jurors to be able to hear from our expert witnesses uh we did this action\nTo almost two years ago to the day on Thursday will be a second anniversary\nBecause the problem of climate change is so urgent that we have to start shutting down ... down now\nThe trial came just as the United nations climate panel warned in a landmark report that humanity has only a dozen years to mitigate climate change your face global catastrophe\nFor more we go to Minneapolis where we are joined by valve Turner's Annette clapped dining Emily Johnston as well as Dr James Pants and the former top climate scientist at NASA now the director of climate science awareness\nIs that the defense she's also executive director of the climate defense project\nWelcome you all to democracy now let's begin with a valve Turner's 'em yourselves Emily and Annette Emily begin by talking about the significance of you were acquittal but first what exactly you did in October two years ago\n[noise] um thank you Amy so we entered a we broke the links to a couple of chains uh enter enter into the enclosures where the pipelines uh\nWe were with their vows uh we began to shut off one of those vows had but we had made to safety calls in advance so that I find companies could shut them down or mostly if they if they just chose to and we knew that that was actually standard procedure [noise] um and they did in fact are doing that shortly thereafter\nAnd Emily John ... rather clocks diner why did you decide to do that\nUh we decided to do this because tar sands are the dirty is [noise] and ah most climate polluting oil that there is [noise]\nUm and does Dr he'll come home the you know it's game over for the climate if these are developed so we wanted to shut them down um because they absolutely\nHave to be shut down if we do have a chance of having our children and future generations have habitable planet\nCan you talk about your role as a retired attorney um and a raging granny I'm quoting\nYou represent\nWho do I represent you know as an attorney\n[noise] oh I was staff attorney for the pure all up and then try for Twenty one years I retired in two thousand five\nAnd did some of your work there and form what you did hear\nHeart of the spiritual cultural and economic life of the northwest tribes\nAnd um the salmon or now endangered almost everywhere in part because of climate change we have the issue of the streams and rivers where the family bond becoming too warm for them to do that and we have a number of famine rooms that are endangered\n'em and threatened and in a couple of cases extinct\nJohnston you kind of CERN about facing terrorism charges explain exactly what you faced in what you um you were acquitted but what you were confronting in terms of prison sentences and your other colleagues or ... Turner's another state [noise]\nYes so we know when we plan this action that we would be open to all kinds of homeland security charges and and potentially federal charges um and ... statutes that were developed after nine eleven or\nAround the energy infrastructure uh so we went into this with our eyes wide open a and in fact the charge that uh that we received a main charge 'em was was one of those statutes um [noise]\nYou know in a way I think that was a oddly lucky because uh he was overreach and\nThing or something else because they win or something that they probably couldn't support that explains what happened\n... Kelly Kelsey Skaggs or you're an attorney for the vowels Turner's were you surprised by what transpired first the judge ruled\nIndigenous people's day uh Columbus Day on Monday that they could not have their um expert witnesses talking about climate change like building a Kevin at three fifty dot org and like our next guest will talk to Dr James Hansen\nUm we received a ruling in this case a year ago allowing us to present the climate necessity defense um which would include expert testimony as you mentioned um and then the last minute ruling a really rural that back\nAnd excluded much of the expert testimony that we had prepared a that seem to to be directly contradictory to the year old ruling in this case um so we were very surprised by that\nUh and disappointed uh in terms of the acquittal of it is it's procedurally quite rare\nFor a judge to a a quick clients at that state of the case in our criminal legal system the state has to prove what the defendants did and this judge's decision to acquit\nEarly on in the case uh meant that it didn't even go to the jury because the judge determined that no jury could reasonably convict 'em", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "city": "Middletown", "day": "10"}
