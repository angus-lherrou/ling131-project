time so we she said well some of that I should go to consider flake of it and we did um I I had been in front of\nThem that are flakes often on Monday and they were the first time that I had to tell my story of um of survival\nAnd um it seemed important to me to go back and try to talk to him I did not think that we were going to find him I did not think that we were really going to be able to have the interaction with him a but I'm an organizer and I know that we have to fight the fight up until\nReaction that people are singing and the elevator is the reaction of my and I just finding out that he issued a statement and he was ready to vote for Brett Kavanaugh\nEven after hearing the very powerful and got wrenching testimony of Dr Blass before it or who do it in front of him and all the Republican men and the Democratic senators\nTo share her story because she felt compelled\nAh I I did it the uh the ... to it she felt compelled to share her story to protect her country um I felt

rights and civil rights on eligibility cue equality and I do not when my children to have fewer rights and I have right now\nSo explain what happened when he went into the elevator when you spotted him um there were some reporters standing around on the door of his office they spotted him first and they ran behind him\nMaybe in Iran behind them and you know Maria before I did not know Maria which had just met I didn't know her story she I knew we were she was telling me that it was her first time trying to talk to a an elected officials so I was giving her tips like you can share your story tell them what you were\nThere um and um we just ran into the [laughter] and put I just put our foot and the door as good with clothing and then just stayed there and um the adrenalin of running behind him at\nThe fact that we knew that these we just had a few minutes um we use those minutes in the best way we could we I think without really wouldn't be talking about and we were really demanding a connection we're really asking him to be\nAnd so you told him you are sexually assaulted\nI I said to him and that are like you did just a few days ago I stood in front of your office and for the first time shared my story of sexual assault [noise]\nUm I did it because they recognize myself my own experience in Dr Ford testimony um and I I I Want to I Want to know what you know what are you one message are you planning to your children and my children\nUm do you think it's a ... are you comfortable with the idea of putting someone who's been accused of sexual assault in the court for the Next Fifty years and we're both of our children to grow up in the country\nSo you are also trust publicly talking about\nYour sexual assault and you have a national cameras on you\nAnd how'd you told your family that\nI had not told my father I'm so immediately after that interaction I texted him and I bet\nYou're going to hear something that we haven't talked about I Want you to know that I Am okay um and the reason why I didn't tell him all for more than Thirty years [noise] um because they didn't want him to feel pain I didn't want him to\nA few like keeping protect me I'm the same reason they took me many years more than ten years before I told my mother\nAnd allegations made by Dr Christine Blasey Ford that cabin are tempted to re print Nineteen eighty two but Democrats say the FBI's probe is too limited critics take half an hour committed perjury lying during his testimony friend of Kavanaugh's from yell\nHas accused him of lying about his drinking habits in college\nIn testimony sworn testimony\nCharles ... said quote when Brett got drunk he was often belligerent and aggressive on one of the last occasions I purposely socialized with bread I wouldn't

number of Kavanaugh's roommates uh classmates at Yale have\nTom ... should call for fellow graduates to come forward if they if information about any sexual assaults possibly committed by the Supreme Court nominees sang in a petition please do not remain silent even speaking out comes at some personal cost\nBefore you go to Washington DC where we are joined by Lisa grey co director of documented which investigates corporate influence on democracy\nLisa welcome back to democracy now can you talk about\nWhat is the scope of this FBI investigation President Trump says it will only be a week the White House controls that though the information is given to the Senate explain who's being talked to who is not New Yorkers reporting that the third woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh\nJulie sweat neck has not been contacted though Debbie Ramirez says he'll classmate says he pushed his genitals and her face his naked generals she has been contacted a\nI think we're seeing a lot of conflicting reports but it's very troubling what's emerging what we saw on Friday after the elevator confrontation was thought agreement between Democrats or Republicans that there would be actual due diligence that there would be an investigation into the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh and that would of course include\nInterviewing the witnesses Dr Ford um and the other two women um it would also include interviewing people who are whose evidence who's testimony could support them or not support that it would also include\nInterviewing Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI what we're hearing is that uh the White House counsel McGahn has somehow put limits on who the FBI can interview and made it very a very small number of people that's ridiculous that's absurd that's not the way these\nSupplemental background investigations proceed and it's not a real investigation if it turns out that that's what's happened that they've tried to whitewash this by interviewing only a couple of people a justice will not be served and this will be basically a whitewash I'm sort of ...\nWhat happened on friday was a recognition that more needs to be known about Brett Kavanaugh before he is given this sort of lifetime position I think there's ample evidence that he lied I think he lied\nIn his testimony on Thursday um but you know the FBI should not be constrained by whatever limits the White House wants to impose because the White House wants to get Brett Kavanaugh on the court in fact that the White House had its way he'd be on that he'd be confirmed today\nLisa you said that we shouldn't be talking about ... sauce denial she said he lied on Thursday judge Kavanaugh lied on Thursday under oath explain\nI think that there will two parts of that one is you know the the the conversation nationally in some parts has been on this notion that women make false accusations exceedingly rare the actual probability in our country or just based on history or in recent history in particular as well is that\nWhen men are accused of attempted rape of rape of sexual harassment they deny it they falsely deny it that's the norm that's what usually happens sometimes they fall asleep at night with anger\nSometimes they fall asleep deny it through lawyers um but that's usually what happens women come forward bravely tell their stories and men deny it and that's what we saw on friday I'm\nA that this the to statement of Brett Kavanaugh was appalling the idea that he would attack those senators for daring to investigate a credible\nAllegation of of attempted rape is absurd and in fact it's more than a credible allegation what we saw was compelling consistent eyewitness testimony from Dr Ford that should be fully credited\nWhat Brett Kavanaugh offered was anger anger isn't evidence of innocence it's certainly not evidence that we're ... the consistent and compelling testimony of Dr Ford and in fact what you saw Brett Kavanaugh do was the symbol yet again about his history about\nThe other people who she says was there were there didn't denied it in fact most of them said they didn't remember it which is fully consistent with her statement it wasn't significant for them it was significant for her\nUm but that's not the only time in which Brett Kavanaugh alive he I I Believe lied in his earlier testimony in ... in two thousand four and two thousand six and earlier this month about a number of matters including his role in receiving stolen confidential information if when she was stolen from the United States Senate\nAbout judicial nominations and lying about his role in those additional nominations I think that this man Brett Kavanaugh tells lies big and small he's unfit for the bench he's certainly unfit to be always say Supreme Court and I've called for him to be impeached not promoted but\nActually impeached so you're saying you're talking about impeach right now I'm from uh at the federal court judge\nWhat I'm saying is that is that I think that that should be the conversation I think that there is ample evidence for the house to begin an investigation or an impeachment would begin in the house not the Senate that's the procedure on our constitution I don't know how long that sort of inquiry would take\nBut they're certainly ample evidence that Brett Kavanaugh has been on truthful to the Senate that he lied under oath that he's misled the Senate\nEvery single time he testified he has testified falsely in my view his statements have been contradicted by evidence in two thousand for two thousand six earlier this month in ... in twenty Eighteen and just this past week\nI Want to get to those issues that you've raised before you were a top aide to Senator Leahy when you're talking about uh you believe Brett Kavanaugh I'm
