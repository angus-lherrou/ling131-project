and if you could maybe ... some of those that do\nBut what the what the house of representatives have the power to do\nAnd we and the Senate can cut off these arms sales and it's very important that the president is peddling fall so it's in the correct the record it's not as if Saudi Arabia can go and suddenly\nBy aircrafts or a tanks from Russia it would take decades for them to switch there are so dependent on us technology would be as if you had an iPhone and an apple computer suddenly you couldn't go switch to windows\nOr they're these things aren't are transferable and the president knows this he knows that if we weren't to cut off\nThe arms sales the Saudis wouldn't be able to quickly switched to Russia or China and it wasn't really a cart their efforts in Yemen and the reality is it's a Lockheed Martin rain the on the bombs that are being found in Yemen are responsible for the death of children and women\nDollar economy uh is not a significant detriment to the United states I don't think there's a single American citizen who would say that we should be aiding the Saudis and killing women and children or for a hundred billion dollars but that's a price worth paying\n'em in

Henrietta Lacks' cells are to the contribution of science contribution she did not know she was making at the time\nYeah I mean there isn't a person out there who hasn't benefitted in numerous ways from the cells um you know at the vaccines that we all get\nWere developed using her cells they were the first genes with some of the first ever sequenced um they went up in the space to be it would happen to human cells in zero gravity in vitro fertilization was developed with the help of her cells I mean just the list goes on and on and on it's just I'm kind of inconceivable\nHow about ... Henrietta Lacks' cells the heel of line what is it about her cells I mean she had cervical cancer\nYeah so these are her ... her cancer cells and she had an incredibly aggressive cancer that grew sort of unlike many cancers it went from a tiny tumor on her cervix to just within a few months or tumors covering every oriented her body um\nWe're seeing in the labs and kind of hasn't been seen seen since\nAnd so what did Johns Hopkins do how did they realize that and then how did they start how did they take the cells and what happened to them [noise]\nYeah so they didn't realize anything I mean she just happened to walk into Hopkins in the fifties at a time when scientists all around the world we're trying to grow human cells outside the body and it had never worked and\nSo at Hawkins there was one of the leading tissue culture researchers who was kind of at the head of the field and he was taking samples from anyone he could get his hands on any patients who walked into the hospital himself his kids as friends\nAnd basically it was just trying to grow and he so he could and so it really was this kind of chance confluence of events that Henrietta with incredible cancer arrived at the location where this man had been trying to do this for so long\nSo it wasn't that they targeted her that they said oh her skills are interesting she just went in for a routine by a biopsy of her tumor and they just took an extra little piece and put that in a dish\nOn and that's what became the cell line and and that she never knew about\nBut they did and they knew how valuable it was so they didn't tell her she died and they didn't tell her family is that right in fact they understood that they wanted information from her family as well um their genes as well actually\nThey didn't yeah they didn't know these were going to be valuable so at the time we didn't know anything about cells they were just trying to cure cancer there like if we can grow cancer cells outside the body maybe we can figure out why it's so powerful\nThey had no concept there was no industry connected to any of this or biology really in general they hadn't DNA hadn't been discovered yet so we couldn't know that some day they'd be able to look in these cells and learn about our family so it's important to look at this story within the context of history in that way that they they really had no idea what they were potentially discovering\nI'm more of that there was a potentially any gain in it\nYou know ... ... genome sequencing was starting and um and what they wanted to do was look at some of her family her family member cells and their genes and it was in order to learn more about the cells there was no financial interest at that point there wasn't someone saying oh we can make a bunch of money if we take samples were family it wasn't that at all\nBut they went back to her kids at that point because there were things they needed to know about human cells that they want him to be able to learn about her genes um in order to do that\nAnd did they explain this to the lacks family as they were All right doing experimentation on that\nYeah no and that's that's the key I mean there's sort of several big ethical moments in the story and the first is in the fifties they took these samples without her knowledge you know should we do that should we not that was the fifties and then in the seventies\nUm when they went back to her family it was it raises these other questions about what should you should people have to be told that when they're kind of researchers of going back to them and asking for more samples", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "city": "Middletown", "day": "12"}
