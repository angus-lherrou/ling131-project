we've put in action plans and we're working with community leaders to begin to look at how this can never happen again in our community how do we avoid these types of things\nAnd so as a community we're very resilient we're very focused and we have a plan in place to be able to execute that this won't happen again\n[noise] uh well a representative Scott I Want to see if you are if you agree with the assessment on forever and James and also if you could talk about this whole issue of the of the blue lives matter legislation that went through the uh the legislature\nWe have to make sure that we have honest conversations about what got us here and when we have a political system that passes hateful legislation when we have\nA societal I issues around comments that have made whether you're calling out black kids pumps that dies or whether you're passing legislation like the ...\nDo ah if you were first responder including law enforcement\nUh that sends a clear message across Kentucky about whose lives really do matter and then this year passing a so called gang bill that we saw Mississippi in eight years since it's been passed it only black people have received an enhanced sentence from that gang bill to support it and then pass that bill here in Kentucky\nSays a message across our black communities in other communities of color that you are under attack by her own elected officials at the local and state level and we have to have those conversations that say wait a minute what are we doing to make sure that we're looking\nTo restore people to their fullness rather than to incarcerate them so that we can justify building more prisons\nI wanted to I'm correct we said the St Louis police chief but at the Jefferson town police chief Sam Rogers I'm a ... we had said the ... police chief but the Jefferson town police chief Sam Rogers to\nI'm told the first Baptist church on Sunday that the shooting was motivated by racism was a hate crime um can you talk I'm Reverend James about\nUh the feelings right now and inside the church that Bush apparently tried to get into your the Reverend of another church or how\nChurches yelling right now um and also this being\nThe one\nOf a series of attacks that week I mean you have this man allegedly saying\nUm to a white man standing outside with a gun outside kroger's why don't kill whites like saying don't kill me I'm or he's not going to kill him\nAnd then you have the um letter bombs now apparently Fifteen of them sent out to people who are critics of President Trump and then of course the horrific\nUm synagogue a massacre that took place\nThe anti genetic shooter who also linked I'm I'm Jewish groups helping immigrants and his fears anti immigrant a hatred\nYeah says it's that it's very sad time in our country and when we have these types of acts of hatred in our communities and in our churches and synagogues\nAnd mosques when you think about all that is taking place across the country but one of the things\nThat people of faith recognize the fact that these challenges are written in the holy word that these things were to come and so one of the things in terms of what we find and what we see as faith leaders ask community leaders\nIs that it is our faith that really drives us beyond and what we see and what we experienced to hope that we know that with people coming together and staying together that we can change\nWe have to realize and know that we this is not a time to turn on each other but at the time to turn to each other\nAnd so what I've seen across the faith community talking with all kinds of faith leaders across our city and across this country is the fact that we have a a reality that we have to look at income front when we talk about hatred when we talk about the rhetoric that is coming from our ministry in all these types of things\nThat we as a people of faith have to rise above it and take action you know the reality is is that it it takes us as a people to recognize what is going on and then we have to go to the polls next week is going to be a very critical time\nFor our country that we need to send a message that this type of behavior this type of situation that happened in in Pittsburgh that happened in Louisville is totally unacceptable and we're going to change and the way that you change that is going to the polls and sort of failed remedy is rising above uh-huh\nJames I wanted to ask you in a in the same vein for the President Trump a uh after\nWorship or he said similar things after the Parkland shooting that are that are armed guards or the arming of teacher she he ... he suggested impossibility arming of teachers what's your response to this idea that maybe a houses of worship should now have armed guards as a means of protecting themselves\nI don't believe that houses with say our schools need to have armed guards you know that that's not why we attend church we attend church to be able to connect with our God and to be able to realize that our faith protects us an even with challenges come against us\nAh we'd know because of the worst says no weapon well formed against does\nThat mean that the weapon want calm but it means in terms of won't prosper that it won't it won't destroy the hope and resilience other people in spite of what challenges\nThat we face that's why in terms of having an armed guards you have to be secure and understand the Bible teaches us that we need to be wiser served in Syngenta was a dog\nThat means you have to be alert and awake in terms of things that could potentially happen but you also have to have a heart of compassion and love and forgiveness\nAnd so when we recognize these types of things we move forward with accident fate and hope and knowing that these things you know we'll have the possibility of existing and we're prepared in terms from a security standpoint but not from the standpoint of having the armed guards standing at the door\nI think that is it to the extreme of what we need in our country we need to talk more about how do we live in peace as opposed to living in fear and violence\nAnd it just got out and as a political representative and Kentucky on and not so far away or the race in Georgia and Florida right now on taking on extreme racial tone on you have a secretary of state of Georgia Brian ...\nRunning against Stacey Abrams if she were to when you become the first African American woman governor in the country and then Andrew Gillum running for governor in Florida the president just call him don't hold these\nUm at this followed a a a K. K. K. backdoor won some kind of white supremacist organization backed robocall and his opponent just sent is\nOn telling voters tone ... knocked a monkey it up right after he became the Democratic candidate your thoughts in this midterm election season and then what happened this week from Kentucky to Pittsburgh to the mail bombs that were sent out\nThoughts are that we better not in Kentucky act like we're immune from what we're seeing in Georgia and Florida what we're hearing\nA out of the mouths of politicians in Georgia and Florida because we hear some of the same and the very similar sentiments\nRight here in Kentucky we've seen the mailers than going out a call and people radicals and I'm trying to shame people and uh attack people especially women who are running for office here in Kentucky\nI'm so we're not immune and we're also not immune from attacks on our right to vote\nI serve on the committee in Frankfurt that uh pays attention to the elections into our constitution and even this legislative session we had a Republican lawmakers asking about how do we\nIf you can talk about um his link Bowers link a white supremacist link\nBetween uh Jews and Jewish groups were about to speak to representative of highest he particularly focused on the issue\nThat a refugee I'm I'm ... settlement organization was bringing what he called the invaders and I'm a Brian shelter of CNN just looked at um a Fox News and other right wing outlet and saying the level of\nUm time that they are talking about invaders just in the last few weeks so escalated\nAnd Bowers himself said I like the way they're changing the language is\nImmigration as President Trump now even if he goes to Pittsburgh tried to divert attention to the border spending saying he's sending the fifty two hundred soldiers to the border soon on the border there'll be more soldiers than in Iraq and Afghanistan on spending more than fifty two hundred um soldiers to the border um\nAnd also saying he plans to through executive order and the birthright citizenship\nMean you're pulling all of these incredibly troubling threads together and it's really important to recognize that the attack of on the tree of life than a God in Pittsburgh was an attack on Jewish people and the ... of the people who died are just heart wrenching\nBut an attack on Jewish people for supporting refugees and attacked specifically targeted at\nAn organization that was helping a has a she bought ceremonies in honor of supporting refugee youth um and drawing on the Jewish history of persecution or\nEmphasize how important it is that people who are fleeing violence in terror elsewhere in the world that we have the capacity to welcome them up and give them a safe place them that that is a moral duty ...\nAnd in talking to a representative for highest the particular a refugee organization um that the shooter named and that he said if you will to rage that he shared a link a\nTo a synagogue that were hosting these kinds of events you know she said that there are still wrestling with what it means to be targeted with violence particularly for fighting for the basic humanity for treating other people with basic humanity and that is what is so incredibly tragic your ...\nThat the congregation meeting people were targeted I'm at because of their humanitarian impulses because of support for Jews for refugees for people of color\nHi Semitic incidents in the U.S rose by fifty seven per cent in two thousand Seventeen the largest single year increase [noise]\nSince it started recording such statistics\nI'm Wondering if you or your strengths and this is of course not an isolated situation here in the United states so there's been a rise in anti Semitic incidents across Europe as well I'm Wondering if you could uh uh uh talk about the context in which is a current as more and more\nOf a right wing governments are coming to power all across the industrial world and even in in many parts of Asia Latin America as well\n\nSo obviously the context of rising anti Semitism is very disturbing\nAnd what what's particularly striking about Robert Ballard that Pittsburgh shooter and that and looking at his on line a profile on gap and opposed that he made it was clear that he was channeling a lot of very ancient anti Semitism is a lot of the throat\nAnd the hatred that he was sharing a are very our country old that this is not a new phenomenon and the anti Semitic violence\nAnd it was very old and a very dangerous ideology but Robert powers with also someone who was actively in communication with other white supremacist someone who was very familiar with the events of Charlottesville where white supremacist group marched through university town with torches Santa chanting Jews will not replace that\nAnd some of the statements that he made on his account suggests\nUm that he was the millionaire with those debates about what people who are white supremacy in America should do the optics and different kinds of action what's going to be most effective\nUh for advancing his white supremacist beliefs again that belief in an all white country that the United states has only a country for white people that other people should be shut out or don't belong here or shouldn't be allowed to have citizenship at\nActivists an anti fascist from Charlottesville who says that she constantly monitoring gab\nFor the harassment of white supremacists and she actually got some of these Robert Bauer post\nUm but they she passed them by she saw them she had screen shots of a couple of them but that the kind of hatred that he was dealing with the comment on the platform that there were so many dozens and hundreds of men sharing equally extreme racists propaganda but nothing about what he said has stood out to her\nThat this was someone who had apparently harassed her directly directly it's I'm a massage the mistake nasty comments and then appear to go on to commit a mass murder at a Jewish synagogue and she said she's still wrestling with it because what he's dead on that platform the kind of hate that he was expressing was so common\nThat it didn't stand out it didn't seem exceptional\nBerg Mayor Bill de Vito ... speaking I'm about what happened on Saturday ah the synagogue attacked the darkest day of Pittsburgh history but said armed guards are not the solution\nIt seems to be a place that we need to be looking at is how we treat the guns which is the common denominator of every month shooting America ... ... ... George first featured three murder\nSo that's there to do he also said that President Trump or should not come today to Pittsburgh that they are busy burying the dead\nPresident Trump right after the massacre talking about armed guards\nProduction shards of the results would have been\nThere will always are just sources but but they're very odd\nSome kind of a judge shows a double\nSo forth Jewish or the will to do and here the boys were civic leaders of believe wrote a book job but as you know\nWe were always\nSo that was President Trump calling for armed guards in the synagogues um lowest Beckett if you could talk about this and also I mean as we're talking about this violence do have\nUm grab Bush or in the Louisville area and Jefferson town I he has a numerous weapons are not clear whether he had to legally he had to hand them over because of its violent background again so often we see the links to domestic violence in their past\nBut why these men are able to have these guns course Bowers used in a are Fifteen\nThese Lincoln just to violence than this might you might think of as a stretch but because you are a guardian reporter I'm thinking about your colleague Ben Jacobs on who is body slammed by the Montana Congress member to plead guilty to criminal assaults and why I'm bringing that up now\nAs President Trump just last week on held a rally in Montana\nWhere he applauded a John forte for bodies slamming or your colleague at\nThe guardian this in the midst of um uh the investigation into the murder of a drum all ... with President Trump taking the side of the Saudi a leadership\nAnd not to mention the CNN mail bomb and then President Trump has not stop attacking the media all week\n\nThe one thing I Want to say that the tremendously important uh in the times where um the amount of violence and the partisan intensity theme so overwhelming is that female gun owner in\nOwner ... millions tens of millions of Americans own guns are roughly a third of households are condoning how told\n'em I think it's really important not to ... indiscriminately lumped together a a lot of different issues um but to say that there is a different a big difference between being a gun owner in America and even being someone who is skeptical of new regulations wanting to to really understand\nHow much that they will help 'em\nSomeone who is advocating for instance violence against journalists war as thinking that it is funny or cute that a politician might ah physically attacked a journalist who was trying to ask him a question about health care um that it might be appropriate to a\nPraise or to joke about that\nA politician who then went on to make false statements to the police who spokesperson made false statements to the police are about", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "30"}
