I'm the Saudi royal court\nSince then the evidence that the Turkish authorities have has been shared with\nUh the U.S intelligence community it seems that the Turks diplomatically speaking of been trying to walk a tightrope they were looking to get some sort of support from their allies in NATO as well as the Europeans there was a interestingly enough or comments that were made by the U.S intelligence community to\nSeveral American outfits where they described the evidence that they were showing by this hard I truly shocking nuts\nPrint them as well as a Guantanamo and other a huge

be making things or take a lot longer than they should in terms of wrapping up\nI wanted to ask you specifically about the Turkish government's release of information it's been coming out sort of in dribs and drabs over the over the period of\nA stage show she entered the of ah the consulate or wanted to ask you first why they took so long to actually go in and investigate since they knew early on apparently\nUh that that a crime had been committed a and what do you think is behind the ah the ah the partial releases of information over this period of time\n\nI think Turkey's foreign policy is ...\nIs under a lot of stress that has been before this when you look at the war in Syria when you look at the G through the crisis when you look at the courage of separates it than many many other issues the usa an order then I think they are not happy that they had landed on them\nI'm I'm they suddenly found that they are currently now being dragged into a confrontation with Saudi Arabia with which although I'm paper as an ally [noise] they don't really see eye to eye on several issues are in the beginning it seems that the Turks were trying to exhaust diplomatic\nA car doors between them and or avenues rather between them and we all are by trying to maybe get the Saudis to own up to what happens and therefore\nUh it wouldn't be seeing so confrontational when that didn't happen\nThey started leaking ... here and there are to try and maybe a gardener supports from other countries like the United states like\nA Britain and Germany and from in order so that it doesn't mean a it so

tried to float the idea that this was rogue elements that were behind this and therefore I think the uh Turks wanted to do miss completely by showing\nWell how can it be a rogue elements if indeed it's a took place in a conflict but I Do a diplomatic mission I'm under the direct order or control over the governments\nAnd secondly the details of this taking place\nWas done when trying to try to maybe a ... the idea that this was a somehow in a row corporation a an interrogation that went wrong the fact that you would send your head all the expert at the fact that uh he was a\nDamascus will she was barely question difficult question I'm living in fact\nDescended upon by these special forces officers and a pizza and killed in the way he was with a a costs a lot of doubts on the idea that it was simply an attempt to interrogate or questioned him enough people or didn't really listen to the orders that they were um\nGiven obesity this hurts themselves have a lot at stake here are not just in the sense that they\nDon't want to call this rift or fall out the Turkish economy has been suffering quite a bit recently uh they've been trying to maybe make amends of a relationship with\nWashington and we've seen that in recent days with the comments coming out of the Trump Administration following the release of\nThe pastor so like I say this is a case that's got to do much more we've\nGeopolitics and uh in the interests of power groups than it is about unfortunate the just the the the case of freedom of expression and a journalist has been assassinated just\nYour friend and she went to a gym now to shop Chase Brown there and sat right you can't talk about how his family is responding right now what they're demanding\nDid that they were rogue elements who did this so they did it happen to explain how did they did that in Saudi consulate or the Saudi consul general's residence\nI'm a you have Trump pendant self thing that was rogue elements possibly and you have a pen pal now gone to turkey where you are a by going to Saudi Arabia yesterday many question why wouldn't they be calling in\nAnd the Saudi ambassador in Washington why would he be going directly to

United states\nThe about the message that you can reach any\nUh opponents are critical voice in any country whenever you want and nobody's going to punish the regime for it and even if they do catch the regime they can do what they want a as a result I mean you would think that's an active crime scene even people walking in sort of forget about cleaners that in itself will be something that was for\nFor for the fact that that was a loud talking in front of the cameras speaks more to the breeze in nature of the shameless nature or of the regime which has been given a green light and enabled not just by the Trump Administration by the way but by the entire a free world and for many decades not just now I'm I'm therefore that's what's happened\nThank you so much for being with
