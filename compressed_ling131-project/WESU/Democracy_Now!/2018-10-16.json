immigrants it is playing to a racist trope um that in the body politic that these immigrants are going to somehow steal our election\nBut he cannot point to note saying the same way that Kris Kobach could not point to all of these illegal immigrant um it is a fiction it is a lie it is a myth that as being used\nTo stir up fear to justify the kind of unwarranted voter suppression techniques that these secretaries of state like Brian Kemp and Kris Kobach are usually\nI'd like to go back to this whole issue of will do the closing of polling places or most people who really don't pay attention to what happens in polling places all of them there's\nRight and because you talk about the impact on voter turnout of all of sudden or either closing the bowling places or shifting of old voting place from one location to another just before an election\nOh absolutely I'm so one of the things to to pay attention\nBy the time we got to the twenty sixth teen election states that had been under pre clearance and that is where because of their history of racial discrimination at the polls they had to have all of their voting rights voting changes may or approved by the department of justice\nAfter the voting rights with God at eight hundred and sixty eight polling places were shutting down by the time we got to the twenty sixteen election Brian Kemp and been responsible for two hundred and fourteen of those polling places being shut down\nWhat the research shows is that for every tenth of a mile that a polling place is removed from the African American community black voter turnout goes down by point five percent so the more you move these polling places\nThe the further and further the more and more you're able to the press the black voter turnout\nSo we had a an instance in Florida where\nAre under the guise of being fiscally responsible they were going to consolidate the polling stations well when they can file a date at the polling stations\nBut one for the black community and I can say the black community because we do have residential segregation in the United states for the one in the black community that one was moved Seventeen miles away\nNow think about that\nFor trying to vote and what we all still knows is that many\nIn the African American community do not have a\nCars they don't have personal transportation so they have to rely upon public transportation so when you move a polling place further and further away from the black community by that very moment that very instant is designed to the press to black voters\nVery Kim has unfortunately built two very strong record a voter suppression and yet the and I have\nTo leave a conflict at a number of time and I think I'm I'm very well I'm not I don't think I Know I'm very proud of our record of beating him a forcing him to restore the cancelled registrations of thousands of compelling his office to do the right thing when it comes to voter registration\nBut also I think it's a little challenging conversation to have both\nWith secretary can to end with lieutenant governor cable because rather than focusing on how we move the state forward they've both focus unfortunately on quieter\nOf bigotry and how they want to harm community and hold us back\nSo that's the Abrams speaking ... about her opponent church a secretary of state Brian Kemp than Georgia lieutenant governor\nKate Cagle I also want it to turn to the Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia who was captured on video Saturday AT T snatched cell phone out of the hands of a kind of ... who asked about\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp poop Purdue was stumping for senator Purdue is on the campus of Georgia Tech in Atlanta or want us to try to ask\nHim about his endorsement\nSo I'm not going to endorse a candidate Robert started going to want to jump through\nSenator Purdue return the phone after the student demanded it back on Sunday produced office called the incident and misunderstanding saying the senator thought the student wants to take a selfie with him\nI'm\nProfessor understand if you could comment on this and as we wrap up the discussion\nGeorgia who's voting right now I mean in some states there's no voting taking place but what's happening in Georgia so\nChristian breakfast [noise] um by praying for Obama's death by saying you know make your life be ended short you know quoting us a song\nAnd you know may your wife be left to I'm a widow and your children homeless and beggars so this is Senator David Perdue um and and Stacey Abrams is actually right that the the language that we're getting from\nI'm Brian Kemp and Casey Cagle has been the language of fear has been the language of joking um some racial animosity racial anxiety\nAh and and bigotry and sold and they're they're selling fear as as they're as their component for why they shouldn't be in office\nAnd so what we're seeing right now is that we have early voting going on 'em and the ...

W E s U Middletown ... now and fame\nAnd Hi everybody I Want you to hear about a remarkable man\nOut during a Seventy nine year old with severe ... and spinal to know says who has been walking for immigrant everyday to point two miles since January twenty fifth\nOn October twenty first his two hundred and Seventy eighth consecutive day walking on his neighborhood streets we are sponsoring walking with out for immigrants in America to walk will begin at the ... federal building for fifty main street Hartford\nAt two PM and will proceed to six locations before ending with a peaceful rally at the federal building this will be an introspective family oriented event focused on the unity of diversity please join us on October ... when she first\nFunny one\nThat we have a brace and we own onto\nFor dear life because at the end we are organizing folks along the lines of humanity\nAnd because of that we've been able to get people that that that that that throw off their part of the same clothes and come together as brothers and sisters are in this movement as Americans that's rallying around each other knowing that once the debt is paid it's paid\nSo we can have a organizations like the tax watch Christian Coalition freedom part of that\nSo the ACLU a organizations like Advancement Project I'm I'm alliance with safety and justice and for all the rights restoration coalition\nThat is to me the most beautiful thing that we're witnessing hair I Believe that we are becoming a shining light for the rest of the country about what's good when people can elevate themselves above partisan bickering above racial discourse\nAnd connect along the lines of humanity for the good of all people\nAri I'd like to move from Florida to another uh another state that's also a scene of a disproportionate targeting a racial minority and the Supreme Court has ruled that will allow the state of North Dakota\nTo enforce a new voter id requirement that will make it harder for Native Americans to vote during the mid term elections\nThe state's new voter id law requires voters to show identification that demonstrates a residential street address\nBut this has already rented many tribal IDs invalid since many Native Americans live on reservations depend on post office boxes to receive their mail or the law could make a big difference in the close race between\nDemocratic senator Heidi Heitkamp and her Republican challenger Kevin Cramer a the races expected to help decide who controls the Senate if you're talking about that as well\nYeah so the north Dakota voter id law has flown under the radar relative to Georgia but it's just a serious because the way this Republican voter id law is written is that most tribal ideas are not going to be accepted because they do not have a residential address in them\nMany Native Americans live in rural areas on reservations they don't have to address that they get their mail at the post office there's nothing wrong with that\nBut that probably civically written to not allow PO box is kind of an address so what's happening now in North Dakota is that thousands of Native Americans couldn't be disenfranchised by this Republican voter id law\nAnd that means about five thousand Native American voters might not be able to vote in the next election and then we're running out of time to try to get them the correct ideas right now I mean we're basically twenty days away from the election and\nHeidi Heitkamp only won her first race for the Senate by three thousand votes with strong NATO support now you're talking about a much larger percentage of Native Americans who could be disenfranchised so this one voter id law in North Dakota could cost potty how to ... percent and could cost\nDemocrats control of the Senate so it's a very very serious situation we're also talking about the most historically disenfranchised group in this country who faces all sorts of barriers today and now\nThirty days before the election they find out they might not be able to vote in a critical midterm elections absolutely shocking an appalling was half an hour it's a kind of it's\nOften particularly interesting is happening at a time as a\nTrump continually attacking US Senator Elizabeth Warren are trying to use the word Pocahontas the name Pocahontas pejorative to describe her she has now gone and gotten a DNA test which she says from Stanford professor\n... says she has Native American lineage and ancestry as she looks like she's about to announce her bed for twenty twenty a presidential uh for the twenty twenty presidential election\nJust imagine Amy is voter suppression North Dakota got a fraction of the attention of Elizabeth Warren's DNA tests or Donald Trump's Pocahontas worse and I think what we should be focusing on instead of her ancestry is all the barriers are being faced by Native Americans in this country and you can go down every single statistic\nAnd you see the problems but particularly with voting there was a long history of disenfranchising Native American voters of making polling places very inaccessible of gerrymandering district so they don't have representation and that was right before an election a new voter ID laws put into place that could disenfranchised thousands of native\nIt by voters depression you can't reverse it and so right now people have to do everything they can to get Native American so that they can get the idea that he developed but this law was typically written it's very very clear to disenfranchise native\nAmerica ... an hour and what are the ... in terms of the fact that we're only weeks away from the mid term elections clearly\nThe Florida referendum or whatever happens there will only take effect for the next election but what can be done now in Georgia and in North Dakota or to be able to have some I\nHave a have these folks have their right to vote on before this election\nIn Georgia there is a lawsuit filed the to allow the pending registration to go through even if you are pending registration you can show up and vote with an idea at the polls so it's very foreign people know that they can vote\nIn North Dakota the tribal authorities are going to have basically a temporary id they're going to give people a letter saying they have an address\nPoll workers are supposed to accept that but we used to be very very vigilant here and that's why issues like election protection are going to be so important 'cause I'm extremely worried people are going to show up in Georgia they're going to show up in North Dakota they might even have the right documents and election workers won't be able to won't won't tell them that they're able to vote\nAnd on the ballot initiatives that have um that will in each direction and other parts of the country\nThis is huge because there's a ballot initiatives in seven states that would dramatically expand voting rights restoring voting rights ex felons in Florida to making it easier to register to vote\nIn Michigan Nevada to cracking down on gerrymandering and places like Colorado and Utah and so despite all the focus on voter suppression there is an opportunity to dramatically expand voting rights and twenty a teen and there is the best opportunity in a decade\nTo make it easier to vote for millions of people so I think that while all the focus is on depression and twenty Eighteen the landscape for voting rights could look dramatically different in twenty twenty if\nLinked to your ... made the
