Court justice of the United states Jody Jacobson\nThat's what you focused on in your column talk about the significance of this of course I'm Senator Murkowski of Alaska and now she would not\nSupport judge Kavanaugh in the end she simply voted present to balance out her colleagues center\nSenator colon has often been portrayed as a moderate\nBut that portrayal it's really an inside the beltway portrayal it's convenient tool for media pundit you use in order to have someone on the Republican\nSide they can use to frame up with Joe mansion for example but Susan Collins is not a moderate she has voted with a Mitch McConnell and with now President Trump most of the time she has taken a step here\nIt's really beyond just a vote\nShe went on the floor of the Senate\nLiterally gas like the entire nation about both the cross\nOut and about the nominee himself she took Republican talking point about the process of the FBI investigation for example which was far from complete and far from sorrow and did not even include an interview with\nEither Brett Kavanaugh or doctor Blasey Ford and called it a complete investigation it didn't have there are many many witnesses that we're not called and many leads that were not followed it was really um the epitome of window dressing so she tried to tell us that\nA full investigation had been carried out that she had\nA you know examine his record and found it to be far more centrist or liberal than other people may mostly all of us have 'em have gained it to be um or have read it to be rather and then also she went on\nTo tell Dr bleeds before\nThat she did not know what she was talking about and there's this Republican line that goes well we believe Dr Blasey Ford but\nWe don't think she really knows what happened to her and if that is not the definition of trying to ... someone I don't know what it is\nUm uh the I Want to add to the fact that neither blah the Ford for Kavanaugh was\nInterviewed by the FBI a very different situation than ah being questioned at the Senate Judiciary committee this is what Dr block the Ford had called for\nAn FBI investigation the criticism at the beginning once it was going forward is don't trust interview the two of them go beyond that but I think very few people thought maybe Mitch McConnell said that the two of them weren't going to be interviewed and it's particularly significant when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh\nBecause he would be under oath it wouldn't be a the Democrats asking questions and he could attack them for being Democrat and then the Republicans simply supporting him he would having to directly answer FBI question\nCan you explain how it was possible\nThat the FBI investigation didn't include interviews with these two primary people\nLooked controlled by the White House in conjunction with the Republican side of the Senate Judiciary committee and they decided to gather what would happen in the investigation and literally there were people that were\nThat were done the FBI was not allowed to interview and among those were ... or ... oh you have\nA situation where Kavanaugh Who Lied under oath numerous times outside the scope of this issue of the sexual assault but on many other issues was not being put under oh by the FBI\nAnd if you watched the hearing when he was questioned repeatedly I I think it was by Dick Durbin and several others would you ...\nAnd let's face it he's spent the better part of the two weeks before the FBI under investigation in the White House with Don McGahn so\nThere's no way there was going to be a fair and thrown at the end of the nation because he was kind of a group calling the shots I think the key thing here to realize is if you wanted\nAnd if you wanted to really understand if Dr ... for ... and I really her claims were honorable than you would want to do a thorough investigation and you would want to remove any question but the reality may have to grapple with it they did not here\nAnd they did not want to understand and that is so\nWell clearly clearly they deeply cared about putting him on the Supreme Court\nI wanted to bring in a democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren who spoke on Thursday making a new claim about content says the FBI document on Kavanaugh that we're viewed by senators and the Senate basement one after another and not being able to bring in a pen not being able to take any out any notes\nThis is what she said\nSenators have been multiple so I Will now said three things that committee staff has explained are permissible to say without violating committee rural statement that I have also independently verified accurate\nThis was not a full and fair investigation it was sharply limited in scope and did not at war the relevant confirming fan\nTo pay a veil of all documents do not ... Don array Mr cabinet\nThree payable document contradict statements Mr ... made under oath\nSenator Warren and it says\nTo review the saying they were not exonerate ing\nRight because I think it was very critical for her to say that clearly and loudly because what you've got is being on the other side of the on out saying well these documents show that you know there was no evidence for ... for\nUm a a\nClaims and if you know what I like to be jak later when you've been attacked and I do\nIt the the most humanizing kind of experience to have something happen to you to try the house for how to how people dismiss you I Can't tell you how collective\nThe conscious painter this episode has touched so many women not only of course the women\nWho were there to outlet you leak protesting at the Capitol giving their all but women throughout this country who have been in this situation and have been Gosling about it and it's it's really deeply painful\nJourney Jacobson press and editor of a reason why our dot news wrote a paper this weekend headlined a Titanic fraud Susan Collins a moderate who never was um a\nCrowdfunding website with set up after she said she was voting for Brett Kavanaugh four million dollars just immediately relay race\nYou know I mean never again should anybody here that this is ruining a man's life that boys are in danger and the kids obviously it's young white boys um because that's really the only way you could interpret what the president said\nUm you write in your book Shariah jak rages hard for women to express [noise] and I was wondering if you can talk about that and also Senator McConnell characterization of the mob [noise]\n[laughter] well you know I think that um it's useful for McConnell to to talk about a mob either\nWhich means that they're associated with unhinged emotion 'em and you can see that in multiple\nForms of commentary coming from his party but I think that we all understand certainly as women that anger and the expression of anger comes with the penalties for women were socialized to put others first\nTo restrain our expressions of negative emotions the cause of comfort and even his little girls are rewarded for being nice and pleasing a not for being a sort of or aggressive neither of which implies that were angry by the way\nIt should be assertiveness and aggression and anger are are not separated and the behavior and responses to girls and women\nAre so I think that what we're seeing now in the explosion of women feeling is is clearly a pent up need to be listened to and believed that the demand that they stopped at the gap lighting stop\nThat the doubting stop and that the disregard for our right to it and then come to an end\nYou wrote about Kavanaugh's reach 'em to block the storage and testimony\nYes well she she was so composed and um to me or and actually\nHer she was deferential right shoot she went out of her way to\nTry and put others it is which I think is a fairly common for women um in her situation certainly knowing that and she had she not only with a ... a witness but an expert witness said she was testifying but she also a study that's her entire life she knows what the dynamic look like\nI Would say that the saddest part actually of her whole testimony to me was when she used the word ... because it showed that ...\nAnd on the right of course it was all men are three of them had been participants in the Anita Hill a judged a Clarence Thomas hearings that that they considered her appear that they would treat her with mutual respect that they would\nAct now acknowledge her professional expertise and that is simply not true she could not make that assumption and that kind of rude shock two girls and women all the time that we believe that we are functioning as equal\nWith equal dignity and with the knowledge that we have accrued some expertise and then we're sort of slapped in the face with the information that our male parents do not feel that way at all\nOn the other hand came in roaring and indignant and ... and I'm here that motion analogy\nOverwhelmed everything else in the room and he could do that because in our culture there is an essential core of rationality that as opposed to being a man it it actually didn't degrade the idea that he could think clearly whereas if you're a woman or you don't\nHave that uh come you can't prevent people don't presume that about you you are all emotion holiday and if by chance to think clearly um that's sort of a layered on top of that that\nI'm feeling orientation that we're supposed to naturally habits women which was of course nonsense that men are no more rational logical than women are and women are no more unhinged an emotional and men that was very clear from from the confirmation hearings\nShow on a lot of the discussion about the mid term elections innocence galvanized did the right um many Republicans are saying interestingly shortly after Kavanaugh which

book tour around the country how people are continuing to organized or do you think that Dr women in their tracks\nOh gosh no I mean very clearly I think that may be one of the love for middle I'm confrontation of of what we've been living with is about to come I think that the bigger not stopping anything in its tracks\nIf it if we're looking at a twelve hour a clock we're probably at second three or four I Would say I mean the the truth is that a lot of people would like me too and any suggestion that need to add failed or coming to an end\nTo go away and it's really not an end at the
