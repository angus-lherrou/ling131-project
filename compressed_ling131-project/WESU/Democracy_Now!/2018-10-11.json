when you heard about this news of the worst us traffic kept a\nAccident in almost a decade and that the limousine that we use\nHi informant who leg tea or an ... can you talk about you're fine and exactly who shot chain in\nYeah good morning or Amy I I was completely devastated by this news the fact that this man\nIs allowed to continue to to to live a bomb\nOr you know citizens and and and to be out here when this guy is he's a road and you know he he he's a liar and he's a sea of criminal he he's a he's a scam artist and he and he's a danger to society\nAnd and the fact that this took place and and more than likely that the money that was used to to build this company was money that was paid to him by our government\nI mean this is ridiculous because of because he's an asset to our government and he's bringing him manufacture cases of terrorism or this is why he's allowed to continue to stay in this country and to flourish and to run these illegal businesses in which he's constantly cutting corners and and and\nIt's it's just sad twenty people die as a result of this guy's negatives in\nThis affect\nHow you met her saying\nYeah I I met him um to the other and former that was involved in in in the case I'm not sure if\nHe told me one day a man my brothers coming in from out of town and then I really want you to meet him he's a real resourceful die you know and I think you guys will get along deal with relate\nThat's how we won't need for money or not the only thing they're going to make any money on point ended up going to be a sort of you know what should he

saying and again to bring this back for people are just joining us national had seen who run\nThis one was not there to be on the road and the hiring and that's the one that crashed killing all twenty all Seventeen people end up in the car and drive our as well as to um pastors fine right still talk about that and defending your clients and how they ended up in jail they can\nThey get such Danny not so much of your clients they're clearly desperate and sometimes trying to get away from him he was coming up with a plot all the time he had to send a guy in the military base\nSo in the case here there were a lot of different ways where my ... one we're compressed in time in a sense because it starts in um early two thousand and eight and it goes all the way the two thousand nine nine months of recruitment\nAnd during the summer months crude and people are leaving to keep walking away they can't find people my client comes in the first time he appears on tape anywhere he says to shed by the way thanks for the job I really needed a job\nThey're very I'm here to do damage to the world a new job\nAnd I mean literally waste on the street so that for assistance is what ultimately the FBI are allowed to use to say let's to press it all into one moment what do we have we had people staying and clip here for the job\nWhat the trial was about was pulling back that that band aid that that ban to hide the actual wounds and the wars were sure how to St doing whatever he wanted to do\nAnd that's the connection with the case here today it's not because he was an informant and then and live then that he somehow legally responsible for the it's because every day of his life and every minute he's ever had\nHe's had no responsibilities for anything\nSo he comes in he lives about his immigration an application for asylum never punished he comes here and he creates a fraud from business never punished he comes here and he does a bribery scandal the DMV and he's never partners to comes here in the lives of the trial up and all but it never punished comes really files bankruptcy\nAlready makes offers binds the FBI to things never punished at trial he lies on the stand McMahon turns the jury and says this man is lying\nNever held accountable for the government says you're doing a great job and the terror case in other cases he's done and now they're so the timeline is for all of us to watch this to say he's never been held accountable in his life for anything\nSo what does he learned from that he learns sociopath the ability to say without remorse without any concern without any hesitation or do whatever I Want so if I Want the truck on the road that goes on the road and who says no you may know we're still paying a salary he's making hundreds of thousands of dollars doesn't pay taxes on it he lives in Tibet felony crime\nAsking you to pay taxes on the government pays the money you mean the FBI and our\nTrial came out that he got sixty six thousand dollars a year before trial to pay taxes on that money\nTo gift so what does he learned he learned to do anything you want to go to Pakistan wherever he is who knows if he's actually there and it's done this years down there for him\nMaybe his son takes the beating for um I don't know when did you mean who knows she comes and goes as he pleases have you ever been to JFK on the line to get it out of JFK do you think he stands on that line he doesn't he just disappears with during a trolley disappeared during the trial came back\nNobody says we know where he is the FBI agent handler who's on trial on the stand as you go to follow him in Pakistan no I mean how do you know he's not actually a terrorist maybe he's the actual terrorists\nThen and there are questions when he first came to United States from Pakistan flinging murder\nShow he's ties right we don't even have proof of that but he actually said that he was a victim of an unlawful arrest and all these other effects we have no proof that that is true and the FBI never offer proof that that was true the only thing we know that the FBI they said about the foreign the trial they said in a letter and an internal memory\nGo to a comments that have been made a statement that's been issued by a Muslim groups in the U.S [noise] uh the solidarity committee projects Saddam and the coalition for civil Sweden issued a statement about has been saying quote the limousine company is the latest hit on the road of calamity\nShy than the debt to justice has not been paid\nThe years spent in prison and the years filter the for the phone a crime that has an engineer for the FBI cannot be recovered for the men he put away and the terrible irony of a felon\nConvicted as part of a DMV scan who's now responsible for the faulty operation of a vehicle that kills twenty innocent people\nIs not lost on a ... a lyric Congress could do a response to that and to also say um [noise] what you call from time to too many uh\nYou said that in fact you thought he was taking a direction from the FBI\nSo one of the things that has always troubled me about Hussein in response to the project slum statement on earth that she just read is going back to his initial charge which was the um the fraud\nUm you know the FBI always says FBI's argument is that it needs a criminal to catch a criminal but going back to that actual act which was in the ... I Believe it was in ... in the early ... thousands of my question is why does sci choose to hire this individual because that very act\nUm which for which they could have prosecuted him and put him in jail\nIs ultimately what kill these people on the fraud getting vehicles actually in what he was convicted of what he should have been convicted of what the FBI knew that he was doing was helping people to receive driver's licenses illegally\nAnd his son in this accident than not have a license to drive the vehicle so I ... I I have not heard much scrutiny around the FBI 'em to date I've not heard the bureau\nThere knowing his capability around these five\nLyric I'm you spoke to the mother of David Williams' one of the new broke for I think they're in jail what for twenty five years when she learned if that's terrific car crash that involves the man who ended up getting her son and press and what did she tell you\nI'm Elizabeth ... Williams was just horrified um you know she ... she was just wondering like any mother would she's still trying to get her son out of jail um she understand that in this by you know the injustice occurred so I think her first response with a legal one\nI'm going back to sort of the point that I spoke on um is there any way that the FBI can be held accountable for this man now that it's clear um that the original crime when they hired him is what kill these people all of them at least so she's wondering how this current event\nMight impact our son shards might impact David I'm freedom\nAnd the last ten seconds your response than brave for sure when you heard what happened in the higher\nYou know it's more the same for this young men are seen does whatever he wants to do throughout his life and it's not just that there are so she passed among us because there are it's what our government tolerate this sort of craziness\nLike the love story both Scott the governor and Florida would tolerate the nonsense with the ... and hard and said if you harden send about the environment Heiden said about justice if you're hiding within about all the issues are important to us\nWhy do we ever think we should be credited and give the bottom line is the the wrap their arms around\nA lawyer and here's the IRS would report more there so\nAnd as Michael German said in a remarkable film or by David how Brunner a the HBO film the uh the Newberg dang quoting Michael German an FBI agent uh\nNine one one after nine eleven\nHis colleagues to the FBI were saying you know the rules no longer apply and he was walking around saying what are you talking about\nOr to ... send braver men lawyer for one of the Newberg for lyric ... co director of the award winning documentary terror which is now on Netflix and we want to thank ... who joined us from the halfway house in Pittsburgh\nWe thank you so much a ... a ... a foreign lightning us as we continue to try to find out what had taken place down the road of upstate New York and wear a\nThat point I had um Hussein is his son is in jail that democracy now when we come back yes yet how\nFascism works the new book by Yale professor Hillary Stanley stay with us\nYou're listening to W E s few Middletown eighty eight point one I found it doesn't ...
