are not made public a about the uh the most\nShouldn't team and they're four and I think uh we really need to concentrate on the context of all this and how the United states is to\nUm not wanting to make or break or maybe acknowledge that the Saudi regime whether it's been set amount or his so called rogue elements within the regime\nAre responsible for this but I Can't imagine how a a janitors entering the ... the state disappears on because we have the video of that\nWithout actually the finger pointing to the involvement of the Saudi regime and possibly that talk person in the Saudi regime I'm about to crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nSuch a horrific crime if has it has been it fits has happened inside the embassy or consulate no but they could just take the initiative and execute someone without orders from above\nThink many in this country and around the world are shocked that President Trump and as secretary of state Mike Pompeo continue to say we simply oh wait the Saudi investigation\nThis is the Saudi investigation of themselves [noise]\nWhen the FBI was asked that they investigate and they said no there were no orders to investigate so the U.S government is waiting for those accused to come up with their own investigation\nAnd when ... when I'm secretary of state pump pale on the tarmac in Riyadh after visiting with the crown prince to end up\nAnd his father the king um and when the video showing up them laughing smiling together was asked what he learned he said it wasn't\nEver happened as far as I Know that the accused are involved in the investigation\nBut this is how ah the inequality in this world works it says and inequality between countries that are wealthy that are capable of transferring to a hundred million dollars to the U.S on the day off the top but it's a secretary of state\nAnd it didn't that money that actually meat sauce to stagnate in their relationship with the Saudi regime that continues to attack\nA basic human rights inside this country but this act if it actually happened or inside the consulate in is some board is a new phase that we are seeing a and in Saudi Arabia\nBut it's the Saudi regime is allowed to find a scapegoat or a cover story that with a low with from any responsibility for the murder of Jim I ...\nI Would attribute that to the purchasing power of the Saudi regime rather than its integrity at the integrity of its patrons that you United States of America\nDon't talk about that relationship talk about President Trump and his son in law Jared Kushner\nA relationship clearly a what it's called the romance between um a Jared Kushner and the crown prince of talked about the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman end the crown prince Jared Kushner\nBut why they are so close although it shouldn't be confused with the U.S not supporting Saudi Arabia for a you have President Obama visiting Saudi Arabia I Believe something like four times President Trump\nAnd I did the shore Dan cetera [noise]\nWell that's hit the history of this relationship goes back to the ... after the second World War and the discovery of oil and Saudi Arabia the United states did not have any interest in ... at that time as it was called\nOn to our oil was discovers by a an American company\nAnd it did in the oil company that brought to the U.S government into Saudi Arabia rather than the other way round\nSo we have the oil we have the money that needed to be protected after the uh at the signing off a contract for a further exploration off the possibility of oil on the soil off a rape yeah\nSo that they that the United states government was brought in to protect the interests of the corporation the oil company that discovered the oil and talked to pumping at\nThe United states found in Saudi Arabia as strategic ally it's had initially the ministry based in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia where oil was found\nAnd the ministry based one used by the United states as an a at a at a place to stop on the way to the far east during the Nineteen forties when they the Nineteen fifties\nSo they ... it was extremely important and at that time a child you or it was important for the United states and the rest of the world because at at the moment we find that the U.S is less dependent on ...\nAnd the justification for the close partnership between Saudi Arabia and the United states from the U.S perspective has always been that we need Saudi Arabia because Saudi Arabia is a force of stability in the middle east\nVote and support and Saudi Arabia was actually conveying that and uh actively participating in that ah you had in the Nineteen eighties\nBut also there is this threat to the in addition to the economic importance of Saudi Arabia the strategic location of Saudi Arabia the importance of Saudi Arabia to the rest of the Muslim world and the Cold War\nOr Saudi Arabia and specifically it's religious tradition that is known to everybody as the ... tradition was a very convenient ... ideology to counter for example\nAnti imperialist to a a a ideology is in the Nineteen sixties uh\nArab nationalism and also socialism so as as I make fundamentalism was promoted by Saudi Arabia in cooperation with the United states as a counter strategy to all the threatening forces in the world at the time from the perspective of both the U.S and Saudi Arabia\nHowever at when we come to the present and we come to the election of Mr Donald Trump Saudi Arabia had at as you said of course it did to receive that President Obama\nA in Saudi Arabia and frankly if President Obama sold more weapons to Saudi Arabia than any other president\nBut that was one issue that they did not agree on and that is the Iran nuclear agreement which allowed Iran to be happy to stay tuned into the international community and accept are they the conditions off\nThe uh uh they they are they're agreement to stop a its nuclear program and Saudi Arabia felt threatened by that because it felt that President Obama went behind it and behind closed doors and did not involve them\nSo he he was promoting\nNot democracy because if he did that at the time he would have ended up in prison\nAnd but he was almost like praising can GOP de ... an praising his so called reforms I mean the the the word reformed comes up every time we have a new king but we we we don't go far in that reform so\nAll so that was a ... he was close to al ... who is probably a known to western or just as as the ... the businessman who ah\nOwns and means yeah empire that he started in in ...\nIs channeled based in Bahrain called ... up and how she was she was meant to go there and in our view the rate that I'm a news channel\nBut it is very very interesting that news channel last is two hours and it was shut down by on orders from the Saudi regime and therefore how should he returned to Saudi Arabia I continue to arise\nAt until king settlement unemployment been set mine came to power and that's when he and began to and have a difficult relationship\nAt all so let's not forget that one of his main jobs\nAt was as an adviser and spokesperson to print ... who was the ex director of intelligence in Saudi Arabia nature he became the ambassador of Saudi Arabia in Washington and London\nSo he he wasn't very close to that person\nThen ... at the time when ... came to power\nHe ... he lost like ... had no patron anymore because he wasn't close to the new\nGuards that came with ... settlement and therefore he was banned from writing he was suspended and on Sunday he appears in Washington and started writing for the Washington Post so my gas in July ... should not be regarded as\nAn opposition figure as a dissident he is a defector from within the corridors of power of the Saudi regime\nAnd he moved to Washington which really wanted the Saudis I think simply because\nHe's close to the patrons who the protectors of this hour\nHe ... he began to rise to critically off that time off some of the settlement on his reforms knocked all of them he appreciates that some of them for example giving women the right to drive introducing cinemas and the editor in Saudi Arabia\nBut he was desperate to have freedom of speech in Saudi Arabia as a journalist and uh he started writing and for a different audience a\nAn English speaking or does which probably water and the fact that I have a job on how she was you know it's too much perhaps and they did not want this to go further\nSo then what the story of him attending conferences in London and going all sorts of stumbled onto a we saw that video of him entering they sowed they called ...\nAnd looking for a document that's the story that we got from his fiance who was waiting for him outside the confidence\nThat he needed a document to say that his divorce his wife in Saudi Arabia and therefore he wouldn't be able to be married in Turkey\nAnd so this is the story that we have this and that but she\nHad I appeared when Jamal ... on television and Andrea Jew or when he was the spokesperson of prince Turki al ... saw that in ... in London we disagreed about so many things but I must say that he was very polite person who wasn't defending that\nRound here was defending the king the policies of backing them at that time in his role as the spokesperson for them back to\nInterestingly the middle east I is reporting Saudi authorities band official chief from writing and newspapers appearing on TV and attending conferences after\nHis remarks during a presentation he made it a Washington think tank on November\nThen the was right after Trump's election in the last minute that we have viewer Pete and the New York times why king down much replaced and the talk about what you think has to happen now [noise]\nI mean I think Peter or we should leave the investigation of the possible ... of July for the right people who are actually who knows what they're doing what what is it better happen in Saudi Arabia and what should happen is that first we need to know who the murders are\nAnd who gave them orders and if it has proven that must have been sending money is responsible that are two things that could save Saudi Arabia at this moment one er kinks out mud must sack his sons and find an alternative crown prince\nHe should go to a sink into oblivion because his name associate is associated with the ... and it's not as bad as evidence to prove that\nThe second thing I I Believe that just replacing them ... mind with another ... it's not enough\nThat has to be a political change in Saudi Arabia to mitigate against the emergence of a new ambassador\nIn an absolute monarchy we conduct simply wait and hope that then future king would it be better than the previous one\nThat is no mechanism in Saudi Arabia to mitigate against the mergers of somebody like him at all previous kings I mean we focus on them best as if Saudi Arabia had like enjoyed a certain kind of openness or democracy or the\nElements off scot free speech it's never been a free country and therefore at king's tell them that if he wants to save Saudi Arabia from future upheaval civil wars et cetera he needs to start thinking and making it up\nA symbolic fingers ignored there's two and now a transition to more democratic system and we haven't even mentioned I Do not support any monarchy whether it's a a a an absolute monarchy or echoes the tuition monarchy like the ones that we have in the Arab\nWorld and even in that caused the traditional arrangement we still have that the king interferes in everything and we have examples from Morocco to Jordan to Kuwait to Bahrain\nAnd therefore but as it turns issues on Syria as appear to have to prepare Saudi Arabia for a better future then that can must act now however I have my doubts because kinks out of mind is very old and he may not be aware of the severity off what his son may have\nDone and and and therefore\nTo focus the mind off of the the world are on this change is extremely important because Saudi Arabia is not a country with the resources for its own people it's a country that is relevant to the world economy and if we have a situation in Syria in Saudi Arabia\nOr along the lines off fast Syria\nYemen or Iraq then the whole world with feel the shock\nAnd we haven't even talked about Yemen as a crown prince is being accused of orchestrating the I'm a killing of a Jamal ... member ring him um piece by piece\nYou have the children of Yemen being blown to pieces you have a country being destroyed by Saudi Arabia back by the United states we just have thirty seconds [noise]\nYes absolutely I think from the very beginning almost ah two thousand\nCannot to bomb a very very poor country and a tell all over ten thousand civilians and stabilize a country it's just not gonna happen that the Saudis should have a\nStayed outside back to a country\nAnd not interfered so much and it's in terms of politics that had been a struggle for power in Yemen but the Saudi intervention\nHas made the worst and had has actually contributed to that or a struggle for power not ending stewards so the war in Yemen should stop immediately because it's going nowhere and it has become a\nYemen itself has become a training ground for an inexperienced sowed the army but has\nActually a participated in a war or launched toward or let alone as a achieved victory or no war let's remember that in Nineteen Ninety", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "19"}
