of five hundred and fifty thousand voters he used the postcard drink camped sent out millions of these cards\nRequiring voters to confirm their addresses problem they looked like junk mail eight out of ten voters get them throw them away throw away the card and cameras can throw you off the rolls the trick not everyone gets a postcard mostly they go to neighborhoods like this\nThis is my neighborhood and this is where I almost got birds\nStacey Hopkins is a community organizer and\nYou came into this is also a community that's rapidly changing ... impacts us as a voting community with

I wanted to know why you didn't want me to vote we filed suit against secretary of state county\nAnd she won big\nBut what feels bad is that more than half a million voters remain on the purge list we

sixteen documentary titled the best democracy money can buy\nYou are doing Brian Kemp as well Greg palace to explain what you found and why are stealing him\nWell you're the one answer my question so he's going to have to answer them in the federal court there's a follow up to my Rolling Stone to thousands sixteen\nInvestigation uh we're suing him and I say we including a civil rights organization to find out why he's remove three hundred and forty thousand one hundred thirty for Georgians on supposedly the evidence that they've left the state\nOr left their county and they are in there are still in their home registration address is they haven't left to talk to a third of a million people\nIf these people show up to vote a on a November six they're going to find that they canceled they'll be ended a provisional ballot but it won't be counted this is huge and the the list are\nAnd for my other investigations I was able to get inside his uh his operation and get the some of the purge list before\nIt's quite an ugly operation I'd never seen a purge operation this why this big and this one thing that Stacey Abrams was mentioned during the debate it's not just the fifty three thousand names pending it's three hundred and forty thousand people\nHeard that is their registration have been canceled that's why we're in court with the voting rights groups and to get the information on exactly why these people were wrong me removed\nAnd grand you are a veteran of visit this issue voter suppression and various on a national elections I think back to\nKatherine Harris

Ohio during the two thousand four elections we've heard about Chris called back in Kansas and now camp\nIn Georgia this this secretary of state position rarely gets a lot of attention\nBut when it comes to election time it's a key position isn't it\nWell that's one thing that's not very well understood it's very very dangerous for Brian Kemp\nTo be in charge of the vote while he's running for governor as you said for example Kris Kobach also secretary of state and got another story coming up is closing up and moving polling stations where voters of color can't get those stations\nWhere nationalism is on the rise in the country but so is you know violence around nationalism ethnic nationalism white nationalism\nSo in a way this is drawing back on that twenty sixteen uh twenty sixteen strategy which was quite effective for him which is a rallying cry to all of these people around the country this base that put him in office\nThat elected him at a time when in the midterms are in the midterms where he is really pushing a a culture war strategy and reviving a culture where\nBy being at the other interesting point is that he's reviving it at a moment where Steve Bannon is no longer officially a associated with his uh with the White House with the Trump Administration\nSo it does tell you that the you know those ties are still there but so is that ideology that's pulling through um it's a message again to the base that I'm here for you I stand for you I support your agenda it's also a warning\nFor those outside in a way of alienating other people as outsiders and uh it's Donald Trump's way of saying I'm president of the people but not those people\nAnd that's all kind of said that the Florida gubernatorial candidate the Democrat Andrew Gillum was targeted by a racist robocall paid for by a white supremacist group Galen aiming to Florida first black governor the clippings or a ... a real warning it is extremely raised\nThem [noise]\nAnd it says that moving truck candidate Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum responding to these racist robocalls on CNN\nI Want to make sure that we don't racialized\nAnd frankly weaponize raised as a part of this process which is why I called on my opponents to really work to rise above some of these things I'm a ... people are taking their cues from him from his campaign in from Donald Trump and we and we saw in Charlottesville but that could lead to real or frankly dangerous outcome\nLater right regarding your final comments on the climate right now\nWell the races that are indicative of a much broader and I I Am in some ways much more dangerous climate um that really\nTied back to a really ties back to the Trump Administration and the emergence of you know a really the emergence of a much broader identity that is tied to nationalism or racial\nAgainst people that have wholly tie themselves to Donald Trump proudly tied themselves to Donald Trump and Donald Trump's agenda\nSo really what we're gearing up for it is a showdown between you know does the Trump effect still stand this a one way of approaching Paul attacks or this exclusion area way of uh X. approaching a national politics and local and state politics or is\nThere another way is there is there a way that is\nBuilt on alliances and coalitions that is inclusive and is about expanding the boundaries of democracy so that all American citizens count\nWe want to thank you for being with us the lay right we're gr professor at the Kennedy School of government at Harvard University she's the author of the loneliness of the

has more than Thirteen thousand voters compared to an average of\nTwelve hundred voters for polling site and other locations we're joined now by Johnny Depp lap where the Kansas Democratic Party and joining us from dodge city welcome to democracy now tell us what happened\nAh so this is really a one more a sitting in a larger longer problem a way back in two thousand two\nIt's been that way since and that one polling place was in the uh more affluent white part of town um and dodge city is pretty clearly divided between like a all white or then part of town on the on the Hispanic southern part of town [noise]\nUm so this move or the polling location\nIs is really just taking a fall ready bad situation and making it worse because\nUh it's moved the polling location outside of town a so it's convenient for no one um\nAnd when you can pay when you combine that with a historic turn out of Seventeen percent for the un has a Hispanic population is sixty one percent turnout for the white population a and then you look at uh our elected officials ah every seat we have except for the kind of commission has had large\nSo our city commission our I'm a school board or our community college

Latino population but it's not the only place in the mid west throughout\nA Iowa and Kansas and Nebraska\nAre there's been a huge difference in the last Twenty years of solid Latino population is mostly as a result of\nThe importation of Mexican labor for the meatpacking industry because you talk about that\nI'm not sure uh so in in ... specifically a that influx began in the late seven\nA dodge city it's it's one of the uh cornerstones of our economy around here and uh those be packing plants have historically recruited folks from\nA um a point south to ah to come here and live and work and so what we have now is a second third generation Americans who have only ever voted in one polling place and don't know that it could be better\nAnd what the what the reason the city clerk gift card that the law and policy but forget about the fact that it's already over burden given the uh the voting population but they're moving out side of the city limits to a place where you can't even get there by public transportation\nWell so uh it's it's a county clerk to the county clerk I'm I met with her in may I'm I'm a late may\nOr to them or you know ask her to increase the number of polling places and this is not the first time I've met with uh our county clerk\nI'm an ... and her predecessor in several times in an effort to convince them to have more going places and the excuses that she gives for only having one polling place frankly don't hold water I mean one of them is she said well it's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "city": "Middletown", "day": "24"}
