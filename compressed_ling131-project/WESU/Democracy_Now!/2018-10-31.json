the face of the devastating rhetoric and dreads Scott continue to wage a campaign for citizenship into what then become the era of the civil\nWar I'm sure you found as a historian teaching at a university\nHow little knowledge there is of history and when you refer just in Dred Scott\nExplain who he is and it's crusading attempt to challenge that then how um the amendment comes out of what this perhaps the most recent decision of the U.S Supreme Court but it came out of activism it came out of dreads scotch bravery who was the\nI'm Scott isn't and slave man in the city of St Louis Missouri\nI'm his case arises because in the company of his owner Scott travels to free territory I'm among those places Minnesota\nAnd the claim had long been that person who um were held slaves but regarded and freeze soil became free themselves now Scott\nI'm living in the Minnesota Territory he meets his wife Harriet um they begin to have a family they marry and then finally they return to St Louis where they are still held slaves\nAnd by the early Eighteen fifty I think they are concerned that um they might be sold that their family might be separated um they're always at risk a slave to people and they began what is it do you explain a series of freedom suits um a tireless effort\nTo secure the freedom for themselves and for their two daughters\n... of course on their chief justice Roger Tony I'm now notorious Le Pen and opinion on that on deprived the Scott family of doing their freedom claims in the federal court\nUm but as importantly um make sure that no African American

adopted and the and the intention of all Congress or are in the ... with the passage of the fourteenth amendment\n... so\nI'm African Americans are going to be um among the first to attempt to volunteer\nI'm In the civil war era to serve and to support the union army on their view is that this is an extension of their long quest for citizenship\nThat military service service to the nation is capacity might further open the door or make their case I'm for their status citizens\nOn the thirteenth amendment as we know an aging sixty five will abolish slavery but\nThe thirteenth amendment does not comment on the status of African American before the law for the constitution is still an unresolved question and the campaign to the fourteenth amendment it precisely designed to respond to that long campaign that African Americans have\nA wage it is to um resolve the kinds of ambiguity the kinds of dangers the kinds of ... the former slave face without a resort to the status their status as citizens and so in Eighteen sixty eight um after Congress has um promulgated\nAll persons born in the United states are citizens of the United states is a remedy a radical remedy to bring millions of former slaves into the body politic\nBut it is written in a way that gives it a lasting and enduring effect which is to make every person regardless of race and I may say regardless of religion regardless of dissent regardless of political affiliation make every person born in the United states that have been of the United states\nBut now during the debate over the fourteenth amendment 'cause there are some or a relatively small number of scholars who support the viewpoint of Trump's the or\nThe birthright citizenship husband incorrectly or or interpreted a book that but even then in the debate wasn't there a debate as to whether this list a amendment would spend to people who were or\nOr where the children born here all immigrants\nImmigrants are not what troubled Congress um during the fourteenth amendment debate um what Congress is concerned about when it comes out an exception to the fourteenth amendment for people not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states what Congress is concerned about are three things\nI'm One of the children of foreign diplomats to might\nAh incidentally be born in the United states the fourteenth amendment does not make them birthright citizenship\nCongress anticipate um the possibility that the U.S would be occupied by a foreign army and in that case the children of soldiers a foreign army would not be birthright citizenship even if they were born in the United states\nThe third category of person um who Congress is mindful of our Native American and here um we're in an era where native communities\nUm and Congress does not on it your fear or impose on that sovereignty by wholesale demonizing native people us citizens that will happen later in the twentieth century\nBut it just said that no Congress has not thinking about um what day we might term an authorized or illegal immigrants [noise] um but it does carve out an exception for persons who are said to be not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and this is the language that I'm a President Trump\nAnd others have seized upon um as they have looked to constrain or ... tale the effect of the fourteenth amendment\nWell you know when we were covering the protests around the killing of Michael Brown a few years ago and florists and diving you are in Ferguson, Missouri just a few miles down that same road is the cavalry cemetery where dreads got was a buried\n'em but I wanted to go beyond the Dred Scott and talk about other cases I you look at and birthright citizenship and so I wanted to ask you about one Kim arc that Chinese American cook who was born in San Francisco and Eighteen Seventy three at the center of a major but often overlook Supreme Court decision regarding birthright citizenship\nUnited States versus ... tell us what the court cases about who won came our was and why it matters today\nSo I'm One Kmart is essential for understanding where we are today because he is\nI'm a son of Chinese immigrants born in the city of San Francisco um he appears to be a birthright did it then I think regard themselves as such even his his parents are not eligible to naturalized 'em by what become the terms of of the Chinese exclusion act\nSo one Kim ark\nA tree in the early Eighteen nineties and when he attempts to return at the port of San Francisco he like many other people have Chinese descent is detained at the port\nAnd is charged with being a non did it and I'm of the United states why um because of this curious language and the fourteenth amendment about being subject to the jurisdiction of the United states\nThe argument on behalf of customs officials goes that a a Chinese American born in the U.S to non citizen parents I'm In like his parents I'm Still\nHolding an allegiance to the emperor of China I'm Still far and even if he was born on us soil and one Kim arc must take his claim to US citizenship all the way to the U.S Supreme Court\nThey're an Eighteen Ninety eight the court will examine the fat will return to the fourteenth amendment\nAnd conclude unequivocally that long Kim arc despite the fact that his parents are not eligible for US citizenship he himself by virtue of his birth in San Francisco is that it's been and has the right among other things to come and go at well\nLet's go to vice president Mike Pence speaking to Politico on Tuesday\nHuman rights groups are also alarmed over must not us past comments about women in algae Beatty community he wants to throw the female lawmaker she was too ugly to rape you also said he would rather hear that his son had died in a car crash then learn his son is gay for more we're joined by two guests Bruno talk to her\nAs a journalist and photographer founder and editor of studio fluke so an independent media outlet based in Sao paolo Brazil he also founded the Brazilian digital collective uh media ninja\nJames Green is professor Brazilian history and culture at Brown university past president of the ... billion studies association here in the United states\nMost of democracy now burned I talked to let's begin with you in Sao paolo your response to the election of both NATO who won like quite a margin well why and like anything\nWell it's a hard to overstate Amy the significance of his election to such a young and fragile democracy such as ours are I think he won for several reasons is very difficult to\nPinpoint just a single one but I think is the result of many many years of a criminal station of the political class in Brazil or this is a long time\nComing aids uh started a with that being a operation\nThat the police the federal police and the tribute Cherie\nUh did in Brazil are but the fact is a mini Paul this coming by the political establishment couldn't believe it was possible I'm most so NATO also a reporter and uh the military dictatorship\n... in the country which is which is pretty pretty strong\nBut I also have to say something that not many people who are um put on the table which there is a ... a psychology things are happening here in\nBrazil there is the fact that they left in Brazil it's being criminalize and demonize for quite a while so both ... results of many many things\nSo the impact of the Brazil elections which did not get a whole lot of coverage here in the United states on Latin America and really the ... a democracy is across the the the world because people forget Brazil is the\nFifth largest country in the world and population it's got more people than Russia or Japan or and so what happens in Brazil really has a big impact\nOf certainly across Latin America because it represents a about half of all the south America's population\nI think that the election and Brazil reflects the international trend that we've been following\nIn Russia in the Philippines and Poland and Hungary in the United states and conservative governments have come to power in Chile and Argentina and by the way a and the boats and other government which I Would consider worse than\nThe Trump Administration is probably going to be a implementing a series of extremely reactionary changes to the country which will see a decline in the standard of living of ordinary people working class people\nIn addition to attacking the environments are tearing up international agreements a divorce seeing the Amazon region and a challenging the Democratic rights of eligibility community the women the black moving in Brazil all of which have been fighting for the last\nThirty years for full a democratic rights in the country\nI mean here in this country I think I'm a a report that something like Seventy five percent of the Brazilian eight ex patriots around three quarters of the Brazilian expatriates voted for\nUm voted for both to NATO that former army captain and pray that the military dictatorship attacks gays attacks women on a and then talk about the issue do explain this professor grain\nSo that there's no question that there is\nProblem is solution to increase violence criminality as to arm all citizens\nOr his solution to a criticism by human rights activists of the police excessive violence is to\nEliminate any investigation of a police when they go into a community and shoot to kill 'em in this regard I think immigrants people who've left the country and other momentum um\nFall into the category of those in Brazil who are listening to a these ideas of both ... and I do have and hoping that they will solve very complex problems are with his simple solutions\nUm the community and it's very diverse in this country I think there are a large number of Brazilians who have been very consistently supporting the fight for democracy in Brazil that have been very vocal about they do remain a minority of the community in this in the United states\n\nOr have you done a he's not the president a yet but if you follow the last a couple of a couple of\nDays here in Brazil they radiate violent attacks on ... you know people in a in a D. or Amazon and the fact is that this man made his political career on your side\nI have three we changed the oppression of them\nI'm I'm started 'cause I'm studying a lot the pressure of the um\n[noise] uh\nAnd the minorities in the country and he owned leashed he authorized the military police in Brazil which is very uh I'm I'm ideological or so or\nAct even if he's not getting the proper um\nOrder so it's going to be hard you know it's gonna be hard it was in a something that was them\nClear and these dark aspect of the Brazilian I spirits a won the election so um it's going to take a lot of\nA organization and a lot of support from the international community\nYou know how to pay for an hour people recognize than liberals zero to stop that we're not how are people organizing to criminalize all does anything in Brazil\nYeah yeah he's saying that he's saying this for quite a while he's saying that he or putting prison kill or\nSoon ... the uh he's a opposition and he said that he ... final stop on all kind of a after this I'm\nSo people are starting to reorganize and we don't know yet what\nOur a response will uh be\nYesterday there was the first peaceful protest or to say that we won't tender and there was a lot of police brutality hearing from Palo there are people who are arrested people who're\nIt Perry police has become an ideological ... a a an ideological ... militia and gave a lot of reports through his election and you know it's gonna be hard times I'm wearing an
