they are and where I think four or five blocks professors and that was essentially at in terms of Harvard law school staff and the students at the time were really um\nFor more diversity and faculty\nAnd so they were protest outside of the meeting where Warren was hired and students were were were very pleased at the end of the day when we're when word came out that they had higher Elizabeth Warren a woman but the students were interviewed at the time by the Hartford Clinton's or friends and\nSo they were they were upset that it was a white woman why not hire you know a black woman or an Asian woman or a Hispanic woman on this was a debate that was going on in the campus and the student activists who are most attuned to it\nYes they were pleased that um there was a little bit more gender diversity with Warren's higher\nBut they were still angry that a woman of color hadn't been hired so I mean to me that also says you know if she was pushing this as a reason to get hired she definitely wasn't doing a very good job\nBut I think you if if you could just say a again just to clarify the exact uh a year and institutions in which Elizabeth Warren identified herself a Native American because it's you know her critics point out that uh\nIf she didn't do it to a non ... self professionally why did she do it at all and that you know even if her family were was speaking to her about her heritage what reason did she have in the moment that she decided to declare that on official documents\nYeah this is where it gets complicated for war and so if you take at that that if you if you accept that she did not um got ahead because of this the ... the question though is when she was at the University of Pennsylvania from I Believe it was eighty seven to nine to five I'm I might be a little long on that\nThanks very unusual wishes she'd go she has her um ethnicity code changed in the University of Pennsylvania's HR system\nThat does something for me in the University of Pennsylvania it allows them to report that they have a more diverse faculty than they have and the University of Pennsylvania like all major institutions was under pressure to hire 'em diverse and have diverse faculty is so\nShe does is for some reason um she does the same thing at Harvard so when she was later hired at Harvard you know of course your age are foreigners don't transfer from one university to the next she has to refill them all out\nAnd I'm about two years after she got the job offer at Harvard and a good three or four months after she started working at Harvard and Ninety five\nUm you also saw 'em I all the talking documentary evidence that her um ethnicity coat and changes to Native American and that sort of ... started reporting to the federal government that they have a Native American law professor staff\nSo in both instances she didn't proactively make a change\nThat changed was used by these two institutions to argue hey look we're we're not as bad as it may steam diversity wise because we do have this professor who was Native American I'm Still\n... you know that certainly complicated for her you know I I'm I Am sure about that and you don't have\nI don't have a satisfying answer from her about why she did it I mean she says to this day she doesn't does not specifically remember making those changes and she says that she thought back to that time in her life\nThat her on the matriarch of her family her her ... her mother and her mother sisters\nJust what so what she's saying to me is that she kind of felt this said that she spent her own growing pride in her roots that at the same time if you think about her life\nYou know she grew up in Oklahoma she went to law school she went to um graduated from school and in Texas and now all of a sudden she sort of thrust for the first time the ivy league environment and her\nSort of character is to sort of\nDouble down on on her own who she is rather than kind of try to fit in 'em\nAt these institutions so I think that's part of it I mean I talked to people at the University of Pennsylvania who would say that she liked to identify as an ... I wouldn't use that word a lot and so you know her explanation really is that this was sort of an expression of\n... the identity that she was trying to to put out in the world but you know I think it's a fair criticism when you look at how these universities or using that statistic and particularly Harvard which was so completely lily white at the time ... was arguing that hey look\nHave a diverse stuff because we have as it turns out this woman Elizabeth Warren who's Native American\nDon't let me go back to an old Harvard Crimson the university paper or to law school spokesman tells the Harvard credit than in Nineteen Ninety six of Seventy one current law school professors and assistant professor is eleven or women five or black one is Native American and one is Spanish\nUm that's where the list but Warren being that one Native American uh crimson editorial from Nineteen Ninety eight refers to warrant at the law schools one tenured minority women\nOn political also reports that a Ninety seven Fordham Law review piece described her as Harvard law school's first woman of color any Lenski\nYeah I mean that's a problem\nHow Elizabeth Warren as a woman of color and if you are the contacts at the time was is really interesting um it's [laughter]\nI mean at Harvard in Nineteen Ninety three when Elizabeth Warren was hired had not hired a single woman of color at to their their faculty they had not hired a single person there was an and they were having two hundred year\nHistory no woman of color was hired and that didn't change um I didn't tell I Believe Ninety seven or Ninety eight um I Will say when they did make they're finally an African Im they hired an African American woman however\nDid make an enormous deal about it um but I you know I think that this is where the problem cotton is Harvard\nWas out there now without their touting her as Native American I Will say the University of Pennsylvania I took a very different approach I took I talked to the tea in there and about this and he was like no no no we were\nWe were not going to do that you know if it was with Warren wanting to be Native American on our rules on our statistics that's fine but there is no way we're we're going to walk out and\n... and suggest that she was a Native American law professor so that to University of took a very different approach\nBut I you know a lot of her critics of the critics of of her decision to come out as Native Americans a day that\nUh she basically her presence of these universities sanctioned the universities allowed them to not hire a other Native Americans because they had one is that true is that what you learned\nThink that's where it gets problematic for her I mean that has not been a criticism that's been leveled I think when she was going into a Democratic primary I'm with a you know Cory Booker Kamala Harris and with us\nAfter that very question she says that she knows she did it was doing a lot of work to promote women and to promote minority hires but I think that that is where it becomes more problematic to for her because her allowing Harvard in particular to use her\nUm do you use it and that's what they claim I'm you know if you look at the statistics they they were they were arguing internally oh we're doing much better um uh with minority status and\nYou know than than our own measurements want us to be doing and so sort of internally they were saying oh we're doing fine externally Harvard was still saying we need to we need to do better for the most part [laughter] so yeah I mean that is I think that as an area that that's going to be really complicated\nFinally on Lenski you've been speaking to a Senator Warren a ah after she released to be a DNA test and the video\nAnd you've spoken to her husband Bruce men about the effects of what this has meant a and you've covered the response to the release of the DNA test yeah\nYeah yeah and I have and it's that's it's been a fascinating um the day is really um I you know it was I'm a\nBig surprise I think to many people that Elizabeth Warren was willing to kind of undergo this DNA test\nAnd and do it and put the result out there um I think it's a little early to know what the impact of it's going to be on her political future but I also think I mean she is a bit of her arraigned and questioned on this for more than a year and her approach to this is\nIn a historic figure and making that into somehow was for um her behavior is less crew but it still problematic and it's still a completeness understanding of what I native identity actually is\nAnd it perpetuates the mess that so many people hold I mean you live on the east coast than you hear almost everyone having the story of being part Cherokee on their mother's side\nUm when there are real tricky people who still live today and we should respect that and understand her native people really are\nI'd like to bring in a mock a John from Anchorage, Alaska\nOne had released had taken a DNA test and released it could you explain what you are a problem with this is your criticism\nWell the dentist itself is just another use of a colonial narrative basically it uh the ultimate goal of a DNA test is to prove that Indians are immigrants like everybody else\nAnd it's a again it takes away from the idea that there's a tribal community with a governing\nInstitution that's been around before the United states and there are reasons the tribes are around with ten thousand your history is in North America\nCan you explain what you mean by that uh that that the DNA tests that they have to prove that ah indigenous people a Native Americans are immigrants like everyone else why\nHaven't all bear a who's written quite a bit about this is talk about that that that\nIs basically coming up with a a a narrative that says a used and figure out where folks came from originally and trying to figure that out rather than to connect with the stories\nI mean a shiny bad I for example one of the things that just a I Love about my own people is that if you look at the history of North America we once has hunted messed it on and you think about that is an arc of history that goes back\nMany generations that is much deeper than a test that you can use\nAnd you even suggested ... that a ... thing how DNA tattoo kind of qualified\nTo be president\nOr could you explain that\nI mean campaigns are about stories and what story are going to tell about yourself and I'm here we are three weeks less than three weeks away from an extraordinary election and we're talking about this instead of the extraordinary election I think just from a strategic point of view that makes no sense\n... and I have you watched that I'm from the north west Jaffe and talk about your response to that not only um to Senator Warren doing the DNA test in all the way she has very slowly represented herself\nBut also Donald Trump on ... and his comments to ... continually right through this week talking about Pocahontas\nI'm banking and good morning thank you for having all of us um it's good to be on this very esteem panel um you know I I had a few reaction number one is one concerning the media generally\nAnd it would be nice to have quote unquote native stories native themes stories that weren't centered on white people um that something that's very common whether you're talking about Hollywood dances with wolves little big man\nOr Elizabeth Warren every single time we've seen native and mass media it's in response to white people doing something really really stupid or saving our community\nAnd uh that's a false narrative and so it wouldn't be nice to see our our communities that are that are actually pushing ... on an amazing recovery\nUm relationship to economics in relationship to education in relationship to language I'm actually have ... centered around this story as opposed to around the white person and the native people being collateral to that white person I'm also\nReaction is that um you know Elizabeth Warren obviously she wants to be an ally\nBut she doesn't want to be an accomplice meaning that she feeling they're willing to make native people political fodder for her own political survival as more pointed out you have native women\nI'm Better running historic numbers and doing historic things in this particular two thousand an Eighteen election Sharif David in Kansas their bow in in\nWe're in the white women want then or the Indian narrative is made of narrative in politics around her as opposed to going out and campaigning for them two weeks in advance of the two thousand and they in elections and me and to me that does make me question her judgment\nWhen we do for that we raise we um you know condemn\nDonald Trump or his emotion analogy and his competitor was new and unpredictability was she dug the Maury Povich wipe spectacle revealing her DNA results as opposed to doing the actual work of a leader\nYou mentioned Jesse ... Powell and I want to turn to what she said the Democratic candidate for Congress in New Mexico who could become the first native woman to serve in Congress she tweeted this week\nSenator Elizabeth Warren DNA test confirms the family history she has long shared with the world\nAnd I acknowledge her native ancestry is testament to who we are as Americans the oppression that native people of experienced over the course of our history caused many native\nAmerican family to deny their heritage language and culture and I understand why this with the case with her family Senator Warren has been a sister in the struggle for years for indigenous people's rights and for all of us who weren't born into the top one percent\nThe revelation of Senator Warren ... Native American ancestry is significant for her personally and I joined her and celebrating her ancestry ah\nIs the code of the Native American a congressional candidate democratic candidate in New Mexico who could well be come I'm the first\nA Native American a ... a Congress member your response to what she says Jesse\nCongresswoman she was ... it\nAnd I believe that her insurance ... coal occupy that title\nWonderful event for United States politics in the United states history generally\nFor um for you know Congress woman how and that is they typically gracious and amazingly brilliant response and absolutely I'm sure she does celebrate just like all of us cool if you want to be into the fold socially that's a beautiful thing you want to find out why you know this is the year of the native woman and\nI'm you know Elizabeth Warren evidently wanted to upgrade herself you know beyond the style\nBut that doesn't mean that requires these mobile Maury Povich like the ...\nIn which they do it and disrupt a slow where you native women are rightfully getting a lot of attention politically and a lot of resources politically and do this as opposed to doing the work it's an incredibly gracious and generous response from congresswoman Holland\nBut that doesn't mean that the timing is correct number one nor that it wasn't something that you know that she necessarily thought out or her people thought out properly\nAnd your response to Trump sang he'll give her a million dollars that she and take the DNA catching now saying you know I never said anything like that [noise]\nFrom the pig I mean he's a liar so that shouldn't surprise us I think both of them for making native ancestry into a spectacle\nInto a three ring circus in which non natives and specifically white people by the way I feel completely emboldened to\nTo posit their opinions and actually challenge native people about native ancestry Elizabeth Warren and Donald Trump both open that door and so I Believe that both of them should donate a million dollars to the national Indian women's resource center\nAnd um you know because both of them helped create the spectacle and both of them have an obligation to native women I Believe\nWe're going to break and come back to that discussion or where talking to\nJack the raw author lawyer and endurance lack of the nation\nAnd mark ... hand as Indian editor of Indian country today speaking to us from Anchorage, Alaska that says democracy now backing them and that will you read a few middle\nAnd high everybody I Want you to hear about a remarkable man\nOut during a Seventy nine year old with severe ... and spinal to know says who has been walking for immigrant everyday to point two miles since January twenty fifth on October twenty first\nHis two hundred and Seventy five consecutive day walking on his neighborhood streets we are sponsoring walking with out for immigrants in America the walk will begin at the ... federal building for fifty main street Hartford\nAt two PM and will proceed to six locations before ending with a peaceful rally at the federal building this will be an introspective family oriented event focused on the unity of diversity please join us on October twenty first", "show_name": "Democracy Now!", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "18"}
