basis\nDave welcome back to democracy now she joined us from Colorado can you talk about what do you understand\nHappened at ... sure\nMuch bigger than a than was predicted and I think it really caught the air force off guard so for decades what the air force has done and also the navy and and the army and Marines who all have their their own aircraft uh\nWhat they've done when one of their their airfields is in harm's way is a fire up the planes and fly them off to safety in this case at temple they flew\nUm most of their after twenty twos to an air force base in Ohio a and that works if you can get your plane started but the EPA twenty sue is a\nVery sophisticated and somewhat finicky plane and a\nQuarter an Airforce reports only about half of them are missing ready at any one time and so with only a couple of days' notice of this impending storm\nOr they weren't able to get you know step of wear hearing Seventeen planes I'm going and so they they put them in hangers on the base and and they uh\nThey hope for the best and the best did not happen or when hurricane Michael hit the coast it hit directly on ten dull air force base\nAnd the when there were measured up to one hundred thirty miles an hour before the bases a wind speed measuring equipment broke so we really don't know how ferocious storm really was but afterwards the base was flattened\nOr many of its hangers had uh their rules ripped off a buildings were flooded uh I I think the air force or you know in its assessing the saying that base it's almost a complete loss\nAnd these planes that were left behind the air force as being very careful about what it says without it but the but they say that that many of them are damaged\nMany of these believe to be what's happening teen ...\nWhich is worse just somewhere around five point eight\nA one point five billion by the Air Force's estimation so these these planes are are literally irreplaceable and also just add a tremendous cost\nI mean you think about that President Trump has been talking about a caravan of immigrants coming up from Honduras making its way through Mexico talking about is a threat to national security if people learned that there was an air force base on the southern border that was almost leveled that\nPerhaps Seventeen of vets leading on a jet fighter plane just droid um people who did that who is the enemy um in

have a airfield down on the coast in the southeastern United States\nHere in Florida where the governor denies climate change you're in a land where the president denied climate change what do you say to them I'm\nAbout to say look around and look at the science sometimes people tell you things politically to be ex radio but\nIf if if there's a one percent chance the human activity has contributed
