price of these boilers\nHundreds of thousands of dollars worth of boilers\nThe man who sold Fred Trump these boilers Leon Eastman I'm a told me in an interview that one day he comes back to his office

county building supply would turn around and would send an envoy to Fred Trump for the very same boilers but the invoices padded marked up twenty thirty fifty percent more\nSo all it was doing it was
