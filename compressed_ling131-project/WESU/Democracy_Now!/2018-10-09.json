... or something of fake news especially on watching that that is not controlled\nFor example Facebook has so close to ever accounts that were spreading fake news I'm Dan ... and again that the candidate for vice president ... uh\nSo you know all the Stephen Bannon is one of the advisors for both on that\nA photo on Twitter of him with former Trump strategist Steve Bannon\nEduardo Balter NATO wrote quote it was a pleasure to meet the van and strategist in Donald Trump's presidential campaign we had a great conversation and we share the same worldview and we're certainly in touch to join forces especially against cultural Marxism and the significance of what Eduardo himself joy or son\nYes exactly and uh\nWell I think that they think for them to understand that to the meeting birthday was foot train for them but that did the progressive candidate as far left but when he was the mayor of follow\nActually what he did was to build a several daycares and more than thirty hospital and uh he tried to make the traffic and the the the batter\nFor example have the infrastructure for bike when he was the ministry of education under the Lula administration is he created more than a chain new federal university to more than three home their new a camper through the university campuses\nAnd there there was much more um incentives and a\nA fellowship for ah education at all levels so you know he comes from an educational backgrounds\nAnd uh it's a you know he doesn't come from any type of a cream lab backgrounds and so what we have now is a very extreme fasting candidates\nRunning against a moderate candidates and that to an hour holds now is that to three other candidates progressive candidates have said then that would support financial dads and now in the runoff election in a few weeks so hopefully\nWell because those progressive granted is to gather ... probably got about twenty percent of the food and ah if they are able to convince people that do business as dangerous bad\nAnd the the challenge is how do we deal with neither manipulate them not just mainstream me there but the ... the manipulation of social media\nI wanted to go to Noam Chomsky who just recently went to Brazil um he met with ... in print and on and when he came out a chunky condemned Brazil's right wing media\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo that the world renowned linguist than political activists Noam Chomsky as we wrap up and leading into this run off the significance of the media and shaping up a popular opinion in Brazil\nThat's very important because so during that was straight up and do more with Dr Jackson example unemployment rate for corporate fan than I was Fifteen Percent or so of course you know that is an economic crisis and their weddings that are ah\nA new thing than to have to fear and that creates space for fastest candidate like both on that\nSo the question is how the because they're they're left wing party has already announced and going to unite the unite the for the second round the question is how the neo liberal parties and the\nLet's say the mainstream culture which if pot isn't that a\nThan our input maintain try to adjust to them and Paul if there's how let's say the main stream called server to neo liberal parties would ban\nWhat was it stays on they're going to me because it's a risk of this season to support a far ride faster candidates so I think that's the main question\nWell money all the way some and don't want to thank you so much for being with us director of the network for social justice and human rights and first tell the democracy now when we come back we go to Manchester, England\nTo speak with Dr Kevin Anderson about a new un climate were pork as a monster hurricane bearing down on the panhandle and Florida\nAnd the Alabama governor declares the whole state an emergency stay with us [noise]\nThis is W E s you idiot for one of them but community service of Washington University law emerged dirty before Russia's first station aren't there more than Seventy years ago\nEnergy move play out in terms of a whole suite of different more extreme weather conditions that whether this particular publication\nIs um it's caused by climate change isn't possible decide what is often the ties as we are exhausted by increasing the the power in these harkens in these extreme weather events on the ... what we call the funds who I was a tradition\nWhere we're trying to say is this have been a climate change if I were getting better with the understanding that uncertainty this quarter but most of evidence now this is just that some of them will recent severe weather conditions we're seeing are being seriously exacerbated\nBy the additional warming we're putting the atmosphere from a burning of fossil fuels on the release of calm dogs on the wall so I Can't comment on this particular topic and it's like this how it can\nThe only um has been exacerbated by issues of climate change by our burning of fossil fuels on the enemy joined this should be making that clear link when they make them into discussing these issues and during the during the weather forecast within the u._s.\nYou talk about what's needed professor Anderson the report says there's no documented hit star precedent for the scale of change as required um you have a talked about a Marshall Plan what do you mean a new Marshall Plan\n... well the Marshall Plan was the um the to deliberate strategy after the second World War to trying to reconstruct Europe after being nosy very severely bones and destroyed\nUm both institutionally but mostly physically during the war so I'm saying that that is probably the newest miss a fool and knowledge that we have to the scale of challenge that we actually face the compromise to shift away from fossil fuel based\nEnergy system to zero carbon energy system and to do that within\nWithin the wealthy parts of the world really within about two decades I'm probably three or four enough that guy with a slightly poorer parts of the world\nSo we're not going to do that through a small price mechanisms through just tweaking the market it is going to be ... to change it intervention by governments to make the necessary rates of change now that sounds initially ... very I'm very challenging and suddenly will be but I think there was also I\nAnd there was a positive narrative behind this in this this transition this transformation\nTo zero Kelvin and uses them will come with lots of job opportunities a loan to secure job opportunities not just in building a low carbon power stations but in the massive electrification program that will be necessary in ... in retrofitting in other words making our existing building infrastructure which we'll we'll still be using for the next\nTwenty thirty forty years the ...\nSo if we bomb it to be in the climate continues to change which is undoubtedly will um ... even if we stopped to missions to the what we're seeing some ongoing climate change\nYou have criticized the eyepiece tasty for constraining its policy advice to fit neatly within the current economic model can you explain I mean for some type of a landmark report like this is simply critical because we live in a country in the United states where the precedent proudly\nDeny its climate change you know calls it a client at Chinese hoax\nOn and so had any kind of report like that but you're critic of the report in some respects\nCertainly well so I think is a really good report and trying to understand the impacts between one point five and two degrees centigrade of warming when it comes to what we have to do about it I think again it runs skate a really being very honest\nAnd given that how it is effectively a scientific report I think our role with a scientist and academics is to tell it like it is not to color is all sweets in the pill to make it more attractive so\nMy comments have all of it and there's no justice report they shouldn't be painted come out to the hype ACC there was a coin direct and honest about the impact side when it comes to what we have to do about it we ... we don't want to scare the politicians or the public we don't want to um\nMove away from this is all the energy systems that we have today so we always try to bully bullies massage the status quo incremental changes if you're like what I'm saying is that actually when you really look at the numbers behind the report look at the numbers the science comes out with then we're talking about\nA complete revolution and the energy system and that is going to be very fundamental questions about how we run our economies\nAnd again you can to him and said well not seen as just as you know ... to\n... out front and removed from the county economic system we have but we have to remember it's only being was ten years now\nStruggle and within his own remiss if you like but I think this has been a real opportunity which will not losing to reshape the economy there was an economy that suitable for the ... the ... the the suitable for the economy and I think the policy make the academics\nI'm just runs scared of this uh being honest about ... on numbers tell us about the rates of change that we will that we require\nAnd how we have to move the productive capacity of our society from building second homes for professors or private jet so private you'll so large four wheel drive cars moving from that to building public transport electrification improved homes for everyone so it's a it's a shift about productive capacity the resources on the ...\nFrom the if you like the luxury for the twenty percent\nTo the essential low carbon infrastructure the oldest\nDr Anderson the effect of Trump polling the west side of the Paris Agreement we just had a segment on British jail\nThe front runner Jerry ... who are gas called U.S Open fashion that extremely far right wing candidate um has promised um that he will pull out of the Paris Agreement as well and would abolish Brazil's ministry of environment\nWhich environmentalist fear would lead to deforestation has the Amazon your thoughts on both both NATO and Trump\n\nPlenty from a scientific perspective and I would also argue believe are mobile perspective by all completely 'em out to chew with walked on now is is is saying\nOh it was so we have to be very careful when we see these extreme figures on both of these I think of a sudden the extreme figures remember that they are a little bit of noise on the system the the the the general trend line is more recognition to climate change is a serious issue even the poll data in the states shows they are not indict different Brazil's so I'm not sure\nBut ... so we are seeing climate change advance and people off thinking this is an important issue because some of our times not always the ...\nI Want to hear that message and I think the rest of us should not scared of\nThem we just have to double redouble our efforts\nI think they win and President Trump\nIs either to put out the\nParis Agreement which of course he can't do yes anyway ... plans to than the Chinese and the French stepped forward and say well we will try and doing some make some extra effort to compensate\nAnd we also said the U.S many ... sang the climate change is still an important issue to the U.S has nothing to do is not a dictatorship chunk cannot take tight ... population to the U.S and it's going to do a call ... both an uneasy influential but so all the mayor's so it is incumbent on the rest of us there are more informed by the science and I would argue with a more\nReasoned moan and progressive a groundswell analysis and it's up to us to redouble our efforts\nAnd make sure that we move and the right direction and not to run the scared of of the Trump service well there are plenty of them they will come and they will go but the overall issue of climate change the physics of climate change is here to stay regardless of the time frame who wins\nOver the occasional presidents and in this last minute what\nDoes the future look like a how bad can and things get if we person said on this course\n\nOne of the way things are going at the moment I think it is quite reasonable to think we're getting about four degrees centigrade warming across the century that would be up to the devastating just remember the difference between now and an ice ages about five degrees\nSo we're talking about changes that would normally occur over probably tens of thousands of years ago but a little more than a hundred years\nAnd and the Hundred Years' in some respects sounds like a long time but many of the people listening to this that children will still be alive and hundred years and certainly their grandchildren will be a hundred years is just to move I really and so many respects and when the light looks in the infrastructure and what would the ... we will be saying find more funding from or famine\nDrought floods\nYou mean it just so I'm we'd say even if we look at Syria Syria claiming that he wasn't caused by climate change but the twelve years of drought in that region wasn't exacerbating front to not just one year of\nA one degree of moving as we had the was full of degrees centigrade a woman with children are breaking down many of the ecosystems of the world the polling nights are crooks but let me go actually for so this is a different planet of the ... from the woman which we live on\nThe titles that would ensue will be bad for our space for humans but also indeed of course many other species around the planet and that's why we have to do everything we can\nHold still ideally to to to send to grow the over three degrees centigrade know daily for one point five I think that's looking very challenging so let's let's do everything we can to keep the temperature as low as possible\nKevin understand we want to thank you
