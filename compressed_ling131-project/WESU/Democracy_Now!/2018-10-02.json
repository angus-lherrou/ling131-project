do this um because we felt that it was stunning to me that we as a community I Believe no so much about what was going on during the eighties and and perhaps party culture\nUm and that there are many graduates with the class of eighty three who were close to Brett\nBut who have not shown their faces they've not they've not spoken out about what was going on either in his defense or and Dr forests defense um and so I I I was stunned by that violence and felt we have to try to do something to to shake my classmates and my schoolmates up and get them to think\nThis is an opportunity for you to do the right thing and if it if if our little position and our drive to get them to speak um gets even one of them to say something then I I feel it's been a success\nAnd Bill Maher bowl or you were a freshman all when no Brett Kavanaugh was a senior at their school or did you uh how well did you know him and when you were to solve the testimony how does that jibe with your recollections of what he was like\nWell I didn't know Brett personally and I think it's important to note that I I don't consider myself a witness in this case in any way shape or form again I was a freshman and he was a senior he was a very big personality on campus he was a I'm a\nFootball player and he was kept on the basketball team it was hard in a roughly four hundred person school not to know who the real social leaders were\nUm even as a freshman um so I knew him and his crew more by reputation than personal observation um however it just struck me during his testimony that given what I Know about perhaps party culture in the eighties\nUm and knowing that he\nOpenly on his yearbook page about his protest\nUntoward or downright illegal could have happened when he was under the influence of alcohol and not just felt wrong to me and um I I Know that there are\nThere must be people who are closer to him closer in age and closer and and social commitment ... that have to know more about what was going on and I think we've been feeling out from his classmates and I would like to see that from his\nPrep class in Nineteen Ninety the Washington Post reported that hadn't mastered from seven prestigious Washington DC area private schools including yours Georgetown Prep and cabinet\nHad sent a letter to warn parents about a party culture among their children which included heavy drinking leading to quote sexual or violent behavior\nThe article quotes the headmaster at Holton arms saying quote a number of parents and can have a fresh dismay over some of the situations that we can parties were concerned\nAbout the potential for tragedy elbow can you respond to that on yeah I unfortunately\nIt wasn't a millionaire with that article when it was printed in in Nineteen Ninety I that was when I was graduating from college but what I read yesterday when it was first forwarded to me I'm\nShocked me in in some way because it was an acknowledgement on the part of the administrations of the schools that we all went to that there was a severe problem and it was a severe problem um but what is what a shocking and upsetting to me is that as I understand it not much institutionally\nHas been done to really put a stop to it and I know that there is a very very steep hill to climb for educators in managing teenage kids um I Know that as as a parent of a teenager myself my son's Seventeen um it's not easy for parents to get involved but I just feel like\nWow that was a long time ago and we're still fighting the states\nBe accepting of illegal behavior and dangerous behavior um and I I just wish that there was something more that that we could have done and the the twenty eight years plus that had transpired since um since that letter came out\nThat you have a close to Seventy named on this letter that you knew issue what do you hope to do with with it and what are you a hope ... are all the people who signed a petition are willing to go public with their names are\nIt's closer to a hundred now actually didn't look at the number of this morning I should have it's it's been growing since I'm we released it on Saturday which\nUm is probably a tricky day to try to get people to pay attention to it but since we started to get some news coverage on it I'm a we've been getting more and more signatories um and we've been very judicious with uh how we're going to proceed because there are a number of folks who signed who for various reasons such as there and play by the federal government\nCan't have their names released publicly um but did they did find it in that they wanted to indicate support so we're having to be very thoughtful when we're contacting everyone individually to make sure that they are aware that we intend to go public with their name make sure that they are who they say they are and that we didn't end up with some fall centuries [noise]\n[noise] um but the concern that I have right now is that I'm not all that sure how interested the FBI is in our list um they have their hands full and that's what has so\nUrgent about the situation to me is a week is not very much time for the FBI to conduct a very thorough investigation um they have to\nIdentify locate an interview a lot of people if they really want to get to the bottom of this um so they may have their hands full which leads me to believe that the press um maybe a more\nA effective way to get the word out and to get our letter to see the light of day and ...\nI'm barb oh you bet in an interview with the Washingtonian painted the concept did not even ... it was not in our lexicon at Georgetown ...\nExplain well I feel culturally it's important to recognize that the eighties we're a very different time and place for the country at large I'm not just in in private schools private all boys' schools um everywhere we weren't talking a whole lot about the\nSexual dynamic between boys and girls at the high school level it just wasn't part of the conversation when you compound that by\nHaving an all boys private school that's Catholic um the likelihood of meaningful conversations between administrators between parents and kids I'm coming up to try to recognize the fact that\nThere are thousands of shades of Gray's between the gentlemanly conduct which was which was the the shorthand at the time to tell us how we are supposed to behave around girls um and and\nDown and out rape um there's so much nuance in there and it's a lot to cover and they're needed to be in retrospect hindsight is always twenty twenty a more concerted effort on the parts of parents administrators the school itself to to lock coroners with the fact that\nGood kids do do bad things um especially when alcohol is involved\nAnd I think it's easy to criticize them now through the lens of twenty Eighteen um\nBut but I just just to be very honest about the million which we're operating at that time we weren't talking about the subtleties of sexual dynamics we were barely talking about the mechanics of sexuality I learned most of what I knew about sexuality\nFrom my middle school health and sex education class not from ...\nHow to stop yourself when it's not okay\nOh abrupt Kavanaugh's senior year book page refers to him as a quote kegs city club treasurer one hundred and text book and says he was called biggest contributor to the beach week Ross club as as well as a reference to the we're not a vote alumnus\nOr could you talk about things references that you saw in the year book and what the what they would mean to you\nAs someone who is part of the school for a part of that school\nDoor on as with many private schools that have a whole page dedicated to each kid it is a place for you to commemorate your time at school it's it's your way of of writing your ... rate writing her name of the wet cement so that you're\nFor all eternity a locked down it's a way to commemorate inside jokes that you have with your friends um and and just to basically have a laugh because we didn't have Instagram or Facebook\nThen so you couldn't go back and and take a look at the old photos any by any other means we started looking at your book\nSo collectively we all made up a lot of stuff on some of it could have been exaggerated some of that could have been entirely state on but what I saw\nIn on breast page was a a championing of the drinking culture um and and you don't if you were an innocent choir boy who occasionally likes to have a beer I'm call yourself the the\nWhat are the concerns well I'm a plane to the code of judicial conduct the cutter judicial conduct talks about the importance of a judge behaving in a way that\nInspires public confidence in the integrity and the impartiality of of the court and when we look at judge Kavanaugh's record in these proceedings or what's come out he's not behaving in a manner that will\nAdvance the public confidence in the integrity I Would point to we have credible allegations of sexual assault\nAny fair proceedings and we have a judge who now and the hearings last Thursday talked about the allegations as a political hit and as a political hit in response to pay back I Believe was his word for Trump and for Clinton that\nThat that makes more of a partisan than a judicial temperament\nI wanted to ask about that because\nThe hearing was really funny in terms of the\nThe damages streamed George government do to himself and his testimony in terms of the belligerence\nOr do you do to the members of the Senate and also the um the lack of would you buy the judicial restraint in the way he approached the questions that we're talking about him I'm Wondering to what degree those hearings really galvanized the board or to make the decision of Israel you\nKnow the board with was considering seriously the allegations of sexual assault and attempted rape the board met after the hearing so that the board could have a chance to hear the witnesses to such as we had it\nUm we like other its share concerns about what kinds of investigation there is our best to hearing it and whether there's a fair chance for both of them to tell their stories robustly um and in light of of the allegations and it didn't Herman statement says in light of allegations in light of the hearings we came out to oppose\nThe decision to launch an ad campaign in the same time\nWell the decision to launch the ad campaign of course followed the board's position the boards vote that we would oppose but now that we are opposing it's incredibly important that we stand up it's incredibly important that we stand up because of the message\nThat the any confirmation of judge Kavanaugh was sent to sexual assault survivors it's important that we stand up\nGiven what this would say about the integrity of the court I Can't reiterate enough how important it is that we believe in our in our systems into believing the court requires us to believe that people albeit humid or working as hard as they ...\nThis whole effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election fear that has been unfairly stoked\nAbout more judicial record revenge on behalf of the coins and millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition groups [noise] this is a circus\nAnd talked about the Clinton conspiracy et cetera the million spent ... left wing group they talked about left wing conspiracy his range was almost on contained\nNow to maintain that progressive groups that go be before the Supreme Court should ask him to recuse himself I mean the fact that matters right wing groups have also spent millions of dollars he is not raising that [noise]\nUm I think I Would leave to another day questions for acute cool but I Will say that we had a lot of conversation about it we the public can in discourse around nominations about how they become so partisan what we saw here was the nominee himself engaging in part is than conduct and I think your question\nOf course raises for us\nI'm Serious question about how well the public perceives a decision that comes out against a group like Planned Parenthood and I believe they pay for example groups that have been opposing cabinet how well how will we assume that the fairness and stand by the fairness of a decision\nThat affects you know quote democratic opponents quote quote that might run to political gerrymandering our campaign finance or the census again this isn't about\nHow important it is for judges to really conduct themselves in a way that give them confidence that they're doing everything they can to be impartial if they hear cases before them\nMore nervous or NBC News is reporting that there are some ...\nSaul ... before he became public are there any ... true and the concern is there about his conduct or leading up to the hearings\nI certainly think that\nIt's incredibly important that we have had a here that we have a hearing and that we have a full investigation and a full investigation seems important both for the integrity\nOf the opportunity for judge Kavanaugh to clear his name should that be the case for Dr lately for its allegations to be robustly hurt and tested and for the public to have confidence confidence in Canada is our ads that there's just too important and we can have no doubt\nSo it's important for an investigation an investigation to look for the facts into tests the veracity of of the things that have made\nWanted to switch turned out the gear
