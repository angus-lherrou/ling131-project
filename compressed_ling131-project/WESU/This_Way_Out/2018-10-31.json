thought about changes in our past conscience when I read this group\nThe article out of high country news out of my own in Colorado and said why don't Diane and groups count as hate groups and that was the question as the title and these hate groups have always been here especially during this time\nOf increased intolerance towards others and I want to talk with James about this and we talk

of Blackfoot and and and my citizenship is both us and Canadian and both us and Canadian citizens\nAre well I live in the world as you well know\nWorld where you know World War II demand the met that really great that you can actually we navigate bat and a couple\nMore divided you as you know ... we're divided north and south like many countries today by the border where are you know we'd have to ... foot in the north and black feet in the in the south\nOn our ... our bands are divided and we've had interference going back and forth over the border you know it just adding our people uniting for all the same you know I find them like a class [noise]\nYeah you know I'm the reason why I Want to talk with you is because of reading this article about the current of understanding of hate groups and I realized that what we talked about way back then it was going on with what they called the regulators and it was one of the\nReasons why you know the Ninety when I was there in the northwest talking to people all over the radio airwaves\nUh a lot of hate mail a man a lot of phone calls him in talking about\nYou know how much I Would say non native really didn't like me to people in in a very ... put the board and hate [noise] ah you know letters everything coming through because we were talking about the truth and at that time I was talking about what was\nWhat was happening to Europe but yet there were the non natives ... in eastern Washington it and watch them in general in that area of the northwest but now it seems as it always has been spreading there is the anti NATO boat going on in North Dakota\nThere is the anti union groups going on in that area of Montana theory the newly elected president in Brazil who actually stating that he's going to get rid of the native people it's happening\nYou know back and forth indigenous people but I always wonder what degree do you know what did we do need people to the people that hate us that that's the thing that I don't get\n... kill let's start with the foundation itself okay let's start even never mind let's go after\nThan persecuted okay they were trying to impose their own ... their own version of their own kind of Syria where they were in England and Holland\nAnd and and they they were the you know they are the ones who started the whole foundations that began to slavery all the rest of that but let's start with the declaration of independence we don't even rate\nAs three fifths of a person in the declaration ... called savages\nAnd then the letters from Thomas Jefferson to William Henry Harrison Eighteen you know oh three he talked about you know when we were going to forcibly assimilate these these these natives these savages or we will ... extra pay them wanted to do\nSo and then we go from there to the our founding universities Harvard and Yale and Princeton all of which were centuries of eugenics\nAnd all of which were were you the museums history there was a period where they called they called scores\nThey said what we do to our Jews and our gypsies is our sovereign business and they made genocide legal they thought\nAnd so what happened was we we enter the case of candidate was Nineteen sixty three we did not become a signatory to the un convention on genocide until Nineteen eighty eight forty years after the un convention a genocide while we're lecturing the whole world about genocide and and human rights\nSelectively I might add ... okay you know and then it whereas if you're if you're a refugee from fascism and in our death squads in Central America while you're on migrants you are an economic rapid gee uh because I don't watch it\nWe don't want or need it that you're running from the very people we trained his torturers and whatever if you are rapidly from Cuba or communism and we can use you didn't then you are now you are a refugee per se\nIs that not true that yeah and\nSo the hypocrisy we've seen from the ...\nIt\nAnd I had by the way this to you know I had a security clearance at sixteen years old before I went in the army at Seventeen years old that three us presidents Clinton Bush and and and uh Clinton Bush and Obama would not have been qualified for it because a felony drug use that they've admitted\nTo or to committed to\nSo here I was had to wait for F. sixteen years old when the army is Seventeen years old with a security clearance that three us presidents would not be qualified for and all three of those us presidents including Obama\nWho comes from a CIA family all three of them are ... all three of them were prep peace who got in to legacy systems and through the fix to the back door where they have the gentleman's see like at Yale and Harvard\nAnd all of them talk about marriage and and and all the rest of that stuff and so from our beginning we ... when you're called savages and the foundation documents of the other republic and there's not one of the word democracy is never used even once in the constitution\nNor the word political party nor the word capitalism nor nor the word\nThe N. word with age and is used only twice in the U.S constitution one is to prohibit any you know religious tests for public office it's article ... section three the supremacy clause\nAnd the other ones in the first amendment which prohibits I neither the establishment or preference for bias for nor the prohibition of religion that means you don't want this tax business you here you've got all these churches for example\nUsing land and resources and police and fire in the water that people pay into but they're getting tax exempt\nWhich means a subsidy from the state for some people\nExempt and who will get tax exempt donations and what and violates the Constitution's establish the cause but people accept it as a routine\nThese mega churches with these parasites running them and then the idiots who go to them and and ... and finance summon subsidize them because their lives are empty and they're scared of of the asset and they and they need some kind of promise from you know for something that their lives are empty\nWe're speaking with James ... who is a public ... on his blog and teams craven and the number and I were pressed dot com games you know um that\nGo by weight you sorry to interrupt include I mentioned just one more thing is we have a website if yeah S. P. T. P. M. L. filled it that people may live E N E S P P.\nT. M. L. I felt that the people may live remember our fundamental mandate by now and it's just people dot com why we we think the seventh generation why we really do the winter count towards dot com or dot org dot org okay he had an uncle Canada\nThere's two of them and we we are I group a collective up and did just that trends mhm from us and Canadian service either military service hook up on the surface okay Rachel document we we don't we will pulling up is the real original documents\nOkay yeah I mean there's a lot of information here and I think the listeners but all the seventies so I've been thinking about this program goes out to North and in North and I thought you'd make Canada and North America ... really [noise] um there's a lot of information in there so we we just made me go back\nTo this one bad happens in the north west area of the New Mexico Arizona California Montana I might I might as well throw watching in California and they do with\nIt or didn't or equal rights alliance ended Eugene federal Indian all you've got threatened or ...\nThe group has declared that treaties regarding land and water rights will no longer valid an object state rights expense of tribal sovereignty repeatedly\nRepeatedly owned distrust between native in trouble governments but that's what you're talking about is that the trust and I often think why is it easy for the government as the ultimate ... of\nPolicy oh these are groups the eastern government troops he's a group native and non native groups that are common\nPeople they are they are\nThey needed people and putting them out these are still people vote for that government that that has to execute their wishes and desires as regular as soon as I was doing and\nWhat that what that does is often you know they have these huge you know that's not our country that is our land all these things that they don't put that on\nThat threatened them that because I don't know what that is but it's something there that really doesn't get them there are a little box so\nI'd say looking for exoneration within a box to say well people don't exist anymore so we're not going to talk about what's happening all over the world and I know I\nJust returned and a lot of people know about it all over the world but when we come back to the United states just nothing you know people think that we're all going even\nHere and and we say or do with those living around us but the people like there is there a sense of equal rights um that that a\nCorrect why are they are actually really knowledgeable about made people and I think that's somewhat dangerous because their their border guards in their mind about that\nForms of self determination that whole wheat wherever you as always been here right we have always been here for the reporting we we go back to the constitution now here's the thing James to think about this I just recently returned from Greek [noise] and I think you've been there for the either democracy started\nAnd you're the true story the story about it I went up to the hill\nWhere the problem was the world of magnificent column some FEMA and all all of these senators used to gather there but\nBut what it said down below where the actual seat of democracy started there was nobody busy place because there's the grandiose buildings but at the glass shards everywhere and it's a natural setting to hold the speaker a peek into the thousand people to do a auditorium\nBuilt manmade anything it's just natural rock below and so\nThere where the statement that all men\nUnderlined men all men are created equal and that part is where they separated when nature\nAnd everybody else pillow and it was only men and that climate only white male\nWho were on chart white males property white man yes same and that's where it started and we think that we are we we hear that you and I think that people will we always hear that [noise] we\nWe have to stop living in the past problems that we stop living in the past you can't go back to ... you cannot you know it it used to be an aid to pay any more but then you're Americans so Chris do past your trip bras and being native yet when I look at where the separation a matrix game in that\nThat statement all men are created equal to put her put women but everybody else down below so what uh what I'm really saying to [noise]\nI think that you bring to the early ... when you do people understanding or a little more men are the better than others are meant would ... and we've always been going on a limb trying to say what is happening in the reality we we live in a major people put\nBill ... ... talk to you and to go through your Bill Bill with unbelievable\nWhere a lot of people that these things are happening to me to people 'cause we're still talking about the same thing and it sounds like we're complaining and it was only would be caught up on our food drops with being an American", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Way Out", "city": "Middletown", "day": "31"}
