producer of the ... the film crying earth rise up currently being ready for release but it's still being worked on produced but we wanted to bring ... on and talk about ... rise up because it is very urgent that we all look at what is going on not just in this\nTri city area of New York Connecticut in New Jersey in Rhode Island I'd say quite state area and because what we're looking at these locking watered places you know all over the world but namely\nWhere in the middle of the the United States middle of the north American continent lies ... which is geographically the center of North America and if there is no water there and what is being done to\nSo you know that's underway and in the meantime the mine is trying to expand um there's four minds in Nebraska\nOr there's there's one mind can we go and it's trying to explain expanse of foresight and I'm not sure if he said um\n[noise] you know they have eight thousand wells currently mining and each well uses nine thousand gallons of water per minute\nYou know so here I Am in Chicago China brush my teeth and I said oh I better shut off the water because I don't want to waste water when I'm brushing my teeth we all learned that in school right like we're supposed to save water but yet there's these mines using nine thousand gallons each minute\nAnd they want to expand to force sites which would make that times four and then there's another mind in the black hills which we all know the black hills has some of the purest best water in the country people travel from all over the world to go visit the black hills and they want to put a mine there and I really like the point you made about the food\nBecause the one of the project managers of the mine up there is an organic rancher and he thinks you know and it says opinion that mining is safe and that it's okay for his cows degrees on land where uranium going to be coming above ground and so now you know we have to question okay as anybody testing that beef\nFor

that's going through all your organs and then it sits there when you're eating it stays in your system\nThere's you know there are some things happening to see if we can clean out radiation and Fukushima as tragic as that is is is causing a lot of scientists to try to deal with this crisis because it is a a global crisis really I'm\nNot to mention the waste that's generated you know the water that they then inject back into the ground when they're done extracting the uranium they they call it um evaporation ponds and they'll put it in these times of evaporate all the bad stuff\nAnd then when that when they feel it's OK and it's cleaned up they can just shoot it back into the earth you know and they put it and basically those become toxic they're called temporary holding ponds ... but you know as we know from many many historical decades nobody ever goes back to figure out what to do with that waste it just stays there forever\nFor thousands and thousands years well ...
