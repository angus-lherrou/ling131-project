Michel Shenandoah\nSo much for inviting me to come on to your show it's a real honor\nThank you very much to interview good here and I'm really looking forward to discussing this this whole thing with me to take me too because you know I Begin to hear from the the native women from across the country and it was not exactly the same type of response to kind of went to\nA little deeper and I was really wondering when\nWhen someone would come out to him and talk about this and you're the one who's who's who's doing this to like to thank you for doing that or an indigenous response to me to what compelled you Michelle and others\nAre in your group to really think about is to give it a much more deeper meaning of the the one that the mainstream was often just kind of going with\nYeah well I'm\nStill I recently have um\nYou know left or a law I'm a career in law and um I decided to move in to media um I I'm wanted to uh start focusing in on being able to work more directly with our women\nAnd I decided to enter back into a graduate program at Syracuse university's 'em aside and you have school of communications and so I'm I'm actually currently wrapping up they um program and online journalism here\nAnd back in January\nUm I held a summit for ah the magazine ... which we're working on currently\nUm to uh you know start pulling in um you know members in front of the community to start talking about ... talking about what we're doing and through really finding out from the women what what's important um for them and you know\nWhat would they want to express themselves a through that such a publication and when we got together at that time the me too movement was sort of really hitting its height um in media\nAnd as we're watching 'em you know all of these different uh you know men in Hollywood um and and television who are being called out\nUm by different uh women for sexual harassment I knew that it was really a matter of time before it would come to hit Indian country\nSo I watched in an interview with Oprah and all of these a high profile women from Hollywood I'm conducting interviews sort of talking about you know this uh the me too movement and time's up and what they're doing\nUm and I also watched a a list developing on the New York times with a list of all these men and if you Google it you can find it today\nAnd it had you know the picture of the men and said what he was accused of what his response has been um in any sort of action that's taken place since then was primarily has been you know he's been fired or he left the workplace and I thought to myself you know\nIt's probably just a matter of time before this hits Indian country and in fact I had that list I'm On my Facebook or one day and I considered\nShe never walked from their loan she always was carrying with her her children she's always carrying with her her people she's always carrying with her her nations so as we're being called to task to heal and to protect its opening up a door for all the young people who are coming up\nTo begin to really make that change in the world that I think that we all need to see and they're showing us right there showing us that they're ready they're showing us that they have the mindset and the willingness to take us to that next\nPlace where we really are living into those teachings and those values that we've been taught as a ... who have people but as you know the the indigent\nOfficer and had to editor in chief of\n... magazine the new magazine from coming out and out and I wanted to ask you to take you know you were to take control of the ... and I want to continue as we are not part of the mainstream society which I find very true\nSo with that I'm thinking this movement to me to move more or less a\nScene in the indigenous ... indigenous women women a feminist movement or is it much more or less deserve brings some of the value of the mainstream into it or is it just\nMore more so to address why we have too much sort of tolerate the mainstream in order to to keep you know or or cultures evolving\nYeah well I think um you know if you look at\nYou know the ah the true origins of the me too movement it was created I think in two thousand and eight\nUm or two thousand two thousand and eight it was created by a black woman who wanted to raise awareness about the sexual violence that was occurring against black women and that movement did not gain\nA traction or the type of attention that it has now because it came down to an a point where you know it was the elite\nOf Hollywood um who suddenly brought attention to it and they co opted it so now it's about it's not about sexual violence you know against black women it's now more and to\nA sexual harassment in the workplace um and you know I think me too movement created an opportunity for many of our community members to be able to say oh yeah you know I was sexually abused too but it has a much different\nViolence a occurs and has occurred through throughout time um and and it's very very different\nUm from from that mainstream um space so um you know in terms of you know what the movement is I think that's why we\nYou know I I felt the necessity to create this film was so that we could have those dialogues within our community to not really necessarily just address the differences because I think we know that those exist\nUm there is a professor here at Syracuse University um who is marry her name is I'm a Haley a more um a casino and she's in an article that I recently just um\nPublished up on medium but she talks about you know uh you know a better sort of way to look at it is is us to rather than me too\nUm because she understands um you know and teaches about indigenous women's lives and and these types of issues regarding sexual violence but that when the violence happens again like I said it's it's a ripple effect and it it has effects on impacts all of us\nSo we don't have that luxury of that solution to just be able to um you know raise the issues and say oh yeah that happened to me too and then expect for you know all the men in our community or sexual offenders in our community to suddenly just you know\nTo to be gone or to you know to disappear you know it hasn't happened that way over time and I think it's it's a very complicated issue there's no really one\nUm you know solution um but I think the point of the video is really to be able to\nAsk ourselves as indigenous people well what are the practices that we had to address these types of issues you know are they realistic I'm In the space\nAnd you know maybe if they're not you know what was the underlying teaching behind it right so just like you were talking about you know we're in the space of you know\nBut we still do have our communities together\nUm and in some states says you know on the culture is still there and very strong and some places it's it may not be so strong\nAnd this is where I encourage 'em you know us as indigenous people to help other nations out to be able to you know offer those teaching than those insights and those values so that we can begin to look at those\nAnd incorporate them into how do we address this right there may not be a simple solution or answer right now but those teachings\nThey're very very um you know they're they they've worked for us throughout time and there's no reason to believe that they can't again guide us and lead us um in fact we have everything to believe that they they will guide us to a new space\nUm and so\nYeah I think that that's really important is to remember you know we can incorporate um are teaching and the values are those into the time that we live today because the moment that we start\nOnly using the mainstream solution is when we really do begin to lose our culture and identity and\nVery good very good we're talking with Michel ... who's the director and editor in hopes to an indigenous response to me to take me to\nWhich is a new house our main Dimitri ... magazine film featuring this cultural these cultural change makers I like that\nAnd I have one more question for you Michelle before we moved up here is a you know your husband new powerless he's he's in his film and I'm really wondering because of the mill character hears a\nHow are men respond and use it more of a thought provoking will I be able to get my you know what together before whatever you know\nOh we're women books with the women because it'll his one is how do we respond as moon to this and\nTo strengthen those core values that we we need both of those men and females to to to not talk to men are not talk to women or even children up to me now you know ... see the\nResult of it was just dumb and yet we have to keep together as people judge us to do hopes are men responding\nYeah well that's the that's that's a really great question\nUm you know it's been an interesting process also for me to to be witness um to to the U.S in regard to the men to the point of the film and I just want to make sure that I say that before we and the show is that um [noise] um [noise] is to\nCreate conversation so it's out there for free it's on ... dot com you can Google it\nUm and indigenous response to me to unveil a meal and um it's out there for free for our community is to use and I highly highly encourage watch it with a group watch it you know you know among you know your your family you can watch it in your organizations you know I'm tribal um you know\nI'm organizations can use this as as a talking tool and you'll be really really amazed at the conversations that come out afterwards um create space for conversation after\nUm it creates a lot of dialogue and and this is answering your question um because what I have witnessed as I've sat now in space is with are indigenous men and I have heard perspective on\nMale behavior that I'd never as a woman as a grown woman I had never ever ever heard before framed in certain ways I've discovered an openness and honesty for the men in the state\nAbout accountability and in ways that men have not had to be held accountable um and and sort of an awareness of that and so um you know and then also real Justin's from men\nYou know to the community and for women on how to begin to address this entire issue and and to to move forward\nUm and so I think it's really great I think you know we can't really address an issue until you have you know many perspective and voices in the space to be able to understand really\nWhat's at the core of it and and how people think and feel about the issue and so that's what the point of this the film is has to be able to\nCreate that type of dialogue in the communities and I think once you begin having them in the communities than solutions and pathways begin to illuminate themselves a much more clearly because you begin to see that the solutions are right within sight of us as the people", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Way Out", "city": "Middletown", "day": "17"}
