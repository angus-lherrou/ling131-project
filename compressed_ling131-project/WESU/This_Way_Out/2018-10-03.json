Michigan a few weeks ago there was a public hearing in lake township in Wisconsin where capacity audience of fifty people came together to offer input on proposed amendment to his zoning ordinance that would make regulations stronger with regard to the proposed back forty mind\nAnd guy in his own words was there to support in a positive way in which the township was taking action on his toning ordinance and the\nGuy writer started by addressing the audience as it's customary in his nominee language in those pilots or from doing so [noise]\nAnd a guy will talk about the meeting and what happened to him and the larger issue about forty mind project on what his organization is doing to protect them a nominee river it's good to have you here on ...\nWhy would they cut you off in your language first of all it is that very disrespectful as we know is the the people that didn't matter who's speaking in what language that they're allowed to express that we know that that sort of a given among native people why would they do this\nWell ah you know why this particular uh lake township or it's located in a pretty rural area up in the UP Michigan I'll buy that there's quite a few uh tribes that are around the area but I don't really feel if there's a lot of interaction between the two\nYou know not to give them any kind of excuse or anything but I just think that there are familiar enough with a indigenous people to to uh uh recognize that\nAnd so when you talk about your language how how long were you able to speak because this is a major issue to me and you know this is supposedly America and the freedom of speech analysis of how long were you able to speak your language before they cut you off\nI I think I'd just barely got maybe Fifteen seconds thirty second primary at the most\nUm [noise] you know the videos posted on our website right um you know and so people can see how quickly it was but I Do continue to talk as he was telling me to stop I wanted to make sure that I like reading a lot of fat in our language just muffled on their\n... and they are going on in the primaries and has a protector of them a nominee river I Am sure you addressed it that way but also what was the context of your ah your your uh intervention I Would say\nWell I'll just give a little background you know I've done it with a fight for I Would say about seven Seventy years I'm zero at one time I was just myself a that attended those meetings um [noise] so everybody around that table knew me uh they all know me\nSending their zoning ordinance started they were holding to strengthen the resulting ordinance to making a little bit more difficult for the mining companies had acquire a a rights to it and and and being able to mine in that area so we were going up to congratulate him I don't I'm sure anybody that's\nDone now worth you know on um any kind of mining projects understand that you know you seldom get bored and county boards and things to\nCome be completely on their side and willing to work with you in terms of strengthening things and specially protecting the water and our ancestral sites so we were just going there to congratulate him and let them know that we were standing in solidarity with them so it was pretty surprising to me when we found was the response we got\n[noise] yeah I mean I'm reading your website you know the [noise]\nThe French who explored in that area visited the nominee way back in sixteen thirty four you think after four hundred plus years that something\nYou know would be conducive to getting along with each other just financially understanding that there were also you know the nominee and other native people in that area\nAnd I'm Wondering what it takes to understand that the water is so uh I think to buy such what the capitalistic system would say such a little thing because it's too good for all Americans not just you Indians what what do you think about that\n[noise] yeah I I absolutely I think we're you know definitely out of place as a country where we ... we need to start to focus on\nYou know protecting our water more than what we have a lot of these corporations to do it that you know sooner or later we're not going to have fresh water and you know where we live where I live\nUp here by the great lakes you know or some of the biggest freshwater in the world\nYou know the sacrifice of creation and all those those are animals that live within the water and around the water but also you know we've been here for ten thousand plus years\nAnd uh you know we have many cultural sites and sacred sites right a rape within this project area and the law all waters here and I know it's about time that our voices are heard\nMhm what what corporations are involved in a ... you know trying to mind that area\nWell this particular um this particular mind as a sulfide mine a gold mine that\nI'm In the company that is proposing this project is a killer resources there ought to Toronto, Canada ah they're actually an exploration company so they've never operated a mind over and the company's history this will be their first if they are able\nUm you know one of those early figures we did a position to this mind as we do have sacred water walk and I'm\nDoing the walk really what we were struck to do is just let the water nor did what we what we were going to do you really do\nProtect it as we were going to put our lives um you know on the line if need be and we did a lot of those a hundred and twenty six miles we walk from my reservation you walked up to the mine sites are carrying a sacred water\n\n\n\nMost of the national emergency alert system the system was developed by broadcasting operators voluntary cooperation with the federal\nEmergency management agency Federal Communications commission in Brooklyn to keep on going to be a bit of an emergency submit an actual emergency especially message would have followed the tone over you heard at the start of this message\nIs the water was emergency alert test message has been sent out\nTo also frogs in the nation from cell phones we received a message others will not no action is required\n\nBut I also want to make sure that people understand that when they called the meeting into Puerto they were saying it's about the zoning ordinance\nAnd only the ordinance and this is not about the mind and the reason why I asked that question the previous question is you know it's it's kind of like there's twice seeing\nWhat you can actually talk about because what you were there was too is really to to confront that idea there back forty mine was a not\nWell I mean you know the the lake talk show a zoning across the board there you know like I said before as is doing going above and beyond I'm\nTrying to protect their water and their property rights and then um protect their lender are what they feel is their land um it also so we\nThere's really no animosity that's it I thought was I liked to us um and and really you know we were just going to let them know that hey man how we appreciate you guys are pushing in the same direction that we are and and uh\nYou know at least you have that understanding because you know it does get difficult um you know when you're trying to stand up to a particular extraction company of this size\nYou know going to the meetings putting in the notes and and traveling at all the money and all the time it takes to to uphold something like this and also just to\nTry to be a an educator as you also talk of life partner in that we protect these things and we are in business people felt that this this particular bar at that particular time I was really just to stand in solidarity with him and\nIt was supposed to be a happy time man\nThat you get that type of reaction when the gentleman tried to fight on it but um they don't have to go in a way it is sometimes\nAll right yeah um [noise] it it's really you know to me that because of the the recent protection of water that that is a phenomenon lately and the last decade or so is is really coming to the forefront and\nJust recently being in that area of Wisconsin you know you see the beautiful when they're just getting cold now\nA ... and and someone was talking about going to the nominee reservation and when I was overseas this past summer a I was\nYou know some Europeans came forward and said well we thought you were all gone all the native people are gone and I said well it's the opposite in in the United states they think that there's millions and millions of us left\nRight and that's the American idea there's millions and millions of us and more Americans now and we forgot the old ways and we you know we're just not native anymore what wouldn't you think about that you know there's the ducks to position going on\nEven with our own people that are we still being able to live off the land are we more of a um you know resource to reach tourist based uh\nUh economic uh entity as has sovereign nations as it goes or their combination within my nominees\nThey are [noise] you know I think um you know that\nEverywhere I travel around the country here in America you know you kind of feel a lot a lot of similar struggle you know and a lot of ways if the struggles of our ancestors that I've been a struggle [noise] um you know affects fourteen Ninety two about called ... and and just trying to assimilate off into\nYou know the western way of thinking speaking and and\nA way different than in and there's value in many of our ancestors that have lost their lives fighting for our our beautiful languages and in our way of understanding and our way of seeing things\nSo [noise] you know that that I think it was\nIn two thousand and Eighteen that idea is getting stronger and stronger especially after\nYou know Standing Rock and and what was done out there but in different areas you know even on the reservation here you know there's there's a lot more pride going around in a lot more people pushing 'em culture is prevention and those types of things that I see it I actually had many places\nYou know that those beautiful stories that were given to us\nBy a by the creator and by our of our ancestors you know those\nThose were you know too that we can use to help help live our lives in a good way of live close to the earth\nSo we we try to still do that you know up here and and and try to\nBe an advocate for our culture in our understanding the way in which we see things through our own language\nUm it's not to say that we have to be living and ... are you know that we have to be nomads or anything that we can we can still live at home and and I think like in a you know an indigenous person I think like our ancestors did try to live our lives that last best as they can\nI'm One of the things that I think that\nAn understanding that we all\nI'm trying to remember is that our languages and cultures ... were given to us out a lot for us by their creator the creator loved us so very much they gave us this beautiful beautiful language in these beautiful uh tools that are here with us\nThat says it all for it because the tools are still there um\nNominee rebuild ... dot com protectors of a of a nominee river and you could go to that site to find out more about the organizations initiatives\nAnd that even pertaining to the interview the protectors of the ... river guy writer as one of those people the director executive director of many ... let me come I seen that right guy\nA mini comic gem mini ... All right that that's a nice word I really liked I Love to learn that [laughter] and uh so uh what what would you have to say to the people on the way out here I I Know sometimes in the northeast people\nAre listening to first courses radio and they're trying to think of what why do we connect to this is not a local issue um but yet when we we talk to his native people everything is related especially the water and you know it it's that we I mean I think differently like you said\nYou know that that area of the water you protect one area than that goes out to all the consciousness does all the rest of the water that people drink\nIn her living with what would you say to the people on the way out here because we have a few minutes left [noise]\nYeah I you know it's all about just the way in which we understand things that have Frank I'm wherever of listening to my voice now if if wherever you are if you\nLook out the window and and uh look creation and remember your players within that creation and if you're buying bottled water ... to remember your connection with it and it's a really aren't and speak with them and our tech time every day and makes sure\nWorth who say you know that were grateful for all that water out for us none of us exist without it and this beautiful land and these animals are are here for us to help us\nUm our natural world\nAnd understanding our place within it\nSo I think that's extremely important if there's just a couple of seconds a day that you give gratitude and give thanks to to have this beautiful place that we have here into the water is I think if you go a long way in your life I mean all of us remember that ah you know these these creation as here", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Way Out", "city": "Middletown", "day": "03"}
