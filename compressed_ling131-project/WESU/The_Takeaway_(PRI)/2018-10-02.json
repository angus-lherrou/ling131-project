Texas and one is in Miami Dade County and while this is not the first time the federal government has used tempting cap and for my grandchildren this time around critics say it's a crisis of the government's own making\nJoining me now to discuss this is Bob more an independent journalist based in El Paso who writes about the border for publications like Texas Monthly and the Washington Post I Bob\nI like for having me thanks for being with us and mark Greenberg the former head of the U.S department of health and Human Services administration for children and families under President Obama mark thanks for being with the show\nAnd thanks very much so Bob Let's start with you the federal government now has more than twelve thousand eight hundred kids in its custody that's five times as many as last year how did we get here\nOne topic steps are just now well over thirty thousand records numbers I got yesterday uh children have been crossing the border on a company from Central America in large numbers since around two thousand four key mark and talk about how the Obama administration dealt with it but the Trump Administration has changed some\nUnlikely to step forward and try to take sponsorship of these children who arrive at the border on a company and then you had the implementation of very specific policies particularly a new requirement that any family that wants to sponsor\nOne of these children who arrives at the border without a parent or guardian which is usually another family member must now submit their fingerprints to ice as well as the fingerprints of any adult in the household\nMost of these families of course have at least one undocumented number in the household and this is just had a massive chilling effect on the willingness of these families to take these children and so they're sitting in federal custody which increasingly\nMeans thousands of them are sitting in these temporary facilities intense or either in the desert here in Texas or or out in homestead Florida\nMark I'm going to ask we're being told that this is the highest number of migrant children being held in detention ever a but in twenty fourteen as I mentioned in at that point you were with the Obama administration there were far more unaccompanied children crossing the border what's the difference between twenty fourteen and today\nSo first that's exactly right that this is the highest number ever in custody\nIt is not because this is the highest number of arrivals ever the number of arrivals is greater this year than it was last year but it's not nearly as high as it was in twenty fourteen or twenty sixteen\nSo the reason that much larger number of children are are in custody now in the shelters is because when they arrive they are staying in shelters for longer periods of time at the rate at which they are being released has slowed dramatically that's the basic\n\nTune into the ... with your hosts lord Louis ... felt at nine and get yourself in taste of hot sauce mo Jo explosion in the absolute best contemporary\nDitch the phones ... ... ... to ... happens every first third and fifth Monday from eight to nine thirty pm here in the ...\nMost of reasonably Catholic keeping the faith a thoughtful discussion of progressive issues of faith an action interviews features book reviews news and commentary airing right here at eighty eight point one at them W.

they movements that has surged in the universities in the central part of the country you're seeing a new generation that his waking up to the struggle to social consciousness\nAnd it is also a generation that remembers and knows that through the state there has been no justice in that those responsible for the massacre have not been brought to justice ... once I get your most are getting on to your your body\nTo understand more about the massacre and what we've learned about it fifty years later is Kate Doyle she's a senior analyst at the national Security Archive who's researched us and Mexican Government documents regarding the event Kate thanks for joining us\nThank you tend to you know so we are talking about a turning point in Mexican history tell us what happened fifty years ago today fifty years ago\nThere was a real bug student movement that began in the spring of Nineteen sixty eight with students from universities all over the city and eventually all over the country\nPouring out into the streets and asking really for the first time for change for freedom for an end to police and military brutality\nFor the president of Mexico to step down for authoritarianism to end it was exciting\nA movement attracted a lot of anger from the Mexican government and slowly over the course of the summer and into the fall of the movement ruins strength and the demand became sharper and more articulated\nThe government began to crack down and the crackdown culminated after months of back and forth between the government and the students with the terrible shootout and massacre that took place during the protests meeting\nIn the public square at ... in Mexico city on October second when dozens of students and bystanders were killed and injured [noise]\nThere were reports at the time that armed snipers were up in surrounding buildings and shot towards the plot though which then forced a military response what do we know about what exactly happened there\nSo there was a very aggressive stance on the part of the president ... that the students themselves had been firing from\nThe building overlooking the square just simply wasn't true it was a lie and what actually happened which we discovered slowly over the years that in fact the president had placed snipers in those buildings that overlooks the square where we're at ten thousand students and other people were gathered to protest\nAnd that they had fired down into the crowd in order to create a kind of chaos which would then permit the military to move in and harassed hundreds of people which is in fact what happened\nEarly in September of this year we saw major student demonstrations in Mexico city and I'm Wondering when you see you know students and young people getting very much political these days do you think back to what happened fifty years ago are you seeing similarities there in between what happened in ...\nDecades ago I think they're pouring into the streets because of violence and impunity or from the government today I think they are pouring into the streets because four years ago almost to the day forty three students were grabbed by police and drug traffickers in a tiny town and get the state of NATO\nAnd disappeared and if never shown up and the government has done nothing or so the the students today yes there is a movement today there is a pushback against the government\nAnd in fact the Mexicans just voted in a person to be president um Lopez Obrador who does not represent neither the ruling party ... even the sort of\nDominant opposition parties but a new party that he has found that so there is a kind of a ... a resurgence let's say\nOf hope for change NF demand for an end to the kind of a huge less violence that has been going on in Mexico for much too long\nAnd last week a commission from the Mexican government recognized the massacre as a state crime in your opinion you've done a ton of research on the east is sufficient and is it a step towards justice\nNo it really is and the government can emission that recognize that is is a new and important commission that it was set up by the current government opinion yet to to provide support and attention to victims of violence\nThat it's not a government recognition of state responsibility for the crimes of local Mexico is a long way away from\nFully embracing the state's role in killing young people on October second Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd right now the government is even trying to censor and withdraw records that have been available in its archive for some years now about ... local so Mexico has a long way to go before it is able to really face what happened\nTheir case thank you so much for your insight I think for the invitation to

who might be upset by conversations around sexual assault this material it's explicit and could\nBe triggering I remember when I was about Eighteen and though the guy who's a friend of mine who I just thought it was the most beautiful parts in the wild and we had gone out one night we'd been drinking a lot and\nIt wasn't until I turned around and throw him naked and a\nHe's I think my clothes off and pushing my head down that I realized I really know a tiny part you wanted to do that\nNew documentary film called consent\nI remember saying to him I didn't really want to have that\nRemember him kind of taking that as a cue to convince me [noise]\nBut the film explores more than just the conversations required before a sexual interaction in this current moment of me too and the emergence of decades old sexual assault allegations in the public arena\nYoung says we need to also be thinking about how to better deal with the trauma of the past and what does that reckoning look like in some cases she says it looks like dialogue I think\nThat ... I ... I think that people are starting to talk about it I mean especially given what happened to have the last year it's been almost a year and um the hobby wiping allegations came out and there was a real trickle effect when that happens in Hollywood and in other parts of our society and\nWe start talking about what consent looks like from cells in our daily lives in orange ... and then they thing\nWhat is consent how is it being defined today and has that definition evolved\nA word you can also that question I still do it is essentially an agreement between normally to people as to whether we move forward with that or not\nBut it is incredibly difficult to define just one of the things we found out in the feet and how you get to the point of consent is constantly up for debate one of the things that we do it in the peace with a ... you know needing to have a solid yet before we move forward with any kind of I'm actually interaction\nAnd that on the face of it it's great because that would just the bell any kind of confusion around the topic but when we actually think about it you know needing to you have a yes when you started someone\nHow and when you get someone not always seen as very sexy but maybe that's a problem with our society and a ... for ... for a month is maybe we need not redefining then\nAnd then the question becomes all part of it\nPlace to go I'm particularly given what we're learning recently about how long it takes how these memories can be stored I mean does it help to confront the person or talk to them\nI think that it caused me depends on your own situation how about trauma has manifested itself and how you feel about that\nParticular minority paying out what we tracked documentary is a case of two adults who ten years go hide that one person group about consensual sex the drunken incident won't ... rape\nAnd they sat down and had a face to face competition\nI told myself that was a dream and and the things I thought I had Spain and ... just a real like really not not wanting to face the next level if line of questioning\nTheir soccer I don't remember how I got into a room why I came into your room one happens any of those details\nWitnessing that was incredibly powerful very very moving role conversation with a lot of fun ... the I'm a little bit humanity and forgiveness that was well ...\nWhat to believe you\nAre and I became\nA source of problems in our community that sort of like a ... no one could imagine I didn't want us to eat like that no one could imagine you like that and all their children and so by default\nEveryone if do you have to do anything ... anything got to keep everything away I was and I had to leave everything everybody [noise]\nOne of my biggest regrets thrilled office is in addition to you know hurting you got married and causing a trauma heard ten years of average\nJust started you know\nIt's interesting because at the time when we're talking about ... accountability looks like I mean we really don't have a lot of options for how to handle situations that often happens years ago or even decades ago um and so the good one option to face it with conversation and dialogue\nIsn't there I mean I I Would also say it's a pretty dangerous way to approach it depending on your situation I mean do you recommend trying to do that with a licensed professional or is it something that you should just do on your own call the person or I just\nKnow that something was up a lot of feeling yeah definitely and and I bet that it's definitely not for everyone and I wouldn't recommend doing without seeking professional advice to um [noise] yeah I mean that the ... it's a very controversial technique it can cause ... station\nUm it can be seen as the two Gulf didn't approach but some people I mean some people do to the to go through the criminal justice system this is just an alternative option that I wasn't aware of before making this documentary and that we wanted to bring to the table as a possibility for some people\nIs there any other way that people should be thinking about getting to that level of reconciliation without a face to face meeting and I think we often talk about forgiveness in a way that that's the end goal but is it [noise]\nNo I mean I'm In charge of justice sessions I should say that the end goal is not necessarily forgiveness um the majority of justice sessions allow the survivor to be in the driver's seat\nAnd set it up to them whether they forgave or not or whether they want more sessions or whether they want to continue the conversation or whether they want to just let it go there obviously many different ways in which individuals find healing and find closure\nAnd this is definitely not a building and pollution for everyone I Would say that there are limited options because you know\nIt kind of a thousand cases those actually still go without convictions and so we have very limited option but this is just one of the ones that we try to shake too\nAnd at the beginning of the film you mentioned your own experience um that you said falls into the sort of gray area of ... that\nDid that experience make you change the way you think about trauma I think that it's an interesting time to talk about ... if the last few days have been if anything it's that trauma it's real and lasting and can run extremely deep I'd be surprised at the last year will say that that experience has had a lasting\nImpact and that I Do find myself thinking back to not very uncomfortable movement that I thought I'd left behind a long
