an American woman named Catherine my your guy is speaking out for the first time\nShe told the magazine that Fernando raped and assaulted her in a hotel in Las Vegas in two thousand nine at the time she said she went to the police and even got examine by medical professionals ultimately she agreed to an out of court settlement for three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars\nBut now she's coming forward with her full story and she has the lawsuit documents\nTo discuss this issue Rene Ahmed freelance sports writer and co host of the burning all down pod cast Shereen thanks for being with us\nHi thanks for having me something that we need some of your guidance on this story here so let's go over the basics of this who is the woman in question Katherine my your gut and how did she and wrote Ronaldo first meet well\nKevin Oregon is actually from Las Vegas Nevada at the time she was twenty five and we're talking about this occurred in two thousand nine she was working at a night club\nAnd she was an aspiring models slash actress and she was there this was just before he was going to be traded to Manchester United so she was there to party which has a policy I guess you get to his entourage\nSo he according to the dirt Spiegel article and her account she noticed her pulled her aside and she wasn't really sure who he was she had heard of him I mean who hadn't heard of him but she wasn't sure\nAnd then he got her number texted her and invited her to a party and the details and just to trigger warning for anyone listening he was very aggressive\nHe I'm brutally assaulted her and even in the account that she has the story that he's a documented a sane\nChristiana run all to himself in a conversation with his lawyer has actually said that she said no several times she said stop so this is part of what happened and he confirmed that in his own words so I mean afterwards she was in shock as most survivors are\nShe didn't know what to do and she was very intimidated by him and ... and then when she confided in somebody finally who advised her to go to the hospital and filed a police report\nYou know everybody's reaction was saying oh it's but he's so big so powerful and you'll get lost in the so coupled with her own trauma and the mounting fear of who he was\nDidn't help that her first lawyer was not as experienced and couldn't guide her the way that needed to be but I mean she was an aspiring actress she didn't have twenty thousand dollars for a retainer [laughter] so I mean this is part of the problem with a system\nShore and this is I I this is not the first time that there should be go has written about this they wrote about this back in twenty Seventeen where the U.S media been on this story it this is something that happened in Las Vegas Nevada um where have we been on this story\nUm and I will say this very honestly is because I'm part of the problem I'm part of sports media this has been nowhere and I absolutely find media and mainstream media football media particularly to be complicit in this rape culture because\nThis is first of all not the first time he's ever been implicated in sexual assault case the first time was in London in two thousand and five barely won anywhere it made no waves they think I just found a blurb on the guardian about it when I started this research\nMyself and one of my co host friend also you had been talking about this for a long time we want to do examining we pitch the story about sixteen different outlets and got one yes\nSo nobody was interested in it either they said it's not our beat or we don't know\nThe reason football media is reluctant to do this is because let's not forget that ... has an incredibly powerful PR team if she was if those particular outlets get cut off from the club or from his representatives you're in trouble I mean he's played for some of the biggest teams in the world\nAnd that applies to us media where football play soccer is not um as popular here I Would argue is maybe regular football or American football that that fear you think that it's applicable here as well\nBecause I mean I I pitched us outlets [laughter] and no one wanted to or nobody wanted the story and I'm like how can this not be possible that this is the first time this happened to me same thing with David ... the current goalkeeper from Manchester\nWe we should also be clear though that that heat at that ... has responded and denying these allegations right\nOf course is going to deny them I mean he called them fake news but before he denies them let's not forget that he paid Catherine my or a three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars in NDA like let's not forget that that happened and she has the documentation I mean now she's finally got appropriate legal counsel but the thing is is that\nYour speakers would not and this is something we have to address when we talk about media would not have printed that they've ... and cross the T's and legal has gone over this a hundred times if Christie honor and all of his team was going to sue ... would have done a year and a half ago they haven't even issued a cease and desist so it's all posturing\nRead it and it also it's interesting to me that we are in this moment the me too moment\nA particularly when it come I don't feel it any industry a is safe at this point if you will quote unquote safe I'm surprised that there's been such a real lack of attention to this given for example the Larry Nassar are stories that have come out in the sports world and other issues so I'm I'm really surprised at the lack of attention from the American media here\nI'm not it was the same thing with David to hand look what happened with Kobe Bryant he was given basic you know a pass by the media which is complicit in this I'm not surprised at all but I'm happy to see that her stories being shared now\nSyrian Ahmed is a freelance sports writer and co host of the burn it all down podcast Shereen thanks

I'm so these would be ... that are more integrated into the community um to do that um they go through sort of a public hearing process and there's been hearings already and the different neighborhoods where these jails are slotted for and there's been tremendous opposition so far\nWhat about you mentioned clique prouder and I think that that's a fascinating and really important part of this conversation do we is there any talk about ending cash bail as opposed to just moving people\nIn and out um rights to there is a whole debate about it and an effort to change the way the bail system works in New York um a lot of that change requires action from the state legislator which um seems like it won't happen\nThere is though something pretty interesting that's actually happening today too which is there is\nThis mass and bailout that's being planned\nBy the Robert Kennedy human rights foundation and said that um math to bail out is targeting sixteen and Seventeen year olds and women who are incarcerated\nUnless they're supposed to happen throughout the month of October um and today was is the first day that we're expected to see some of these people being bailed out\nAnd I just want to let our listeners know that we did reach out to the mayor's office for comment and they told us and we're quoting\nThe city is very clear on the east coast of raise the age that kids should be treated as kids every part of the planning process has been guided by this principle city Rodriguez covers urban affairs for WNYC thanks for joining us Cindy thank you tend to you know [noise]\nGot a comment for this show up on our Facebook page we'd have to take away or leave us a voice mail at age seven seven eight might take your ideas and takes are a huge part of who we are let us know what you're thinking about\nThis is the takeaway [noise]\n\n[noise] measure to be the\nUsual or broken all barriers and it's time to discuss the differences of race age in class [noise] universal feelings about the flooding salvation her injury and left the door by the world today I'm your host Alex Robinson please join me uncovering beetles\nZero to be viewed as soon Middletown\n\nYou are listening to a point when they had done a little town called ... or if you value reporting in coverage of current events Rudy racial and gender equality\nWas not fall program here at the middle [noise]\nOh\n[noise]\nYou've reached the national sexual assault hotline operated by rain to reach a hotline staff member in your area please press one now if you are a member of the U.S military foreign calling about someone who is please press to now to be connected to the D O D safe help line\nLast week the national sexual assault hotline run by the rape abuse incest national network or rain\nGot what they called an unprecedented surge in called the increase came during the marathon Senate hearing last Thursday or doctor Christine Blasey Ford recounted her story of sexual assault in front of a national audience\nPatricia ... heart of the executive director of the New Jersey coalition against sexual assault which helped to manage the state's part of the national hotline Patricia thanks for joining us", "show_name": "The Takeaway (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Middletown", "day": "01"}
