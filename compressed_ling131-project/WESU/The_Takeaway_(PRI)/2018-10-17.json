collaboration with double your GPA\nWell and in a few weeks voters will be taking to the polls for mid term election as Rick Scott term ends a crucial race for governor is heating up Democrat Andrew Gillum facing off against GOP candidate Ron defensive and voters are closely watching how each candidate is handling the hurricane response effort\nThirty and will also decide on whether or not to restore voting rights to one point five million felons Florida is one of three states along with Iowa and Kentucky that permanently take the vote away from convicted felon\nAnd there are questions about whether people who haven't voted during the last three elections but emerged during the primaries will turn out again David Smiley has been covering all of this is the Miami Herald political reporter David welcome back to the takeaway\nThanks for having me so there's a lot going on and for it as we know um midterms are just a couple of weeks away how is a storm like Michael affecting or could it affect people's engagement not just getting to the polls but their desire to vote\nWhere Michael hit a interestingly is a heavily Republican area and it really\nWiped out um a lot of the road the uh infrastructure so immediately we're seeing questions about will those counties in the Florida Panhandle be ready to vote for early voting on Monday and for\nElection days so that'll be interesting to watch or they aren't the most populous counties but that seems like it might affect Republican turnout um and just generally the hurricane has kind of ... to\nThe table for the campaigns you know there were topics that were heavily in the media before the hurricane are formed in the Caribbean and began aiming for Tallahassee and\nThose issues like the economy and red tide were pretty quickly drowned out by hurricane Michael and um\nState wide focus from voters on what they're thinking about and how they're viewing the candidates as governor Rick Scott runs against Bill Nelson N. is heavily involved in recovery efforts in as Andrew Gillum I had to take a break from the campaign or as mayor Tallahassee to handle the storm\nOr Ron dissent is no longer a congressman trying to ship his campaign to remain involved without an official role hurricane certainly shook things up in the campaigns\nDo we know that that's affected Gillum lead at all that he's had to step aside to handle the hurricane or is his campaign still going\nThe polls the recent polls have showed Gillum with a very narrow one point lead a new poll by saint Pete polls are came out this morning the really the first poll a taken\nTo to potentially show hurricane of fact and it still had Gillum ... plus one um I I think you know the the assumption would be that he would get something of a bump given that he was a so heavily on\nThe the media rotation during and after the storm or disadvantages didn't have a invested role and the recovery and the preparations are so I think I think we need to wait and see some of the polls that should be coming out in the next couple of days or weeks\nOr to see whether we'll see any other shift but in a state like Florida where a top of the ticket races are typically decided by one point uh I don't think we're going to be either Andrew Gillum all around us and to a a head or behind by too much\nWe talked a little bit at the opening about the possibility of getting Floridian to restore the right to vote for one point five million former felons in the state has there been any movement can you gauge what the interest is so far I'm On that ballot measure\nWhat late last month we saw a University of north Florida pool that had a ballot measure at Seventy one per se\nI've had received nearly nine hundred thousand signatures which obviously bodes well for support you would figure most of those seem to tourists would also vote for the initiative um but in Florida you need you do need sixty percent to pass a a ballot question\nAnd I I Do think one there is a campaign against it and to ... we're going to see some skepticism\nFrom people who either may not totally understand what the amendment seeks to do and the fact that I'm a convicted felon do have to complete their probation and parole in order to have their rights restored and then there'll be questions from voters about to what extent are they comfortable restoring voting rights for\nUm people who are convicted starting non violent offenses are and and I don't think that's a slam dunk\nWe talked a little bit also about the fact that a Florida Supreme Court has ruled that the current governor Rick Scott won't be able to appoint three state Supreme Court justices um who are the justices who are stepping down and I'm Wondering how that will affect um deliberate majority\nWell right on the southern member court there are three of of four justices who have\nKind of formed somewhat of a liberal voting bloc and have at times ruled against Rick Scott they are due to age limits are stepping down\nUm the day that the next governor is sworn in and given that that decision will now fall to either Andrew Gillum around the Santa and they have such divergent opinions on what the court should look like\nThat seems likely to to energize a they're voting base is I I think Republicans tend to be more attuned to issues of the higher courts and the significance of it and we did see some a speculation that perhaps the Kavanaugh hearings for the U.S Supreme Court\nOh by decent margin or and then it seemed to get a bump around the time of the Kavanaugh hearings so it's possible that that controversy energized for the Republican voters maybe they were hesitant to side with the dances over Trump\nOr or or any other issues and I'm In that might have given him a Bob so probably better for the Centers for Gillum but certainly Planned Parenthood\nAbortion rights healthcare rights are front and center in the minds of democratic voters are so I I don't think that you know a liberal voters are just going to throw up their shoulders and think about it there's\nNever a dull moment in Florida David Smiley from the Miami Herald
