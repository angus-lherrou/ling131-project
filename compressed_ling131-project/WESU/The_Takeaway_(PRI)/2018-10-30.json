so much for taking the time my pleasure\nDefinitely remind us what Saudi Arabia contribution to the crisis in Yemen what is their role\nWhen the war in Yemen ... started about\nFour years ago when a

March twenty Fifteen starts to air strikes a campaign of strikes\nIn Yemen resetting the war in motion of the time\nShe is or they practice a form of she has them and because they have received some weapons supplies from the uranium Saudi's have been fighting the war principally\nBy air for the last three years they've carried out almost twenty thousand airstrikes against cruelty and also economic target in the country and that has brought a great deal of criticism of Saudis because\nHousing of civilians have died and those airstrikes and and they have brought recently accusations of war crimes on the part of the United nations against the Saudi led coalition the other part of the Saudi led campaign to oust duties as being a range of\nPunitive economic measures that the Saudis have imposed on territory that is controlled by the ... in an effort to uh\nIt offensively in an effort to isolate them but we just had the effect of really falling very heavily on the country's civilian population because those same\nMeasures actively contributions to crushing the economy and that's what we've seen in the last couple of months the collapse of the country of Yemen already very fragile economy\nYour reporting on in the New York times was accompanied by some pretty devastating photos taken by Tyler Hicks I'm kind of get the New York times of young Yemeni children on the brink of death by starvation can you give us a sense of how and why that decision was made to include the sodas and the reporting\nWe're certainly some of the most shocking pulled it I think at the time says used in recent years and the decision to use them was not taken lightly and reporters have said often as not we tend to\nErr on the side of caution when publishing very graphic pictures but there were a couple of very compelling reasons and to to publish these pictures and the sentence one I think was that these photographs constitute a very shocking reminder of the Pakistan has knock on the Web\nAnd places like Somalia in two thousand and eleven and these were really are a minder that in in this day and age a very severe starvation is reality and Yemen and the second factor which I think was probably the most compelling one is that this is very much a manmade Tom and this is not a potentially in my mid ...\nThis is not a humanitarian catastrophe that as a result of a natural disaster or of a naturally occurring shortage of food in these areas\nOn the country when we were travelling through Yemen and in many of the towns we visited the store is full of food the problem is that nobody are very few people can afford to buy it because the country's economy has been devastated and the economic devastation is a direct\nProduct of the way that the war has been waged largely by Saudi\nSaudi led coalition some of the decision they have taken like withholding opportunities from a million civil servants in government controlled and who the controlled areas has had an absolutely devastating effect on the local economy as well as a steep plunge into the value of the Yemeni currency at\nThose kind of decisions have meant that people have far less money than before I'm the bunny they have is worth all that and for people who are already living on the brink this has nothing to push them over the edge\nAnd ah which left they were talking to Declan Walsh at the New York times and he's joining us from Skype in Cairo Declan what is the international community's response to this and what it has it been so far it hasn't been sufficient because to say that there is food and yet there's this famine happening it just in devastatingly cruel\nWell over the last uh over the summer the international community response has focused largely on the effort by the Saudi led coalition to capture a port close to the data that is the gateway for about three quarters of international humanitarian aid the entrance Yemen so a lot of the concern has focused\nReaching the country but increasingly now because of the nature of spam or\nBombing and the problem with the coffee economy a lot of stress now because I'm trying to pressure the party's impose measures that would allow the economy to repair it somehow I give him any chance to August they need to stay mobster\nDeclan Walsh is the New York times bureau chief in Cairo and there's a link to his reporting on Yemen

right here in the middle of the poisonous\nThousand and four hurricane Ivan bowled over an oil rig belonging to tailor energies setting off a massive oil spill on the coast of Louisiana that's been growing steadily for fourteen years\nEveryday the tightest in viewing between three hundred seven hundred barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico Taylor Energy has cleaned up some of the math but they've also been doing the government to avoid a full clean up on this\nIt is ... and he's been reporting on the Taylor oil field for years Michael thanks for joining us thanks for having me I push it to this spill started in two thousand and four and it's now back in the news because the Justice Department had an independent analysis about this talk about that what did they find\nWell they found that the weak appears to be a much worse than either the company or the government itself has been saying for many years the latest estimates which\nWere put together by independent research here from Florida found that between ten thousand thirty thousand gallons of oil is leaking daily from multiple wells around that platform that toppled over during hurricane Ivan in two thousand four\nAnd the reason why this is an issue now after all these many years is that Taylor Energy company based in New Orleans that doesn't have the assets anymore essentially only exist to fight this bill is trying to recover hundreds of millions of dollars that it set aside years ago to try to end this leak they want the money back\nThe government says no you need to do more to finish what you started here down below the surface of the Gulf\nObviously there's a money issue here but what is it about this bill that why is it taking so long for this to stop this looks like it's an environmental disaster that's been going on in our own backyard well\nHadn't gotten a lot of attention until recently that's ... that's true the company's position is that basically look this is not any different than the natural seeps that occur out there out in the Gulf of Mexico that are harmless\nThat's their position is are they right about that though while I mean that's a I think that's open to debate certainly and um ah the government's position is very different that that does pose a potential threat to the environment and that they have to go out there and do what they can the problem is\nIs that when that hurricane rolled through and knocked over the uh drilling platform it also buried the underground wells under mountains of a settlement that they cannot go in simply dredge without risking somebody's life that's the company and with the company says\nPotentially greater risk if they go in there and they pick the sediment away could make the leak even worse possibly so there's some there's very little degree and it seems like between the government and the company about what needs to be done next but the government believes that something can be done and they I Believe are going to order the company to do something else on their below the surface\nI'm just wondering the Taylor oil spill is back in the news but its rivaling this the BP oil spill in twenty can I Can't forget the images of the BP oil spill they were like on loop and I'm Wondering how this is a defect in the environment differently than the BP oil spill didn't Wilton\n... tend to be ... as we all remember we were kind of transfixed by the images of this billowing wave of crude oil coming out of the bottom of the sea floor if it was coming out all at once you know over the period of granted\nI Believe three months or so but that massive amount of oil came out all at once and that as you know ... ... birds on the seashore and creator of environmental catastrophe and in this case this has been a slow motion environmental problem with a tailor energy it's it's seeped out slowly and\nI'm not a scientist but I've been told that the damage and the effect is far less serious what its staggered out in the oil can be weathered\nBy waves and water and it doesn't have quite the same impact also the company has said that there is no evidence\nThat this oil from the ... is reaching shores about twelve miles off the coast of Louisiana and these slicks stretch for miles every day or almost every day but\nAlso have an impact on the environment whether we can feed them or not I mean who's supposed to make sure that this is an environmentally sound place again I Believe\nThat there are some a disagreement about this between the two sides of the company has its own experts who say that there is no environmental ecological risk or danger or damage and then the government says differently that there's at least the potential for damage to the ecology out there even if it's not oil and birds on the shore and you know there's fish there's other marine life\nAre they doing we understand that one of the former owners we do is a prominent philanthropist in
