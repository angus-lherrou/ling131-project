John welcome to use well\nThank you for the beer and John I Want to get right to it as the president and his son and not just the president attacking Ford last night but the president and his son Don junior officer repeating the words of a conservative commentators like Rush Limbaugh\nThat there's actually a dangerous time for men uh Don Trump junior said he's more worried for his son his daughters is this a new Republican strategy we're hearing and then this do you think it's a good one\nRally and I think we got to be careful I didn't take that that he was mocking\nA professor Ford I took that that he was questioning some of the inconsistencies in her story when the tone of voice which are which are number of people to second of all the second of all there are elections coming up and one of the things that we have found since last Thursday\nIs what particularly some of the things that the Senate Democrats did on the judicial committee\nHas actually engaged in rallied and brought a lot of Republicans home we we know that the Democrats are engaged in together since the day Donald Trump got elected but Republicans were stopped going into the twenty Eighteen election and frankly what a lot of sitting on his side Republicans saw\nActually moved them to become much more than my age like one or the ... election I think well look let's just take the the Quinnipiac poll that came out that forty nine percent of Americans not Democrats Republicans but both\nSaid that they thought that a cabin I was a victim of a political attack we saw that for example we learned at that that hearing almost a week ago that\nThe Democrats somehow forgot to tell professor forward that\nThis could have been done and closed doors out in California because we know they wanted the spectacle of of the day and having twenty five million people tune in like they did uh we found out that ah that that that she wanted the kept confidential yet somehow some way that\nA great question so we look at to several different pizzas the first is actually just frequency of drinking and who is a drinker or is not a drinker so we know that about Seventy percent of American adults are past year drinkers the majority of Americans do drink\nThe next question would be sort of how frequently do you drink you drink once a week or a hobby of every single day only on weekends and then finally there's the question of heavy drinking so\nGiven day [noise] and that's sort of it the gold standard for what we consider to be heavy drinking or binge drinking but we also do know that many Americans typically only consume one drink sometimes to drink and there are increased risk for people drinking if you typically only have one drink and you consume three drinks on one given occasion so that sort of\nMagic number of binge drinking works at some sort of a population average which is what we look at it in public health but there are risks associated with lower levels of drinking potentially as well\nWho are drinking the most Christina do we have a sense of who is consuming the most alcohol in the United states particularly when it comes to heavy drinking\n[noise] yes unsurprisingly as those under age twenty five\nIn the United states so college age population um those in college but also you know non college attending young adults drink the most although rates don't declined that much and we see a lot of people in the age range of forty five to sixty five there are a lot of\nAlcohol consumers although probably only about Fifteen to twenty percent of those in that forty five to sixty five year old age range are binge drinkers are heavy episodic drinker as with any sort of frequency and heavy and binge drinking we often see in college age population\nGet real I'm Wondering this was something that we were thinking about in terms of culture in American culture we know as we all just said here are college students to have a ... for for binge drinking frat parties on college campuses what role do gender play and all of this [noise]\nWe know today on college campuses the numbers of men and women are roughly equal in terms of actual numbers physical numbers but activities remain defined by male culture fraternity parties football\nGames tailgate parties pre gaming drinking to get drunk has become something that drinking researchers\nCollege students were actually reporting oh I'm drinking on an empty stomach and more women were doing this and men I'm drinking shots I'm doing this intentionally I Want to get Trump visited my object it's not to socialize and have a good time and just\nHang out and have a couple of drinks with my friends it's literally the object is to to get obliterated\nCurious Christ you know also if you saw the hearing a and you saw the exchanges between a Brett Kavanaugh and the senators who were questioning him when this issue came up what was your reaction to Kavanaugh's sort of defense of his drinking or defense of the questioning\nYeah so we know that people with more sort of\nJust the economic and other resources are sort of April to experience higher levels of binge drinking and experienced fewer consequences on sort of the more of the positive attributes of drinking\nAnd so you know quite frankly it didn't surprise me that this is how he portrayed on his drinking experience to many Americans so many people look back fondly on their college years and their high school years of heavy binge drinking heavy episodic drinking\nWithout sort of realizing that there are you know hundreds of thousands of Americans who are not so lucky and cannot sort of drink at those levels and continue you know they end up developing either alcohol use disorder or experience you know legal social consequences that are really important so\nBut from my own my own experience you know as someone who went to high school and college as well as what I've seen from the research didn't surprise me that someone with Kavanaugh social stature sort of seized drinking and understand drinking and the way that he does\nYeah and I think about President Trump recently you know ... drove the point home that he does not drink at all and uh there are reasons why the president doesn't drink\nChristina I'm curious what do you do if you're one of those people who doesn't want to drink doesn't choose to drink or you disconnected from the social contract from the social fabric if you don't I found it quite difficult if you know not drinking and then trying to I'm engaged socially\nYou know that's not an area of research that I studied myself but from what I've observed\nOn and talking to people who are non drinkers are absolutely you know for example even thinking about your work places that I've been a part of in the past to happy hour going out for drinks with friends afterwards it also a place where\nSort of business the older daughter work gets done as well as an important I'm sort of form of socialization and I think that some non drinkers are quite comfortable\nAround people who are consuming alcohol but it's very difficult for some people I'm particularly those who have potentially had an alcohol use disorder and their own past the context and being in environments like a bar environment can be a difficult thing to do so I think there's a lot of\nYou know in American culture a lot of us is built around you know drinking environments and drinking expectations and one\nThing we do know is that when you drink and when you go out to these contacts you know if you're drinking in a bar with friends you tend to really drink the level of those around you is that we know even sort of amongst drinkers that there's this sort of social contagion this effect that if I typically have one drink\nBut I'm going out to happy hour with colleagues and we you know my friends are my coworkers are consuming two to three drinks\nI probably will drink more than I Would otherwise so I think that you know non drinkers also feel that social contagion that sort of influence of drinking and I imagine that's quite difficult\nTo do we have a problem Gabrielle oh I Believe we do eighty eight\nThousand people um according to the CDC die every year from alcohol over you through that between two thousand two thousand Fifteen after having declined for three\nLee fifty seven percent among women wow Christina do we have a problem\nUp so that they I think that um you know his death and that they're more alcohol is attributable deaths than a related to any other substance and it's one of the sort of the leading cause of preventable death I'm In this country\nAnd you know beyond just looking at mortality the morbidity the impact on our society is just massive\nEverything from you know physiological problem feeling hung over not being able to go to work the next day to social consequences feelings shame getting in trouble in the workplace legal problems as well as of course of the media today we're talking about you know sexual assault\nAnd sexual violence there ... intimate partner violence with some of my research focuses on the link between high PBS alcohol so\nI think if we take sort of take a broader look at the impacts of alcohol in the United states and worldwide it's sort of you know it's there's no way you could say that we do not have a problem with alcohol\nAnd from each of you any thoughts on how we can get better I think we need to look at countries in in which in cultures in which moderation is really modeled is very very well we don't have a culture of moderation in this country for anything Christine [noise]\nSo uh a lot of my research focuses on sort of what I call environmental prevention or thinking about how we can actually change the context in which we drink and these are you know the social context as well as some some physical aspect of the places where people drink so I think\nUm if we think about prevention from and as well as secondary prevention so prevention of heavy drinking and the first place as well as sort of prevention of these consequences related to alcohol\nSo we don't sort of put all the pressure just on the individual that you know you're responsible for your own drinking and you need to go seek treatment of help if you have a problem with drinking I think that we can sort of thinking\nPlace and I think there are number of avenues that we could potentially explore to help reduce alcohol problems at a population level\nGabrielle Glazer is the author of her best kept secret why women drink and

joining us thanks so much thank you [noise]\nHi this is Christine calling from Tyler, Texas\nAnd I guess I just love to see that use of alcohol framed in a more honest way\nIt won't make you a

[noise]\nWe've been doing this for a long time and really what is an orange is listening to the needs and coordinating with other response agencies and local officials and so one of the thing that America's looks for a meeting the immediate health needs and so one of the ways that we can look at that as making sure that health workers have the medicines and medical supplies of a need\nMaking sure that they're able to operate if needed America is prepared to Santa medical professionals and ... health facilities but really looking at for the many displaced what are the basic things that they need many are forced to leave their homes quickly and basic hygiene items are what families really need and these emergency shelters\nWe've seen a ... and sadly we are becoming more accustomed to these major national disasters you were previously in Indonesia providing assistance for another earthquake in August we've seen the stories even here in the United states of hurricane\nA victim's we've been watching a post Maria in Puerto Rico and I think what all these stories are showing us is that there are real challenges in not just um getting aid but distributing it and and uh you know accessing the folks that needed what are you seeing on the ground now\nRight and you know for people affected aid is just never fast enough and especially in places where airports are closing roads are blocked and fuel is unlimited supply and it's really not unheard of for the first wave of aid so to take a few days\nBut again we've been doing this for a long time and we're prepared to go to great extent so similar to our responses and Nepal after the earthquake or in the Philippines or recently as you\nOr how is his ground logistics and really we do whatever we can to get the right age have the right people at the right time and really focused on health\nAnd when we think about things like this I I recall it when we think about Puerto Rico and in Hurricane Maria there were some logistical challenges in getting\nThe aid to the folks who needed it on the island partly because of some obscure laws that prevented a things from being moved in a timely manner are there any legal issues that you all are looking at when it comes to transporting medicine and health resources to other countries particularly right now with a with a Indonesia [noise]\nEvery country has different requirements for aid and we have a team of experts that understand the complexities of what to find and how to spend it and so I'm similar to what we did after the ... earthquake were working in
