N. them dot ORG\n[noise]\nWhen the national media talks about rural populations in the United states they usually mean white people\nThe American white working class makes up the core of Donald Trump support McDonald county was unambiguously\nCorporate loyalty unease in Trump's mid wet they all appear to me retaliating against industries affected by Trump country working class white\nBut with all the focus on white rural voters who turned out for Donald Trump another important group of constituents it's usually ignored\nThere are black people living outside of city living mostly in the house and living in red states right to the black belt overlaps with Trump country and those are the folks that are really going to factor into elections across the south in these midterm elections\nThat Aaron Haynes whack and she's the Associated Press national writer on race and ethnicity and recently she's been reporting from rural counties in Georgia in part of what's called the black belt the black belt is that what we know the deep south which you know historically it's where\nBecame some of the most impoverished areas in the country but the black belt is also where frankly the battle for voting rights for African Americans with with waged\nAnd so you know you think about Fannie Lou Hamer Ella Jo Baker Fred Shuttlesworth John Lewis these people weren't from Baltimore or Cleveland or New York you know they were from the deep south and they expanded that franchise for all\nAnd you know this is also the place where\nIssues like voter suppression continuing persist today and so that's one of the reasons why it's really important to focus on these folks\nAnd how they're going to factor into November and you mentioned voters depression um tell us a little bit about some of the other issues that are really top of mind for black working class rural Americans\nBecause a lot of these areas are poor\nThey struggle with economic development opportunities a lot more than than urban areas but they also have healthcare challenges specifically\nAs we know minorities often have health care disparities from diabetes to sickle cell to obesity but they don't necessarily have the access to health care that you would have\nStay in his city you can have dozens and dozens of churches for example but no hospitals for miles and miles and that's a real challenge for them and something\nSomething that has has not been addressed frankly by by the folks that that get elected in those parts of of the country a lot of times\nAnd in your piece you went to Georgia to report this out why did you choose that state\nWhat George it was really really important because\nIn Georgia there is obviously a very a high profile gubernatorial contest where possibly be first African American woman could be elected governor in the country and that Stacey Abrams and Stacey Abrams actually started her campaign in ...\nYou know about a third of the rural folks in Georgia are people of color and so unlike other contest local contests for example that may be\nDilute the power people of color frankly because of of racial gerrymandering you know in a statewide contest the or the voters that could really be key to to those kinds of victory and frankly you know what she has done go into a lot of these places that had been forgotten\nYou know by Democrats in recent cycles could make the difference uh in the in that contest and others in in the south where you have a large populations of black folks especially in rural counties\nErin one thing that comes across in your piece is that the black rural populations that you spoke to felt disaffected by politics that seems to be shifting and I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about that\nWell one thing that's important to think about for these folks is because they felt like they they they were electing people who work forgetting about them kind of in between election times you know they they were they were\nVoting for people who then did not come back and give them like I said the economic development that they were looking for or the health care\nThat they need and so they felt like\nAt least in these off presidential year elections that their vote didn't count you know you've got now\nFolks who look like they're running in more of these places are in in in several of these counties that I went to you have incumbents who've been in office for years in some cases even white conservative a lawmaker that the local level\nRepresenting majority black counties and and I wondered you know how that possible well these people have gone to an challenge for so long or people you know have not paid attention relate to those local level elections and so these people have stayed in office but but now that starting to change his folks are starting to get more engaged in these local uh down ballot racist\nThe journalist and a couple of weeks ago and she was talking about how white progressive rural voters feel that their perspective to have been forgotten in the Trump country narrative freight\nDid rural black voters also feel like they were being left out of the media narrative or was that just something that wasn't even a concern for them\nNo I think it definitely is a concern because you know I brought this up to them you know doing my reporting it now a lot of been out of their heads in agreement I you know they're not front of mind when you think about rural voters or even farmer I mean black people there's never been a time in this country when black people have not been connected to the land\nAnd so the idea that somehow we have been distance from that narrative is is really interesting to me I mean I'm from the south and so obviously for me that's not something that's foreign but but for a lot of folks that that are in cities and maybe you know either don't have relatives there aren't getting back\nTo to that part of the country to see family or friends it doesn't always occur to folks that yes there are black people living in rural areas and and quite a lot of them frankly\nI'm curious if you think there could be the potential for coalition to be formed between the more progressive white rural voters and rural black voters who might be able to see some opportunities there for cross pollination if you will of ideas or is that just to the too early to tell right now\nWell you know I think it's entirely possible and I say that because again when you're in a small place like that you know these are folks that are interacting\nSo much and not to suggest that there are still places like that where there there is segregation and people are living in different parts of town but the town is so much smaller than say a big city and so these are folks that really do know each other you know\nThe two of them would be on the campaign trail to gather President Carter has endorsed her they're talking about real health care that's something that affects both those progressive white rural voters and\nBlack rural voters and so you know understanding that they do have shared interests I I think that's present an opportunity for just that kind of coalition that you talk about\nAaron hands lack of the Associated Press national writer on race and ethnicity Aaron thanks for joining us\n\n[noise]\nThis is eighty eight point one W.

point one F an\n[noise]\n\nThis is the takeaway I'm tending to Vegas\nWhen a woman at the victim of domestic violence finding a way out is not easy\nImmigrant women especially those who are undocumented think can be even more complicated in fact immigrant women are nearly twice as likely as the general population to experience domestic violence\nThese women may not be aware of the legal options available to them or those options themselves may be limited many of them say they fear deportation\nThose suffering from domestic abuse women who essentially opened their homes at shelters for abused women do the pressure is a contributing writer for California Sunday magazine and she reported on this underground network of women giving abused immigrant safety companionship and even medical and legal advice [noise]\n... says there are about one hundred and fifty other up you know women nationwide doing works similar to what you saw in California and she told me about one of the women she followed in her reporting so I feel a woman named ... and she's opening her home in one of the women who who's she's working with is a woman who I call Sylvia\nUm she has been in an abusive relationship for many years and for a while she was struggling to leave because she was nervous about\nThis going public with her story at all since Trump was elected she became much more nervous about the threat of deportation and in particular about losing her children and so\nShe came to Valentino house and stay for a week and now Valentino sees her regularly to check in on her and she understands that this is a long process right now the average average woman tries seven times to leave her abusive partner in this country when you're an immigrant women that can be even more difficult\nWhat is a you visa and how does that play into this conversation where I'll step\nBack a little so the violence against women act with first passed in Nineteen Ninety four and it was the first federal legislative package that was designed to end violence against women and it included a piece of legislation that\nProvided a path to permanent residency for abuse immigrant women whose houses were\nTheir abusers and who are also us at a center permanent residents are really small fraction immigrant women in two thousand and with the reauthorization of the ... anthem an act that was expanded and do you eat that was created and offered a path to permanent residency for immigrant women were victims of violent crime and who were willing\nAnd today in the past four years he's seen an enormous backlog grow in twenty four team the government with granting visas to women who had applied five months earlier if you apply today you will wait nine years for a U.S visa there isn't a hundred and twenty thousand person backlog so they're kept at ten thousand a year\nI'm In the same time frame we've seen the number of educators drop from Ninety three to stick at the at the last official tally why is there such a delay and is that delay what\nSpring these women in part to seek services quote unquote underground\nIt's hard to understand why there's such a delay and why there hasn't been a surplus or an addition of educators to help speed up the process\nIt's a good question about whether that delays driving people under God of course we don't know causation necessarily but definitely the woman who I was speaking to her opening their homes were finding that\nSurvivors who came to them just didn't want to wait nine years they couldn't wait nine years right so\nThat means that for nine years they don't have the protection of a work permit but they can't necessarily support their children and that's what the you either was designed to do to to give people a pathway to residency so that they would be able to leave safely and to support their families\nAnd you know the Obama administration um how do you know had very controversial ... policies regarding immigration I'm Wondering are these would have been more concerned under today's circumstances under the Trump Administration or is there equal concern under the Obama administration is so what's the difference\nToday I was wondering the same thing and I was actually I'm somewhat surprised to learn that the concern is much much higher today than it was ... the concern of ... and the concern of the concern of deportation a lot of the women who were\nComing to the safe house is essentially under the Obama administration didn't feel as if it was as risky to come forward to the police say felt as if\nReally just don't know one of the other things I heard a lot in this reporting was that women felt particularly afraid about separation of families it's just all over the news in this way that they believe that it's possible to their family too could be separated\nWhen these women come to volunteer you know do they end up staying just temporarily do they end up going back to their abusive partners like what have you seen yes so ... estimate that about half of the women who have stayed with her have gone back to their partners it's really really difficult to leave\nAnd half of last some day for a night some day for two months so it really depends on the woman and Valentino feeling is it's up to them until do what what works best for them I mean I've met I met some women who are opening their home to found that the survivors stayed with them for as long as a year\nOne of the problems at the shelter system is that there's an expiration date um if you are if you are lucky enough to find a better than a sheltered extremely hard to do you often have sixty or Ninety Days maximum and then you have to get out and so these women feel like the least they can do is kind of it than that day\nWhy does the network need to be a secret\nSome of the women don't necessarily call it a secret and would actually speak about it more publicly others feel as if it's too risky to say I'm bringing in women whose partners are abusing them because they feel as if the possibility that if you there will then\nCome after them how many of them have kids are living with you know and they're trying to protect their families and they're trying to protect our communities\nAnd in part because the survivors themselves want to disappear they feel as if they can't get a restraining order I don't feel safe going to the police they can't get a restraining order they don't want to live in the same city did their abusers they prefer to move to a different town and start a new life and so they would prefer if their location was secret until the ...\nThere any uh cultural distinctions that come up and dealing with domestic violence there's so much work that needs to be done in the ground level jak to get women to feel comfortable talking among people who they know\nAbout what's going on in their home and what's going on in the workplace and we can't be failing to see that can't be mixed in\nWith the pressure is a contributing writer for California Sunday magazine Lizzie thanks for your record\nWhich had any [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThey take away is supported by progressive
