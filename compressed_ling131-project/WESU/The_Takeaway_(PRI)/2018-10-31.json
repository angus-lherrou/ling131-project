[noise] what\nMichael ... at the presidential historian and author most recently of presidents of war and he spent his career researching and writing about the role and expectations of the presidency\nPresidents of war time have always had to\nGo to funerals console you know families of soldiers who have fallen on the battlefield because of their own decisions and that's one reason you've always wanted to have presidents with empathy for instance\nAbraham Lincoln during the civil war was told that there has to be a National Cemetery a new one because\nSo many soldiers were dying and Lincoln said put that cemetery right near my summer home so that I can see the union graves being dug I wanted to see the results of the terrible decisions I'm making that are creating an ocean of blood and also I Want to be able to control the widows\n... and you know we mentioned you mentioned Abraham Lincoln I Want to move the clock forward to Ronald Reagan and how he dealt with national tragedies I'm thinking specifically about the explosion at the challenger space shuttle in Nineteen eighty six that I remember it clearly\nRonald Reagan was almost designed for this role of a president consoling the nation after a tragedy Nineteen eighty six Americans saw with their own eyes the challenger accident\nAnd Ronald Reagan gave a speech late that day that was one of the best written speeches probably in the history of the president's he talking about what America aspired to in the space program and giving some context to what had happened that morning\nI Want to say

on the take away and happy Halloween every body you're staying safe and having some fun and we are definitely a costume here at the show so check it out on Twitter [noise] but\nBack to business before the party's since taking office Donald Trump has never really stopped campaigning often returning to speak and towns and cities across the country where support for his presidency remains high\n[noise] but as\nThe mid term elections approach trumpet spending even more time on the campaign trail trying to lift fellow Republicans in tight races in an effort to maintain control of Congress and in order to keep it based energize the president is keeping his messaging simple [noise]\nOh to violate our laws across our borders illegally will be sent back home court\n[noise]\nAnd we tell them because they got along but they can't they cannot government\nThe way they want a government doesn't work done away\nLess than a week to go will the president's message motivate his core supporters to turn out like they did in twenty sixteen you're just got this Christopher catalogue all the White House reporter\nWe've got one week before the midterm elections what are some of the big themes that the president is really knocking hard we've got obviously immigration what else are you seeing\nThe president is going very hard on illegal immigration as you mentioned he has brought up a very unlikely proposal but one that he thinks it's going to motivate folks which has a ten percent tax cut on the middle class the president has continued his barrage\nOf assault on the media\nAnd in the last few days he has really dialed up his critique of the Democratic party that is meant as something to really unify Republicans pointing to what he sees as kind of the extremes of the Democratic party\nYou know and I'm Wondering if president it made no secret of his thoughts on\nMigrants coming from Central America from Mexico with the very beginning of his campaign so is there a reason why he's still really doubling down on immigration um what did that strategy ... as opposed to health care or as opposed to other issues that he should be looking at\nThis was a an election that's really based on motivating his base nationalizing missed election around his supporters because the question that Republicans have always had as there were a number of people who turned out for Donald Trump\nMuch of them Republicans but not all of them and the question was would they come out and turn out for\nA member of Congress or a candidate for the house\nAnd that has been a much tougher thing to answer and so if Donald Trump goes out there and says this mid term is really about me my policies are on the ballot you'll remember rock Obama said that and it turned into a scandal will Donald Trump has been saying that exact thing and it's it's a way for him to ah to make this\nJust on is this has been a constant focus as you pointed out I mean\nGoing back to the beginning of his campaign obviously earlier this spring he went really hard on the MS Thirteen gang and started using terms like animals to describe people which are generated a lot of backlash and so what he's doing is we we flash forward to the beginning of October\nAnd the president's political teams started to get a whole bunch of polling data come back to them\nAbout this issue of immigration saying that in a lot of these marginal districts competitive house districts where Donald Trump is not always seen as a help\nIllegal immigration was resonating with folks this whole idea of the Republican Party being sort of the protectors of immigration and customs agents there was an abolish ice movement on the left obviously and so that whole issue was resonating and what happened was that the president sort of\nHad this migrant caravan issue sort of land in his lap after they had already decided that they were going to really close on illegal immigration\nWell and and there's also the the recent news that the president has decided to send troops to the southern border we should also remind our listeners that\nThis migrant caravan if you will the folks who are migrating are still weeks away from even reaching the United states borders so the president doubling down on sending troops and reinforces the idea that these folks are almost a scapegoat in many ways right\nYeah I mean a lot of these attacks a lot of these statements are not grounded in reality as you mentioned these people are hundreds of miles away they would not reach here like you said for weeks and then in in the last day or so there's been this issue of ending birthright citizenship which um is has been\nReally sort of the third rail 'em and\nSomething the White House proactively put out there well let's listen to that 'cause I Want to hear that clip and then I Want us to sort of break that down\nOn immigration some legal scholars believe you can get rid of the factors and ship without changing the constitution we could have water directly\nOr have you thought about that is totally law it was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member castle and you don't see the number one number one you don't need that number to nothing to do with religion is well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nI think the president was very frustrated in the folks around him were very frustrated over the last few days because the the narrative or as folks go head to the polls and a lot of these states that have early voting\nOr what are all about domestic terrorism there was this obviously the terrible shooting in Pittsburgh and and ... you know\nEverybody these these these things at the tragedies that they are but we have to say that what Republicans have been saying all along they knew this was going to be a very tough mid term elections Donald Trump knew that as well\nAnd what they were saying was you know all these issues come up and they they last for a day or two and then they dissipate and so they never really knew where we would end what would we be talking about when voters finally start going to the polls\nAnd they were talking about these these domestic terrorism issues that we're not seen as a help to the party so the president saw the the ... Caribbean a despite the fact that it was never going to reach a the border anywhere near election day as a political gift that was the term that the folks around him were using and then\nI Would say the same thing for this question that came up yesterday I mean these are things that are going to come up and what he's doing even if it's not something that they're generating they're able to amplify the stories and to really give them life and I think that\nIf that is something that allows them to turn the page\nFirst thanks again thank you so much [noise]\nSupport for the takeaway comes from babble European made language learning program\nThat will teachers practical conversation retaliate Russian leaders and other languages or bailed me up store or online at B.

today defense secretary Jim Mattis called for a ceasefire\nWe've got to move toward a peace show for your kind of ... we're going to do it sometime in the future we need to be doing this and the next thirty days we've admired this problem for long enough down there\nUnited States has long been criticized for aiding the Saudis and the war by most estimates while over two million Yemen nice have been displaced and the humanitarian crisis is a scale that's hard to fathom\nHer for Tyler Hicks has made three trips to the war torn country his latest just this month and when he found there was unlike anything he'd seen before\nOn Tuesdays program we talked to the New York times is Declan Walsh who's recent reporting shares vivid details of the desperate state of millions of civilians in Yemen a country now at the brink of famine accompanying that report were portrait captured by Tyler Hicks showing children and babies starving to death in the north of the country\nAnd the bloody conflict ongoing in the south I spoke to Tyler today about those photographs\nYemen's it very difficult place to work there are a lot of distance to cover you know lots of checkpoints but there were a few places that we'd heard that people are really suffering and and these are areas where people\nAre coming from a pretty large region and and getting to just a couple of really clinics I mean these are so much hospitals as as we would think of them back home these are very small\nClinics where where people come and however they can we found out there a lot of the problems is just that the economy of there's absolutely\nNo money they earned by people people don't have jobs they don't have money to get to these hospitals fuels very expensive and hard to come by and ... it costs a lot of money for them to you know they're they're they're having a hard time just\nFeeding their families are let alone going many hours in a vehicle to get to a clinic\nThat's how we chose to go to these specific areas\nNow the piece that you did a for the New York times one of the first images that readers will see when they opened the peace is a photo of a young girl named among all\nCan you describe the photo for our listeners and tell us a little bit about what you were seeing and experiencing and really what struck you about a mile\n[noise] I've been to a few hospital\nI could tell that the moment that I walked into this was a really were some of the worst cases were ah it so that kinda open court orders with rooms a surrounding it and just looking from that central area without even entering the rooms I could see that that the children there\nWere were really in terrible shape skin and bones and the first room that I went into I saw this young girl a mall and\nThe poor child was just laying on on a Koch her ribs just showing ... through her skin there was an ounce of us out on her her arms and legs just like to ... ...\nIs just very you know something about her face also she was very calm child who ... when you see your body is just heartbreaking and and I I spent a lot of time photographing her um I I knew that\nAs difficult as this photograph was to take\nAnd as difficult it is for the the viewers just to see\nI knew that this was going to be an important picture and an important photograph to be seen because uh she she really sums up how tragic and how bad the the malnutrition and the starvation has really become in Yemen\nAnd Tyler ... there is often a debate about traumatic images right on the one hand people will say they're just too traumatic to publish tend to look at um on on the other hand there are people who say are they exploiting you know people who are in their most vulnerable state\nAnd at the photo journalist I'm Wondering how do you grapple with those issues\nI never take photographs that are difficult to look at just for the sake of of getting a traumatic photo or sometimes there's a reason to document things that can be\nTo file the photographs to the New York times and then there's a whole team of people there who decide\nWhether that image or images will appear in the newspaper this was one of the cases where I think it's really important for these photographs to be seen I mean there has not been\nA lot of coverage out of Yemen it's it's a very difficult place to get to because the travel restrictions they're western journalists have not been invited very often do to go there so when we can see what's happening\nThat's an opportunity for us to to show what's what's happening in the country is as difficult as it is\nAnd Tyler have we become these ten to ties to images like this and the crisis in Yemen over all um because I just think back to what two years ago when there was an image of a toddler or that the Syrian refugee crisis in this together you know with dead on the beach on the shore and I just think\nThat image was so powerful like are we becoming desensitized to the ... out there because we're just\nThere's so much going on right now\nI think yes but at the same time it that doesn't affect the way I think that\nI should be doing my job or about how the media should be covering these places you catch tried to deconstruct what people's sensitivities are and in effect\nQuarantine what you what you choose to show I think it's the more people become used to these things actually the more that you should be out there covering them because people need to be reminded of what's happening out there but all that being said it's extremely important to keep the tempo up\nAnd to continue to get these images out there\nAnd have them scene and to get a reaction from and of course some people will disagree with that they'll think that these photographs shouldn't be shown wonder why would\nThe same hospital and um as people were praying in their their six children often with their mothers being completely malnourished and unable to breastfeed or to to get any nutrition for them\nAnd it was a child photographs and um eight hours later that that that child died I found out the next day and uh\nThat's just incredibly heartbreaking to be witness to such a young and and it satellites that then it's just gone you know you hear it the next day though that that child died and the people who are volunteering and working in these clinics are they're kind of becoming used to
