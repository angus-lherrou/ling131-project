where poverty isn't capable\nIn St Louis Missouri a major component of the crisis it's affordable housing there just isn't enough of it and for many of the residents who do manage to get to subsidize place to live conditions only adds to the dignity of living and working in poverty\nWas mole inside the apartment and so what they did was instead of them getting rid of the mole they just hang on top of everything so after about a month or two of the stuff was coming through you know the ceiling\nOther and receptionist in St Louis January went from living in an apartment run by the St Louis housing authority to a townhouse run by a private landlord one that she paid for with help from a federal section ... voucher program but even though she works full time January says the assistance she's getting is not enough\nAnybody that has won ... or or other common or some type of housing assistance they need it nobody is usually fatal they're low income families you know given his able they were so people were three part time job is not an audience still is not\nThere is a big discrepancy in St Louis and economy that President Trump likes to boast is stronger than ever and\nUnder class of people trapped in poverty and challenged every month to keep a roof over their heads that's what we teach the beach I'm a political reporter at the center for Public Integrity found in her reporting in\nSt Louis especially in this city about twenty six point seven percent of the people there are living below the federal poverty level it's very difficult if you are very low or extremely low income you find affordable housing and especially if you need to spend\nThe last time the city opened it helping choice Fouchier commonly known as section eight within twenty four teams do when you have is people waiting years hoping that they'll be able to receive a voucher\nA for helping that will accommodate them and their children I'm there also are waiting list for a public housing in the city in the county as well\nNow what are your options if you are waiting for section ... voucher we're what do you do in the meantime\nIt's not really a pretty picture and people are either in stable condition they're living with family members that might even be facing homelessness where they're living in a park a housing conditions as they wait for years\nComplicated program there are many different kinds but what what are the generally do you\nKnow with the U.S section eight housing choice voucher system it allows for a person who's ... through a privately owned property um and the federal government will pay a subsidy to the section eight accepting landlord and the tenant will pay the difference uh based on their income\nTell us about January Harris January\nHere is um live out in ... in Missouri she lived in the county of St Louis within a week of her moving into her town home for her and her youngest daughter Michael Brown was killed by police officer in that housing complex is just\nA two minute drive away and you have worked for most of her time as an adult down at least I went back to her work history back to two thousand\nAnd so she is technically checking off the personal responsibility boxes that\nPresident Trump and Ben Carson and I have that or we can get out of the system but at the end of the day it's just not enough she does make money she does technically an above the state's minimum wage of seven eighty five\nBut even with that it it's hard for her to make ends meet because as soon as she got her job at um a local nonprofit in St Louis before she got her first paycheck her rent had increased\nI get paid by the end what am I think goes completely for the rest I guess food I Can't see I'm not receiving any work\nI work every day so I Can't go to their trees I mean they they made it this is supposed to be set in stone associate families to transition to where they do not let me say\nThis is and there's no way\nCan you even get off of section ... housing right now because money is just too tight\nIs the housing situation that you're describing where there's limited housing available and long wait times for section ... vouchers is not being exacerbated by gentrification at all\nI think when it comes to public housing and action eat how thing I'm not quite positive if it's being exacerbated by gentrification my than a through my reporting that the housing authority are\nWonder highly underfunded um and that is not a partisan or something unique to this administration\nAnd do it can be difficult to find landlords who want to accept a section ... housing choice voucher holders because of all the stigma that come with that really that's racism or whether that's your fear that they may not care for the property\nAnd also for the landlord a there is a long process of paperwork and infection that golden you rather not used to be a section eight landlords so I think it's a lot of bureaucracy at play the reason why it's so hard to find affordable housing well\nLet's also talk about um what the current administration's stance is when it comes to public housing I'm thinking specifically about Ben Carson\nA HUD secretary who are essentially ... did a twenty Fifteen rule that require communities that receive Hod funding make an effort to integrate their neighborhoods where does that dance\nIn the Nineteen fifties in the Nineteen sixties there was a wave of white flight to the suburbs and what you have now is a county that is mostly white and in the city it\nOf this rule because no longer mandated that you make an effort to try to integrate your community\nThe president has said that the war on poverty is largely over or does that reconcile with what you saw in St Louis\nYeah I'm not at all actually um when I was visiting various communities especially alone north side\nPeople are just pointing around saying hey look at look at all the empty houses look at all these ... nobody is coming here and people are concerned about how they're going to make ends meet and that economic problems than\nGrowth that Trump teach for America doesn't really reconcile with what I saw in much of this city\nThe

the house thirty five of them are Democrats\nThat the most in recent years according to the center for American women and politics at Rutgers University\nThese women are trying to close the big representation gap but that heightened visibility comes with a different set of challenges in late August ... Morris the only black woman in Vermont legislature dropped out of her reelection race because of racist on line threats and harassment\nBlack women also faced extra hurdles when campaigning gathering funding and national endorsement\nKimberly peeler Allen is here to talk about these issues and she's the co founder of higher hyped for America in organization working to elect black women for public office\nKimberly thanks for joining us and it's a pleasure to be here what an interesting topic this says I'm let's talk a little bit about motivation right well I mean we were hearing was the year if the woman and everybody wants to run for office but there's one is particularly driving women of color more specifically black woman to run for office well I think it is um\nYou know the confluence of events that we are that we find ourselves in a black woman had been running and doing the work behind the scenes for generation you know thinking back to like Fannie Lou Hamer and Barbara Jordan you know women had been in black women have been in the trenches\nAnd now there is this new sense of urgency where it's being the attempt and in many cases the actual reality of the rollback of the last fifty years of progress\nAnd we're seeing that black women are saying I Can't let this happen to my community do I'm going to step up and run and it is um that combined\nTrey are white and male and that is you know by no means represent the diversity in this nation the electorate a thing you know we need to have some different voices around the table\nAnd the black women are speaking to my issues\nAre regardless of you know the fact that they're black or they can appeal to everybody and it has really\nBeen a great um catalyst for\nAll of these women to run such strong primaries and you know we really looking forward to some great pick up on November sex so let's talk a little bit about that because there are some challenges specifically and then we know politics is is like any other industry right there are challenges as we mentioned to funding and and getting support here\nUm yesterday in the show we talked about how important black women are to the Democratic party they've been called the backbone of the Democratic party Ninety percent of black women voted for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen and yet they still lacking representation and the party's leadership one of the guests that we had raised this notion of viability of black women candidates\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think black women candidates are thought of by the Democratic party as less viable because of who they are because they can't raise the money because they won't give them to support what is that about\nUm I think that's exactly at a higher heights was born out of the notion that we needed a space for a black woman a political home for black women\nAnd Glenda car and I we knew from our experience that the factors that make a black woman a viable candidate or not necessarily the same as our white counterpart\nAnd we know that by mobilizing our networks because that is what we do just you know to make life happened for so many of us\nAnd the volunteer effort and the word of mouth and then also be bringing our authentic spells ah to the campaign trail has really been a a great factor in the successes so we've always looked at\nStructure they have we look at a you know do they have enough money to reach their constituents we don't need you know the hundreds of millions of dollars that so many of\nThese races costs but do you have the baseline of what it's going to take for you to reach your target voters and do you have a solid campaign plan\nAnd you know are you in line with issues that we believe will make sure that black women in their communities and their families thrive\nWe should also note that Nineteen up the black women who are running for the house are challenging incumbents here now that could work to their favor or not depending on\nWhat we talked about which is funding you know how often is the ability to raise money part of the viability of a candidate right because you mentioned you don't need hundreds and millions and millions of dollars but are there specific barriers to fundraising that black women candidates face in particular\nYeah well I think there is you know just unfortunately the um\nInstitutional wealth or we haven't been here that long we've had a challenges to our communities that have not allowed us to amass\nA the the type of wealth that some of our counterparts have uh the fact that black women are making sixty three cents on the dollar just you know from the jump you know we we need our whole dollar if we're going to be competitive\nBut I think it is also thinking through it's not just the the large check but ah being able to mobilize our networks for those you know monthly five dollar contributions that add up over time\nAnd the those ah you know contributions strength because they're not just dollars but they're also voters then most likely volunteers and it's also a question of actually getting people to the polls I mean you can spend all the money you want I think we saw that here in New York without a ... year Cortez\nWho nobody thought you know this person was going to win and then she went right hand people showed up at the poll how important is that\nFor black women candidates absolutely it is a ... that is the deciding factor we ...\nOur priorities and there's a lot of races this that and just in the midterms will be watching Stacey Abrams than a bunch of other folks Kimberly peeler Allen is the cofounder of higher hype for America Kimberly thanks for being with us thank you\n[noise]\nThis week we've reported on the controversy surrounding Timothy ... and the police officer who shot and
