facing in their own state joining us to discuss this is Emily Stewart a reporter with vox Hi Emily thanks for having me and we're also joined by Jake Zuckerman a political reporter with the Charleston Gazette mail Hi Jake\nOr extra Emily I Want to start with you a senator Collins came out this weekend um to defend her vote on Kavanaugh let's take a listen to what she said at the un I Do believe\nThat she was assaulted I don't know by home and I'm not certain went but I Do not believe that he was the is\nEmily a Collins is not up for re election in November but from what you've seen what's the reaction been so far to her vote I mean she pretty\nPopular I mean and it seemed to have at least for the time being harmed her obviously she's not up for election until twenty twenty so there's a lot of time between now and then that people are disappointed um\nWe'll see sort of what happens in the next several months and years but I think that a lot of her constituents were disappointed and more broadly I think women around the United states who are looking to her to defend them are also disappointed and her\nWell and then not just disappointed there actually putting money towards funding her opponent what have we seen about that so far there's been a crowdfunding campaign to support whoever that the opponent would be whoever the Democratic opponent would be\nSo there's a crowdfunding campaign run by it be a hero which is the group founded by the activists Eddie barking and they've raised about three point five million dollars to go toward who ever run toward runs again turning twenty twenty and that is a big amount of money I spoke with him over the weekend and\nYou know they said that that might be a game changer for whoever does decide to run against her get the nomination in twenty twenty obviously there are a little optimistic about that but it's a lot of money that's already again\nToward something more than Jake let's move to West Virginia

[noise]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n\nAre you interested in a tally in music and talk\nSaid that it is the weekly round of news music and memory some\nEvery Saturday morning at seven on W E s U Middletown\nThis is the take away with tens of a a guy from WNYC NPR I public radio international in collaboration with W GBH radio in Boston [noise]\nOver the summer the White House made a declaration of the nation war on poverty with quote largely over at the six that this is part of the administration's argument for an acting stricter work requirements for public assistance at the same time unemployment is at three point seven percent and the stock market is booming\nSo is the war on poverty really one well this week we're working with the center for Public Integrity to check in on parts of the country that are still struggling with poverty our first stop today\nGrand the town would also be directly impacted by the president's proposed border wall [noise]\nFor what they say\nWe know there's a lot of Kelly\nSure there are some places that that\nThat I mean they need to be quiet and\nThey love and all is here to tell us all about that he's the federal politics editor for the center for Public Integrity and he's the editor of its news six part series Dave welcome to the takeaway got to be with you tend to be so what is ... like\n... sort of this idiosyncratic little city in Texas uh I used to report from Texas I've been there several times\nAnd our reporters to hunter Hussein who's spent some time this summer down there found a place that really cut against the stereotype of what a border town is in the United states and what I mean by that is that\n... is incredibly dependent on a cross border sister town in Mexico ... Mexico and as a result quite literally people depend on ... for\nThe basics of life groceries water a transportation family there is such a cultural connection almost as somebody else is there that were a border wall to be built um most of the people there feel as if the community would be not only cut off but even killed by its own country and they feel that\nThe debate in Washington is a world away from the reality that they're living down there a ... which is very bleak and uh in high poverty a not a whole lot of crime but certainly a lot of needs that they feel go well beyond a border wall they don't want the wall at all\nWell let's talk a little bit about that I mean you said it's a high poverty area I'm going quite an in contrast with what the administration announced this summer that the war on poverty has\n[noise] it's poverty but it's also jobs which I suppose the two are inextricably linked it's health on a very odd twist or in the story is that if you have a a an injury if you're very sick and you need to get medical care\nThere's only the most rudimentary basic medical care available in ... in ... city oh and you have to rely on the hospitals and knock out to to get a critical medical care otherwise you're going to be a matter of fact two at Texas a city that\nAre in minimum will be an hour away and if you really need serious care it could be four hours away by cars so as a result of people feel very isolated that they feel that\nA Washington and the federal government in a way is not eating their concerns this was a place for up until a couple of years ago the many of the streets were unpaved or in the city literally a dirt road town so something that you would expect and not necessarily in Texas but much more in Mexico but\nThe narrative is sort of flipped one eighty why\nIs this now and it's interesting that you mentioned the narrative and in fact for health care um Americans having to go across the border into Mexico to get health care I just want to make sure I understood that correctly\nThat's that's true and I even for a non critical care your your dentist might be there are certainly uh other\nCountries and daily necessities might be there to help both in an acute situation but also to and and just keeping yourself a fed keeping your family fed or making sure that\nThat you have the basics of daily life this is really the reality there and if it becomes more difficult for the cross border flow to\nTo flow as it were then that would be something that would be potentially disastrous and many of the minds of the people are ... you were that to come to bear\nOn also seems to again also fly in the air and the face of the narrative that we need to quote unquote build the wall um when there's this type of symbiotic relationship going back and forth between these two communities\nOut um throughout the week but tell us why you chose the place that you chose what is it about these individual places that um tells a story that's different about the nation's war on poverty\nYou alluded to it earlier but yeah Donald Trump or as president has taken a sort of victory lap this summer and into the fall\nSaying that hey the war on poverty has largely been one of the economy is incredible that the stock market is at its highest heights and for many parts of the country that is absolutely true and people are doing extremely well must underscore that but\nThere are places that feel incredibly forgotten and that even though things might be great on one coast or another in this big city or that they are struggling and might be an issue of education we go to Yahoo city Mississippi to tell a incredibly heart wrenching story there St Louis Missouri where\nHousing is such an issue on everyone's mind or should I say the lack there of\nUh we go to a place like Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota where\nPeople feel incredibly disenfranchised to all these places that we may have only gone to sex but a representative of many other places throughout the country whether it's the\nUh the mountains of West Virginia maybe the the rural parts of Florida Gary Indiana Flint, Michigan these are all places that that are struggling that that have a reality that goes against what are what some leaders in Washington would like to have you believe\nWell we've got about a minute left and obviously we've just got a couple of weeks left before the midterm elections what could those elections mean for communities like ... all\nWas happening with the backdrop of the mid term election and people have a choice to make their making it now in early voting in some states they will certainly have the opportunity to to make that choice in November ... election days so for places like this are struggling they they face a big question to which is whether they want to participate\nKeep your head above the poverty line it's very difficult to participate in such a critical vote is the one that we're facing right\nNow they love and solace the federal politics editor for the center for Public Integrity and editor of this new six part series it launches tomorrow and we'll have a link of it on our site the takeaway dot org

eighty eight point one W E s U S in Middletown\nA community service of Wesleyan University\n[noise]\nHi this is really jumps out hosted the Broadway radio our joined me every ... seconds before Sunday of the month from five thirty six thirty PM feature of the best the Broadway some old classics two last night for\nAs well as a society is a system Broadway brightest stars [noise] the Broadway radio our rights here a W E s U Middletown [noise]\nRight after democracy now you can find our\n... program on line I Do believe you assure them to work where you can also find two weeks of our private programs to catch up on any shows\n[noise] last Thursday marked a turning point\nSteve what's in formerly known as the MacArthur genius fellowship a grant of six hundred and twenty five thousand dollars that recipients can use however they'd like over the course of five years it\nAllowed us to be able to practice our and to have space and time to create new work\nWithout having to have the burden of figuring out where our income is going to be derived from you know we don't have to find supplemental jobs to be able to do the work that we do we can actually just be the writer that we were sort of been pushing to be all of our careers\nMore recently has already carved out an impressive career for herself writing the Broadway bound musical into proud about the temptations\nServing in the writers' room for the Showtime series shameless she's also authored a series of plays that in Detroit a city that's central to her identity [noise]\nI'm from Detroit I was born and raised there and my husband's from Detroit in my family lives there and so for me Detroit is personal it's about family\nI always say that Detroit is also a metaphor for black America in this country and then therefore America large I think so when people are looking at the city where sort of looking at\nThe social narrative a a narrative around race and economics and our nation and so for me it's important to be writing about that in writing from a place of within a\nHave so much love for the city because I have so much family there and and I had such a really particular upbringing there and so\nI don't feel like Detroit has had very human picture painted about it in terms of media exposure and so for me I Want to be a narrator on the city that's held more humane picture of our city\nOne of your most recent plays a huge take on the issue that we're calling the school to prison pipeline where children are essentially criminalized and on that very young ages and um something\nAge and keep audiences involved in such a heavy topic\nWell first of all I was an educator for many years and I was raised by an educator my mother was a teacher for forty years and highland park Michigan which is a\nA I call it a subsidy inside of Detroit um and so because of that I just have a vast knowledge about teaching I spent so much time and so many schools across New York city and all of you know the many public high schools in elementary schools\nAnd I have a very close and personal relationships or to teaching because of that as a public school teacher and private schools teaching I've been in both\nUm and so it looking at that topic it's pandemic really\nYou have to look at it from really many angles and so my play pipeline is about\nLooking at it through a mother who's trying to raise her son but also a mother who's a teacher in a public school so we get to see her relationship to the public school system her son who goes to a private school and had relationships that private school system and we're looking at\nBasically within the two forms of education how institutions can fail children an educator\nBoth in the public school maybe infrastructure ally but in private schools culturally and both of those things are harmful to young people and can lead them to not having enough space for the total humanity and their emotional ... young especially young black and brown boys and our nation and so that was important for me to try to explore\nOur producer who was putting the segment together found a an interview that you'd done with NPR and here's where you say\nI always say that we can't allow ourselves to be cherry picked you know or to be the flavor of the month flavors come and go and I think that it feels like we're being flavored right now as opposed to being institutionalized and grown up from the bottom up and I think you were referring there to the opportune\nWhat do you see going forward as now a newly minted MacArthur grant awarded the but also as a woman of color\nPlay right well I think that change doesn't just looked like putting people on the cover of things or in the on the brochures of things and it looks like if a structural change you know you have to change in leadership and we're seeing that evidence and large and small ways and our nation right now right leadership it comes from the top down\nAnd so on because that in theater in particular it it means\nProgramming is decided by leaders you know how a theater as Ron How they're marketing department as Ron\nWhat kind of audience they're bringing in that's all decided by the institution and so it takes people within that institution and leaders within that institution to have a very diverse backgrounds and for women of color\nTo being more positions of power and where they're making those decisions that so I think we need to see a shift and that so the work that I Do as an artist\nMy work is on stage but it's not just wanted to stay off of off the stage because it it it's a time in the world while I feel that\nIt doesn't make sense for me as a woman of color and it's a habit work about people of color and then they're not to be people of color in the audience\nThere has to be a an entire collective shift that invites audiences of diverse backgrounds into the house to have an experience together that's what makes theater special and that's what my work has to be the catalyst for\nAn Dominique I Do I agree with you a hundred percent and they don't know how we make that change\nIt starts first and foremost with community development I think that there's an assumption about what people of color will not spend their money on and that is ... but by and large because people are not following the buying patterns of people of color to suggest that we don't have the money or wall spend it on things that are the significant is false\nI think it is also it's about ... ...\nLady of tickets is a big deal and that needs to be that needs to be addressed in theater there there's too much of a disparity between ticket prices especially when you're talking about Broadway but the biggest thing I think it's community development which means\nYou cannot expect people to come to you leave their communities to come over to see something at your house if you are not ever willing to go to them\nYou have to be willing to take work out and to their community\nOffered them something for free I always use it in terms of like food I say you know why would I leave my house I Know that I can cook I have my food\nSo it comes to your house and each of food and I don't even know that you can cook and you brought me they're all samples\nLike why would I spend money for ... each of food and I don't even know that I like your food that doesn't make sense you have to you have to move me give me some samples to bring me out and show me that I'm not just\nA flavor but somebody that you're really trying to cultivate a meaningful relationship with that is the kind of thing that I think is missing and that we have to start doing and being way more active about\nDominique Marie so it's a playwright whose work includes
