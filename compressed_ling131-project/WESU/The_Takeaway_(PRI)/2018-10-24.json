slashed the uh bay [noise]\nThis is the take away the caffeine I make [noise]\n\nThe past few days President Trump had been crisscrossing the country stumping for Republican candidates in the lead up to the mid term elections\nAnd one of the biggest talking points here of immigration what's\nHappening right now as\nA large group of people they caught a camera that [noise]\nHe's referring there to the caravan of Central American migrants that's been growing since the first set off almost two weeks ago from Honduras and migrants have now reached southern Mexico where many are requesting asylum others will continue the arduous weeks long journey by foot to the United states\nThe president has made no secret of his feelings about certain groups of immigrants [noise]\nYou wouldn't believe the streets [noise]\nAre animals they're bringing drugs [noise] they're bringing crime their rapists they are not our friend believe me I don't Jay ... is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United states\nSo we want to take some time today to do some fact checking on this caravan of migrants coming from Central America\nCameras and search for the five MS or you're going to find Middle Eastern\nYou're going to find everything I guess what we're not allowed because I said I Want to say\nTo help us unpack all of this is Ron next and the New York times is correspond\nA into consideration here we just heard the president's comments about uh they're being middle Easterners and the caravan he later said he had no proof of that but clearly this with a dog whistle I'm thinking who within the caravan Ron what do we know\nThese are people that are primarily migrating and speaking to a an asylum primarily coming from Honduras and I understand that there are some people from Guatemala and maybe a couple of other places in the northern trying all countries [noise] but uh it looks largely like it's it's a group of people coming from Honduras\nNow we also heard um my pen vice president Mike Pence and Sarah Huckabee Sanders who were saying that there are about ten terrorists are just back the terrorists come into the United states every day that was something that they are set around the caravan let's take a listen to a vice president Pence\nWill it's inconceivable that there are not um people of Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than seven thousand people\nAdvancing toward our border in getting the truth is well let me let me statistics on this I mean in in the last fiscal year ah we apprehended more than\nMore than ten terrorists or suspected terrorists per day at our southern border\nOr from countries that are referred to in the lexicon as other than Mexico that means from the middle east region\nRon does other than Mexico mean from the middle east\nOther than Mexico includes everybody you know from Mexico so it's not a direct one minute okay no no including people from the northern triangle and and that's primarily who's been refer to as other than in Mexico but it it really does include anyone who is not from Mexico and nuts because\nTraditionally up until a few years ago most of the people seeking to come across the border\nThat's an end up fighting about terrorists being apprehended at the border\nThat's that that the vice president mentions come from um customs and border protection the parent agency of border patrol and it basically says that\nThe agency prevent and known or suspected terrorists from traveling to or entering the United states every day and physical two thousand ah Seventeen\nIt makes no mention of them being apprehended at the border and it doesn't say specifically that they're coming to the southwest border that typically has meant that these people are being stopped from coming the airports so yeah it it's completing a that\nThat is meant to be one thing with the home care of and it and it has nothing to do as far as I can tell a with a caravan of people\nHe's also made some claims about him is Thirteen and I don't want to minimize the concern about him as Thirteen um but I Do want to check with you to see is there any evidence of MS Thirteen so far being a part of this group or having any influence over this group\nI haven't seen anything that that just with MS Thirteen is is a part of a group in the president's comments about ticket camera and go in the middle of a caravan and you'll see him as Thirteen I I don't know what MS Thirteen would look like I mean there are certainly\nYou know a members that have facial tattoos and things like that but not everybody who's ... him as Thirteen looks like that so [noise]\nYou know as far as as I Know and from my colleagues on the ground there and and my coverage of this we have not seen any any evidence of that today\nThere's another concern um and I I I think this is a really a question of language and dog whistles out when it comes to race and politics and I'm Wondering are the Republicans\nAnd um you know obviously it it helped to president get elected and this has been one of if not the signature issue for this administration\nAnd I think that for a lot of Republicans ... place wow a particularly now UC cameras with this crowd of people coming to the country and you can point to be there they're they are they're these people who are trying to to get into our country\nUm so I I think for them you know it's it's an issue or that they feel they can gain some traction with as you know political scientists and pollsters are predicting a blue wave particularly uh in in terms of taking the house of representatives\nYeah we've also heard a Mike Pence said that it is a the caravan that they've Venezuelan plot um the president has suggested that the caravan is being supported by Democrats and George ... his name has been talked about can we confirm any of those claims\nThere's no evidence that the Democrats are George Soros or Venezuela have bonds for instance this particular care man and and remember this is something that happened earlier this year too there was a caravan of people coming to the U.S and most of them\nActually didn't make the trip to the U.S it it sort of petered out before it actually got to the U.S border so ultimately we don't know what's gonna happen\nWith this group of people because they're about a thousand miles away\nRight which is more than Miami to New York from when I Am right now yeah right and they're walking right so\nTake that into consideration thank you run next thing is a correspondent for the New York times covering the department of

to get back to the sixty minutes daylight saving time do from us back in March\nOf two days later Californians will have a chance to decide if they want to join Arizona and Hawaii and live in permanent daylight saving time meaning nor clock changing that's right and California daylight saving is on the ballot proposition seven and lots of you say right on I this\nJohn from buffalo I have been railing against the uh time change for years I have a sleep disorder we really throws my body clock off for weeks every time we do it this is Peter from New York I absolutely would support\nAnd to the changing of the clocks housing to avoid disrupting by young children's already fragile would say this is Sam from Portland, Oregon yeah down at the time change things\nIt seems silly to change our clocks twice a year\nAnd as an editor and reporter for ... science in San Francisco and she's been reporting on the measure as well as the origins of the practice and the case against it today Danielle thanks for being with us on the takeaway\nThank you for having me so what is where did this ballot measure come from who wanted to eliminate daylight saving time in California\n[noise] this is from the state assembly member sponsored by a state assembly member in San jose and he heard about the issue from his constituents on it was his dentist actually who showed him medical studies that link that loss of an hour of sleep and the spring to increased stroke\nTraffic accidents and heart attack\nWow so there's actual um consequences to clock changes\nThere's pretty good data that that loss of sleep um throws off people's circadian rhythms disoriented them and I'm puts them at higher risk of all of those things\nSo it's not just that we're grumpy or there's actual real change interesting what what's the case for ... like what is the case that there that are in addition to any of the health concerns are there other reasons why uh props up and wants to be a white white folks are pushing props\nUp [noise] yeah I mean it's a pretty unpopular practice to switch clocks so there's some popular support for keeping the clocks steady year round also when we are using daylight saving time we have that more light in the evening\nAnd there is some economic benefit because I Am from public health benefit because people are exercising their out eating at restaurants they're playing sports there walking the dog\nNow why do we have daylight saving time in the first place can you remind us\n[noise] yeah the idea dates back centuries it was Benjamin Franklin who wrote the first proposal he was probably joking but at the time\nBut just leap a to work late late into the evening writing by candlelight until three or four in the morning and then he would sleep until about noon and one morning he got woken up by the loud sound at six AM\nAnd realized oh the sun's up that could be I could be using the sunlight to write by I don't need to spend all this money on candles um but it wasn't until World War one\nThat it was really adopted by countries it was a Germany\nThe was the first country to Institute it and then I'm all of the countries that were involved in the war effort adopted daylight saving time to save energy and it did use to save some energy it doesn't\nSay much now it seems um it was then made optional between the wars was brought back again in the United states for World War two and in California voters um voted to Institute that the daylight saving time schedule that we have now are in Nineteen forty nine\nNow some of our listeners may remember the last time the United states didn't switch to standard time which was back in Nineteen Seventy four during the oil crisis can you tell us what happened then\n[noise] yeah I'm President Nixon ordered\nYear round daylight savings time for two years to save to save energy during the OPEC oil embargo\n[noise] but it was incredibly in popular because it meant very cold there dark mornings especially in the northern latitudes and it was so unpopular that Congress ended the experiment I'm a year early\nNow I'm Wondering about you you mentioned northern latitudes now is daylight saving time something that really helped um those of us in the north and maybe heard those of us in the south who are closer to the equator\n[noise] well I wouldn't say that it hurts people who are closer to the equator but\nThe shift of light versus dark\nLight so here for instance in California if this proposition passed and California did indeed go to a year round\nSaving time the son wouldn't rise in the in the shortest days of the year in LA until about eight but in the northern parts of the state that it wouldn't rise until about eight forty five\nWow that's pretty intense you know we did ask our listeners um for what they thought about this idea and there were lots of folks who supported it as we mentioned earlier you know there's a lot of support in California for this right now but I Do want to play you a comment from one California voter\nHello I'm Alexis from Los Angeles as a Californian and it's pointless measure that what is resources that could be used for other issues like health care homelessness\nEducation pathway for immigration prisoner farm and lifted them is even if the measure passes it still needs to be approved by Congress and who knows how long that would take I don't know\nDid you know we've just got a coming up on the end of the segment here but it's not an accurate representation would it take resources away from needed services to make this change\nYou know the fiscal impact it's really unclear it would require some extra money to coordinate airline flights and you know with other states but it also could save money with the decrease accidents and increased productivity\nDaniel bench in as an editor and reporter for ... science Daniel thanks so much thank you [noise]\n[noise]\n\nThey take away is supported by constant
