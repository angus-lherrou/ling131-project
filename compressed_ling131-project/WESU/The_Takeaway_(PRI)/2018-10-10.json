schools can you tell us or described for our listeners a little bit about what you saw what were the conditions like so few schools\nAre actually in very good shape they are modern there's new tables

gone out a couple of years ago and some parents tried to pay to have it fixed I tried to help the school district\nAnd um then the heating system couldn't keep up last winter and one parent had to go and pick his child up early from school so it's in it's in rough shape and the issue is that they don't have\nThere are there just isn't a tax base there it's it's very low they don't have a lot of income coming in so they don't have resources to pour into this old facility let's talk a little bit about um race and how the demographics of these schools are playing into what you saw down their\nShirt so what I found in my reporting is that in Mississippi did this happen has happened across the state [noise]\nForty nine of a hundred and forty five school districts\nAre more than three

there now is Ninety eight percent black and if you look across the state of Mississippi none of the districts that are more than three quarters black R rated a or B none of the district\nNow is that

targeted by the Saudi Government\nSo he was one of the most outspoken critics but the most interesting thing for a lot of us who knew him over the years was that he was well connected to the government and he had served in the government\nYou become a spokesman for some senior officials so for us we knew him that way\nAnd then lately she'd taken up a poster with the Washington Post or the global columnist and moved away from Saudi Arabia and basically set up in self imposed exile\nIn his in his criticism had increased so he was a real ... in the side as we speak clearly now with his fate\nAnd you've been speaking just sources within the Turkish government Carlotto what are the new development here\nWe've been following this day by day and drip drip the information has come out of it was clear from the start the that the Turkish officials here were very alarmed and\nThey talked early on of his possible death um\nAnd now we are getting the actual evidence we don't have a his body yet but we've got very from signs from Turkish officials they don't want to come out in public that clearly giving it to\nJohn honest to publish that those two groups of Saturday's that arrived on the day that he attended a meeting at the consulate he never came out from that meeting\nOn the left the same day I'm\nOut in his shows are Turkish officials\nSaudi officials Fifteen of them on two separate\nPlanes they came in in in a different times that day and they left the same day and the\nTurkish officials are saying they were essentially a hit squad they were responsible for killing him this membrane his body and somehow disposing of it so the the mystery remains the investigation the types of now\nMounted an investigation they're asking the access to the consulate which of course is

about what we know so far about how ... was killed if that in fact what happened\nThe details are gruesome as one official told my colleague David Kirkpatrick that it's something like pulp fiction and that they even arrived with a bone saw among their equipment we know they took several books is an suitcases out of the embassy or consulate building put them in the cold [noise]\nUm we know they traveled with luggage on that private planes so it's coming out slowly but there's some very alarming details um those even one team to do the job of killing him and another team to clean up the premises often with\nNow what do we know about how the United states has reacted if at all in the United states obviously had close ties to the Saudis um has there been any anything from the U.S so far\nSo at first it was a bit muted I think perhaps for everyone nobody was quite sure what had happened was this a case of a disappearance or really foul play and the talks I think have been\nHold on rich nation especially in the Muslim world and so everybody has been looking certainly from here from looking from Istanbul where where I'm based has been looking to the American reaction and we saw a couple of comments from President Trump but also from vice president Pence and I think\nImportantly a more and more comments coming out of from congressman and senator so the American I think sided

any you know the president\nOf the usa criticized John us but the president turkey often criticized as journalists including foreign journalists like me working here um but this is a completely different league from you know complaining about the press or banning press from working or even share as journalists I'll put in prison [noise]\nThis is altogether different league because it's not only an act against a journalist who was clearly\nA disliked by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia for his criticisms but to dispose of him breaking international law I'm In another country\nA different league of of what we have seen ... coming from the U.S president them on the Turkish president so it's also very shocked the talks are both in government on in society I think the government or radio
