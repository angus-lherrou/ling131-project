to do is try to make it\nEasier for people understand what they can do to try to solve the problem\nWell I Want to talk a little bit about that from your perspective mark is that when we were thinking about this I thought well a lot of people are using paper straws for example and they're using nylon bags instead of plastic bag is that enough is that not enough what are some of your solutions from

some of the poorest communities in the United states just months after the president's council of economic\nAdvisors declared that the war on poverty was largely over that narrative neglect the stories of countless Americans still struggling under crushing economic conditions\nAnd today we turn to a community in North Carolina where natural disasters\nAnd poor governmental respond to have exposed the depths of that suffering\nMorning it's our journey Chris I live in a lot of\nCow and march first term storms may just a\nHurricane Florence made landfall in the Carolinas last month and the devastation brought back painful memories from just two years earlier when Hurricane Matthew tore through the area the first category five Atlantic hurricane in nearly ten years\n... it affected everyone in your show with [noise] ... it affected everybody but they don't understand it God Forbid I Wish\nIt was just deja vu for these residents the damage was just horrible\nThat's actually ... a federal politics reporter for the center for Public Integrity and I talked to her about reporting in Lumberton and whether or not residents stories were reflected in the ... the economic picture touted by the Trump Administration\nLumberton North Carolina it's a it's one of the most diverse rural counties in the country actually um you have about a third white a third black a third lumpy Native American and a growing Hispanic population so it it's a very interesting kind of make up there\nAnd of course we're looking at this series through the sort of idea that the president of the United states has recently and said that we solved the war on poverty that were good when it comes to poverty but Lumberton is actually one of the poorest an unhealthy is the most dangerous counties in North Carolina tell us about what that looks like yeah\nSo I visited twice a this summer in the fall first to kind of see what the town looked like after being hit by Hurricane Matthew twenty sixteen and you could still see a lot of the destruction from that long ago you would the\nPiles of stand that had come from under the river that people hadn't cleared out I'm Still some furniture laying out somehow ... that just were very dilapidated and some areas where they had already torn down the entire house and there was just to green space\nAnd what about the impact of Hurricane Florence\nSo they got pummeled again I'm almost two years\nDestruction but I was talking to a lot of people who are finally getting their lives back together um one woman I saw her the day that she got into her new home that was just rebuilt\nAnd then Florence head and the same thing happens all over again her houses with flooded and I heard that story time and time again\nAnd are there any people or groups in particular that these residents would like to see more from I'm Wondering about FEMA um or any other organization\nFEMA on the ground Red Cross been on the ground\nThere was an issue with Hurricane Matthew with HUD money with housing and urban development money that hadn't come through from the state\nI think about ten percent of the money that was gifted from the federal government would actually distributed the people are saying well okay the money hasn't calm not time around than in two years later to what's going to happen with Hurricane Florence money um how would I was not going to work\nSo Chris Howard the lumberjack resident we heard from earlier echoed those same concerns in trying to get help rebuilding his house\nAbout at the end of the airport right now but just getting medication stage which\nWe don't know what was going to happen because they're telling me that is true for Eric rich default batch\nI talked to many runs in that one either or to discourage even apply for aid because they were told that they would never get it denial they're very frequent FEMA admits that and they say you just have to apply again but that's really discouraging to residents\nOne person that I spend a lot of time with a stand Powell she actually went back and forth with FEMA twelve different times talking to different representative\nOn that process so the recovery for a lot of people that need it the most that were really hit badly and are in shelters are staying with family members the system isn't really working from them in the way that it meant to\nThis is a district that was reliably democratic but did end up voting for President Trump who has said as we mentioned earlier that the war on poverty is over is that a disconnect for the residents of Lumberton also at the\nTime but it was very interesting I as I said before just showing up matter and during the hurricane at a lot of the people I talked to said we saw Donald Trump's last we saw the big name Trump on the side of the box we saw Lara Trump\nPat thing our water bottles to us and that was really memorable and we didn't the Hillary Clinton and\nDonald Trump all those kind of talking to the points that really resonated with Robert don't in such as I'm going to get rid of NAFTA a lot of people they took a ton of them and you factoring jobs out of the county um I'm not sure\nHow much they think that he held up their promises but at the time he seemed to be speaking right through them\nAnd where does lumber to go from here obviously there are mid term elections coming up in a couple of weeks though there's probably still a lot more recovery to be done where did they go from here\nYeah so that's something I was trying to piece together when I was there because you still have hundreds of people in sheltered um and maybe voting is the last thing on their minds are they weren't really politically engaged to begin with that is one of the reasons we chose rather than county they have a very low turnout rate\nYou're trying to rebuild ... um you may not be living in your house you maybe with a family member the board of elections are saying well we can send you an absentee ballot you can vote from anywhere we're sending them to shelters we extended the voter registration date\nTo see who does come out for this election if they're if they're angry enough with being hit twice in two years and don't feel like they've been paid attention to is that if that will matter or if again they're just going to be struggling to stay afloat\nActually both ... the federal politics reporter for the center for Public Integrity Ashley thanks for being with I think too much for having me and you can find a link to the abandoned in America project from

registration deadline for one third of the states across the country from Arizona to Georgia to Illinois and beyond that if you want to vote this November this is your reminder to please go register and leading up to election day we've heard a lot about election meddling whether by Russia China some guy in a ...\nAs to ballot hurdles for voters are now getting thrown up across the country just this year the American civil liberties union filed a federal lawsuit against Arizona thing to stay put more than five hundred thousand voters\nAt risk of being disenfranchised and in June a federal judge struck down of Kansas law that required proof of citizenship to register to vote it was deemed a violation of the national voter registration act\nJust to go who's minutes here to tell us more she's a reporter with ProPublica and the lead reporter for election land a coalition of news rooms covering problems with voting and twenty Eighteen just get thanks for joining us things for having me I appreciate it help us understand what's happening here we know that twenty sixteen there'd been a couple of changes as we mentioned at the top\nWho are affecting really voter disenfranchisement who can and can't vote in this country has some of those changes but there\nAre a lot of states that have um issued new voter ID laws or there are states that have redrawn they're voting boundaries um to make it more difficult for your voice to be heard um in terms of gerrymandering and making district far more partisan than they once were\nAnd this is sort of been a slow progression states have also a become a little bit more\nUm bowls in terms of um cleaning the voter rolls and sometimes that\nIs sometimes that crosses the line into purging um and and so there are there have been a lot of action especially in the last two years to make these things happen so there's going to be in this election it's going to be the first time that a lot of these laws are in place in our expecting at least a little bit of confusion at the polls\nLet's talk about that because um we talked a little bit about you know cleaning and purging what's the difference there between cleaning the voter rolls and purging the voter rolls I think there are lots of civil rights activists who say this is really an effort to purge and keep communities of color and other folks off of the voter rolls what are you saying\nYou know I think that it really depends on who you ask I think\nThat vote or all maintenance is bad I think we all have an interest in making sure that people who are no longer living in our communities or who are no longer eligible to vote for whatever reason and remain on the voter roll\n'em but there are states that do this and in a in a particularly aggressive way that might make it more likely that a person who\nUm say doesn't check their mail very frequently or wouldn't know tourist bond she would have been a specific mailer or doesn't vote regularly would be more likely to be purged from the voter roll 'em so for example the Houston case which the Supreme Court decided just recently\nAllowed the state of Ohio to remove people from the rule if they didn't respond to a few mailers and also didn't vote in and I think to election and so if you think about the people who are least likely to respond to a postcard that look very much like junk mail or for being honest and then also not regularly turn out to vote\n'em those might be people who are minorities or the poor or the elderly who are least likely to vote anyway and so they might be at higher risk for getting her from the role that it really depends on who you ask how severe\nThey believe that problem is if you talk to someone like the Brennan Center they're going to tell you that if the ... have you talked to come on like the public interest legal foundation they're going to tell you it's good\nPractice practice but I Want to push back a little bit there because when I get a notice for jury duty and clear what that noticed is I don't think anybody Mrs noticed is that why aren't these notices clear or are they seem somewhat deceptive if you're taking people off the rules are not making it clear that you've done that I mean doesn't isn't that somewhat\nAnti democratic\nAnd that that's not necessarily the case in a lot of state there the mailers I agree could be a lot clearer um but they do send the mailers more than one time over a period of a couple of years I'm an ... that said though people are very likely to ignore them even if they get them a couple of times like I'm not\nRemoved from the voter roll or helps if the language was huge big bold letters and that is when you get a jury summons and it clearly says if you don't show up you're gay rested I Want to turn around for a second here because what\nHappens at the twenty sixteen election there were and I covered this there were lots of threats at the polls a more that the fear of people being threatened when they showed up at the polls\nUm people claiming to sort of want to implement these checks and balances when they got there are you seeing that for the midterms is there are there is that that many levels of concern in terms of who can and can't vote you mentioned confusion at the polls wasn't that going to look like\nDo I think that's what we're more likely to see and that's what the case as well and she's sixteen I'm we anticipate it ahead of the two thousand sixteen election um a lot of voter intimidation and that was on the news every day there were people actually actively making threats about intimidating voters at the poll and are costing them there\nThat didn't actually happen um in two thousand sixteen we only saw that a couple of very isolated locations and not for very long and it didn't appear to be any sort of an organized effort and so\nEven if we start hearing sort of threat the head of the mid term elections I think that people should be really wary of the idea that someone's going to scream at them in front of their polling location that have actually not a threat that we have seen and but the talk of that threat\nIn and exaggerating its likelihood would prevent some people from turning out to the polls so I really want to stress\nThat we did not see that in twenty sixteen and we don't necessarily expect to see that in twenty Eighteen well we didn't even twenty sixteen and what we do anticipate staying in twenty six twenty Eighteen is confusion around new laws so for example and twenty six team to Texas voter id law was implemented\nUm and it wasn't even necessarily that the law itself disenfranchised people but because there was confusion about what the law actually say that\nBack when you said they didn't actually disenfranchised people the voter id doesn't the voter id require you to have an idea\nThe state and so that and the the information in terms of what voters expected and what poll workers are trained to do different branch I it's quite a lot of people and so we expect to see the same sort of confusion and twenty eight feet around new laws\nJessica who'd been at the reporter with ProPublica and the lead reporter for
