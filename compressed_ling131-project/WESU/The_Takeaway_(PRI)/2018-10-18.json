Astros are vying for a chance to win back to back World Series title [noise]\nPitcher Roberto tuna may have lots of asteroids bands when he gave up that home run during Tuesday's close game the Astros are currently down three to one against the Boston Red Sox and the American league championship series but it was placed on the team has also been question for reasons unrelated\nIm for violating the league domestic violence policy and while he was still suspended the Astros picked him up in a trade from the Toronto blue jays than the Astros made another move this week they announced a partnership to address domestic violence in the Houston area\nWhere the Macintosh is a reporter covering baseball for SB Nation thanks for being with us Whitney absolutely thanks so much for having me so there's a lot of information public right now about the of tuna a domestic violence charge what do we know about it\nSo what we do know is that he was arrested back in may early may uh in Canada for an assault on an unnamed female victim uh in that case than a police report was filed but because it was in Canada\nI think they're just a little different things are a little bit more under lock and key whereas in the U.S we would probably do some detail what we know trial dates were pushed back throughout the summer while he was suspended\nA and eventually just about a over a month ago the criminal case was wrapped up with a piece bond which is about approximately the equivalent of a a probationary a restraining order situation in the U.S he has a year of\nProbation he's not allowed to speak to the victim and essentially that was because the victim who lived in Mexico did not want to travel back to Canada to testify so they had no a reasonable expectation of conviction um so that's where we stand the suspension has ended and uh yeah the the detailed or just a little\nFuzzier because we don't have that police report to refer to or an actual criminal trial that you know went under way talk a little bit about and that will be a current domestic violence policy like what is it it's only been around for a couple of years um but it led to some long term suspensions like in the case of tuna\nYet so I'm all these current domestic violence sexual assault and child abuse policy was implemented in twenty Fifteen I'm there have been a handful of investigates\nWas the third or fourth one this year actually I'm most recently adamant Russell of the cubs which was funded forty game for a domestic abuse so are there have been players offended before and after as soon as he is not the first but again his situation and very specific because\nThere was a trade that was involved um but MLD doesn't necessarily um similar to other sports and that they do not necessarily\nWait until a criminal case has been completed they do their own investigation they speak to the victims on their own time they may not speak to a victim uh at all when they take their a final decision into account um an overall the processed it a little bit a\nKind of like hosting this case it's a little bit um non transparent we don't have a ton of information about\nWhy oh so you know was Seventy five games out of Russell was forty or a handful of players have been in the Fifteen to thirty range in the past two years we don't really know what ... investigation\nConfessed stuff and um so it's a little tough and it does make it uh it does open them up to speculation quite a bit especially in the case you were saying\nHe's the third highest number of games\nHe must have done something awful but we don't know um and we have no way of telling so it's a little tricky um and players under the suspended out of the policy are as we've seen eligible to play in the postseason compared to players suspended for steroids or performance enhancing drugs which are\nNot eligible to play in the postseason so that's a little bit of a\nTricky line as well so there's definitely some criticisms there are some issues of transparency as far as how their investigation go out but uh it's been a few years and you know uh I think on a case by case basis it's worked on varying levels for them as they get to\nThe ashes decided to trade to ghetto sooner while he was still suspended and I guess the ... and when he was speaking to the New York times earlier this week the general managers that this quote did we take a risk no question are there are people that are ...\nThe teams stronger what do you make of that\nYeah I think it's a\n... the way I've seen the Astros have been a little a little bit calloused in this case um you know this is not the first time that a team has treated for a an a legit or confirmed domestic abuse or in order to win the world series the cubs did this with our oldest Chapman star closer currently on the Yankees a few years ago and it did when the world series and it worked and fans kind of had to\nCome to terms with whether that was worth it with a tuna um the actual ... been a little bit more blatant about that's what we're doing um you know he ... he throws good pitches he got him when he could win at the world series\nWhen he what's interesting about this story is that the arrows now have a domestic violence campaign tell us about that ... that\nPurely for the optics of ... having gotten no sooner is that a real serious a campaign that they really have put a lot of energy behind what is this campaign\nI think it can be both but it does come across as significant PR then Jim ... owner of the Astros did openly admit kind of\nWe now that we've created for us you know we want to make sure that domestic violence awareness is a ... in an important thing for the Astros foundation which has a thirty million dollar endowment I'm so again he kind of fed the quiet part out loud we trading for domestic abuse are now we'd like to do the work in the community that hope hopefully makes us feel better about that I feel like they're trying to have it both ways\nIt it does um the players have been saying oh he's a great clubhouse president you know ... you know and AJ Hinch Jim and manager of the team have kind of been like\nHe's a he's a great player he can put that path behind him it's great and now they're donating I'm Around three hundred thousand dollars to local women's shelters in Houston, Texas area and um [noise] partnership with the ... the council and family violence\nSo they put the work and they have cooperated but it is a little bit having it both ways we vote the Whitney Macintoshes a reporter covering baseball for SB

T alliance that I think is um an allied a very intimately with Israel with strong support from the Trump Administration [noise]\nUm I think these players are hoping to rewrite the geopolitics and the political map of the middle east\nBy pursuing a series of very aggressive policies toward their adversaries fundamentally rooted in strengthening authoritarian uh allies in the region a crushing civil societies and um and and playing very hardball with um with other countries in the region\nDo you expect that all of these things could potentially lead to another uprising similar to what we saw in the Arab Spring\nI think can evidently it will to think that you know millions of people many of them young I'm with aspirations for a better future are simply going to accept\nTo live under different forms of despotism forever I think is wishful thinking I think in many ways that really is the um the ... and bargain it many people in the west have calculated on that these authoritarian regimes can simply keep things under control assuming that people will be\nHappen but almost certain ah another revolt some form is inevitable\nWell and I well also you know the Arab Spring was in twenty ten twenty eleven were now in a very different a moment\nUm at least internationally the United states has a different president in a different administration I'm Wondering um what about that long standing relationship and support to the United states and Saudi Arabia have had\nA this isn't a Trump phenomenon slowly this is something that the United states and Saudi Arabia have had for for quite some time do you think that uh that relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United states could be affected by what we're seeing right now in the ground\n[noise] well I think it's bound to be affected I mean you're absolutely right to um\nTo suggest that this is simply not to be diminished Donald Trump the U.S Saudi relationship and more broadly the U.S relationship to the region goes back to World War two where the United states effectively I'm struck up a series of alliances with 'em\nOr autocrats in authoritarian regimes I'm hoping that they would preserve stability advance American interest\nIn this particular incident that we're talking about what ...\nThe United states and specifically President Trump has sort of played two sides of the coin on the one hand they're defending the Saudis they're saying they're regional partner on the other hand they're being confronted with more and more and more evidence just yesterday we heard there was an audio recording of\nA what could potentially be ... um last moments um then that evidence is showing that this could in fact be a state sanctioned Saudi murder what type of danger could there be in continuing that alliance given this increasing evidence\n[noise] well the danger is that it's simply going to um um perpetuate a very um [noise] I'm odious regime in Riyadh is responsible\nAnd it's going to generate more anti American hostility it's going to embolden\nAutocrats and dictators around the world to see that at least this administration in Washington DC is willing to go to bat apologize deflect criticism\nFrom the policies of authoritarian regimes so is going to have a lot of destabilizing consequences we've invested heavily in these regimes we've invested heavily in this particular crown prince hoping that he would be our savior\nAnd all the warnings that people were issue in with respect to this policy with respect to the this particular ... no one took a seriously and this is not just a Republican Trump problem this goes across the political spectrum\nAnd as I stayed at a moment ago has deep historical roots this is the consequences of investing in authoritarianism and political tyranny and\nIgnoring human rights and basic um questions of of of democracy and good governance\nAnd we also know that the Washington Post published a final opinion piece from ... last night um which they had received right before his death are disappearing\nAnd in it he writes about the need for free expression in the Arab world can you tell us what the role of the press and the media is in Saudi Arabia and how that impacts what people may or understand about what's happening in the rest of the region\nThe role of the press and the media and Saudi Arabia is to effectively repeat the propaganda of the Saudi royal family I mean there is no independent press there is no free media that's one of the reasons why\nDo you want to show you had to leave and move to the United states um and so the role of the media in Saudi Arabia is not that different from the rolls the media and any authoritarian regime in Saudi Arabia I think it's much worse because the the the nature of the level of the repression particularly under this crown prince has moved at a much more ugly and repressive direction you know this final\nThis this concept in this idea of the free press\nIn relationship to U.S policy toward Saudi Arabia we haven't been pursuing a free press in Saudi Arabia we haven't been pursuing human rights we've been coddling dictators in death spots from the time that the United states emerged on the scene in Nineteen forty five\nIt's been a consistent policy of downplaying these\nBasic values that we often espouse as being foundational to our own country at our own national identity but we rarely apply them to our foreign policy particularly in the middle east and I think we have to we have to figure out a way out of this um this just broken pattern of of policies that are I think not in the long term interest of\nThe United states and they're certainly not in the long term interests of the people in the middle east\nNot her ... me is the director of the center for Middle East
