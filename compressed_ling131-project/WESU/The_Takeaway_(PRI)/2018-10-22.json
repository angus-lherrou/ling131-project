death a new report from the New York times reveal how the Saudi Government uses troll farm to orchestrate digital attacks against dissident and journalists including ...\nBen Hubbard at the Beirut bureau chief for the New York times and he's been reporting\nTo to field public relations were crusts or customer request something like that except this is this'll be a group of people who've been hired to be very very active on social media to promote some kind of agenda in the case of the story that we wrote this was obviously to\nSort of do a number of things to try to benefit the relations during the the reputation of Saudi Arabia so this is to attack content that was appeared to be negative to Saudi Arabia and promote content that is positive for Saudi Arabia\nAnd tell us who was behind the troll farm and whether that farm can be traced all the way back to the highest level of the Saudi Government\nWell it would be pretty impossible for something like this to happen without the knowledge of the Saudi Government so I mean this is a monarchy it's an authoritarian state so it'd be very unlikely that a ... say impossible for this to happen unless it was signed off on you know by the government and we know that so one of the officials who was in charge of\nIn charge of this effort is somebody who's very close to crown prince Mohammed bin ... the man who was you know the sort of the fact or ruler of the kingdom\nAnd what are some of the messages that these trolls were using\nTheir their various ways that they do this sometimes it's just to try to manipulate hashtags that are already out there so if there's a hashtags that they perceived to be negative to the kingdom they can sometimes just flooded with various kinds of spam so that it becomes in a way unreasonable\nThey also try to game the algorithms to Twitter has to try to get certain hashtags onto the trending topics so if there's a hash tag that picks up or there's some cases it may have actually been created created by them\nThey can drive a tremendous amount of traffic to that\nAnd don't try to get it on the trending topics list which makes it much more likely than anybody inside of Saudi Arabia who's on Twitter is going to see that particular topic\nYou know to take a step back you kind of have to understand how important something like Twitter is in a country like Saudi Arabia again this is an authoritarian place that doesn't have really free media I mean almost all of that newspaper\nSo when Twitter started spreading in Saudi Arabia probably seven or eight years ago it was you know it was a huge deal for the kingdom and and a lot of people then we're very optimistic and said oh this is going to be this great new technology that's going to lead to you know it's going to democratize the discourse\nWhat we've seen is that you know this government really had the ability to manipulate all of that because they have huge huge resources from the oil wealth they're able to buy really the best off the shelf technology that you can find\nAnd they just you know they're they're very organized so they can you know either create automated box or in the cases that we wrote about higher human boss who can order trolls are called air sock puppets there's various terms that people intact used for this but basically hiring people whose job it is to weigh in on the social media debate surprising to shape the way that they go\nThey drowned out a lot of messages they they've apple fight other messages they manage to get certain things that would not have been trending on the trending lists on Twitter so they they've they've ended up being very effective and um they they they end up playing a real social media plays a very large role in these countries in just shaping people's perceptions of reality just as media doesn't any country\nBut the the differences Saudi Arabia is that they're just fewer avenues out there and so when they can so effectively manipulate what people are seeing when they got on Twitter they can really have an effect on how people really perceive the world around them a perceived their own their own government\nReported on an ax Twitter employee who was spying on behalf of the Saudi Government what do we know about that person well\nKnow that there was the Saudi engineer or Saudi Saudi tech person who got hired by Twitter was working there and then joined with basically tipped off by American law enforcement and said we have suspicions about this person that he has been whether he was working directly for Saudi intelligence or whether he'd been sort of recruited to do this bit of work for them\nIs not entirely clear but the concerns were great enough that he was using has access to the company and has\nI Am wondering if hang attention to this more now because a democracy ... death um he was in fact one of the folks who was targeted by these campaigns was he not\nHe was definitely targeted by these people you know there was you know ... mile by the time he was killed had last time I checked I think it was somewhere around a million and a half or more than a million and a half followers on Twitter he was very prolific on Twitter he would tweet in Arabic he would treat an English he would interact with people who were post articles and\nYou know so so for someone like him this is a very powerful publishing platform I mean there are lots of articles published by the New York times that don't get a million and a half views\nBut you know somebody like to have that many followers just on his own Twitter account so\nThey put a lot of effort into trying to fight back against him and so he would get lots and lots of comments and lots and lots of abuse and and and things like that so yeah he was definitely sort of one of the people on their list that they were\nYou know try to influence the way that the content he was putting out as being received by people\nOr we should also be clear that Twitter at the company has been under\nFire for a while now for what it allows and doesn't allow on its platform and how it controls when people can say and what they can't say\nAnd I'm Wondering from your reporting have they ah said anything about all this time folks from Twitter responded to either the ah the employee who was supposedly working on behalf of the Saudis or to how their platform is being used in this instance\nI'm not aware of any direct response from Twitter till the article that we published on Sunday I mean I Know that they they certainly have talked about other ways that they tried to do this there was you know they put out of information\nA few days ago I'm Talking about a large sort of bought network I think they called it that they had taken down to the sort of a pro pro Saudi bought network that Twitter had taken down so you know there there there are certainly aware of\nTo allow the mediums function we don't want to be censoring people we don't want to be taking things down and less otherwise necessary so I mean I think for what are they they're trying to find a balance between keeping the medium as open as possible but that also stepping in what they need to to try to shut down things that are enough areas\nThan Hubbard is the ... bureau chief for the New York times and thanks so much for your reporting on this thank you [noise]\nYou take away and

tragic loss of life that that wall by up gun standards this was an epic cheap Kelly\nFiat Saturday many people that fit that it would be in a lot more major attacks I mean I've been reporting from Afghanistan for ... a year and a half and and some of the attacks that we've seen in the last few months for example I I I've seen\nFifty people being killed in one single attack and we didn't see anything like that so from a security perspective that to me that people who were killed that wherever attacks people was in some cases prevented from voting we already knew going into these elections that\nEpisode will clothing stations across the country we're gonna have to remain closed\nBecause of security concerns\nBut these elections were more peaceful than many fit they would be\nOr they considered democratic by the electric because\nThe ticks off the year the violence and corruption\nActually being and in Afghanistan over the last a week or so that was a lot of people who will also quite optimistic at times because they felt that in these elections are unlike in previous elections and numbers the candidate for a young boy from professional backgrounds but went educated\nAnd and

because it was introduced so late I go to this stuff it seems one particularly well trained in how to use it and that helped contribute to the ... so there has been a lot of\nCriticism of of the organization of these elections\nYou mentioned a lot of the younger more educated candidates that are running I'm Wondering are there any themes are there any common political threads that they share you know something that might be resonating with this electorate\nWell one thing to note is that in enough gone to San Juan parliament isn't particularly powerful in comparison to the to the position that the president um the second is that the political parties on really a dominant into parliament most candidate standards independence even if the\nAnd the struggle for power so a lot of the people who stand as I say our our independence\nAnd that means that they can uh cultivate their own constituencies of support ready to that and he was still a lot of people who have full majority led a civil
