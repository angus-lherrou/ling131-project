than two hundred thousand homes remain without power and in many communities few homes even remains standing\nBut for Americans living in the path of these hurricanes the past few years have been devastating there have been for category for hurricanes in the past two storm season from Harvey Irma and Maria and now Michael and that means some are still responding to one disaster when another one hit\nMy name is Jody I live in Charlotte North Carolina I'm a nurse and I volunteer with the red cross I was only home for two weeks\nFrom my deployment to eastern North Carolina for Hurricane

disasters keep coming due to the challenges of rebuilding and climate experts say the storms are not going to let up in fact it's just the opposite today will take a look at what hurricanes like Michael tell us about our own weaknesses from building codes to community effort\nCraig few gate with FEMA administrator from two thousand nine to two thousand and Seventeen he's seen the country the hurricane Sandy and a host of other disasters but before that he was head of emergency management for the state of Florida Craig welcome to the takeaway thanks for having me\nOne of the things that it's become clear after Michael is we really need to just building codes can you tell us why and how that is [noise]\nOr probably the one stormed it really showed Florida the need for a better building codes and better enforcement was Hurricane Andrew\nA tremendous damage but in the aftermath we saw that a lot of the construction wasn't even being built to the uh the codes and the community and so we we learned that both the codes are important but also the sportsmen inspection of those codes were critical and when you talk about\nStorm surge is one of the biggest concern is that indicated in your experience that folks to not be thinking about building along the coast at this point well\nI think we have to be very careful about how we build along the coast I think in many areas particularly if you look at this part of Florida's coast\nA storm church is measured in ten feet higher and many areas and it goes well inland so probably building right on the water's edge maybe not be the best place but if we build appropriately we elevate structures\nUm it doesn't mean we cannot develop but it means we just not going to be able to build like we've done in the past\nAnd the other challenge we have with all this this is not going to be inexpensive and this part of the state this is a lot of um\nAs much as it's going to cost us to rebuild this coast are we going to create a society of resilience based on wealth and funding a displaced people who can't afford that are we going to look at how we can build resilience eat our coast and not leave out the working class\nThe L. dot com\n\n[noise] say there is Joshua Johnson the host of one egg you might have guessed but we take the first amendment seriously\nThat's why we named the show after the

released this week Massachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren backed up her long contested claim that she had Native American ancestry\nWith results from a DNA test and telling of her family's story my mother was born in the eastern Oklahoma\nIt had been Indian Territory until just a few years earlier when did you become\nMy daddy always said he fell head over heels in love with my mother first time you are\nBut my daddy's parents the hearings were bitterly today are marrying my mother's family read was part Native American\nPresident Trump has long punted warrants claims of native ancestry and even nicknamed her Pocahontas the\nHuge war of using her Native American heritage to advance her career grand Lee brewer is a contributing editor for tribal affairs that high country news and a member of the Cherokee Nation Hi Graham Hi what was your reaction to Elizabeth Warren decision to take this test and put out this video\nI thought it was very interesting I Want to be very clear I'm not here to discredit her story or the common knowledge of her family that that she's been passed down I was more concerned about the way it was talked about and and I think the method this conversation with Elizabeth Warren\nAnd also President Trump has been very problematic from the beginning\nAnd I think using a DNA test to validate that history ... was probably the wrong approach\nIt's interesting there because you don't want to criticize that gets her intentions for doing this but then it was actually what she did write the message the way that it was done with the issue a DNA test to self was it that it was covered up by the media inappropriately\nIt's all of the above when we're covering Indian country weren't covering tribal communities we have to take not just look at the language we use but the way we talk about them\nThe problem I had with senator warns approach was that it kind of fosters a narrative that has damaging to native people to give you a little bit of contacts I have a very similar story to Senator Warren I Am\nNot much darker than she is a outwardly the place where that video shot is probably just a couple of miles from my home I live in Norman, Oklahoma and that's where I'm Talking to you from now\nAnd so I don't fault her for wanting to know more about her history or in fact I Would encourage her to do so but I I think when you invite people to talk about the degree\nLike you're opening up two conversations that\nFeed into stereotypes and myth about native people blood quantum is a very a thorny subject it's an institution of colonialism it was something that was put in place to essentially weed out our levels of of of native blood so by putting a stop on me\nA degree to which you're allowed to join your tribe which is a choice that tribes are able to make as they are sovereign nations\nThen it makes it less likely that your children will be able to be tribal members if they don't have the same amount of Indian blood is you do my tribe for instance the Cherokee Nation we don't have a blood quantum so as long as you can prove lineage you are a member\nUm to say that someone who is one eight that has more of a Steyer is more native than someone who is one thirty second for instance\nI I think is wrong I'm we're not just talking about a racial distinction here we're talking about a political distinction this was a citizenship question I Am a U.S citizen of a sovereign nation as well as being a descendent of an indigenous person\nCan you help us understand a little bit more when you talk about blood quantum what does that mean in the Native American community\nSo when the government put many of us on the trail of tears\nMy great great great grandfather for instance they wrote his name down where he was from and where he was headed to\nThat record still stands and it makes it easy easier to trace my lineage back to my Cherokee roots\nThat way I can show the nation that I Am a descendent of this person I Am a member of this nation and I can be enrolled us such now some tribes have blood quantum in place uh my my son for instance is also part of Iowa\nThe Kyla nation of Oklahoma you have to be one fourth pilot to join the Navajo Nation is similar but when it comes to ...\nThe shit say definitively you are an indigenous person when it comes to tribal issues DNA tests are used to show who your parents are to show that lineage to show that you are a descendent of this person it's not a test that you can take to say yes I Am Kyle or or I Am Cherokee or I Am Navajo\nI'm Wondering in terms of the media coverage of this did you feel like native perspective we're being included in the reaction to Senator Warren decision um to release this video\nI felt like there was a lot of attention given to Senator Warren how she feels about Trump's rhetoric towards her which I Will agree as as not okay it's not acceptable the way President Trump speaks to her about race\nBut I felt there was more emphasis on how Senator Warren was affected by it rather than how her response affects indigenous people\nI think her response helps foster this narrative that like I said her blood quantum is important or that a DNA test can prove that your indigenous neither one of those things are true in reactions I have seen from indigenous scholars writers and just regular tribal members off the street\nIs is mostly one of anger they're not happy with the way that this has shaped the public discussion\nThey don't feel like Senator Warren\nHas made efforts to understand them or their perspective\nAnd they feel again like their own narrative is being perverted and the public eye I think we need to keep in mind that when we're talking about indigenous communities we're talking about some of the most isolated communities in the country and I don't just mean physically yes some of those communities are isolated physically\nBut there is an invisibility problem with Indian country non native people by and large don't understand Indian country they don't understand sovereignty they don't understand a tribal membership and they don't understand like I was saying that this is a citizenship question as well as a racial distinction\nIt's popular culture when it comes to Native American people ... brewer is a reporter with the high country news that a member of

[laughter]\nAnd it's one of the realities of for its promises groups is that you know the claim to just be ... ... ... white interests but you know but I Believe they're pro white advocates\nBlaine dynamic here is less white supremacist them\nThan authoritarianism and that's what they're selling and authoritarianism crosses all kinds of racial and ethnic and religious boundaries\nI'm you know we've got one of our main sort of a ... boy groups out here on the west coast is called patriot prayer and they're headed by a guy who's Japanese American and his right hand man is big among God so uh yeah ... and I see all kinds of non white guys joining their ranks\nBut when I talk to them every one of them has what we call it right wing authoritarian personality\nTania you wanted to weigh in here let's say that I just wanted to throw in the idea that um it's not new but yes it is in some respects in much at that now these white supremacist groups are claiming to be welcoming\nTo people of color I'm not just that they're pro white and it's just about culture and that they're not actually rate that but they were OK with having non white members be part of their bandwagon\nAnd while they may be very much by authoritarianism and I agree with you there\nThey're off spouting lots of pro white rhetoric at it I don't think we should be ... missing\nThat it's a thing and it's like you said about authoritarianism it doesn't mean it's kind of outrage\nYeah no that's absolutely right um it it is it's very interesting mix and it's also it's an interesting mix of all the new because ah they're marketing it in ways that I mean the always the radical right was very backward looking\nAnd this shape of the ... radical right as very savvy very media savvy and very forward looking which is a problematic\nWell I also want to talk about the initial response to this here at least in New York City um the NYPD the New York police department said on Monday that it did have plans to arrest a nine members of the Proud Boys and three more anti fascist opponent but footage from the fight that night shows\nPolice the NYPD didn't do enough to stop the attackers there was also in assumption that there was support here from the implicit support for the the the Proud Boys from the NYPD David do you think there's a level of support within law enforcement for right far far right groups like the Proud Boys\nYes I Do um I Believe that actually our law enforcement system throughout the country right now is being you know very heavily politicized by organizations like the oath keepers\nOf which specifically or you know this is essentially a patriot very far right organization that is recruiting law enforcement\nUh and they're succeeding so yeah I've been out covering a lot of these and I would say Portland police in particular are very prone\nTo uh acting in defense of the the right wing side and I'm very much uh acting against the they very much see\nThe ah anti fascist says the bigger problem is that I think that's a problem\nTanya your your thoughts on what I find fascinating about that David is that I think another aspect of this and that even for the police officers who don't actually view themselves as being invested in the white supremacist authoritarianism\nI think are very much swayed by the idea that what they are serving our it's just about free speech might that these folks are checked spouting their ideas\nAnd I think that's part of the underlying problem here is the stereotype of the United states is being do absolutist about free speech that you can take any kind of hateful thing on the street and it doesn't matter and it doesn't seem to me that it was built in violent although\nHistory shows how intimately into intertwined free speech is with racist violence\nI Do want to point out that we did a reach out to the NYPD the takeaway did for comment about their response specifically to this incident and also the claim that Gavin McGinnis said that the heat\nAgain it's an individual who's a provocateur tour who does not speak for the NYPD they say the NYPD it's a diverse institution dedicated to keeping safe all eight point five million New Yorkers violence in disorder like what occurred on October twelve is unacceptable and will not be tolerated and the the statement does go on so they did respond to this request\nAt the national level what do you see uh do you see this is a trend that is going to continue to catch on is this something that'll go back underground what's your experience tell you\nYeah my experiences doesn't really help this because this is all new I'm I'm obviously I think we all hope it goes back underground but uh I'm not very helpful in that regard because I think this is very much a creature of the Internet\nDavid night where it is the author of all to America the rise of the radical right in the age of Trump and a correspondent for the Southern Poverty Law Center and Tanya Hernandez is a
