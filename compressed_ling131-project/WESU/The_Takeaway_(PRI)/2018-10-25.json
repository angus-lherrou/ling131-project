I'd have a two hundred years ago\nThat the film's protagonist Peter who returned home to fight for his land in Louisiana as he tries to court his love interest Maria when I sat down with Sasha he told me why this film still resonates with viewers in twenty Eighteen\nLand ownership is an important part of the story and there was a statistic that someone in the film and said that like every week black folks are losing a thousand acres of land and\nBy the year X Y Z black people won't have anything and I thought that was a really powerful idea this sense this idea of ownership and land ownership and the relationship that cultures have to the land in as people who have who are of African native dissent\nHaving this relationship and report the land\nAnd the ownership of the land in this you know sort of European system of what it means to own land well we're here so if we're going to participate we might as well be owners as well that was an important sort of a plot and the story that when your mixed in with feminism color resume class there's a lot\nThere did you learn anything about your dad that you didn't know it didn't have a sense of through this film\nYou know my parents split when I was young and he moved on to another relationship the the woman that he was in a relationship with before he died she's from the region and she worked on\nInside of the romance in the film I had a sense of what it might have been like for my parents\nYou know what that courtship might've been like because it was there's something very I don't want to say simple but something so tender about the way the characters interact that it's it's very genuine and you can't really\nYou can't make that up it would be super corny you know I mean someone said recently who saw the film\nThat it it has a very eighties vibe does that mean well I was a kid in the eighties to let them well you'll if you're a kid from the eighties you will love the appearance of designer jeans everyone's we're rocking designer jeans everyone's but male and female looks great\nThere's a photo Matt you know I don't know for those who are old enough to ... days we used to have to take film right actually get a developed right at a little hot that was usually stationed in a parking lot there was a photo Matt\nYou know so the pacing you know there's an eighties pacing maybe like if you watch sixty minutes from Nineteen Seventy five it's like it's really hard you know it's it's really slow the pacing everything so quick now but I think the pacing of the film is\nIs in the spirit of the story he wanted to tell he was a documentary filmmaker so there are long scenes music is a very important part of the film and it was funny the editor was telling the story of how my father would make everyone listened to the soundtrack and he made me listen to it too that the one thing that I always remembered\nBut in some instances the music plays out in a way that it's almost like a music video which to me like almost like a long long for music video which in a in an interesting way was kind of ahead of its time or\nSort of merging with the emergence of music videos and I learned from someone that he was inspired by super fly for instance that that had like a amazing soundtrack and he wanted the soundtrack to almost be a character in the film and that definitely uh the way it is\nI'm black everyday life in those films similar to the way that your dad was able to bring that to like do they think that is one of the most compelling things that you're talking about is just how new ah how delicate these portrayals where do you see the filmmakers are getting better at well I think\nHollywood is recognizing that there's money in this audience and people of color have more than one way to be and there's nothing wrong with not having a broad world view but\nHollywood television in particular likes to put people in boxes by marketing money okay this very specific group of black people like these hair care products you can do stuff to people I get it but I think this sort of box at the same litter you no pun intended black box that we've often been put in\nIt too small it doesn't fit anymore\nAnd um you look at you know my man child is\n[noise] you're listening to eighty eight point one FM W E s U Middletown standby for just to be committed to emergency alert

art forms of reflection of in a reaction to the environment and so to tell the story you've got to understand the environment all the things that they went through to become who they are and so to me the music is the cherry on top\nIt's all the other stuff the environment ... social climate all the things that they had to overcome that really make their story compelling is there anything\nWell thanks something every time I have the opportunity to make a film\nI say something you know I did a film called fresh stressed about the history of hip hop bashing and you you learn about a Sunday

they can go to church worship God it's white or supposedly white\nThere aren't a lot of people looked like me who have the opportunity to say things and so I like to entertain people but I think it's
