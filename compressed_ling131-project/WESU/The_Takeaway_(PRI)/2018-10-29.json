bath and counter terrorism expert Bruce Hoffman\nAnd British we've heard a lot I'm under that diminished ration from the president of the United states that you know we've seen from the Muslim ban 'em to pointing fingers at groups that are violent like MS Thirteen\nThat have committed terrible acts of violence as the real threats here and yet in just one week uh we've seen three uh attacks that were homegrown these were domestic uh acts of terrorism and violence so what our who is really the biggest threat to our domestic security right now Bruce\nWealth through things for the twenty first century it turned out to be enormously in short Todd on any number of levels both in terms of ...\nWe have a spectrum of threats and it's it's I think it's difficult to distinguish what's the worst and what's the most threat they're all threatening and they're all bad because they all kill individuals and they all target individual\nBruce I never I I have to say that I've never um walked into school or up my place of work and thought and and was really afraid for my safety in my life\nI think most Americans these days with the they didn't ever think about um being afraid for their lives when they go to the movies or when they go to a dance club I mean this is something I feel that's clearly different\n[noise] yes well it is it is there's no doubt about it but we shouldn't lose sight of what Freeh said earlier throughout the United states history at times of Gray Davis of this polarization alienation\nWe've seen an uprise repeatedly in this kind of violence before and after the civil war in the late Nineteen century during the period of industrialization and modern communications we saw two presidents assassinated within Twenty years of one another certainly in the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nI think that you know terrorism hate crimes\nRest and sit along the fault lines of our society and what we're seeing right now you're quite right is far more acute now that it's being in our modern memories\nBut don't forget one Eighteen month period between Nineteen Seventy one and Nineteen Seventy two there were twenty five hundred terrorists bombings in the United states\nSo this isn't a this is in terms of the violence unprecedented but in terms of the mood that both you and brief described I mean absolutely there's been a change I think that the security we felt recent years has almost completely eroded\nFree let's talk about that a little bit because I'm you've done or perhaps one of the most visible acts of resistance when you took down the Confederate flag down a little bit about how the activist community is reacting to the\nIn this in this nation and I think that it's dangerous and in many ways a historical to try to lump lights the premises violence and with all other forms of terrorism\nFor one white supremacist terrorism is the most common form of terrorism in the United states it always has been you have to remember at one point Birmingham, Alabama was referred to as bombing ham because a number of bombs that were being set off\nAt the homes of black residents were trying to vote part of the problem of lumping\nWhite supremacist terrorism in with Islamic terrorism and some of these other forms of terrorism that her name is that white supremacist terrorism is unique in America and that it has a mainstream stake in the politics\nA lot of the views that are being espoused by these white supremacist terrorists are not far removed from the views that are being espoused by the GOP in particularly by Trump\nYou don't see as much pushback\nIn terms of labeling Islamic terrorism as his lab at Islamic terrorism because it doesn't have the same implications for American society America is not a majority Muslim nation however the ideology of white supremacy is very much in the mainstream of America now of course we have ...\nWe have made a lot of progress from where we were in the past but to discuss what is

to play\nFrom the Caribbean Africa I'm\nLost that day ...\n[noise]\nThis is the takeaway with tens of Vegas from WNYC NPR I public radio international collaboration\nAmerican voters head to the polls next week there'll be deciding more than just which party comes out ahead in this election cycle\nThe winners of the mid term to have the power to shape our democracy through congressional redistricting that means the redrawing of the electoral map that happens every ten years and it's part of the reason why we're seeing so much outside spending on political campaigns not just federally but also at the state level\nHere to explain more is Denise Ross barber she's the managing director of the national Institute on money in politics Denise welcome to the takeaway\nThank you for having me so can you tell us briefly and hopefully clearly how does redistricting work\nSo after the twenty twenty senses is conducted states have to revisit their state legislative and congressional district boundaries and re draw them where needed what are they looking for in terms of redistricting\n... where the populations are and if new lines need to be drawn or a new congressional district needs to be established based on\nThe population numbers so for example in Montana we currently have one congressional district in that may have to get rearranged ended two and then uh consequently another state would have to lose their district\nI mean there's only certain number of house members in Congress so you can't just keep adding to the number of congressional members so they just get re arrange but mostly\nJust the lines get drawn with regards to who's in what district that's primarily what happens and if you're a state legislator for example you may remain that state legislator but your district boundaries change\nAnd what kind of a role is redistricting playing in our upcoming midterm elections\nA vast majority of states the governor and the legislature hold the redistricting pens after the census that means that curse\nAnd in drawing the new maps so it's a fairly important\nProcess that takes place every ten years or you know a lot of players involved and who is going to be controlling Congress to governors and senators who will be elected in twenty eight team because they won't be up and twenty twenty so they will be holding redistricting Penn\nSo looking at the money that's being spent on political campaigns what are you seeing we just talked about how much money is flowing into political ads\nI'm coming from superPACs coming from the campaigns themselves individual donors where are you seeing as far as money concern in addition to the fact\nThat the U.S house does that play in terms of flipping from Republican to Democrat [noise]\nThis is a very serious and major election at the state level because most states hold their big races during the non presidential years so we have thirty six gubernatorial races on the ballot twenty of which are at play and according to ballot PTA there are twelve state Senate chambers that could flip\nBased on the outcome of the elections so\nThere is a group called the national democratic redistricting committee which is currently run by Eric Holder who also was one of the recipients of a recent bomb threat\nUm and his group to NPR see has given directly to state candidates and political parties almost six hundred thousand dollars for example they gave two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to the Pennsylvania democratic governor a candidate Thomas Wolfe\nThey've given another two hundred fifty thousand dollars to the Georgia Democratic Party\nThey've given thirty six thousand to Wisconsin state parties and they also gave fifty thousand dollars and supportive of Ohio redistricting measure and this is just money that is going\nThe ... and others are spending independently on state races\nI mean you said it's hard to tell how much money they're spending independently are we able to find out who's funding efforts in state and local races\nCertainly the look we're able to know who is giving directly to the candidates and depending on the state laws we know the groups who are spending we may not always know however you know who's funding those groups and that's the dark money problem that both races at the state and federal level are confronted with\nWe've seen this in the past and twenty ten how did Republicans what was the Republican strategy back in twenty ten and how effective was that for them in terms of redistricting\nWell I mean they obviously took clear control of the vast majority of chambers of the state legislatures throughout the country they targeted specific races in order to do so they identified which chambers were most vulnerable and which states within those chambers were most vulnerable\nAnd really spent money and they were very successful the Republicans had a majority in almost all of the chamber's across the country or in at least the vast majority of the state legislative chambers many congressional seats also strong Republican\nAnd I'm Wondering how much do you think constituents really know about what their state legislatures do the power that they have do you think voters really understand the issues of redistricting\nNot at all [laughter] no okay so if they don't why not I mean this seems to be so critical critical use of our sense is that the critical thing for those of us who want to get out and vote and who were voting for why do you think that this she was so overlooked or misunderstood or not understood at all\nRight I I think because most people are just trying to get through their day in their year and they're worried more about\nKind of politically ... [laughter] the whole process involves just a lot of Jill mapping and and it's really\nA game that's played primarily by the insiders are the political parties the people who are going to the polls and and the voters who are\nPaying attention are paying attention to redistricting but certainly the major political parties and and their allies and these groups like the end they are the are very aware of it Denise Ross barber is managing director of the national Institute on money in politics Denise thanks for being with us thank you very much\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nThe takeaway is supported by huge originals on roadside attraction resenting diaper cloud thanks isn't around and at the mothers struggling to free her captured journalist son also starting ... found out in theaters friday\nAnd babble European made language learning program babble teachers practical conversation in Italian Russian Swedish and other languages available me up store or online at B.
