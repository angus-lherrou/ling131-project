{"month": "10", "state": "CT", "station": "WESU", "content": "And so this idea that there was an inevitable takeover that's going to happen is really just not true and and I think neither Democrats or Republicans are willing to engage on this issue at a very very\nFundamental and Cora level that problem with ties to the myth that we're going to the table and by the way Democrats are also guilty of thing\nThat uh people like me for example can only run industries that have voters of color and under playing the possibility that people like us have to run and win in any district in America and and that's the problem that you know Democrats are as guilty of with anyone out right\nWe are expected people to cut her expected to be able to set aside raised when it comes to voting for white candidates\nBut it seems to we're told it doesn't work the other way around it but some people of course do proves that Ron let's talk about your book people like on the new wave of candidates knocking of democracies door\nFirst of all I'm sort of counter to do to survey in your book come in you know somewhat might say well if you're an immigrant you're not eligible to run for office who is eligible as an immigrant and would you who do you mean who do cover when you refer to immigrants running for office\nWere so my book includes stories that first and second\nAmericans but also some who are a third and fourth generation uh I really chose stories that I think exemplify the incredible tenacity of a range of people who\nStepped up to serve their communities and until there's a range of immigrant backgrounds on Latino and Asian Americans out of Americans third fourth first and second generation people who are formerly undocumented and and the point of the story to illustrate not just\nThe power of these individuals stories but also\nKnow we we just talked about a policy a I'm Sorry practice in which people party leaders look at folks like me and say we can only running district with large numbers of voters of color but in fact in the book I tell about\nPeople who ran and won a majority white district or district that include multi racial populations that are not always a majority of people who are who share the ethnicity where the audience with the candidate\nTalking about people who have shared experiences with American voters\nThey shared experience of being a first generation college today and they shared experience of struggling to make ends meet the shared experience of wanting something for your child and you can always give because of the things that are holding holding your and your family back on and that's way more important than the shared ethnicity which I think is\nOne entry point for voters but unless a candidate\nOr an elected official in fighting for you on behalf of shared experiences with you that I don't think that person is being truly represent representative\nLet's talk about some of the people that you cover often when we think about you know wanting folks to uh to run for office we think of Congress but are running for one local city council it'd be really important stepping stone\nTo using our democratic tools you start your book with a ... a survey or friend description of Raquel ... in Detroit Michigan was the city council member tells her story\nShort on recount is one of the people who in fact is is the third generation Mexican American in Detroit and she was able to run and win Detroit went through a process of changing its elections from being city wide\nToo including a number of districts so that the the city was divided up into a number of districts uh Raquel district includes a large lasts\nShe was able to benefit from her relationships with community with residents from enthusiasm\nBy people in her community to date someone like her run for office and she ran in twenty Thirteen and one and she ran for reelection twenty Seventeen and it's still not only the first with the only you know on the Detroit city council and you know she's someone who grew up poor who still lives in the house which she grew up in\nWho in bringing to the city council her experiences as someone\nWho has struggled with poverty who had gone to college who it's from the Latino community but grew up in a multi racial\nEnvironment and and she brings all of those experiences to her campaigning but also to\nHer governance right basically ...\nGo ahead now she's going to say she's just a powerful example of the possibility that exist in our democracy when the systems are set up to work\nFor more people how important use it for candidates of color candidates with immigrant backgrounds who want to appeal to their broad voter base\nTo know subsumed who they are to not undermine their own identity because even though we may stand for issues that are a impact um everybody you know our constituents the\nUm we can be proud of our identity or ethnicity or background\nOr at the same time right I mean sometimes it were given the fact that it's one of the other\nWell I think the fact is that voters want someone who they can try and if you're someone who's going to deny an aspect of who you are\nAh you know whether you're an immigrant or not ah then it makes you less trustworthy I think and and two I think what we bring it not just that the fullness of our experience but the authenticity of of bringing our immigrant narrative are working\nVoters based on that off center city rather than on something we think they want from us as opposed to who we really are\nYou talking to about ... or Mara the incredible Somali a candidate who\n... who won her primary race for Congress in Minnesota and now she's a national figure presumably wrote about her before\nMost Americans knew who she was um how a ... important is her story and you know she the kind of person that can really make it\nTo her office in Congress you better representation\nYeah and you know she will make history when she gets to Congress in January but I think it'll have a story what's particularly important about her story is that she\nDefeated a forty four year incumbent in Minnesota for state legislature and twenty sixteen and so she had the experience of running a successful coalition campaign or you know that unified voters who were either frustrated with the incumbent or even though they had voted\nHer in the past or new voters who had not participated and it'll have built a strong ... campaign back in twenty sixteen it was a very competitive race and so this year when Keith Ellison made the decision not to run a so that he could run\nFor lieutenant governor in Minnesota in hiring already had experience as a legislator and experience running a campaign and so she could benefit from that when she made that congressional wrong and you know I think the fact is that ultimately someone like Johan\nPrimary responsibility is going to be to her ... her constituents in her congressional district and to her states but the fact that you cannot deny that she's a powerful symbol to women of color everywhere to immigrant women to refugee women to Somalia merits\nThat is available to our despite the anti immigrant rhetoric in practice and policy that its surrounding that this moment\nWent off the story ... ... new book people like I was ... Moreno he's here in Anaheim Southern California are quite near where our program is based on some weird she managed to win a seat on the city council\nAfter beat the challenging the biggest ... separate care Heine Disneyland often told this\nStory short a hotel you know came to the United states a as a child undocumented and actually benefited\nFrom the the largest um immigration reform program that we've had 'em in in at least in my time in Nineteen eighty six ah when Reagan signed into law a bill that I'm ... I'm Sorry for\nThat we signed into law the immigration reform in Control Act um and I tell stories of two people who say any cell block both\nOf whom benefited from that law and you know he went on to he ran and twenty fourteen in Anaheim citywide race and law and in that same election the voters of Anaheim voted a voted\nIn the single member district to win he'll say ranting twenty sixteen for the second time he was running a newly drawn district three uh where again he shares income and the experience of many of his\nCommunities residents I'm as I like the you know he and his wife have raised children there and he ran in this race um in which he effectively you know it's a great David and Goliath story and uh since he's been on the city council he and his fellow council numbers have really been able to push Disney\nTo engage in certain reforms that help the working people of Anaheim and so I mean that story and many of the others I tell them my book really are these amazing story", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Between the Lines", "city": "Middletown", "day": "16"}
