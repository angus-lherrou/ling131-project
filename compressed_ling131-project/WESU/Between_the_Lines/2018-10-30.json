listen to it on a radio station ... nationwide\nOn September twenty two thousand each team is she the people's stomach took place in San Francisco bringing together hundreds of women of color elected to office running for office\nAnd supporting women's political power I tend to just comment on among the women I spoke with was to restart younger the president and CEO of the ... foundation for women women\nAre the rule of the ... foundation here the people in the work that you're doing you how do you see you and your organization feeding in in a summit like this\nWhile that's a great question I think that the ... foundation has long supported for nearly forty five years\nThe idea of building women's collective power throughout the United states today we are here to support the women particularly women of color who have come together in a unifying voice to say this is the time for us to really have an impact\nAnd we have throughout the United states in over the past forty five years or sixteen hundred grand the partners\nWho uh Seventy percent of them are women of color that organizations and some of them have actually run for office and have one and so we know the importance of having women in ...\nThe running of and supporting the placement of women and those kinds of leadership roles particularly women of color\nHas this been a turning point you're since well let's just say since the emergence of the ... me too movement with this feels like a different political moment that we're in right now when it comes to women and women's rights and in and taking seriously woman's voice [noise]\nYou know I I'm not sure that it's just around the meat you moment I actually think we saw women of color coming together when we saw first lady Michelle Obama in front of us\nI think we started finding our voices and people started paying attention to those places\nBecause we've always been in these leadership roles women of color particularly black women have led almost every social justice movement this country had ever seen I think now media because of its alternative forms cannot not pay attention to us now\nAnd so I think me too is a point to point in the in the moment\nBut that's not the point the point is the fact that we've come together and realized that if we do not speak up for each other if we do not support each other if we as women of color cannot see the sisterhood nobody will see it and it is incumbent upon us to be the models and the role models for what that needs to look like in the country\nSo um do you feel that I'm political parties and politicians are starting to take\nWomen of color more seriously because for far too long they've taken women of color for granted as reliable voters will show up and vote for a particular party because they feel that that party is the best option they have but then when we see people in power\nWe see women of color being thrown under the bus over and over again when it comes to jobs or health care all these issues important to us\nYeah I think we're not just we're not going to take it anymore I I think we have gotten to a point where we recognize that we have the power and the collective\nBack because there are women of color who are running throughout this country who do not have the backing of the major political parties and yet they are running and they are winning their primaries and they will run and they will win in their elected offices in November\nAnd so what I think has happened is we've said we're not going to take it anymore and we're not going to play by the rules that continue to oppress us\nWe're actually going to design our own rules and we continue to see that we saw that in Alabama we're seeing that in Georgia we're seeing that in many many states throughout the country where women said we will design how we wanted to look and we will build it in the way that we believe best serves our communities and our family [noise]\nThese women doing it [noise]\nWithout too much establishment support basically taking the initiative wherever they can afford wherever they can and you know force thing may lead to recognize [noise]\nI I think there are no we're not gonna take it anymore and I think they're willing to push back\nAnd guess what at this moment in time we have nothing to lose we cannot rely on others to do this for us we saw what happened and twenty sixteen we are watching the world that that election result is doing for the next generation of young people\nAnd and out of disrespect for those that came before us\nAnd we are saying that that is no longer acceptable and so we will do it quote unquote by any means necessary\nSo that we create the world that we believe needs to be there and we will not rely\nNot on our white sisters not on our brothers not on our white brothers we will rely on ourselves and each other to get this done\nSeems as though one of the biggest impediment to women of color being able to run for office is money because there are our system is set up to require one to have access to\nRepresentation in Congress right\nNow I think the the whole structure is broken right we are built we are we are living in a patriarchal patriarchal structure that was built on promoting people that had what\nAnd what I think we are doing is breaking down\nAll of those assumptions around what it takes and we are running we're one we are raising money\nWe are stepping up and putting our dollars where it matters and women have continued to do that no church in this country no synagogue in this country no temple in this country would be where it was if women were not prioritizing things that were important to them\nAnd now I think they have come to terms with the fact that they must prioritize themselves and their sisters in this fight but I also think we recognize that money has contaminated the system and we need to come up with ways\nTo change what that looks like and in some ways it means getting into office and changing the system and another way that means changing it on the grass roots and figuring out how we want to organize alternatively\nFinally do you do you worry that even if we do change the makeup of Congress no significant the this November and each election little by little toward a more proportional representation\nThere will be the group of very angry Americans who feel that women that looked like you and I immigrants are taking something away from them for whom equality feels like fresh and\nWe'd like to think that it's an older generation that will eventually die off but unfortunately we see that sentiment in younger Americans\nIdea about who we need to worry about I think and and how they will hold a resentment and this is just a real affirmation for me that we need to change the narrative\nAnd we need to explain what our narrative is and we cannot stepped back\nWhat we have to do moving forward is we have to be in it for the long haul the change and\nThe browning and black inning of this country is what is behind us and we'll hold to the winds that need to make this change happen\nAnd guess what we do not need to worry about those who do not like us what we need to do is unify those who are like us and that's a key thing that we need to be we need to understand we don't need to concentrate on those they will\nAt some point move we know people can move how they are where they are what their thoughts are it's happened time and time and time again that got us to where we are and yet\nWe just need to push forward with a positive messages with the ability to make change and we need to do this for the long haul this is not about twenty Eighteen or twenty twenty or twenty twenty four let's talk about this for twenty forty four and what that would look like when we have\nAn electoral process on on the local state and national level that actually reflects the population of people and moves women into leaderships at greater than fifty percent\nBecause I'm not sure if you go to websites where people can find out about the with you know\nSure we encourage people to go to for women dot org ... which is the website
