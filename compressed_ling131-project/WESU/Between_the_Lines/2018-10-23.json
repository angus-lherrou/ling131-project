I was writing sacred game on Netflix I think he's been dropped right down from the second season I'm not sure he's come under any side and like this is sold made up against me by some long ago somebody in college I didn't even go to college with ... so\nYou have to be very very careful and I think as\nLimits than they could be sort of coming out and seeing that that let's not let's not minimize\nYou know uh because that really brings a whole movement don't and I think they it's a slight they jump that happening right now because there's a lot of stuff being said which also may not be ... ...\nThere's the case of a new metallic another very high profile person in the industry he's the host of the Indian Idol um show a which of course of the Indian counterpart to American Idol\nAnd ah there are allegations that he was praying on young women that were around his daughter's age um and has he been sort of um vilified ... he lost his position on Indian Idol\nYet they've they've removed him they moved to judge from the next season a mortgage top level with the ... in the middle of directing a film which is the remake of ... and that's not being produced by folks Don ... he's been removed from being director I mean that's that's a lot of cases an ... taking action very ...\n... that's what I think that that is why it's unbelievable it's like the same reaction you know Kevin Spacey gets moved right away from where the guy at the same reaction I think yeah that's never happened before that's what's different it's not that one didn't hear stories of the round for the sex with them but the industry but this is the first time that\nMen didn't follow that funds them being just by dismantle because they had to this monthly because there was one of the box and it's one of the financial Bach nuts and they couldn't stand by him and so they had to dismantle like such a major things are happening on precedent it in a history of the country and of Indian cinema\nAnd so I mean we had so similar to what unfolded here and in the United states as well because everybody knew Harvey Weinstein was a predator treat people who are in the industry new those of us outside or didn't um and and we you know people knew there was rampant sexism round put a kitten to the salt\nAnd women were silenced and then at some point something changed\nCritical mass of enough women filmmakers or empowered remained actors\nWomen in general in the film industry in positions of power in the country that are critical mass now ensures the when a woman makes an accusation that credible but at the auction that they will be consequences\nDoes definitely because if I look at like say the head of for stuff to do is jump out took she's a woman she's in our collection but I must say that I Would say that it's also\nIn the air like if you look at you know a couple of years ago ... when it happened because of the gang rape of this young woman on a deadly bus and if you look at the ... thousands and thousands of young people came out and it's led to the change of law in the country I'm\n... so if you look at the country has a whole and patriarchy and raped the women over on outside of the film industry has where\nI've never seen a movement\nOf young people who are not that political come out in support of something as what happened but the new play a kid you know and I know you know what I'm Talking about him so I think that that that that's a change in the air and sort of and I also think the fact that Hollywood reacted the way did\nEven though I hate to say that you know [laughter] we're being influenced by Hollywood but it is the fact that the me too movement the way it just\nI just supposed to the door that media leave that to do that in the was\nIt getting the attention it did it leading to massive changes because today the was it the small ... everybody's watching the house of cards so everybody is affected by what's happening in Hollywood you know globally people show media plays a big role social this is all about social media\nSo the flip side of back in the country like India which I have to say you know as an activist is that this is not even one percent\nIf you look at the ... the country if you look at women being assaulted envy people don't just sneezed he you know for the stuffing in Vermont\nDon't really I Hope it does but actually I don't see that it you know so that is something much more massive and that has to be dealt with like ... we're talking about is only like now you have and yet but in journalism you I mean in a politics you have you know being denied line journalism you hot\nIt television media politics film industry still the was off of social media\nHas been impacted right now by the me too movement as to whether this will be a drop to several you shouldn't have been you know tackle the embedded patriarchy and his thoughts and of women in the country that has yet to be\nSo I'm Wondering if you think that that two thousand twelve case stuff that horrific Delhi gang rape ... pie or the nearby a case\nIf the you know the because when that was discussed and then it comes to ... hours and hours of media coverage all over the country it really got people talking about what they just did not want to tolerate anymore in the country\nBut I'm Wondering if people are now thinking well you know if we're going to tolerate this happening and when the ... were perpetrators are you know unknown men ordinary men poor man if we're not going to tolerate it from them we better not tolerate it from powerful well known men\nNo absolutely I mean I as I said that it is something in the end of the way you reached a point where you elect enough\nAnd and that happened internationally where women were just like any one person speaking out to eat to ... people speaking out and they become the movement and because of the false social media you know that's what just makes it that you know everything was vital and then everybody's talking about it but\nIt's because women have set up a place on because there are many women in ... and her voice that I read that one but like I didn't you\nKnow you're the lead actress if your film margarita with the straw the last film that you've had released a call ... ...\nAnd I'm On a gender against gender violent than on women's rights on the other people like her have also laid the groundwork right you are surrounded by I Know yourself a leader in women's rights in India so there are some incredible leaders that are all ready they're ready to like\n... push this movement into more than it could be\nAbsolutely and like right now actually the biggest the festival in India or mommy the Mumbai Academy of moving images um so uh spearheaded by get him to do is above the stocks and already in\nThat they've got you know there's such Buckley they've dropped sudden ... by some of the known 'em by\nNoon people because it on the investigation slipped through the investigation is resolved of some of the kids is not just because other people are the filmmakers their students have been dropped from mommy or within mommy that uh people like me you know we have ... ... that that discussion to increase the awareness to make sure this will when it's not just a\nSmall little thing dies down like we wanted to gain momentum and become massive and and everything like to model that the town hall\nThat oil producers directors actors were all attending where wherever you like that it's not just about naming and shaming we want to make sure that I make ... that there are organizations\nThat are set for women to go to within any production house any from every films that have to have a sense I think bookshelf\nFor both for gay people as well as for heterosexual people as to how you can be all you can speak\nYou have to Boston workshop then in every organization that to be a sneak sent that people can anonymously safety going speak so this is fantastic that it's on everybody's coming around like the big could use that everyone is attending this and talking about it I\nBelieve that I think that's what's so exciting I just couldn't believe
