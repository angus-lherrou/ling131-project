{"month": "10", "state": "CT", "station": "WESU", "content": "About the history of the country but did you learn new things through the film [noise] well\nIt's a great question and I ... I set out to learn new things about the subject as I said I had always been and the journalists I'd always been very aware of that experience that I'm\nAfrican Americans had had in my life while growing up in the south and the you know the terrible grinding poverty that I witnessed\nThere and and and the oppression and the discrimination and so I\nI did I really went to school on the subject I thought I knew a lot about it but I also knew that I wasn't being told or a ... and you know in my soul that I wasn't really being told the truth is certainly um there was no complete history\nOf you know in a in film form um there'd been a couple of films made but I really made the film that I wanted to see that I couldn't find the knowledge which [noise] and so it was just great\nUm journey that Sally and I went on 'em and the whole the whole entire long shadow team in in discovering stories like um data\nRobert Carter it's a third\nOf who was the the wealthiest slave owner in Virginia in the late Seventeen hundred she actually emancipated his plays um because then he had a religious awakening and he knew\nThat slavery was wrong that story had really been lost to history and you have to\nRelease and was used as a tool to unfortunately justify slavery too and the the industry of slavery\nOh without question in fact I really wanted to include more of that in the film but it has its own topic the way people are very good about it but that we\nShow right I think Martin Luther king says it's the you know Sunday Morning at the most segregated time in America\nUh the religions began to needed to profit slavery produced in the country they even they even polarized the country more through the poll that I'm at one time played and their masters\nWorshipped alongside each other and then of course we start to see by the turn of the nineteenth century we see just a huge huge profit from from slave ownership and so but so stories like Robert card in the third the um um\nThe story about the ... the British Columbia\nI'm black pioneers who fled oppression and California what it was when it was clear or it was\nLooking like California might the ... state but the owner writing\nYou know issue or idea in the film is incredible political power of the south\nOrganized around white supremacy and how that has impacted us institutionally or in particularly African Americans in terms of economics culture of politics and so and then we connect the dots today and so I\nI did not understand the full effect\nOf the south political power or until I made this film\nFrancis you open your film with testimony from people who remember being in ... that is so chilling because many Americans even the ones who accepted that was a\nA stain on our history like to think of it is something in the deep path but of course it's not there are still people who have grandparents who had that transition from being waved to being\nFreed 'em and so today all we also have these justifications for why there is a income different than wealth disparity between blacks and whites\nThat also initiate want to take on oh\nQuestion I mean it's it's one of the underlying um uh important messages and and aspirations of the film is too I'm really a connect the dots of our history and history as a living organism you know we we know more and more and more about the impact\nOf of slavery and what actually happened in ... and also connecting the dots to the president mass incarceration of police brutality these are all in my opinion artifact\nOf of slavery and so what I wanted to do was I made the film for every one for and and the African American community has really embrace the film it's been so heartwarming but in in all honesty I made the film for other white people who perhaps\nMight not consider themselves racist or they don't know how to bring up\nThe issue of racism in our society and it's very hard to understand and come to grips and deal with an issue in society if you really don't have the correct facts\nAnd so one of the things that we show in the film is that ... it is\nAs African Americans began to make advancements in our society we would hit them again with more oppression and it it was ... very difficult for me to believe growing up in the south that we did not outlaw legal discrimination\nLegal discrimination against African American until Nineteen sixty five with the civil rights act\nAnd so but but after that we continue to the institutional oppression and\nThings that have created I'm at this point inequality is is and not to discount the huge strides made by African Americans but I really wanted white people to understand from another white person\nUm we need to discuss the implications of Jim Crow um the black codes slavery all of this is very very much evidence in our society the problems\nSo the institution of slavery and generated huge amounts of wealth right in white America and when that institution was\nThrough violence enforce the and and great reluctance ended up at the economic disparity that was baked into\nThe country remained there were no reparations so the wealth generated by slavery remain in the hands of white families the wealth stolen from African American communities remain do lend this remained a community that had basically to start with negative uh worth if you will\nUm and uh and that has never been a dress we've never had a truth and reconciliation\nIssue or or or you know it's sort of process in the country which is another reason I'm assuming that your film it is such a critical thing for you to make 'em you you must be a couple of things just not the black codes um which you know not enough say American Kids learning history no about what what the black code\nWell so what happened right at you we passed the thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth amendments which freed slaves and give them citizenship but but we\nInstituted a series of long local laws throughout the south much\nLike what happened what was happening in Ferguson that did proportionally impacted African American and so\nThe black codes were these series of laws many many many local right because it had been outlawed at a federal level\nBut but um and so you could be rounded up if you are now they're targeting African Americans particularly in the south right and so they're they're targeting them for things like loitering\nWith coal mines and corporations down in the south to basically do something called convict lease thing so the black codes were these were these laws that that ... rounded up a\nAfrican Americans for doing hardly anything or maybe bidding on the sidewalk but it just proportionally impacted African Americans like it did in the Ferguson court system when when when you look at the Ferguson court system and how\nBlack people were issued citations rounded up for things that are much much higher rate than white folks were that's\nWhat that's what the black codes were I mean it's so it's basically a reinvention of slavery through things like convict policing and so at at Dr Allen points out in the film you can basically would work when they were slaves right they had\nA fairly high monetary monetary value which isn't even still hard to say but but when they were when they were rounded up thrown in jail and became conduct you could work than to debt\nAnd that just move on to the next you know batch\nOf incarcerated um people and then of course [noise] um\n[noise] I mean you see some of the worst worst racism more lynchings took place from Nineteen\nTen in this country until Nineteen forty than any other time in our history that's when you start to see the building of monument that are really dedicated to white supremacy and dedicated to putting African Americans in their plane\nRide those can grab the Confederate statue that have become the focus has so much controversy the um we're almost at last gasp of the confederacy to remain relevant after it was the month old right\nYeah and I just one more thing about your question is it that I just don't dumb just blown we blew me away um my people don't realize that the south was so
