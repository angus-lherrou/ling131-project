with this picture who is inviting the president to bring in a rap star who makes a disgrace of the oval office this is a sacred office\nThat is owned by the people Trump does not own that office he's merely an occupant of it\nHe has no right to bring the level of that office down to the guts are\nIn my humble opinion now of course you'll disagree with me just to disagree with me but this is part

of\nCommonsense decency a secret service rules to jump up and give the president the side hug like he's the guy who owns a body shop somewhere in Bay on the Jersey what what are you thinking\nI'm surprised by the way that the secret service is so bad that this could ... by the way they should not have been and shouldn't have happened\nNumber one but I Would wish that there was a secret service agent who would have prevented the rapper from grabbing the precedent for this I look at the president's face in the picture is extremely shocked he's horrified by the way\nThat the guy got so close to um do you understand how dangerous this is what a per say oh I'm wrong look at the picture\nI grab the screen shot up without having to put an arid is rapper violates Secret Service protocols that's on Michael Savage dot com and if you think I'm wrong look at the president's face he shocked\nHe shot the demand got him in a hug\nWhere he's got his left arm over the president's ah left shoulder he's got his right arm holding the president's right hand the president really backwards from him and they're cutting us making the big asked himself again smirking to the cameras using that

from it\nYou know on Monday I'm going to have a diamond in silk on the show again because then the movie is coming out\nI'd be very curious where they think about this\nBecause this goes way beyond the optics of the picture\nThis goes to a breakdown in our society and almost every level nobody seems to have any values left no one seems to know what's right or wrong no one seems north knows the difference between north and south no one has any dignity wherever you turn everything's breaking down from the top to bottom that's that's that's my opinion\nThat's my opinion Rosie Rosie on line

don't I don't\nThink we're so it was a ... so it was a garbage man\nI thought they would be ah not\nReally so what's the word garbage man as a right to be in the oval office\nIf the president if I can\nTell what if what if the president invited a pornographer in there who had a big a big following ... ... ... pornography pornographic websites are amongst the biggest Web sites in the country

me I've been waiting for that to all my life none of ... you don't understand this was pushed down a by someone else in there who got it all wrong and I don't think the president's gonna gain any votes from it I think he's gonna he's not going to lose any votes but he's going to have a lot of people walk away feeling sick\nBecause if we're defending him in defending American values aboard his language and culture or you could argue that rap music is part of American culture you'll be right in saying that but I Would say it's in the wrong direction it's taking America and the wrong direction of culture\nAh and I don't care about race it always want to make it racial go ahead and make it whatever you want because that's all that's on your mind I Would say this if it was a a a person of any any any race and if he wanted to have some one of the arts in there with a large following there are other choices besides a rapper whose lyrics are disgusting\nDisgusting do you think that I'm Alone in my opinion maybe on the first and the only one to say it today but I can guarantee you won't be the last look at the lyrics of this rapper I Can't even read them on the air I Need you I Want you come to me ecstasy\nEcstasy ecstasy ecstasy ecstasy ecstasy ecstasy she pushes drugs he pushes group sex he pushes\nYou could imagine that we don't stand for that's the message you think belongs in the oval office I can read more lyrics if you want but I'm not going to do it on the air they're all disgusting lyrics\nAnd this is an example of the the the collapse of American

the wife of the rap and now he brings in the rapper whose that's why not a pornographer bringing a pornographer after all as some of these sites are doing their enormous\nWhy does he get sick the guy from the desert who has a uh all of the ... the um how's the prostitution that doesn't that guy dentist whatever his name is after all he's running as a Republican wanting to have him in there and give them a hug aside hug\nWhat's that guy's name in that with the with the uh the brothels out there in the desert of Nevada said that he represents American culture to you could have him\nThat's what I'm about to say that he represents the American culture to you could have him in yeah why not\nHave a a brothel owner I have a pornographer rent they may bring in six votes each you never know but I Would think that having that had a guy who runs like one of the major porn sites would be very smart politically think of all the people addicted to pornography would vote for Trump after that\nThat's the same thinking as having this guy in there at least that's my opinion I'm running short a time I'll be back\nJoined the Savage Nation coal no eight five or four hundred Savage eight by

your table in around thirty minutes\nAnd uh she got very defensive because something inside of a new that this and to be wouldn't be able to speak to her ... and she would be able to repeat it so impasse my progression that these people are from Egypt or whatever\nWhy not test than Tim has some display something very simple in the native language asking what year it will live with the name of the addiction ... was settled et cetera and wouldn't find is\nThat if they are in contact with these entities they're very limited to what they can communicate and I think more of it is the imagination of the actual if I could count for and the person under hypnosis than if you look at mathematically you add up all the people that have existed before Nineteen forty what people are just now seven billion\nAnd all the people that if you added them up from Nineteen forty in the past which means how could everybody have a second or even the food\nPast life which everyone seems to have when you do these past aggressions\nBy the way he lands on a new book is I Love you and Arabic descent you know\n[laughter] I'm In Georgia with your program I was I I don't think I was the Egyptian prince though\n[laughter] oh boy you might have been a bit [laughter]\nI Love to go ahead to lead to react to some of that\nYeah I hear what you're saying there ah you know if you do a regular if you put somebody in regular hypnosis and do a half life what can happen is well a couple of things that might be a wannabe\nHalf life like all I think I was a Lincoln in the past life you know you get people like that and guess who's going to show up\nHave you know and that's right now because the conscious\nMind Bill Bill things in and you know that's one thing that I really want to do with this state a state therapy the sleep hypnosis um because there is no conscious mind\nAnd what I'd like to do is um get a lot of people to actually learn this\nAnd test the waters slick what you're saying because\nLike in a regular past slight progression there are questions you really don't want to ask like you know what is your name where do you live because if you start asking specific questions the analytical mind steps forward\nAnd either make things up or already things you know I was a Lincoln you know or whatever and fills in the gaps so\nUm you know I'm I'm extremely busy but you know maybe somebody can pick up the ball on this thing that I've created and actually start doing that because if they're\nThis thing that I created and actually start doing that because if there is no conscious mind they really should be able to tell you\nYou know where they live what their full name is um maybe like where they graduated um were there were buried that kind of thing and that would be really really cool to have a bunch of sessions strung together like that and then go and and and then check\nWhat the heck was going on\nUm that reminds me of the first school I went through and I'll be brief on the story but I'm the director of that school did a past life on a woman\nI'm and she gave the name and the tail of this law office she worked at in uh Chicago\nAnd the name of the family all the stuff came through and it all turned out to be correct and and she actually contacted her brother from her past life and they became friends\nTim went Edgar Casey was in his trench like states was was almost like a hypnotic state\nYeah actually uh the story with Edgar is she had a difficulty with his voice his voice stopped working and he needed that hurt his job\nHe went to a bunch of doctors and they couldn't help 'em out so he ended up going to have hypnosis\nAnd his actually allowed him to speak again and from what I've read about him what he would do is you lay down on a on his couch\nAnd she would go into\nLike a trainer and he would basically float up to the cash record and read the information of whoever was asking him questions and that's kind of how he did it\nMatched up let's go to a Fort Smith Arkansas it's John Stewart on coast to coast John go ahead sir\nHey good morning or my quick question is I show up or from my uh sleep apnea and my question is uh is this something when I stopped breathing in my sleep is just something that hypnosis can help prevent and\nWho would I contact you know how do I know a reputable or give them a therapist or how do I get in contact with you\nOK well you can contact me through my Web site which is on coast to coast a website\nRight there and let me quickly ask you John are you a are you breathing what does she pack\nI have a bypass machine or with oxygen added to it okay All right go ahead Tim\nYeah to to find someone reputable or to to work with is you'd want someone that's very very good at age regression\nAnd that that's how you fix things so if you came to me what I Would do is I Would ask you when is this the worst and then what I Would do is put you into this status space and\nThen I Would um basically talking to your subconscious we would identify the heart within you that's causing this problem we have a track it back to where first began which is usually between the ages of zero in seven years old\nEven if you've never had symptoms until you were forty or fifty usually the problem began in early childhood and it's kind of like getting in a time machine going back in time and you basically how the child\nWe're we're the problem started\nSo I Would first do that and we would fix that that Congress spirit guy and I find out hey what what's going on with this with his breathing problems and see if it's related the karma of past life or you signed up for it\nAnd then I had asked the spirit guy you know can you can you go ahead and and ah you know fix this I don't ask like that but basically I Would ask them to fix that then I Would do some a direct suggestion and when you're in that state a state it's like direct suggestion on steroids\nBecause what I say is basically fact so whenever it's the worst\nI Would now flipped the meaning and say well you'll find that you know between whatever three and four AM you're breathing easily in fact that's the easiest you ever worry and and uh basically very quickly like as little as ... session bone done deal\nI Love it let's we've only got about a minute and a half left before the break or Tim but it's a people want to learn how to be a hypnotists how long does it take\nWell you can you can learn rather quickly to be a hit in the chest however it really takes a lot of sessions and experience to be calm good at it uh I'd say for me it took me about five hundred sessions before\nI felt comfortable and and I was doing well um\nYou know this new this new process I have it's not like that you don't you don't need\nA background and hypnosis or anything like that\nBut you know to feel comfortable\nTo to you know 'cause everybody's different and you you never know what you're going to get hit with you never know how someone is going to to to to be you know like in a session you know some people are gonna think through everything and you got to deal with that for other people come in and they're really fearful of the process so you have to deal with that\nAnd there's a lot of different techniques like age regression parts therapy timeline therapy ... therapy so you have to learn all of that so um\nYou know it it takes a little while basically\nI'm a true does so came when you stick with us we're going to come back to just a moment fast night tonight we're going to take final phone calls here with Tim markedly as we talk about hypnotism this is fascinating we'll be back\nGhost inside the\nNew version of it goes to ... am ... bone in no Android ... listen live on demand anywhere anytime good acoustic ... dot com and downloaded today\n[noise]\nThat they've then you know taken and then they get hypnotized and some of hunger is horrible or from you know I think it's all part of a ticket crime but when you feel like I was close to remember this event okay I kind of ... high hopes that says and then [noise]\nFind some stuff out but I'm a little scared [noise]\nShould you be afraid of uh Tim\nI'm no you you actually go into hypnosis every day at least a dozen times\nOh you you don't realize that like I said earlier is just brainwave in your brain waves beat up and slow down so you go there any way and I'm I'm not sure if I got the full question\nWhile he was talking about you know can you use hypnosis to determine if you've been abducted for example from a some kind of the tea situation\nOh yeah definitely definitely you you you definitely can do that um\nYou know you're you're basically just\nYou know find out the details like if you hadn't missing time or you know it was this particular night and then you just basically ... the person back and have um a walk through the night\nYou know just like regular I mean I Do it all the time you know just regular regression very simple\nHow important is the hip to to to the event that's you're going to undertake I mean because they're good hip petitioned the bad ones but you is that is that critical\nYeah you know traditionally when you were just they have no says\nIt was all direct suggestion so like you'd be put into hypnosis than the hypnotists would just tell you how good your feel or whatever and then you're done so you do need to find a hypnotists does not only been trained\nIn regression techniques but have has conducted really thousands of session that that's what I'd be looking for and um you find somebody like that and you can ... view in my opinion you can fix anything you would want to fix or you could find out anything you want to find out\nWhat's going to Springfield, Illinois might turn on coast to coast time Mike go ahead\nHi jarred Hi Pam am earlier in the show you were saying that um when you focus when when when you focus on the back of your brain in a certain state and uh I have a seven week kind of late and we do believe that uh\nThat same state would be that state that would be most conducive to like their students learning something a like a reading his lesson or something and are are there any techniques that you can use like exercise your brain and through that they are but\nThat's a good question and he he just made it honest but can you went through that stay with the with your own mind\nYeah you definitely can um the more you do hypnosis the better you will get better I've worked with people that were horrible subject and I basically I give them homework as they go listen to this this audio for a couple of weeks and they come there and they're much better\nUm what you can do like in my state of the therapy what I Do is I install a re induction\nKey word or phrase so when you were here you know so when you hear the phrase\nBoom you go in to the state of mind instantly so if you want it to apply that to learning which\nIs really a good application for this than what you can do is get conditions let's say for the word or what I pinch my fingers together like this my eyes they'll close our lack\nThan my eyes hello and boom then you start studying you know so or you can get trained and self hypnosis so for the next hour I'm going to go into self hypnosis\nWhile I study and um\nYou fire in that the key word phrase or a finger pinch or something like that\nAnd open up your eyes and go ahead and study and the materials actually I think in a whole lot better\nWell it sure does and it just sounds like a great way to uh be able to go to college in Asia or courses do better than your job to do all kinds of things by being able to self hypnotize yourself too\nYeah yeah it's just you can absorb this information actually you know in going back with sleep hypnosis the person I mentioned Dave album\nHe had heard that in the world war two they had officers that wouldn't learn Japanese while they flap\nWow now I don't know that\nTrue or not but that's that's well that's where she got the idea of sleep is Nelson so think of that you know you're going to this heightened awareness day you wake up and you're talking Japanese [laughter]\nLet's go to Chino Hills California Cindy eastern coast to coast Cindy go ahead\nOh gosh they get good guess Tim nice to talk to you I you know everything you're saying sounds right on\nT I you know everything you're saying sounds [laughter] right on um I got real sick um had a great job and I got really sick about twelve years ago and now I've been living on Social Security and trying to do my best efforts to steady on\nMy own and um did a a\nBiofeedback tennis exercises mhm and uh we get really good at it you know a total of relaxation and you know I'm just so much like the key phrase you were talking about you know like I\nSpent the first words in the tape and they like totally relax\nYeah day I Am I came out of my body you know [laughter] and it scared me I didn't expect it at all and it scared me and they slammed break back down in the mind body\nAnd now I've been I've had this irrational fear about pat happening again and it isn't it prevents me from doing any relaxation deep relaxation and\n... uh-huh I Wonder you know\nWhat you could tell me about like the self sabotage and connecting and myself and [laughter] I uh I really wanna\nGet well ... what is she doing so\nWell it's you know when when I work with people with a lot of different um challenges it's really all kind of the same kind of boils down to the ear and stress\nAnd that's kind of sounds like what's going on with you you know you had that experience and it was a bit fearful so now you've got to guard or you know and what if that happens again kind of thing so um\nYou know again like if I was working with you we could we could just re condition that and so you don't have the fear that any longer um\nSo to get over that\nI Would say\nYou know working with if you notice I mean really quick like like one session where\nYou can really change\nThe emotion in your perception about that a bit out of body experience that you had\nSo I I Would suggest that you do that um you know obviously there are books out there that are that that tell you to give yourself like suggest like waking suggestions you know and you keep repeating it like a million times\nAnd that does work if you put a lot of time and effort into it but um\nThat's what I Would do if I were you I I Would find a hypnotists that you could work with\nAnd you tell them that fear that you have because you really enjoy relaxing and you know very quickly like like like I said one session will quickly and you'll be relaxed again and be able to do that again\nDo the spirit guide to tell you about the future to him\nYou know I haven't asked them to be honest with you but one thing that you can also do which I didn't mention you know everybody talks about past life regressions going back in time\nBut you can apply the exact same thing and you can go into the future you can progress\nI had a session done on me like that and what I saw in the United states is that people became disgruntled with our government and they stop paying their taxes\nObviously the government's not going to run unless it's funded\nAnd uh the government shut down\nIt was chaos for a while but everything turned out to be much better and there was different energy sources and it was a much different way of living than it is right now so you can go you can go forward into the future which is really pretty interesting in my opinion\n\n\nEnded up to see him

A. R. A. dot com\nWhile a story that's been all around the planet over the last several days as he seems to be getting even worse now the Turkish government\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on a trip when what did the indicators I mean the market the last two days has really taken it on the Jim what's the cause for that is it just panic or ... what's happening\nWere well two things in and actually they both relate back to the good old Donald hum last week you saw 'em treasury bond yields you know the yields on on the risk free ten and thirty year bonds\nShoot up I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this what happened we said look if the thirty year treasury bond breaks above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to four point three percent in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and high or low it so\nYou know that that was the first thing to happen but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean this this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be cheating and a lot of ways by\nChina's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh\nIf China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a world wide a downturn and crashing so so it was rising interest rates\nAnd um and and and more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about for the last month at twenty six forty\nI'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I had this kind of limp\nRally for years and it's been waiting to go back and we said look at breaks twenty six forty that that's a sign that China is starting to go down again and it and it did that and the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign\nThat there's something wrong and and again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking oh it's just more interest rates note the interest rates was the first whack these last few days had a lot more to do with China and Trump is really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways\nAnd Trump has been cruising the economy with tax cuts and all that sort of stimulus and stuff\nAnd that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes growth to go up temporarily and what does the Federal Reserve is going to do they're going to raise interest rates that what they do it the economy's overheating they raise interest rates if it's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous\nAnd and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I created this great thing and the trumps wrecking at no this was predictable he's not\nYou know he's got some you know gut feelings we gotta do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences of things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pull back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose one happening like you were you in a couple more days of downturns I mean tomorrow if we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people start saying there's something wrong here\n[noise] yes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this\nYes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this at the beginning of the year markets peaked in in late January real kind of like blow off the top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough\nWe have a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent different market but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped right about here you know where we are now and then it kinda like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude\nWhat happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay this things over and they start selling and shorting to market\nIt happened very quickly you'll see you know I've seen just the last seven stock bottles throughout history everything from the Nikkei in the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two crashing in every other one in the last century including the tech correct in recent bubbles\nThat first crash will be thirty two percent on average in the first two and a half months you know there were people get\nWalk and that's the sign that that's the only way you know that the bubble has finally birth the problem is by the time that comes people are already in trouble and they're panicking and they'd get whacked hard so\nWe did that dangerous side is that we keep going down and and and literally I the markets do look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just the balance after you know fourteen hundred points it may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far but it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers\nSeventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand um to doubt if the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders are going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds keep going up\nThat this is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not\nFifty for fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy eighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash\nWill happen in the first two to three months typically and that's what make bubbles so dangerous uh uh you know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross trial once you know when somebody asks what what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit early\nBecause that's how this ... this was a bubble this isn't a normal bull market\nThat correct so nice staircase manner and goes down bubbles go up dramatically and they crash and and half the time and they crashed twice as dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this\nThis is a once in a lifetime of that and it is the science to me you're building we've been telling people man this looks like a top here and if it doesn't talk here we only get\nThe good part is we can gauge as if we only get a normal ten Fifteen Percent or so correction by the end of the year that we're probably good for one more route one more Trump rally into next year before this thing blows but uh\nRight now though the odds are shifting towards ah it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will this be as bad as that time period\n[noise] ... well this is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George not only decades in advance on demographics the baby boom picking\nAnd and and and causing a down turn off the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean\nI'm Around the world but especially in developed countries well what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash\nIs we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries and then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and and their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nLow interest rates in the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kind of like went sideways and didn't the laboratory debt emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy ... trillion more\nOn top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world and\nAnd those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble\nChina is slowing and and like I said they have the biggest that Bob ... of anybody in any time in history and when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so my view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and stock crash\nBecause they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just filled the tobacco up with money that was draining this time more debt\nEverything's more stretch the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a\nFifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty percent\nOf the box absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come back here yes dance with us is

cracked and a lot of companies when other well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if you're the part Amazon there oh my God I was you know like a\nYou know a hundred and fifty dollars it now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies\nAnd you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued in a bubble like this but they're also\nGo down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down Ninety three percent that ended up beat that was it ended up being the greatest company in the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing so\nThat's the secret and and the other thing is even at the earnings of companies if companies are so good that they keep their earnings flat instead of declining evaluations on stock how many times earnings white people will pay\nThirty times earnings for the typical stock right now are thirty and and sixty or eighty for the best textbook those collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down fifty percent even if its earnings don't decline and then of course most companies' earnings do decline so that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator looking at some of the dangers what is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know it it's called the smart money\nYou know if you tell us it's not a secret anymore\nWell I Know I Know them believe me Wall Street won't get this anyway so you don't have to worry but\nBut what what happened to their the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups stopping in and then when things go down\nThere that wants to jump in and buy when when when they see the old investors have over bought in stocks or about they're the ones that short for his I mean they're in the know and and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks that eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff\nWell they you can measure\nThis action what\nIf there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is that dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes I mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions in the futures market there ahead of everything\nAnd so the market's gonna open down it opens down right at the open or it opens up if it's going to jump most the may ... that's when the dumb money and most people would stop or something to protect them so that's one of those reactions made that's the ...\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit and shorter do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour into the clothes so they measure this indicator measures but the smart money is doing versus the dumb money and the smart money\nThat has not bought this rally in fact they've been short and get they've been betting against this rally ever since that bottom February this year after that crack now they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to\nJanuary top early this year but once that crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is\nDeclines and smart money buying and that has been a strong warning signal to me uh in in recent months into our subscribers are you in Puerto Rico now\nI Am in Puerto Rico and I went through hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here and Michael\nBoth of them similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours in Michael at least pass through so I Know what\nThese people are going through it is unbelievable uh to watch everything I mean windows blowing off all around me you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stuff it it it's just unbelievable it's it's like you know God's got angry or something you know and that threw a temper tantrum\nAren't you moved there well I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and co labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has ... in Calais wrote\nTo islands that are like St Thomas and or or St Croix or St John\nAnd and you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there in in I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family\nFor many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working on this place\nSpending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade than it was when I first started coming\nIn I said to my why don't we move here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality on a corner of the price of South Beach Miami where we used to live\nAnd and we're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport which I get to twenty minutes in advance they only check your id they just wait to see how you're going to tilt below al I'm not sure I liked that part\nIt's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane flight it scenic I'm\nI'm I leave my condo doing in landing on this island in one hour\nAnd once I got down here I realize I I could qualify for some tax advantages here which are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living in the crypto geyser coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses that can qualify there's real strong tax advantage so I'm living much cheaper than a man of great climate I can still fly to New York in four hours director Miami in two hours and then almost anywhere in the east coast\nIs now it's difficult if I'm coming out your way but I have to go out to California which I just did for a long pole ad that the long haul now but I tell ya I I like it down here they been in a recession there's no civil unrest a recession for twelve years\nWe're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent here and I don't see any civil unrest so I've\nEmployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent here and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down\nHere for now and then I'm just going to see what happens in the next are so many years are the big banks down there [noise]\nYeah yeah yeah ... in in ... down here and actually a lot of the banks are by bank of popular in Santander are Spanish Banks because this is by origin more of a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and ice malls and stuff but they there are George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service so people either John [laughter] or they think\nWe're in Zimbabwe or they charge some huge X and there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special pasta sauce and things like that I otherwise man this is a good deal and\nYou know I'm Down here for other reasons but I'd say people ought to be Americans ought to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower\nUm minorities they vote in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that that they are allowed to vote in our elections\n... most important they are allowed to freely move for immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education or the education system here is good\nThen they move to the U.S where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities and then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico\nTo put their kids to colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then sometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving\nTo the United states why\nSixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they end up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants from Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people and that's why\nThey have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides the U.S [noise]\nIt's better to help create good jobs down here the tax advantages rather than just out and out subsidized Puerto Rico because the U.S has always always robbing the best people and again it it's they're more professional educated people that are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\n[noise] so I Want you to you is your best impressions on what you think will happen economic lead over the next year this country seems to be mired right now here in a conflict\nEmotion it's unbelievable I've never seen it this way yeah and I think it's going to affect the economy when\nIt

yeah I I just wish I didn't hear about it and I try to get to stories that we don't really hear a lot about is funny\nOr a um unfortunately we don't hang around as many different people as we used to one thing I can say about living in Las Vegas the amount of time that we did humid\nLiterally a cornucopia people across the country you met a guy who was visiting from Seattle one from Denver one from New Orleans one from the east coast in whatever ... well I met a guy and a girl yesterday when I was heading golf balls ... were just brought the dog\nGrooming shop here in the here in our area and ... out in a cave creek and\nWe started talking and he was from upper upper Arlington heights he was from New Jersey somewhere so we had a lot of places that weren't calm yeah right for ... and she said to be and when the girls said it to me she said it was a two parent arrived\nLike humans and you're sick like we were just talking about with the hurricane about living somewhere and then you go back there\nAnd it's completely gone completely devastated yes and she looked at him he was her boyfriend and they bought this grooming shop together he was from New Jersey and was literally a terror in her I well she said I grew up in Detroit oh\nAnd yeah I get sick leave she felt like her entire childhood was white enraged had been white boarded\nWell ... it's worse than being a race because ah from where I grew up much like Detroit yeah oh it was that not only the ovens I remember I ... and it was never it was devastated and less there to die to be on display\nAnd uh to go back and I remember a couple of years after I had been away I was living in Tucson like many of the kids of that era left and went out west because that's where jobs were and try to make a life go when you're young yes and a\nDad says a steak ride so we get in the car we go down and and drive around through Youngstown everything boarded up the factories were gone and it's not like it was wiped away and anything new had taken its place\nIt was just there rotting in what I Do yeah I mean\nWe were out ... and all the doors closed up because they go on the mall and\nLiving in the old building them ... ran\nOh yeah and of course I think that the story addict form of arthritis really nobody talked about you know it's kind of interesting we always kind of make fun of the spokespersons\nFor certain causes but I think a lot of people learn about this form of arthritis with filmmakers Mickelson the Gulf her who has come out and said he has prob\nYes certainly at the ... that he was able to raise has just been amazing\nUm and you know it's interesting mentioning him you know he's someone that has talked about um the impact of that disease on his wife and his career as a golfer and now we hear from our community that\nAbout Seventy five percent three and four patients say that there are radical arthritis has negatively affected their career path so it's certainly bigger than just a the physical um applications that that does it\nNot right you you have a form of arthritis because you have them back condition and I don't think that a lot of people who have bad\nConditions associate that back condition turning into a form of arthritis well\nUm something that I'm kinda glad you let us they're not that I like to talk about my own ailments but I have moderate to severe arthritis\nBut I have osteoarthritis which I Would not trade for any other type of ... of light and so it's very bad and ah ah as we can tell us\nPeople do go through life wearing a mask\nAnd you actually he was not to participate as a result of that\nAnd you actually he was not to participate as a result of them please continue\nYeah they really do you know and that's why I'm excited that the MPs is collaborating with Pfizer on this PSA narrative which is that Global Initiative really aimed at elevating the voice that patient raising awareness about the significant impact of sporadic arthritis and then and\nImportantly acknowledging the role of the patient physician communication\n... yes because sometimes we are kind of disregarded oh it's arthritis but in this in a in ... arthritis or the damage that continues to be done and it's not necessarily in one area is it\nNo it's not and it is a degenerative disease so it's and it really is important that when you start to have symptoms that you do go see a specialist you go see a health care provider who kind of work with you\nTo treat your disease to prevent any further um a debilitating consequences and and damage that cannot be repaired\nUh I always encourage people living with the radicals right as who feel their diseases not well managed to talk to their physician about what more can be done it's so critical that patients and providers have agreement around what their treatment goals are and that they're able to have productive discussion about how to get there\nI don't know what the overall number is but I Would imagine if you talk to people that are senior citizens eighty percent of them would tell you they have some form of arthritis what does that number is that even close to being correct\nWell you know it is one of the most um common a chronic diseases and the United states and so that's why the tips that um we offer really think that applies to so many people you know prepare for your appointments by um going in and talking about any changes you've had than\nA year last a appointment and any news them that have developed be open about talking about how the disease has impacted your quality of life and come with a list of questions that you want to talk to your provider about and those are combat not apply to all forms arthritis and chronic disease in general\nYeah I mean you know that's a good point because with the amount of time that you get with your position nowadays I think it's important for people who know they have a condition to write down some notes so they can relate that in a succinct methods\nAbsolutely you know one of the things that we have heard from our community is that challenge of really raising concerns that you have with your physician and in fact more than Ninety percent of patients say they feel uncomfortable talking about their concerns and fears\nAh west at rheumatologist even going so far to say they're fine when they're still struggling and so I'm preparing really thoroughly for an appointment often helps you get over that hurdle and make sure that those issues that really must be discussed are brought forward\nLeave can

Seventy two thousand miles or so that makes my eyes roll there's so many heroes there that we can't even fathom that we can't fathom when they say a trillion dollars\nOkay this is by a trillion trillion yeah it\nSays the burst travel for billions of years\nRight right well the the problem is that we don't know yet on these kinds of things because by the time that we hear them they're already long gone mhm we don't know they could be something as simple as the big bang theory\nBut as a line of arming or something to that extent yes or to or it could be literally\nA chemical explosion of magnitude that sent off of radio wave just excited and travel that far now obviously that would be a big explosion\nYes but it ... it could be it does not have to be intelligent life form and he'll they can take that and somehow through corporate colleges send people like that make some kind of Harlem and all that it's a language\nIt may be the mission of gas it may be assured of a sound well and whether or not necessarily meaning it's an intelligent life for\nSure and when you think about a\nHaley's comment mhm Haley's comment was remnant of the big bang\nThat just blows me away the moon but that's yeah I mean we really are I I suppose yeah but to think that that's still flying around out there will actually Haley's common has broken up and uh it has\nA and we see remnants of ... still and I forget what ah every five which shows that is yeah that comes about that you're able to see\nSo we decided and uh that we bring you a couple of things about national farmers day\nOkay a recent survey by the undeniably dairy campaign found that fifty one percent of Americans question would be interested in moving to a farm if they could would you move to a farm if\nI couldn't do it I Can't get up early in the morning humanity you manage\nA survey said eighty percent of people interested in meeting with a farmer to discuss farming I think that yeah we went on vacation seven out of ten think it's important to get to know the farmer who grows the food they eat\nWell that's very nice I O seven out of ten say they would like to I Wonder what the number of people that actually do\nI Would imagine you would have to me to meet the farmer on his terms as far as time of day go because they have a pretty pretty serious schedule\nAge and he doesn't drive around the truck that said I'm a farmer guy I talked to me I mean do you guys got stuff growing out there yeah yes yeah\nUh Seventy three percent of the people interviewed view locally sourced food as very or extremely appealing I couldn't agree with them or I'd rather have food locally\nOkay but once again ray you say that like there's not limitations horse there where you live in the middle of a desert where there are many many many things\nThat you can grow here mhm that will not grow so we have to have some kind of\nCooperative yes we need things from California and or ah I mean there are not going to go there are very few states like California basically where everything is global but then again look at the state and expands almost eight hundred mile mhm\nI don't think there's one thing you can't grow in California I don't know of any one thing that cannot be ... it is an amazing ah I'm performing state from avocados to strawberries to day or two yeah bananas but once again it's a hundred\nMiles of wall you know so the fact that there's different climate zones across that eight hundred miles if you go from the tip of Florida to New York city\nThere's a little difference yeah yeah yeah and that's basically hemorrhage zones yeah he's sick when the kind of a distance that you're talking about there are a little less than that yes basically from from the tip of Florida to Baltimore or from\nMaine yeah through the Carolinas so Halloween is coming on a whole lot more yeah by the way Twenty one years ago and they John Denver ... plane crash Monterey Bay California and an experimental plane\nOh yes yes yeah a mess and Brian Epstein so yeah that was a much used term to be the fifth ... Beagle was kind of cool mhm yeah yeah well former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich told Sean Hannity yesterday that the left has become more willing\nTo destroy the system than to fix it\nAnd he was asked well what are we even looking at now\nYou see the emergence of a very\nWeimar, Germany went\nAs his troops by brute force\nHomo action they have they're becoming\nAre anti democratic\nTo destroy the system they ran\nThat there are people who oppose was so much\nAnd I think that faced with that kind of opposition so some of us have an open public debate if you think if people don't care to colder\nTo allow to impose their will\nSt Louis profoundly wrong\nIt should only be that easy yeah you know I mean if you like one side you know it's so much easier to be a sports fan\nYou know and just say well let's say I really liked the quarterback better for the eagles then for the New York giants sure okay and and as well within your limits but just to say well one side's oil is right and the other side's always wrong\nOh yeah yeah and you know it really has said we're going to demand ridiculous something that we're seeing more and more of\nAnd I'm a that is um\nDifferent political figures in different places and they're being harassed I'm close to violence situations\nAre that have been happening I'm disappointed\nMe very much in in just in human kind you can have a disagreement you can agree to disagree but when people harass you out of a restaurant or they harass you out of a public place it's so on becoming and so unproductive\nAnd just to the last two weeks in a row it'll on what they did Ted Cruz\nAnd what they did to Sarah Sanders ... should not be done to any body yeah this has no party lines are restrictions it's so just last long it area absolutely wrong yeah and we have to get over this now once again they'll re\nAnd I know you're a lot more cynical than I Am\nOkay who me yes I'm a realist no you're not you're a cynic okay\nI Am sure that we will get through this period\nI Hope he will moderate back to the middle because that's the way a pendulum works it goes all the way to one side and the swings back goes the other way and that is swings back and onward we go\nAnd I honestly do believe that we will swing back to moderation that we will once again become more civil that we will become once again more homogenous and we will maybe even get closer together then that'd be forever before\nI Would only hope so at this point I don't know how that could happen and if we could treat others a little more graciously uh just like the protesters I get you have a point to make but during the beginning of the Kavanaugh hearings the protests that are usually ... physically removed\nFirst of all none of us heard what you are saying we have no idea what you were or two we have an idea based on news reports but you being they're shouting or over shouting people we didn't hear you was unproductive and wasn't it embarrassing in the end and maybe we\nEven would agree with you if I was in the right setting we might even be on your side on the issue you want to be perfectly right but your methodology stinks okay and that's what\nIt is we are methodology nowadays is not\nVery good by the way a very important they understand Nineteen Ninety two Brett\nHeart beat Rick Flair present W.

...\nYeah exactly that they would be like yeah and that's all they're all that it's\nLike ... ... not for personal reasons probably going to be one term senator from that point what you just like I don't think that part but like I mean you know going to be running for reelection he can get in there and\nDo the right thing after six years [noise]\n\n[noise] oh is that so [noise]\nSo actually get some that are [noise] you know [noise] uh [laughter] um\nSo there you have ten is the Senate hopeful Democrats Phil Bredesen staff\nLiterally explaining away why he's consciously lying to the people of tendency\nThat he would never support somebody like judge Kavanaugh but we're down eight and we're trying to get more Republicans on our side and when he gets in there he'll be the real liberal that he always wants to be and do the right thing you won't be concerned about reelection\nThis is just a political move in a political statement\nAnd um I I mean it doesn't get any more sick than this\nNow thank goodness our friends over at project Vera toss wherever the catch all these people including top campaign workers were practicing exposing what was the truth would their undercover cameras you know you know based it's all expose their\nBrothers and staff saying that Brett isn't a liar when he said he would vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh it is purely a blatant political move\nAnd uh when I asked for comment all they said was well project ... posed as a fake volunteer and and you secret video recording equipment to capture uninformed is speculative comments made last weekend by college students and youth organizers\nWell that's not exactly true is that James O'Keefe was the c._e._o. of project ... is with us or some of the more high ranking campaign members weren't they\n[noise] that's right Sean and and and thanks for highlighting this yeah this is a coordinated campaign between the Tennessee Democratic Party in the um [noise] and the silk reticent campaign and\nThese these workers have been working at the headquarters for the president campaign for a couple of months and it's a Greek chorus of voices all saying that it said quote\nPolitical boom because this is a big deal last friday when when the Tennessee Democratic Senate candidates so ... credited announced that he was going to be voting for capping off if you were in the Senate he said I Would be voting was a big deal and they're all saying\nThat no it was a big lie it was a cheap political move to get rural voters that weren't supporting him in Tennessee I mean I took it\nAnd that that isn't but that isn't your a ... statement now that's this tape and coming from their own mouth and Sean I don't I'm not speculating here I'm not reporting\nThis anonymously you can actually see this video you can see it coming out of their own mouth they're the ones who are selling it so we are confirming the suspicions what you just said we've confirmed that and again it's not just one or two or three and half a dozen of these people are inside the campaign office\nThey have confirmed that the people are real\nAnd and then of course you have the dawn of material what the president staffer thinks the Tennessee voters are ignorant\nHe says quote we don't have this out of these walls\nSays will be a good Democrat and what that means he'll be a good Democrat that means that he's going to vote with the Schumer wing of the party once she gets elected kind of see they don't want them given the Democrats don't want them to be Chuck Schumer democratic so all of this is pretty amazing stuff Sean and uh\nYou know it's just we're confirming what was known for years\nYou know you you think back and you you think Peter Struck and he talked about smelly Wal Mart Trump voters and you think abiding just what like last month saying that Trump voters were the ... of society despite\nLosing the court [noise]\nAnd then the court of public opinion has these forces of intolerance\nRemained determined to undermine them roll back the progress you all\nMay this time they're not you\nHave an outline in the White House this time they had been out\nThere are small percentage of the American people virulent people some of them the drugs in society\nDrags is inside and so then you've got\nSmelly Walmart people drag this society era de mobile deplorable that we now learned this week from Hillary you cannot\nBe civil with you know we got Eric Holder saying a kick 'em a Obama once famously saying that you know these are bitter angry people cling to their God guns bibles in religion I mean there's such hatred in contempt\nFor voters there's another tape we showed last night James I don't know if you saw the show we did run your tape and I thank you for sharing it with us\nBut an Arizona democratic senator a Senate candidate name's Kristen cinema literally caught on tape and twenty eleven calling\nThe people of Arizona crazy and it's even worse than that because we found\nFull of Arizona crazy and it's even worse than that\nBecause we found out Fox News dot com reported that she was promoting an event at Arizona State university featuring a lawyer is lawyer was convicted of aiding and Islamic terrorist organization and its leader\nAnd the lawyer in question presented represented someone who was sentenced to life in prison in the nineties were plotting to blow up the UN and FBI building and more\nIn a fight that person to\nYou know just I mean it's unbelievable to me the what they're doing is they're just outright lying to people\nWhere they have to Sean that that's the whole purpose behind our organization is to go to the real nature thing the reality and the motivations behind these people and and they have to lie and the red state it's not at the Democratic red state Democrats have to lie\nIn order to get elected and when they get into the Senate\nIt can only go one way yes or no but they have to mislead andme misinform the voters and and again and so if people think that it requires all this espionage it doesn't you walk into the office to ask the question staffers all tell you the same there\nAmong several we don't actually believe this and if there's one thing voters won't tolerate Sean is one thing ... and I don't like the right thing because it's just so self evident you can't lie to people you can't lie about what your intentions are you have to be honest\nAnd they cannot get elected they will not\nIf they still no you're right if they if they state what they really believe they'll never get elected so whatever you do it's like uh they just it's an orchestrated wind campaign and you call them all on the other hand\nThey will be the first time that we got a bunch more coming and now it's\nGoing to ask you about that in the second and we'll talk about who might be up next on the list\nA James O'Keefe project parents' house dot com as the website want to remind you with our

Thirteen and a half percent state income tax I thought it was bad at New York with a ten percent state income tax\nNow that's a lot of money a lot of people's money and Gavin Newsom now wants to make universal health care available to anybody Californian non California in\nA legal illegal doesn't matter\nIt would cost a fortune now I Know because California is so radically left wing it's kind of hard to think that a Republican to win the governorship out there but\nI kind of believe in miracles and when I saw a poll that showed it was a five point race with John Cox she's the other candidate running for California Governor against new some I'm thinking Well Donald Trump shocked the world why not um here a couple of the ads that John Cox who's running out there in California\nI live on a truck traffic and relatively ... rent going up friends and family moving out of\nMillions of Californians that near the poverty line\nPoliticians like gotten used to talk about change but they've done

leading in California for so long\nGavin Newsom stands with\nLobbyists and the corrupt insiders\nAbout time someone stands\nTime John talk\nAll right so is it possible that there can be a California miracle out there now one other attend them to this is there are number races house races\nEspecially in Southern California and that would be even our friend Dana Rohrabacher sees you didn't Darryl

frankly the whole state of California\nYou have to get out and vote for these congressional candidates because otherwise Nancy Pelosi could end up being speaker but\nIs it possible that there could be a California miracle anyway a Republican John Cox who is a I think surprised so far a lot of pollsters nobody thought you'd get within single digits ever\nAnd one poll how'd you within five a\nThanks for having me on a show on and you're right I was listening to your earlier remarks about the Florida and everything and uh you said help is on the way that's actually a message to the people in California that Gavin\nNewsom political class has resulted in the highest housing prices the highest gas prices water is being rationed in California you're right he's proposing new open\nAll the way they should rationing the water because of the delta smelt like went out there in Denver newness his district is a great guy and if you're in the in the San Joaquin Valley I was out and I did a show from there a couple of years ago when the farmers to couldn't farm because they were saving water for those little itsy bitsy fish called the delta smelt\nThat's part of it Shawn but they haven't built a reservoir out here in Thirty years imagine California if it hadn't built a road in the last Thirty years can you imagine what the congestion would be like it it's all horrible anyway and but they haven't built a reservoir we built one desalination plant that\nTook Twenty years because a lawsuit and regulations and you know we've got to do more just shell nation we got to do more recycling we got a Bill Maher reservoirs that's all the rest Jordan but the political class you're right they don't want to do\nRecycling we got a Bill Maher reservoirs that's all there is to it but the political class you're right they don't want to do that they want to save a little tiny fish which is wonderful but we got to live\nWell farmers got a farm and that is such a big part of the California economy I mean you're growing oranges and avocados and and all sorts of other you know strawberries and\nAnd fruits and vegetables you may not know this about me but I Lived in Santa

and\nSomething constructive might come out of it but more to the point\nMore open minds we have in this country the better the employment picture\nOr minorities the more opportunity not only politically that comes with it\nBut the better the opportunity for the entire country open minds equal better opportunities and a better chance for a more moral nation because if we adhered to pull politics and the people that start out on that sliding scale of morality\nFrom a really negative place\nWhere are we going to be taken for the people who wanted to believe for example Christine Ford and Chuck Schumer who said he believes her Dianne Feinstein who believes her people believe them\nSo you have people that started out in that sliding scale morality and an amoral place and have taken their politics and those folks left with them\nThat's not good Donald Trump taken hold minority communities including black adults women Hispanics even Native Americans to new heights economically

nothing except that it was ... and she had one beer\nNothing he said was false\nOh but you can't say those things sure you can because she was in the process of committing perjury oh by the way\nBut there's something else that he's been doing on Medicare for all and that is a a piece that he ended up a pending op ed in the u._s._a. today couple days ago called\nDams Medicare for all boy and threatens our seniors and hey it is Brian mutt it yourself or the friend ah yeah I Do a morning show it W. J. you know in West Palm Beach I mid morning show W. I. O. D. in Miami and the always in and honor and pleasure to be filling in for the great one more call then by the way\nYou can catch me on Twitter at Brian ... radio\nNow here's an excerpt from the president's base\nThroughout the year we've seen Democrats across the country uniting around a new legislative proposal that would end Medicare as we noted takeaway benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives\nCalled Medicare for all the Democratic proposal would establish a government run single payer health care system better limit dates all private employer based health care plans it would cost an astonishing\nThirty two point six trillion during its first ten years\nOh by the way as a candidate\nI promise that we would protect coverage for patients with preexisting conditions and create new healthcare insurance options that will lower premiums I've kept that promise and we're now seeing health insurance premiums coming down\nI've also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare that's why I'm fighting so hard against the Democrats plan that would of visceral rape Medicare\nDemocrats have already harm seniors by slashing Medicare by more than a hundred billion dollars over ten years to pay for Obamacare likewise Democrats would cut Medicare with their plan government takeover of American healthcare alright end of the extra there for the president let me\nPut something in very clear terms\nThe president cannot be more right\nThe omission and the media on this one beyond the USA Today piece is pretty incredible\nBut what the president is doing here is an education that you can even get in school right now it's so important the greatest fraud the greatest fraud that has ever been perpetuated and accepted as the legitimate concept by\nRenew to under delivered we will do new to this fortunate ... heroes for the ... story\nCoach Toyota the northern Arizona auto mould them her story would have done\nSo much for news will first and dirty one while you're doing\n[noise]\nAnnouncing delays him only Columbus Day sale on now it's your joys furniture gallery\nDuring the lazy boy Columbus they shall enjoy twelve much interest refinancing for ten percent off for free delivery and haul off the store for details right now he'll sail into savings was lazy boy high by throughout the store\nThe Dixie stationary sofa Columbus Day sale price six Ninety nine for the lazy Maureen Morrison reclining silver just nine Ninety nine\nNeed more examples okay three great recliner is one great prize your choice ...

[laughter]\nSmart cookie smart he gets it I Love this guy right here and let me get this guy\nOh there you go I mean guy come into\nTheir Huckabee Sanders meets Kanye West\nTo talk about the entertaining exchanges you heard the president he said he could talk for many time what do you want to bet that there is a certain amount of empowerment that gun you feels I mean like ... as the president said he is smart cookie [laughter]\nYou can also see him going you know what the president that I can speak for 'em any time that that could be entertaining and has a simple occasions we'll see where that story and\nNow a a story that I\nCan't believe it is still being discussed one that has been long perpetuated as a fraud not as significant as the Medicare fraud the Medicare for all idea that we were just talking about but the minimum wage\nThe the greatest fraud perpetuated over decades of time has been the need for the minimum wage to be maintained by your federal government now recently we had the Amazon dot com increased to Fifteen dollars per hour which ended up itself and don't get me wrong\nAmazon they built a better mouse trap but I mean the ... so you want to talk about the ... the on the left and it was no bells remember a while it's about a time Wal Mart was the greatest the pool and the country because they were coming to your neighborhood and and killing ... they were taking them out there taking their businesses and\nThen they were putting a bunch of people on yes minimum wage right a plus\nAt Walmart here from uh from Republican\nPlace aren't they yeah they do speak so I mean for all those reasons I mean Walmart which is a evil but here you go you've got a you've got Amazon dot com they happen to be greater than three times the size of Wal Mart yes yes Amazon is three hundred percent\nThe size and market capitalization of Walmart and loved by the left but again you know I I began begrudge them nothing happened to be a capitalist they built the better mouse trap but anyway I digress whoever's on goes to Fifteen dollars per hour and then you hear\nBut anyway I digress where Amazon goes to Fifteen dollars per hour and then you hear that the folks go everybody\nShould take Amazon model now I Will point out some of the obvious here for people to understand economics there are many other businesses that operate in retail which happens to be a low margin business there are getting crushed by Amazon ironically enough are going to have a harder time increasing wages because Amazon at their size scale and ability to deliver the way they're delivering\n[laughter] they they are killing their profits or take a look at any number of you'll retail companies that you grew up with that are dead and dying as we speak now\nThan I was standing the number of people that actually earned minimum wage I went back and actually check my research on this and ironically not the last time it was a really big issue it kinda like coming off the occupied crowd indeed twenty fourteen mid term elections I happen to be about four years ago that\nWe had the the big minimum wage conversation and hey you know what a lot of folks in the country had to point the economy did kind of ... you know for eight years of Obama we average one point eight percent economic growth we never even got close to an average US Economy so yeah okay\nBut even then\nWhat percentage of people on\nMinimum wage yeah number in your head\nHow many people back in twenty fourteen you'd think earned minimum wage ready one point eight percent even add Brock Obama's economy it was only one point eight percent what's more as the average age of somebody who earned minimum wage happened to be twenty two and a habit of be working part time\nJob I mean you know that the people that were heads of households that were you know trying to raise a family and uh you know they needed a living wage right but that was them and we've got the best economy\nIn a generation we've got the lowest unemployment rate in forty nine years weve got record low unemployment rates for everybody but pretty much why the white people\nAnd how many people actually earned the minimum wage you're ready according to the bureau of Labor Statistics point six percent\nPoint six percent that zero zero point six percent now what's\nMore is that Ninety nine percent of those people the point six percent are under the age of twenty five and what happened as soon as Amazon raise those wages we got the\nConversation come up again oh one of the great rods perpetuated that's out there the living wage it's funny what actually happened a good economy economics Amazon dot com props prospering and they had the financial wherewithal to be able to increase wages\nJust like what we're seeing because here's another little factoids oh by the way\nWhen you take a look at the average amount of money that a person's banking not only are we finally just about three percent towards the wage growth by the time yet and bonuses goes over that by the time you add in your tax cut churns out to be about another Eighteen hundred bucks for the average person working this year is what\nThe average Jeanette take home pay now a six point seven percent year over year you have to go back thirty two years to find the last time your income growth\nThat good so the living wage\nFunny what happens we actually have a good economy you out a living wage and the minimum wage and I was just a bunch of ... kind of like Medicare for all\nSuicides histories one side of the facts will continue to do a lot more of the factual stuff right here I Am ... and for the great one mark a little bit [noise]\n\nEvery time you go on line your Internet\nProvider an advertising companies can track what

it's going to be a big story that will be reported on\nAnd again CNBC they're the ones with that story interesting how even NBC ... one of their news outlets hasn't decided to actually run with their own story from their own CFO council\nOne of these days I'm sure it's just oversight All right let's go to Ross in South Dakota Russ go\nOn all good well\nI see it as kind of a two court problem really I mean you get a single payer health care system and you're going to basically just keep these big hospital in with the smaller ones they're not going to survive\nYou know they're not going to make the money that these bigger wants to make it all because they can't cut the cost that the government wants to cut them down to you for a lot of this stuff\nThat's the first part I see\nSecond part I see is we need to adjust something in the hospital you know what it costs the manufacture of one thousand cc bag of IV fluids\nI Would think not much I'm guessing you know\nA dollar I I did the research for my call just to make sure I had the numbers right and you know what they charge you for it in the hospital and a lot more memory hundred dollars\nWell and and so Ross and I appreciate the call and you have a ... a good point by a couple of things in it that we should discuss when we're talking about insurance generally\nThe biggest problem and affordability in health care is health insurance\nThe problem is we haven't raised the idea that health insurance equals healthcare\nThat's not the case one of the more remarkable statistics in the wake of Obamacare\nHas been the lack of people that could afford health care with health insurance is was according to the Kaiser Family foundation hardly a conservative organization they still to this day are proponents of Obamacare I mean after all the kind of have a vested interest\nBut here's what they found in their research there are forty two million Americans point two million that have health insurance they can't afford healthcare you think about that for a moment\nThe average health insurance plan eighty five hundred dollars now if you don't pay all that it might be because your employer sponsoring it but that's the only an average cost of health insurance right now\nSo would you be better off\nIf you had eighty five hundred dollars you could use on health care\nOr would you be better off if eighty five hundred dollars went for health insurance and then after that you got to see how much you had to pay out of pocket before you hit the deductible which often happens to be a high deductible plans which then you can't hit which is why people can't afford healthcare\nIt's all part of the financial fraud\nSo the number one way to get to more affordable healthcare is to break the back of the insurance first model having embrace it was the first thing that we did that was a big time mistake\nOnce you do that you are going to get to the crux of what you were talking about there which is consumer price transparency the most back crap crazy thing I've ever seen in my life\nIs walking into a medical facility being handed a piece of paper that says in so many words that whatever happens in that facility\nWhich you have no clue generally yet what that's going to be in whatever it happens to cost which they generally can't even tell you\nAnd whatever your insurance company doesn't pay for once they also can tell you you'll pay for\nHow crazy is that you will Magid walking into a store build a car with stuff not having a clue what any of it costs and signing the piece of paper that says some point later we're going to tell you how much you're going to pay us for this\nI mean that is bad crap crazy but that's what we have with our insurance first model right now\nSo you break the back of it we get to weigh the way we use insurance for everything else in her life how was that well what do we do if we have you know the chemical problem with our car well we we do pay and have it fixed\nIf we get into big time accident we fall unless you're in school and we're already at the point with health insurance to where it's essentially catastrophic care for tens of millions of Americans right can't afford to use health care the rest of the time\nOkay so why don't we go to that place to where we use health insurance as a catastrophic plan which by the way is what the president's new plans the ones that are called skinny and bad plans and but the Democrats are are sitting there you know what I'm saying it's the worst thing that's essentially what they are is catastrophic care\nWhich is cheaper and better for people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to use the other more expensive policies anyway\nBut at that point you're able to do what you're able to be a consumer we are incredibly good consumers when we have an opportunity to shot oh we got to find the best deal in the world on MTV or whatever else it is will sit there and we'll take a look at best deal boom done\nWell with health care we never have a shot we never have a shot at doing it one of the things I Do somewhat routinely I'll take a look at any time we have research that will show the cost of a procedure from one place to the next\nUm I had a I had a minor surgery years ago that had I gone through my insurance would have cost a thousand bucks\nDecided to shop around\nPaid cash and it was five hundred dollars to the point there\nWe never know because we sign pieces of paper those ads something's gonna happen here and we'll pay you for whatever the insurance company doesn't so they'd be if you really want to get to the crux of it not only is Medicare for all financial fraud but frankly the\nBiggest ally of Obamacare is not the you know it's going to be cheaper and you can keep your doctor and all that\nIt's an insurance equals healthcare insurance doesn't equal healthcare insurance is the antithesis of healthcare for tens of millions of Americans what could say the
