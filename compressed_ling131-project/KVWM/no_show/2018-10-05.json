that there are times that's what I was talking to George earlier on the ship where there are a species but I also think\nThat there can be in two dimensional holograms programmed for you to feel like you're someplace where just the ship is talking to you that's what I meant to about some of the ship seemed to have intelligence\nTalking to you that's what I meant to about some of the ship seemed to

questions for you um so you said\nThat your early experience was about three years old\nYes um [noise]\nSo can you can you explain to me what that experience was can you remember the vividly\nVery [laughter] um I used to when I was child I used to have two big panda bears that were about my size\nOne way or yellow and brown and one was black and white and I used to have this ritual habit at night of putting them on either side of me in bed with the thought and not knowing why I ever had this thought that when they come they'll mistake one of the bears for me and take the bear instead of me and\nNow they live in ... so you have you had an encounter before you had the ...\nProbably but I for some reason the panda bears or a trigger of memory\nRight where if they moved or do anything different than you know\nAnd you know my feeling was um they whoever I kept referring to is they when they come on right hand is instead of me\nI'm right I have a memory of three of the graves coming through the wall and coming down the hall anyway to towards my bedroom and then the next thing I remember is I was on the ship and then the fact\nThat they hurt did did you feel pain at all when you're on the ship\n[noise] um\nIf I did it that memory was wiped away in other words as soon as I looked in it when they knew I was in pain they would look into my eyes with their big black guys and then I Would not have the pain but I Would also not having the memory\nOkay you know when you're talking about all these different species I I don't remember a ... a kind of been a [noise] this giving kind of my background on this is a nightmare as long as the child\nAnd I see things on the wall and I pinch myself you know like you know the the panel that you like make faces out of you know and kind of get like misconstrued\nMhm but and I'm at that\nAt that point were Eric where are you going into hip and a guy get state 'cause sometimes as we go into\nI don't know I I ah I had no idea you know and I used to think people like you talking on the radio right now not to make not no no no offense [laughter] what grade are nuts [laughter]\nYou know while you're not alone like that a lot of people do you\nNot alone like that and and so I I uh well I still do have an alcohol problem but um I've been beating a pretty good and\nUh you know I'm forty years old now and I kind of you know it when I reflect back on things and now that I keep seeing and stuff like this more and more I'm like what an idiot I should have observed you know I'm a people watcher and or\nI should ... you know all of what's going on you know just like you know even politically you know ... everything that's going on just ... is just out of this world but not to get off the subject but what I wanted to know\nIs do you not think that the ... the use of their mattresses there's the graves there's the Andromeda says you know I don't know if I necessarily believe in different dimensions\nOkay I Want to say you know like I've always said you know the you know when you're looking up at the sky so they're that'd be a big where's the space of this wasn't something else out there\nCertainly but I also think a new biology in quantum physics\nHave proven that there are other dimensions and I think that we can only see one dimension because of our physical structure\nBut even if you look at certain animals they can see him for red which is beyond what we can see so I Do think there are different dimensions co existing that we're just not observant of because of the state of mind we're currently in\nSo uh before the break a Sandy let me ask you this and that will come back with some final last phone calls\nIf you get this opportunity to contact them again or they they you and they teach you again and you're aware would there be anything that you would do differently or change about the encounter\nI think I'd be ... try to be more observant and less in fear mode or lessen confusion um because so much of what they showed me has come to pass\nUm I Do think that if communication is head now um it would probably be more coming through my dream state or a heightened perceptions um\nI Do think at this point it's not that we're on our own but they're they they cannot interfere in certain things were planted a free will and there are certain things that they cannot interfere with like you know\nTons of spaceships coming down in saving us from ourselves you know I Do think there'll be some kind of falls disclosure that happens first but I Do think um that eventually we will join the legions of like I just think that's in our potential\nOkay we're going to come back and take some phone calls in a moment right here on coast to coast they\n\n\n\nThat's O.

six\nBecause the founding fathers decided to form a new form of government one that was based on laws that were eternal certain rights that people have that or an ale available wolves the ball or the people that have ruled your sister who they didn't like that so for two hundred and forty two years they've been trying to get it back\nAnd we America has resisted and that's a fight that we see going

back up for a minute and one thing I Know that you before the last break yeah um I said that um some of these species don't interfere\nBecause we are free will planet but they have interfered in the sense of not letting us destroy ourselves I think back to\nThe Montana missile silos that were\nClosed down and I think recently to learn um you know in October you heard that ... ah the European nuclear\nOr watching a drunk collider\nYeah that that in October that they had figured out a way to punch a hole in a different dimension but you know the pope was doing his us tour and all the news when to that\nAnd then in November they did punch a hole and reach some place called the hidden valley or something but that's when parents took place so we never heard about that and then in December supposedly it was destroyed internally\nUm or externally like the missile sought missile silos so I Do think there are times when we can create something that might help a self destruct where they do step in\n'em and I guess that that therefore wouldn't be always free will\nAnd do we hope against hope that the ah they will definitely trying to bail us out\n[noise] I think the only way they can get

I was cataloguing a number of spooky movies and I wanted to go through them with you a lot of big anniversaries ... ... ... what is your favorite do your personal favorite all time a horror film\n[noise] it's really tough it yet what swayed if you ask me every day I'll probably say something else right now I'm kind of falling in love with night in the living dead again just because it's ... anniversary [noise]\nUm but there's a lot of them that I really enjoy I read a you know so it's tough I I really like playing nine from outer space a guilty pleasure [noise] I really love the blob I Know that sounds corny since I'm the host the block and opposite solid movies I think it's a great movie\nWhat do you think movies like Halloween the extra ... the shining the conjuring and things like that you\nKnow I like those movies I think the shining it's actually a an excellent ghost story a you know in addition to uh being I guess it's not ... I mean I don't know if I classify shining at the slasher\nUm but it's certainly a horror film and and and and I and ... and a and a good one and I think it's what I mean forty years old or something now right you know these these are these modern horror films are pretty are you know the ring is Twenty years old\nYou know so um [noise] you know it's a you know a lot of them are are are ah you know whoa hold up pretty well um with age and I I really I think a Halloween the\nFirst call I mean\nIs really a pretty suspenseful movie and ... is really excellent as kind of like the captain kept trying to stop this uh you know maniacal a killer actually not even maniacal\nThat's the one from Nineteen Seventy eight man\nNineteen Seventy eight is a forty year anniversary of the original hollowing imagine it's been that long like gosh uh and John Carpenter who of course ah gave us a the remake of the thing and asking for your can have a bunch of other\nA horror films a science fiction a heat of the original concept was that it was going to be an anthology is that every Halloween\nThey would do a different theme or different type of a scary movie and the first story was called the babysitter killers\nAnd and the babysitter killer a and that was the ... that was the Michael Meyers story ... story kicked in and uh the character became so popular um\nThe mask he's wearing that we're trying to come up with a scary math and and and what they ended up doing was taking a William Shatner Star Trek mask and spray painting it white\n[laughter] so that's\nWilliam Shatner mascot wearing um\nI Wonder how bill feels about that yeah I don't know\nUh but uh you know ... and do what you know the fact that it took a blank you know expression on the mask and then and not deliberately scary face\nA you know I think that that made it more uh more scary you know I think a lot of times they are newer movies they try to heart you're talking about the conjuring and some of 'em there is a\nFamily of films there's an a bell which uh you know the original dog that the war and uh having their a basement full of uh object\nIs Iraq at the end all and we all know raggedy and looks like and the one that they had ended up doing in the movie they tried to make it look scary a it looks like something out of your Halloween you know and and it's just\nIt's it's a you know it no one would trust the stalled for two seconds you know they're like oh what a beautiful dog with the whole effect looking right off the bat you know a much scarier when it's something you least expect you know no one would think that that their little ... gonna\nGonna try to possess them or ... ...\nComing up on fifty years Rosemary's Baby can you believe that started to leave that either a ... to she was just almost a kid when she started in that movie\nShe was she was you know and that was kind of you know she got kind of a controversial sort of mob look with a short hair\nRight she ... proteges\nAnd that's true and that didn't last too long but you're right\nYou know and and uh you know a William Castle want it to make that movie you know William Castle was the producer of course in the fifties was famous for his gimmicks you know all like emerge Joe and uh you know I always feel the ... and the seats and the uh uh you know all of these uh\nMovie gimmicks of a house on the hill and uh\nUm

footage film but but creating a a a a story that people want it to believe in and the you know nowadays I think that'd be hard you\nBecause of the Internet it gives you can't keep a secret for twenty second but in Nineteen Ninety nine a food everybody everyone thought the Blair Witch was the thing\nWhat did you think of Freddie Krueger nightmare on elm street\nYou know it's interesting I didn't like it when I saw it originally uh you know it just kind of just greedy and\nCame out in Nineteen eighty four right\nAny for but you know I I've gone back and there's a lot of humor in it and and it's great marriage that said you know he's not just stabbing people going into their dreams\nUh which I think they pretty liberally ripped off from the movie dreams scape which I became the year before which is an excellent movie that people should seek out\nWhere someone is trying to assassinate the president inside of his dream right ah but ah yeah ... it's actually very clever movie and and uh with any any Arnold whenever they go five six seven equals yet they're getting pretty bad\nThere was a movie out two thousand fourteen I never saw it's got a weird movie it shows up as one of the horror films have you ever heard of at the bottom of Duke\n[noise] yes I have you know and I did not like the father just pretty much did it's Australian film I Believe it's about a a mother and her child and ah they are basically kind of dealing with the grief or over the last of of a spouse\nOr or and a father um and I think it manifested in this\nIn this creature that kind of comes alive from a children's storybook which kind of looks like London after midnight you know that like the top hat and kind of frighten me kind of hair\nAnd he's a cartoon of out of a children's book uh I didn't really I mean it it didn't I never really believe the ... but that wasn't the part of that is why\nI didn't like that it seemed like a two hours don't walk commercial where it was just running [laughter] this this allegory for their depression in their grief and that you you don't ever really escape your grief you just have to feed it\nWhat is it about horror and creepy films that people generally like to be scared\nUm you know I think if you you sir you won I think there's two there's two aspects roller coaster you know there's two kinds of roller coasters you want to you get are right you get on a roller coaster and you'd have so much fun that you want to get back on it and yet\nThe other kinda roller coaster is when you get off your kissing the ground [laughter] in forever want to get on a roller coaster it yeah and they're both fought\nA and I think that you know you you you you your face you know you get to put yourself in a kind of a mock a mock danger you know and and but really you're safe and then you feel like you've overcome something and I think that it's just that that Russia I think it's just that thrill\nAnd and again I think it's for a moment there it makes them forget all the really thing real things in real life that really do terrified and I think that that that's worth the price of admission by itself\nWhat did the demographics of movie goers these days I mean I went to a lot when I was younger and I don't go to nearly as many movies now that I'm grown ah I prefer to see them on video or DVDs or you know streaming you know in the comfort of my house\nI think a lot of people are like that it it's interesting 'cause uh you know I I think that\nTo\nSeventy Seventy [noise]\nThe Senate will vote this morning I'm David Anthony Fox News

changed up the biggest sons have bit\nOr something that you taught me that I did not know until very recently is that each market each PBS market local affiliate in his own prior yeah I Know that but it does the length and frequency of their of their begging sons or their own they they\nEach one is is individual because depends how much money is in the area if you're ... more than ...\nLine only

Ford\nWho we will all agree in some form went through some abuse\nWhen she was a teenager at this party that she talks about\nWe don't know to what extent and\nWill still say we don't even know who did it she said she had one beer but ask any cop you ever meet in your life how many times they've heard that crazy allergy I only had one beer\nOkay but the truth of the matter is when he arrived in her life that\nAfter saying that she was very credible the week before\nThen national talk show host went on the air and said it was okay for him to do that because everybody who had been doing that to justice Kavanaugh and you know what\nI agree they should not have been tearing apart justice Kavanaugh was out any facts and tearing him down like they did but that doesn't mean I take some\nMedicine woman and do the same thing there are just for sport\nThat's there ... years of victim at this particular incident\nI think everybody agrees with that but to tear her part because

Fox to tell the story as he saw it\nOn how President Trump and sun ... got how we got that story and how it's sprouted wings\nOr my colleagues sucrose went to her mailbox one day and there was a level open inside the ... for a couple of pages\nFrom President Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax return uh we reported on those documents are in the run up to the election but it was a a move information that that was kind of stunning to us within those documents which was with the president in Nineteen Ninety five\nShowed that he had lost over nine hundred million dollars and it was it was a one of those moments that made us realize okay wait a minute\nThis a lot we actually don't know about President Trump than Donald Trump candidate Trump and his history with money\nAnd so that was really the beginning of us deciding let's let's dig deeper let's try to pull back as many layers of this onion as we possibly can yeah it was um I mean there was a that was a a a huge surprise and fined for us\nBecause what we were seeing was that ...\nThrough you know starting when Donald Trump was three years old and moving forward had been endlessly creative and coming up with a new ways to get money into Donald Trump's pocket\nSo he didn't just pay him to be like on his payroll but he also pay them to be as purchasing a trip he paid them to be his property manager you pay them to be as a consultant who gave him the laundry revenue from the buildings and yet he's on after this incredible\nUm generosity from Fred Trump to Donald Trump there comes this moment that we discover in our reporting that there was one line that was sort of\nToo far even for Trump and it was when Trump discovered that Donald Trump had hired\nLawyers to rewrite a portion of those will in a way that at least ... Trump perceived\nCould put his entire empire at risk\nNow re win the election was going on when you know in the middle of the elections and we started hearing these stories so during\nThe campaign about I remember this story about\nWell but once again I I'm moving to the southern part here when you heard the story that Donald Trump said he was going to refuse to release his tax returns ... because he was still being audited on it mhm and when the audits\nWere over he would release them it never happened wouldn't that be kind of ironic is that the teams the thing that came back and then

think anything can happen and I hope the American people see what they were electing and Nancy Pelosi Maxine Waters and Chuck Schumer that's my of my biggest hope John McLaughlin\n[noise] I think you're right and uh uh in terms of its just four weeks out over four weeks ago a lot can happen but I Will tell you that the key thing is Donald Trump is putting the Republicans on his shoulders and bringing them across the finish line in that he's bringing his votes to bear\nBut it is voters are coming back out but the key thing is it's too real opponents right now or Nancy Pelosi and Chuck

percent unfavorable rating\nSo we've got to do is they're supposed to last national survey ahead of fifty five percent unfavorable rating I mean fifty five percent will be a landslide for the Republicans and they could they could hold the house so right now we're headed to gain seats in the Senate but it's too early on the house and and\nPrior to cabinet looked like we were going to lose the house but uh uh with that kind of a negative on policy for her\nTo be the leader to oppose Donald Trump every day for the next two years to his reelection he needs to take on every day about\nThem wanting to raise taxes on the economy have open borders having having a back to the elites where the swap around the country again so or if he does that over the next four weeks the Republicans could

them a simple question do you believe in the presumption of innocence listen\nDo you feel that he was a shortage that presumption of innocence this is a job interview and the question is about the evidence that presented and the credibility of her claim do you believe that just jumping a presumption of innocence got a beer drinking their [noise]\nNo I think\nHe's going to get him because he liked the entire time\nWe end up in the law\nYou why do you believe shouldn't jump on and I I feel like he's by multiple times not how he felt\nThat they have that\nApplication Kevin Oh wasn't given beer presumption of an\nInjection\nLike me I shot and now I'm investigation aimed at the age of ... not one I think you got in the behavior of someone\nLike that\nAnd I\nI mean\nDo you believe that uh he was given a fair chance to discover Mitchell better job than the man is sitting among friends of his\nHe was making the decisions about what they want they just starting\nOut because there were

can go to Jesse leap Peterson a dot com justly tutor dot com and we're going to be talking with Democrats and Republicans and independents about this\nUh upcoming election because a lot of people are really really upset at what happened with just a cabinet are even people who at one time thought that they were going to be voted for the Democrats have started to rethink their position and I have to tell you Sean I grew up on a ... down in Alabama\nI grew up a born and grew up under the Jim Crow laws are among black and white size only when I voted at Eighteen I voted for the Democratic party all those three are growing up on that plantation living under Jim Crow laws that I was as a Democrat Democrats All right\nFor you to help free thought they don't lie for you to take care of yourself they lie to you about the Republican Party specially with the a straight white conservative Christian now they're always calling him racist and they use those words to brainwash you in order to as slave view and the beauty of all if there is it a beauty and death\nAbout what's happening with the judge and hatred\nAnd the anger at the accusations false allegations about Pearl ... we have seen over the last couple of weeks a\nMonth or so even longer than that or even a lot of black people started to think about the Democratic party and they're starting to realize especially\nThe Christians that started to realize maybe they are involved with the wrong party and that the party the Democratic party is not like to party it at a joint many many years ago and I think a lot of folks have been affected by this\nYou know see O'Brien I remember correctly where are you part of the N. double ACP for a number of years\nSean I'm a two term president at the end up on the Garland, Texas\nHas a way you might not know and I'm I'm a life member I became a life member I was not an event in Atlanta and I it just so happens I said please the next time take politics out of a man like Clarence Thomas\nIs in advancing and is exceeding at the highest level please please support him I said that when I when I pay when I paid my membership of the party or somewhere\nAbsolutely right Sean and what we're seeing now are the fake activists who are hitting the street I remember when I was president ah there and I'm going to disclose this that there were times when we would ... load up and buses full of activists by simply giving him ten dollars and a tuna fish sandwich\nAnd a drink to get on the bus to go protest something that they\nHad no clue what it was that they were going to protest and that's what you're saying on the streets now and that\nFake it is something that will not stop freedomworks the organization that I Am with what you have grass roots activist who are in the capital right now\nWho are checking on their congressmen and senators\nTo make certain that they ride herd on this particular vote we want cabinet noted come through last week freedomworks we had two thousand people on the Capitol Grounds pushing through\nNot only Jim Jordan who I can be the next speaker of the house but also we wanted those elected officials who should be responsible\nTo the American people for the officers they old to make sure that they go and do the job that we sent them to do it's a long way from when I was president of the N. double ACP twenty seven years ago\nTo where I Am now and that plantation that revenue Peterson was talking about the Jesse Lee was talking about by the way Jesse leaves in my movie runaway slave or just you lead on why\nAm I not in your movie what's up with a\n... do you and I have to make the next film together Sean we have to make the next\nNone no no I'm just wondering why you picked Jesse and you didn't pick your friends Sean Hannity\nYou might be good for you got to come on the show real soon but that plantation was real I grew up during that same Jim Crow era it's very real but many of us have run away from it and\nWe encourage many more at this point in time in America and the president is giving us all the caliber that's necessary to run away from that type of sleep but that this nation that following up on ... you know to\nAdd to that and the beauty of what President Trump has done that because the lack\nFear he's put country first he's not afraid to really deal with the people he's not afraid to use social media to put the troop out there and just credit is encouraging a lot of men and women if those are good to stand up and speak a\nFight for their country fight for what is right and when they saw this attack on judge\nKavanaugh his wife\nHis daughters while they're saying that they care about women care about children we're to love and compassion for the judge and his wife his children uh God I have to deal with these allegations\nIn this whole thing has to now we've got to get through the vote tomorrow and I am cautiously optimistic that judge Kavanaugh gets to be on the court that he deserves to be on what we don't deal with the these tactics\nThe willingness to tear down bludgeon destroy men families\nKids are obviously impacted by it if if they can't even have the most simple as the civility on these issues\nYou know the American people need to see it no it get it understand it embrace what they would be voting for it's horrible you know destroying people it's horrible how many more people have to go through a Clarence Thomas judge Kavanaugh Robert Bork\nHow many Republicans are falsely accused of being racist and wanting to kill their grandmothers it's ridiculous at this point\nAnd they do it with literally with them to immune but there is total immunity for them there are no repercussions for this conduct anyway Robert ... Petersen thank you rubber CEO Brian thank you and uh we wish you both the best\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalt allegation show we facilitate Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations because we believe that the Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation show that all allegations are important\nWe believe that all Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations are important\nWe believe that all Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations are serious and most importantly we believe that all Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations should be believed healing happens here at the Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation show\nIf you would like to join the Chuck Schumer sexual allegations Joe\nYou may he'll by calling eight seven seven three one thirty eight eleven\nAll right so hey what a week or ... it's been huh what a what a few weeks it's been a it is you're South Florida friend Bryan mud in for the great one mark Levin\nAnd by the way because there's always one this is not the place to share your your Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations if people are nothing by now you go directly to the FBI and you demand an investigation and then be sure to look over their shoulder and tell them how that can be conducted all throughout the course of that investigation\nBut the the absurdity of the situation is that Chuck Schumer lifestyle and my uh was joining you\nA couple of Tuesday's ago hadn't made that statement earlier in the day\nBefore we even had the hearing last Thursday well I Believe her and that's what this really what it's all about\nThat is what this all really was all about\nNon Brett Kavanaugh out about the Supreme Court about Christine forward\nIt's about what kind of country we are going to be what can the country on this would end up representing in a world in which someone as distinguished has incredible and you know otherwise clean as Brett Kavanaugh if he can be taken out of the highest levels of justice\nWe're all screwed the moment that somebody comes out of left field with an allegation actually sure to a very personal story with you and I received stories from across the country and believe I'll responded to a to all of you\nWho who share their stories about extortion about threats about people that had done bad things to you and here's the the good news and the bad news\nThe good news and the bad news of this situation is that we're not screwed in this country\nThe bad news is we're two votes away today from being screwed in this country so it's a big time wake up call and a reminder reminder about several things for example\nIt's a reminder right now that if you are in Chicago and you're a cubs fan and you're a leftist wow it must suck to be you right now that's really start to be in fact if I were you I won't even joked about what's the point what's the point you know\nThe same but it's also a reminder that we are right and then that's a line that fine line\nIs senior living advisors at a place for mom partner with friends and families every month listening and operate local knowledge and advice to help find the best senior living communities across the country and it's a free service is the number\nTo call a place for mom at one eight hundred for six seven seven by three zero\nPlace for answers late for mom called today\nCall a place for a mom at one eight hundred for six seven seven five three zero that's one eight hundred for six seven seven by three zero\nAttention all authors page publishing as looking for authors have you with a new book you'd want to get it published page publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets\nThey handle all aspects of the publishing process for you bringing ... publicity copyright and editing go eat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine now where you're free author ... should get that seat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author certainly should get again eight hundred ... or one thirty six eighty nine\nOr you or someone you love one of the nearly one million Americans living with Parkinson's disease there is no known cure\nThat you have the power to help change that I've read dissipating in a clinical trial the Michael gay thought foundation will help you get them died and they didn't Michael\nJ.

say I want to hear from Dr for it I thought she was handled respectfully I thought having al was treated like crap [noise]\nYeah ... herself [laughter]\nAh speaking of the folks who uh stepped up in a surprise is awake\nLindsey Graham at the Atlantic and been in the DC on Wednesday will blow yourself after is funny because here you had Cory Booker AK Spartacus and and he told us he was having his Spartacus moment\nAnd then Lindsey Graham like actually wants to give up the hearing and he's continued it's kinda like Lindsey Graham's like the Grinch in a different sense you know the Grinch his heart grew three ... three times that day let's say that a Lindsey Graham's intestinal fortitude grew three times\nOver the past three months I Believe and so he's become a new hero in this entire process rock solid Lindsey Graham something else that I don't think many of us necessarily thought would be the case\nBuildings I Am very much based on information on the arguments the information that provide you my opinions all based on information and one of the things I've been tracking from the word go the day after Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the United States Supreme court\nGallup has always tracked on Supreme Court nominees and you may be ... whatever about Gallup but regardless of what you think of their polling it's instructive because if they do it every single day ongoing you can use a baseline to get a temperature ... temperature jak of public opinion on any given issue in this case\nOur views of Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat was interesting in the very first polling\nDone on Brett Kavanaugh after\nHis nomination but President Trump we had four percent more Americans say that he should be confirmed in case of that the baseline that's where we started now after we had the first hearing\nAnd we had twenty senators on the Senate Judiciary committee and Spartacus do what they did\nComing out of that four percent more Americans thought that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed the not in other words despite the fact that a couple of months went by despite the fact that they uh you know what else Spartacus on them it didn't change public opinion at all not at all\nNow is interesting because as consistent as that was we did see with Christine for delegations a bit of a shift\nAs a Thursday morning I yesterday but a week ago the morning of the hearing we did see public sentiment according to Gallup shift into negative territory and Brett Kavanaugh\nWe saw public sentiment shift to three percent more people believing that he should not be confirmed then should be again prior to the testimony alright that's after everything that the media and the politicians did the ...\nWhere are we today that's kind of interesting by a forty six to forty five marching\nAmericans believe that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed now there too and I soon to be learned in this entire process on this information to first is\nPublic opinion despite all the emotions oh the emotions the oh the nonsense sport it gets to Christine for two gang raping whatever\nPublic opinion only shifted by seven percent seven percent top to bottom that's it in terms of the opinion about that\nNow what's instructive inside of that seven percent we bounce back to pretty much where this country is one of the things I find fascinating is when we actually do have representatives in this country that represent us and in this particular case the United States Senate\nIs doing pretty much what the American people want to have happen here\nBy a slim margin red Kavanaugh\nEnded up receiving the necessary votes to advance the final vote tomorrow\nWe'll end up becoming the next Supreme Court justice on a narrow vote just as the American people wanted it so that part I think is like a graphically interesting the next facet of this conversation is where to focus your energy\nBecause how many people are really persuadable politically one of the most common questions I ever receive has to do with persuading people politically how do you do it\nWell the easiest way to tell you how not to do it who is it that you are most likely to engage politically\nProbably allows people in your life that oppose you right how's that work out for you and let me ask you for the angry leftist but you argue politics with you ever get anywhere you just get angry do you think they're one of the\nFolks just poured that seven percent that was ever persuadable in the first place\nNow I Know we wish that we could change their minds especially if they're in their lives and our universe\nBut people have to be open minded first coming up next to talk about that in how to be persuasive and who can be persuaded and how not to bend your head against the wall and just become really unhappy [noise] I Am Brian mud and\nMore global [noise]\nListen to what David ask from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the

the bonuses it's all happening and it's important to tell them how we got here\nAnd then it's also important in this Kevin situation to articulate what's on the line here hey if somebody that you didn't even know came out and accused you of the sexual assault may not be awful right\nYeah it'd be pretty bad right I mean that's what happened here and and go through information only rather than just the emotions of yeah you know Kavanaugh anyway just a little food for thought let's go to Archie in Ventura, California Archie go\nRight and it's it's good to hear about your ah your history and and your experience or that tells me why work with a choice you to do is to\nSpeak well of you and I wanted to say that uh listening to very carefully to the Susan yeah a colon senator Collins is a [noise] a dissertation about what happened and even though I'm a Democrat and I'm In California I was a quite impressed by it\nShe laid it out very precisely he was a very methodical started out a little weak but it went on from there and build the was it just showed her diligent all of the time she had been getting a\nComing to her a conclusion interview you did and all the all the meetings he wanted to until I found it very at applying and informative and uh her stock went up ... percent with me\nI couldn't agree more I was frankly shocked at just how detailed top to bottom on every single consideration that's part of this process\nI mean she was on ... and point by point by\nPoint from the nomination process pointing out how many organizations were going to oppose\nRegardless of who the nominee was that one of the organizations hadn't even filled in the name and they put out that they were opposing the nominee mentioned or that even senators got out ahead to one of them even got out ahead of the name being announced when they were saying that\nThey were opposed all the way through point by point by point\nWind Christine Ford was not credible in terms of allegations even though she did mention that she believed that ultimately she was likely a sexual assault victims\nNo evidence whatsoever that it was Brett Kavanaugh and her eyes she could have been the top of joining the country the way that she laid out the details as she found them\nIt was about Fifteen minutes fifty fifty five minutes her speech and I would say that it is a must view if you missed it uh it is definitely worth catching the entire thing it was captivating and again I have never heard a senator deliver a better speech\nNot ever I didn't agree with absolutely everything she said but it was principles it was details it was well thought out and almost everything there is inarguable I just absolutely remarkable Susan Collins\nWhom goes a dynamite go to Jim Jim in Charlotte welcome to the

the skaters are kind of a ramp butter and big but a a sort of the cold weather gets in on her I think er I think they should be like diminishing a little bit\nHow the folks over in Wilmington\nOr

California Welcome to the show\nI Am a yeah I was a I Would agree with your point about look it up and Ford and as far as their allegations are concerned but I had a little different take on a not so much to go after her\nBut to ah go after anybody in the future that might think that they can pick people up to putting up false allegations and not have to pay a price\nCorrect I think that's the single most important thing and the reason why I'm not willing to just give a pass even though Kavanaugh is going to clear this thing\nBecause he's always going to have this stain that he's going to have to deal with there's a certain percentage of the population that's not insignificant but it's going to believe the allegation regardless and it's not okay to perjure yourself these are principal and again you know if we're going to deal with the rule of law for going to deal with the premise\nThat should be addressed and we know because of politics we're not going to see the Senate Judiciary committee pursue her for perjury conduct investigation that would be necessary to travel down that path\nBut it doesn't mean that it should go unchecked what she did was absolutely wrong because again when you say you I'm One hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted me and you have none of your uh none of your witness a\nWhere none of the witnesses period that corroborate any

Joe Manchin who is eight yes Joe Manchin the Republican and waiting wonder if that is going to happen to have no idea but Joe Manchin of course has been the most moderate Democrat in the Senate mentioned after the twenty sixteen election that he considered considered the party but\nThe governor the Democratic governor of West Virginia ... so the question is is mansion next maybe he wins reelection here and and he goes ahead and and does the ... thing but uh so I was mentioning in the previous segment\nThat there's the potential that we could be an inflection point in American history one in which the norms don't apply Donald Trump being president the United states not your typical president and the movement that he was on twenty sixteen not your typical movement which has happened with Brett Kavanaugh\nThat could certainly aid the argument that we're in this inflection point that things are different this is not your typical midterm election cycle to provide a a little more\nFuel for that fire if you want to embrace it\nSomeday and I've never seen and again I'm a student of history now I'm a student of information\nAnd to the point age began in the Nineteen thirties so we have information about what we've been interested in what we've been into their mid term elections since the late Nineteen thirties right never once\nNot ever has the most important issue to the average voter ... in the United States Supreme court it's come up with really high and presidential elections it was the number three is you an election day or three issue and election day twenty six team\nBut it's number one number one right now\nAccording to the Pew Research center Seventy six percent of Americans say that the Supreme Court will be on their mind\nWhen they go to vote however their impassioned do vote now\nWe are still just over a month away from election day\nPeople are fickle things can change Kavanaugh gets confirmed tomorrow maybe the level of priority comes down because it's been taken off the table I guess we can say or maybe people are still that motivated by because hey we could have others Supreme Court justices that come up here over the next couple of years right\nThat remains to be saying but we are seeing right now in some of the internal data that's available\nWhat's driving us that's different than ever before you have the Supreme Court and mentioned and then it goes to health care OK so after that which by the way did that change the dynamic at all so\nWe're in this window of time that is different and anytime that politics that people are different the outcomes absolutely have the potential to be too so as we are now just over a month away from election day\nYou take a look at how many elections are out there\nThat could have the outcomes changed by seven percent seven percent\nAnd that is the potential for what could happen\nIf there were a red wave that\nCame out of this right now if you had seven percent that moved because of President Trump because of the economy because\nOf the progress or may because they are tired of what's going on in this country because of backlash about Brett Kavanaugh eagle wind seven percent\nIn the first hour I mentioned that in this entire Kavanaugh process entire process from the day after he was nominated until today\nSeven percent movement top to bottom in terms of public opinion on whether or not we should confirm Brett Kavanaugh that that is really what we're looking at here those are the people that are persuadable but seven percent\nEncompasses a bunch of elections across this country usually voter enthusiasm is exaggerated because only sixty four percent of eligible adults or even registered to vote in the first place and we take a mid term elections well I mean typically have around forty percent they actually show up to vote\nSo we do tend to often bake a bit too much into voter enthusiasm this and that\nBut it absolutely has the potential in this type of environment to make the difference which is why it's absolutely critical you want to make a difference you get your butt out there and vote like you find those seven percent\nYou use this potential inflection point in American history and you get out there and you're trying to make a difference\nWe do have a different landscape it's not all they are in the polling and the end the top level numbers that are discussed yet but it has the potential to be and we're a little more than a month away so that is what you are in store for you get out there make a difference if you're inclined\nUnlike those angry people that were paid and and shouting that Joe mansion it's going to win the hearts and minds when it's I don't think it's going to winning hearts and minds\nThere is this window of opportunity a moment in time potential inflection point issues that matter more that never met her before in mid term election cycles so what are you going to do with it\nAnd the other way want to give me a heads up on something that uh you've definitely definitely should go ahead and ... on your DVR if you don't already have in\nLife liberty and living in sin eastern Fox News

conspiracy thought process that Susan Collins it was not on the up and up I I really I got the sense that uh she was in the air and genuine throughout her speech\nAnd let's go to Raj Raj is in

that when I was watching everything this whole whole process with my wife the first thing when we saw the doctor giving her testimony we felt sorry for we really felt that she was emotionally disturbed\nAnd there we thought that was probably a whole plethora of reasons for that you know obviously so sexual molestation but one of them\nBut that we felt pity we didn't feel angry I have no animals towards the woman but I think the biggest takeaway on this was the debauchery\nThat the the Democrats ex expose themselves to the process that they would go to to prevent something that was normal\nWithin you know the process of the government and there should be some re ... from these attorneys who were directed to her by Dianne Feinstein who had animals towards President Trump\nAnd hid things from her like her being able to be interviewed in California or wherever she wanted\nThis is the thing that needs to change within the Judiciary Committee procedures and the penalties\nNot necessarily innocent victims like Dr Ford who I really think she is but the people who are behind that and directing it and in corrupting our government and I'm angry because I don't see anything on any news show talking about how the wrong people are going to be punished\nI'm going to agree with all agree it was Seventy five percent of your point you're I I Do want to ask you specifically you say that you're not angry at at Christine board here\nDo you feel that uh she did anything wrong by going under oath and and involving herself in this process saying that she was one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her\nHere's what we don't know we don't know what was said in her um sessions for therapy sessions I don't know that some therapists or some lawyer may have talk her into it you know when when you're that exposed and you're that vulnerable\nMemories can be created all over the place I've been reading all kinds of articles about that so I I don't know enough about the woman to be angry what I Know enough is that I can see that she was used by people who didn't do enough I mean if it was really that big of a problem Dianne Feinstein whether it brought about that one\nShe knew that that wasn't provable in court and she knew that the ... way to the bigger political bang she was going to get out of it and putting the attorneys who hated to begin with and in charge of it\nGet out of it and putting the turning to pay the truck began with him in charge of it she knew that was another lose situation ... well what did she calculate wrong\nIt's interesting now you bring up a lot of compelling an interesting points I still can't get there in in terms of having necessarily been coerced into this mindset remember she's a professional in the field I mean after all I mean as part of her credibility she was telling us about how uh you know emotions are are stored and and\nMemories are stored in the hippocampus was that they only won by the way when she pulled that out that went seriously this is how you're attempting to establish our credibility as a witness I was one of those moments where it's like okay\nWhat part of our tactic is there a but but anyway you know I I still feel she's cattle you go under oath\nYou're you're involved in this process you say you're one hundred percent certain you provide all these witnesses and the thing that's odd to if she was going to end up being the worst by you know some a psychologist but that these are the memories that you really had where was she of receipts all those names that she provided as the witnesses\nI mean that's difficult for somebody who was a third party that wouldn't have been involved in that process to to instill in her I just\nCan't quite get there
