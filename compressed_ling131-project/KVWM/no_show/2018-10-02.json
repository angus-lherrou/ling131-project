R. L. A. go\nHi Mark it's a pleasure to talk to you thank you\nI listen to all the time I Am so incensed with this whole Kavanaugh carrying and fall out and everything like that and everything else I have to tell you I worked for Obama campaign is volunteer I worked on Clinton's I met Clinton I changed over the public and party the Democrat sickened me and\nWhat what was the event that ... seriously that cause you to change\n[noise] a bomb everything that a bomb and did that last for years I couldn't even vote on when he was up for reelection or\nWhat he did with in the middle east how he treated Netanyahu I Do believe that he was an anti Semite I hate to say that I said at the many times and I believe it\nRight but the thing I I that bothers me the most is maybe ... Dr Ford was actually molested I don't disagree with that\nRight but I think that they in my opinion obviously I think they saw all the questions I didn't hear anything about her drinking and ... trying to do a little bit of my own research have a research background I found out she was a cheerleader and high school\nAnd there was there was something on the Web that talked about when the cheerleaders quote unquote guts did enough it was a party time so what I'm Wondering is just like any other teenager she might have had so much to drink she\nDidn't know who well here's what I Do know did anybody asked that question\nExactly that was my point it\nDid they ask those questions about Kavanaugh yes did they ask those questions about her no exactly and this is why she and her lawyers do never never ever want to see the inside of a courtroom\nRight but the other thing that I wanted to mention that to other things do I have time I've been waiting a long time but it's not\nOkay for like um you might have covered this 'cause I turn my radio off I Want to [noise] um I Know you talk a lot about like but there was a comment I read on Fox dot com roughly said that if he was running for reelection\nHe would never have called for the FBI investigation because he said if I Hope unquote incorrectly said there'd be no value and no incentive I could not believe I read it\nAnd the guy's a chameleon he's been a ... million his entire political life certainly while he's been in the Senate absolute chameleon everyone knows it but because he bashes Trump\nOr because he can't win re election in Arizona He does this drama thing which was kind of lived um with the Susan Collins and Murkowski unmentioned behind the scenes or and none of them is called for any of these accuses to go to the Montgomery County police department they\nOh we're not beyond investigation which is not a criminal investigation Andrea thank you for your call Mike San Francisco the great ... go\nTo mark thank you for having me on I appreciate it yeah I Want to ask you a question about lying I concede although I absolutely believe the county was guilty of at least some of these things like that because it's so long hold on\nHold on can't do the hit and run stuff what is he guilty of\nOf I'm just saying what I Believe but I concede that we may have more evidence a sufficient for a criminal court room which this isn't that he is guilty\nWhy isn't it ... sure sure you're you're you're doing your you know hit and run stuff why don't they bring it to a court ... why don't why I I'm happy to answer your question you're going to answer mind first\nYou said he's guilty I Want to know what\nAnd you said it's not a court of law and yet it could be a court of law couldn't [noise] well they could go to Montgomery County police department but they haven't have they\nKnow of course not and you only if it were my daughter I Would tell her to go over to the Montgomery County police department and go ahead and swear out a criminal complaint and I would do that as a father and a lawyer so how come they're not\nWell I Can't tell you what is in their minds are what\nThey asked you can cook you're telling me what's in Kavanaugh's mind you told me he's guilty that's not what it is in his mind that's more online in a matter of being in your mind it's a process if you honestly believe that somebody raped you or molested you or try to do that and there's no statute of limitations where it took place not\nWell then go swear out a criminal complaint\nAnd for all we know that that might or civil complaint might happen in the future\nThe question about the future I care about now when it's real and it matters but go ahead asked me are tough gosh\nThank you um [noise] I

start attacking it as a uh it's not a full some investigation they're already doing not and not investing enough witnesses the president's looming so are these people and not to be taken seriously

who's mundane for [laughter]\nIt it it's actually uh I I guess\nIn the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much it's it's really earth astrology global astrology is relative nations of world leaders things like eclipse is new moon is full of major planetary lime\nIn other words that's kinda the opposite he's doing personal horoscope readings although I've I've been doing that just as long um so the word again now people think of mundane kind of just ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results the same mundane astrology and personal horoscope type readings\n[noise] no I mean well you're dealing with the same planet fine line there there's a fine line is that there will\nAgain kind of ... the maker cause and rather than microcosm if two people who are in my field it's just kind of they they don't want to take the broad objective universal perspective on things that they prefer to look at the big picture of national events current event the way the world is and when\nI was growing up it's this kind of the way it was they read the the the the world book\nUm you know the almanac the world ... book affects every year we'd come out back in the fifties and sixties they'll going after a hundred and fifty years actually mostly for sport like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports baseball football and so on\nSo I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course a President Kennedy came into office with the with the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was I was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there [noise]\nAnd I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation in the world probably because of that particular event\nIn more on the world the nation and the world probably because of that particular event\nMark tell us exactly what is strongly gee is\nWell what we're as I said before as above so below this goes back to ancient Egypt the idea of a a a being called ... or the the thrice great harmonies which is the actual\nEgyptian Greek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly there was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and mathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know I'm of the modern astrology we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy\nWho is also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so much and I also studied all kinds of things we regarding Atlanta um when I first got in the whole field I got into reincarnation\nMeditation metaphysics\nLived at the ... community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about retrograde planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just if we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective here Leo nothing the planet to just keep going the ordinary cycles\nMercury has an eighty eight day forward moving a orbit around the sun um we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away and the astrology we use is what we were called geo centric\nEvery so often all the planets now this is not the center moon George but all the planets will tend to appear to go in reverse from our vantage point uh it's kinda like\nUh this is the perfect metaphor you're at a train station and you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours\nIs going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you and it kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're kind of ... in your direction but there are like going the other way and it's like confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde\nMotion so what most people have tuned into all over the decades\nIs mercury going in reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth perspective for about three weeks at a time and what's amazing now in two thousand eighty and if you if someone went to Google as far as one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde your and then you click on images\nIt's their little George with all kinds of things like stop signs and road signs saying mercury recreate don't go here don't go there because people are actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going to reverse\nIf you have five different astrologers would you get five different kinds of readings at any given time\nUm well let me answer one way if people who really have studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades very intensively if you had say a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same chart of somebody with the same event\nAnd you ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and\nOther things over the years because I've been on during the election times and often you know people want to hear a prediction you're gonna go however astrology really works best in terms of ... or as young said and he's studied it or not just psychology and UFOs and ... dollars and everything else\nBut he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I use is called before whatever is born at a moment of time has the qualities of that moment of time it's because time\nShould not be thought of is like I'll meet you at ten o'clock in the morning at such and such a place\nSo that people think of time as kind of a convenient system it's really a power\nAnd so when a person is born and they have a particular astrology charts and at their first moments that they take their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around in a great circle and they're in different signs of the Soviet and the U.S trawler puts it altogether and reads it as a kind of\nI'm almost like a spiritual genetic code to interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but\n... ... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of\nSolar energy lunar energy and climate or energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above some low so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most astrologers kinda who have been around the horn along time will come up with a similar result\nAre use psychic too or just the Charlotte\nI'm Glad you asked that question I okay\nIf I say out to the public my my son is in Pisces which tends to be at least as I understand that sign rather reticent to to be\nA for instance do well kind of planet earth for Twenty years I'm not somebody who likes marketing and advertising and commercial stuff a much more focused that's why the Monday and astrology on our church will things\nAnd so I'm fundamentally um I ... it's interesting you asked me that because I have been very psychic\nAnd intuitive but I don't broadcasted but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most\nAnd her ... in sports you rush logically psychic like okay stay with us mark where in the break we're going to come back and talk about world events how they affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with the astrologer ... great beer enterprises dot com or\nDo you want your GD beyond belief your jewelry\nJust log on to beyond belief dot com\nWhen the American revolution was one is is the same year that Iran is was cited by sir William Herschel and ironically in bath England\nUm but at any rate that planet has just gone into tourists okay and tourists as the main sign of money\nIn ... New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two and so not yet but in all five years\nOr Iran and spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional\nSoda things coming out of left field shock some surprises Iran us will cross over the sun the solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it will probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back\nUh which takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six he get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three\nAnd that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers are my field people look at these kinds of things like a a nation's chart of nations are born like people if you can locate the birth time of country cities have charts\nStates of the union have charts but America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in a number of years including a probably market changes but I don't see it right now\nWhat about cribs does\nNow cryptic does this this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology\nIt's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred and Ninety four years\nThe ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which the largest planets they've been actually looked at by people going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were charting believe it or not because they didn't have\nA all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrologers they were ... they just didn't have the scientific kind of\nThings that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ... but basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water so to make a what's happening is since Eighteen forty one every Twenty years\nJupiter and Saturn have been in earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know it\nBut what's gonna happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now\nThose two planets Jupiter and Saturn marriage together at the beginning of Aquarius\nAnd then for the next like a hundred and eighty years all the Jupiter Saturn's are going to be an air science and the point here is that crypto currency is are more connected to the air element of things that are more\nA theory that are more online that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties of the banking world the corporate world and all that so that we were ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes\nYeah I guess you could say that\nA very stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new and my daughter has created it really beautifully it's called the astro flash it allows me to do some shorter things so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit so I've got a couple of things on grey parrot prizes in art or a earth Aquarius news zones so now or the crust news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius new segment and grape or enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening\nWith Brett Kavanaugh and and Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this well you can you predict if he I mean today one of his color Joe ... says I Can't call them a friend but said that he was a drunk\nWell you know it's interesting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother die from alcoholism\nYou know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum\nOr the president certainly speaks his mind sometimes to some people too much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not um he could withdraw I mean you know ... it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday\nI don't think it I think it's going to be hard to prove anything\nThrough um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big and what I did is I looked at the truck for the moment of Thursday when the session began you see that's part of mundane astrology always limits in charge of a person although you can do that\nAnd I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an international thing with the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a chart just like a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart\nIs very descriptive of that whole tunnel last Thursday\nCan I put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed astrological speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus in the science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexuality Venus is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it\nI don't think it'll happen but well\nYeah well the thing is is that ... there's too much unknown but if I if I Would hazard a guess you know I Would just say there's certainly pushing forward it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative with somebody else is going to be nominated\nIn ... in his place so it's not as if something like that it would be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there that is squeaky clean well I think\nThat would be because they've been saying that uh a\nLot by my question Mr learner you think you'll get confirmed it on\nUm I like your logically speaking well Esther logically we know his ...\nUm I like your logically speaking\nWell Esther logically we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control\nHe used to hazard a guess on that side of the equation\nYou still didn't answer me though I think it will get confirmed you do okay All right that that that's something that might be one I I I I'll be wrong on but a buyout I'll say now you at least you took a stand\nRight because when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um were so many of the predictors and you know these forecasters were were all looking at everything\nUm I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably win that she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan\nWisconsin a Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million and that turned the election to the electoral college in Trump won\nSo amazing work now ... let's talk about Kim Jong un on and his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think what do you think it's happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this will this will be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other or people who come on often about Iran and the world situation I think it's a done deal that they are going to have nuclear weapons and when and they're never going to get rid of him\nBut what's gonna happen is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing um in other words it will be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false whether or not a kind of you do these kinds of things that no other president would have ever done and you try and just sort of like make things nights\nAnd then eventually you know right now they just said the other day ah the secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize by the end of of the president's administration I don't know if you've caught that did you see that and\nI sure did it was like we're wait we want them to do it tomorrow last week why they're dragging their feet and then during so I don't know if it was late friday or something oh you know as long as they do it within the next two years were fine what you know and so I just I've seen this all the way through the danger I think I'm In all of this\nThis personal diplomacy we don't know if Kim Jong un is going to be the leader tomorrow the next day in this country at least we have a succession of how\nAre you also don't know what he's doing is a trick\nExactly so you got the tricky thing\nWe the other thing is uh in astrology this is very important Donald Trump's sharp President Trump's choice is known we've known as exact birth time for decades it's not a mystery Hillary Clinton's birth time could have been twelve hours off nobody has figured it out it's not talked about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it so\nShe was kind of an unknown quality in terms of her chart okay we didn't know whether she was morning or evening we don't know the year of Kim Jong un\nThere are reports of his word in Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five is definitely a Capricorn son we know that we just don't know the year and I think that the north Koreans\nAnd people in that part of the world they're really into astrology and things and they want to keep it a mystery\nMark telling me something with regards to astrology are we going to have a good year for the rest of this year I mean people are uptight the run happy I'm Talking about general not everybody\nI'm so glad you asked me that because right after the election of the midterm on November six which has during what we called the dark at the moon and it's an interesting day says who the heck knows what's going to happen on that day with the votes\nFor this partnered

Seventy one pounds over that amount of time I guarantee you any one of those friends three months in the hospital will lose weight but my point is that um\nI mean the America hung up on counting calories and when they hear those numbers that if you jog for an hour you lose like six hundred calories but then when you're done jogging you drink a milkshake yeah that doesn't meant lost about ... gained about three bones right\n[noise] yes I'm In you know you have to plan things out\nI Do always said I Would always say to my patients to you know if you're if you have a wedding coming up why do you plan accordingly be a little bit good ahead of time so you can you know because I think that for people it's so hard to deprive themselves or something\nTo really learning what better for you than not is very important\nAnd I think working with a physician who can help you like an empty VIP there that physicians have the time\nThe tools that technology to work with you that is one of the problems with their health care system today is in primary care you know if you go to your physician and you're talking about your blood pressure or the sinus infection that you have or your diabetes and before you know it they have their hand on their door knob because you've had your eight minutes\nAnd they're running out and this is a long conversation this is a serious conversation\nI mean you talked before about sort of a stigma you know obesity has been named the disease by American Medical association and all of the Medical Association so it's just the same as having diabetes or heart disease and in fact sure obesity leads to both of those things and\nIf you could just have America it lose the weight to stay healthy we would decrease like two thirds of cardiovascular deaths and all the complications a lot of the complications from diabetes I mean there's so much and and decrease the rates of cancer because obesity leads\nTo cancer diabetes and heart disease\nAnd I know oh the body type a studies there are the relatively new and how does one uh try to find out who do they go to work with a possibly their primary care physician beginning start on learning\nHow to find out your particular body type\nRight yes I mean working with your primary care physician I'm an empty there he we also have a body composition analysis scale so that you find out what your Faisal metabolic rate is so in other words if I sat\nOn my rear for twenty four hours how many calories what I burn off just breathing in living\nAnd you know some people say they have a slow metabolism yet that number will show than they do not but you can then work with your position to say this is how much I burn off but let's be scientific about it though if I Want to lose weight I Need to take it a little bit less in calories\nAnd exercise a little bit and all of that will help you get to your goal\nInteresting ... ah and ah I I don't like to you to uh put the the light on myself much but I Know there seems to be a higher incidence of women and so I really problems over the last twenty five years and my own wrong on that\nYou are not in fact\nA women always have had higher thyroid disease ... or more commonly have thyroid disease than men with a lot of the independent type of things women can have it more often than men um I think there is because the blood test for identifying thyroid disease have gotten better over the last Twenty years\nThat's likely why we hear more of it because physicians believe\nThe testing now to say we know this is accurate and I can't follow it so that I can determine if you truly have a thyroid problem\nOr if you do not I mean the one on one biggest we're glad\nWhen I'm really afraid of in the future I see too many fat kids and I believe that we're going to start seeing the average age of death start going back down because there's no way when you are\nNine years old and a hundred pounds that you are going to have a long and healthy life and my ...\nNot at all because in fact life expectancy has started going down in the United states\nThey are totally karate this morning about exactly that\nYes yeah so I mean I Know that when I was in medical school which was a very long time ago um we learned about senile diabetes most people got type two diabetes when they were in their seventies and eighties and that's why they call it that\nI have taken care of people who are you a couple of who's in their twenties would type two diabetes and to your point diagnosed there ten year old with type two diabetes and it was all weight related I'm genetic related to type ... diabetes tends to run in families but\nIf you keep yourself healthy in at a let's say fighting weight then you can push off that incidents that starting of diabetes for years\nAnd we know that sugar and what is it also\nI mean carbohydrate and sugar will will stress the system more so that you will use more insulin to bring the sugars down and you know yes you'll end

church and we ended up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere a one quick thing I mean you do have that amazing talent because\nI look at myself as a guy I have not spent my life studying the Bible um I read it now more than I ever have and you you have made this a part of your life study\nYes I just when I I really wasn't a believer when I was a young adult and I\nKnow your car jumbled jerk like\nMe [laughter] yeah like Brett Kavanaugh at a\n... like a like a rock Obama was part of the two gangs smoking pot and we'd and yeah and drink in excess yeah\nThere you go in and so I just I was always a seeker and I kept\nLooking for answers and and and finally I found the answers that that uh I thought were intellectual obstacles and I don't really think they were ultimately but there are intellectual answers reasonable answers and we can give reasonable answers to why we believe and were encouraged by\nUh the Bible Peter that tells us that always be prepared to give the reader that you believe\nAnd there are rational reasons to believe in fate is beyond reason of course but it's consistent with raising so I wanted to share with the game you can make this quick quick I I got on fire for the Bible in theology so I've been reading it\nPretty heavy on and off for Twenty years and I have a passion to share what I've learned and helped people accelerate their learning curve reduce their or intimidation about scripture so there'll be inspired to read it so these look these Christian themed books I writer encouraged are designed to encourage people to get in the Bible themselves\nWell it's worked for me although I have a long way to go obviously anybody that knows me knows that and by the way so does Greg Jared I'm just saying Greg or you're right on target a Jesus has risen Paul and the early church on Hannity dot com Amazon dot com we've got Lindsey Graham coming up straight ahead\nIf we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case um was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen\nAnd then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker well the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mrs Ramirez was\nCalling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't short short herself civil was Brett Kavanaugh so that should go away and\nThis one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News anymore if they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate the stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nOr even the Democrats um declined to fully embrace the Julie sweat mix story\nBut on the original story the Christine for a story I think what we're going to find and what we're already finding is that the people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like Peter Smith and mark judge amazingly enough\nThey're telling the FBI the same thing I told your district committee which they have no memory at home or to support this\nNow I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections or you're not remember\nA Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big deal of this party entry into Brett Kavanaugh calendar July first Nineteen eighty two thirty six years in three months ago by the way\nI'm listening who is that the party and it didn't match up with a with Christine forks account of this but they thought this was a big deal so let's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that that I think there are three additional people calm Bernie and squeeze\nA who had not been interviewed earlier a and I think you're going to find three or people who don't know anything about\nA Christine towards a allegations so uh I listen I I I don't think this FBI thing FBI investigation is a bad thing I think that they will find out that there is no evidence to support this did find out actual real evidence to support it than I change my mind\nBut I don't think it's there well\nDo you go through I thought it was really devastating new report by Rachel Mitchell um now he's the independent prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes and she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be\nExtremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so they brought in an independent prosecutor to\nTo question professor Ford who showed incredible respect to her\nBut she pointed out to he said she said cases incredibly difficult to prove itself\nAnd then she goes on this cases even weaker than that and then she stopped to Fort identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues there was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault\nHappened I mean the dates keeps shifting back and forth dramatically actually the failure to previously identified judge Kavanaugh as the assailant\nAre inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember key details\nWho invited forward to the party how did you get to the party where did the party even take place how did you get home from the party um and and it goes on from there but every case is similar in as much as there's no collaboration there are a big holes in the stories\nAnd at some point when do we ask is this becoming a witch hunt we know that Deborah Katz says her friends sending out emails\nAnd she's a woman that went after Paula Jones and supported Al Franken so she's not exactly consistent on the issue of of sexual misconduct and they're sending out letters here so and so do you know anything please call us and we'll do those letters went out\nI Know please some core operation you know the ... case right here at times they said they call they talked to dozens of people not to me that says twenty four people or more I mean that is a lot\nOf people to look at it on on the Rachel ritual thing you know she was a lot of criticism for her and um I think that the the way she approached it was not a really good way given the limitations of a Senate hearing where they always did she had to be interrupted every ... minutes but she did\n... I was looking today at her questioning of a Ford about her therapist and the therapist notes and the way we even know about this because remember\nFord says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty thirty six years to two thousand twelve and she ... she says she's in marriage there with her husband and she tells\nThe therapist about that and she later also tells an individual therapist about that as well and she checks the therapists notes and the therapists notes do not mention the name ...\nTherapists notes and therapists notes do not mention the name Brett Kavanaugh and she says as a matter of fact it's only her husband remembering that after session she brought up Brett Kavanaugh's name\nThat you're the only evidence that it took place in the therapy sessions and by the way you would think such therapy sessions and the ... would be confidential but of course gave them to the Washington Post so there's probably no longer\nA confidential so even even her account of how she finally mentioned it to someone after thirty six years raises a lot of questions\nIt really is amazing now we have Judiciary Committee Democrats now they're wanting to investigate the quote ice throwing incident in college you know this is what it's\nCalled the ... that's what they say\nWell now we have the Democratic hope uh Hawaii senator the one that said the men to just shut up and sit down the aisle Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants an investigation into the ice throwing incident\nI'm at a ball game and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity about was he truthful about is drinking he said he lives here he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college and high school kids I drink too much beer\nBut they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event um nobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said that somebody I blacked out\nCorrect so they're a little bit cooler fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him\nSo here's objects question I go ahead where things are to blame yeah\nFrom an emphasis on the the sex misconduct allegations to wants to be truthful about his drinking and I think that through watching with the fact\nThat there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking although mentioned many times in his testimony that he did um in fact\nDrink today rocks harbors an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking correctly or mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr they got to let it go there thank you so much Byron York widows actors on Washington Examiner eight hundred nine four one Sean has a toll free

Kramer is checking in with us or Amy Hi how are you you're wonderful daughter ... now joined our team here on the Sean Hannity show did you give you the back number or did you call in and actually get it [laughter]\n[laughter] oh Sean I Hope you all can handle or she's little firecracker and they for taking care of her up there [laughter]\nShe's doing right we love and and I was wondering\nI appreciate you at all you you do and the teams that Sean I have to tell you something I never in my life it's better to be on the same page with Lindsey Graham and inviting him to one of our of that and actually we've done that this week um he's ... he just I mean he ... us all last week that he not\nWell I think ... ... ... you know and that's another thing well he doesn't have the temperament\nNow if you're if you're accused of gang rape and accused of sexual assault\nAnd you're innocent how was the what is the proper way to act was he supposed to be monotone\nOf guys I didn't do this or just not true I mean because as his wife is crying behind him as his daughter is saying to him pray for this woman and it ... it right innocent\nAnd the half the country and these people they don't care they don't care who they destroy in the process of accumulating power\nHonestly it doesn't matter what he would have done it wasn't going to be the right thing and I and I believe it that didn't even have to be Kavanaugh could have been anybody this is much bigger it's about than stopping the Supreme Court\nConfirmation that's what it's all about they're willing to do anything to stop it and these liberal women these he kept wearing liberal women out there speaking like they speak for all women they don't they absolutely do not end when the press in the media and the the leftist obsessed about women this um\nThis cycle we're just not going to sit back and take it we are the ones for sixty ... since the Nineteen sixties when that happened to fighting the women were the ones that don't like that Donald Trump women are the ones that are going to decide what happens in the Senate turns and we're going to be the ones that decide what happened and twenty twenty and conservative women are kind\nOf that together and we're back on all of this and say they don't speak for us and we stand with Brett Kavanaugh I mean we're not going to back down and let and let them win this absolutely no way\nWell it's going to be up to three senators probably Jeff Flake snowflake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and then it's gonna be whether or not the whether or not I booked the Senate's going to hold a vote and I think Lindsey Graham has a point\nUm we haven't really heard from Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski on the issue\nWhat is it ... the the convinces them he's not qualified for the job\nYou know the guy admits that he drank he liked to drink he drink beer still like to drink beer sometimes drink more beer that he should have drink and then people saying but he must have blacked out we know that he's a liar he's a perjure right and now they want to investigate an ice throwing incident at some game\nYou know back thirty five years ago this is how absurd this has gotten\nWell I Can't tell you what I was doing thirty six years ago but I could tell you what were the one and two days and that is we're having\nA win for Trump or first ever conference here in Washington DC it's women for America first heels on ... and women from across the country are coming together and we're going to spend three or four days together and talk about why we love this country and we're going to people that are supported the president\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh and Thursday were taken a little trip to the U.S Capitol while the others are camped out at their most conservatives are working but we're going to take a trip and visit some of the senators and let them do how we feel about it and encourage them to vote\n'em to support to confirm Kavanaugh we need to do this and I'm hoping that Mitch McConnell brings this vote on Thursday it we're having our first event Thursday night and it would be great to be able to celebrate the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh um women for Trump at our complex\nSo I Want to see what happens we'll know a lot more by the end of the week we may even no I'm I'm hearing rumors that the FBI may be very close to finishing their report\nAnd when that happens maybe it'll happen for tonight when that gets an ounce will senators will get to read it and then the cloture vote will be called and we'll have an up or down vote we'll see where people come down on this\nShouldn't be that difficult to read the FBI doesn't reach conclusions they don't make recommendations they just save interviewed person a B C D E F G and but in every case there's no corroboration in every single case\nThey have actual cases inconsistencies and every single case is very problematic and all I'm saying is is if this is successful we will never ever get good people ever in this kind of ... like do want to do anything\nPublicly why should they\nSean I completely agree it's a political ... job and we need to stand up and make sure Republicans\nDo the right thing and confirmed hand so classy Lindsey Graham staying with us with the president and fight back for a change instead of playing on the terms that the Democrats said so and I hope that they keep up this fight and confirm Kavanaugh weekend anybody that's out there that wants to join us this weekend we'd love to have\nThem and that just keep up the fight\nAll right

not drug ... that was the original alec drug gang girls and gang train raping girls\nWell he was in the hallway but I don't know if it was him he was there but I don't know it was near the punch bowl whatever you call the bowl this is so serious you don't make allegations that somebody is a gang rapist and that what goes on almost every weekend\nYou know and she went to ten of those parties\nAnd that she was aware of but she didn't realize that the time why the boys were lined up in the halls waiting their turn to gang rape the girls that they had drugged this is what Democrats want to investigate it\nAnd she gave an interview and in the interview she gave multiple statements that were inconsistent with the statement she put out last week and was backtracking from her original statement probably because it's so problematic you know you call somebody remember we use the classic example\nYou know when did you stop beating your wife when did you stop being a gang rape is\nYou know they're trying to put the burden of proof on a judge Kavanaugh they've concluded he's guilty just by accusation and these stories doesn't matter there's no corroboration these Democrats will

in federal is ten by man is\nNow I Know for most audiences they're going to run away and do something else but not my audience I Know why\nYou're here because you're smart you love your country\nAnd the facts and I'm Talking about we're up against this force ladies and gentleman you and I reviewed this country we revere our declaration we revere our constitution we revere individual liberty we revere capitalism and private property rights\nWe revere individual liberty we revere capitalism and private property rights we revere our national sovereignty and our culture just as the people who founded this country did and they are under attack relentlessly as are we\nWe're mocked were accused of things we are not we are hated we're at loggerheads in this country\nBy a group of people who do want to fundamentally transform it and those of us who do not\nWe don't mind changing your individual life even change the generic in society but by change what this other force means is tyranny decentralization\nControl power that's not change that's totalitarianism\n\nAnd then when these men these white men sat down\nTo write the constitution the United states they wrote the constitution to protect all the people\n\nThe constitution despite what you heard does not promote slavery\n\nIt controls government the bill of rights\nAdopted by the first Congress ratified by the states is not a word in there about slavery there's not a word in there about race it's all about the individual being protected against the central government\n\nI don't have enough time to get into federal is ten right now but I Will after the bottom of the hour these are very daunting and bleak times and I don't think even so called conservatives in the media fully comprehend this\n\nBecause we're getting the same kind of reporting and media day in and day a day in and day out and the American people aren't learning anything the American people aren't hearing anything\n\nWe need to remind our neighbors our co workers are friends and our family that these documents belong to them they belong to them not to the people who seek the rule is\nThey don't belong to these various left wing causes they don't belong to women to the exclusion of men they don't belong to white people to the exclusion of black people they belong to all of\nUs were caught in this\nThis radical progressive state is vortex where

originate\nNot less in Super Bowl obstacle to uniformity of interests protection of these faculties is the first object the government\nFrom the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results and from the influence of leaves on the sentiments in views of the respected proprietors\nInsures a division of society and the different interest in parties\nNow he goes on you can see how brilliant these men are now what is he getting it he says this is the nature of man needs factions\nThese passions\nThis is the nature of man the late in causes a faction or that's shown in the nature of man\nAnd we see them everywhere wrote into different degrees of activity\nAccording to the different circumstances of civil society ... for different opinions concerning religion concerning government many other points as well as of speculation as a practice and attachment to different leaders ambitious league contending for preeminence and power\nWhat a person's of other descriptions whose fortunes\nHad been interesting to the human passions haven't turn divided mankind into parties like political parties\nInflamed them with mutual animosity and rendered that much more disposed of vets and all press each other and to cooperate for the common good so strong as this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosity\nThat where no substantial okay some presents itself\nThe most frivolous and fans of all distinctions had been sufficient to candles or unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts\nBut the most common and durable source of factions has been the various an unequal distribution of property those who hold and those who are without property have reform distinct interest in society those who are creditors those who are debtors\nFall under I liked discrimination and landed interest a manufacturing entrance I mercantile interest say money to interest but many lesser interest grow up of necessity in civilized nations and divide them into different classes actually hit by different sentiments in views\nThe regulation of these various and interfering interest forms the principal task modern legislation involves the spirit a party infection the necessary in ordinary operations of the government no man is allowed to be a judge in his own case and he goes on\n\nNow what is the solution as are now move on from federal is ten what is the solution\nThey say if there is a solution\nIt is Republican is that the cancer is democracy and the pure the worst because that leads to mammography and anarchy and ultimately\nAutocracy\nAnd so you see ladies and gentlemen defending the constitution they explain what they've done in order to present this faction which they viewed as a cancer\nWe've created divided government\nA divided federal government and the federal government would divided powers and with the state's the federal government with specific to numerous powers and all the other governing powers left to the states why\nWhy because you have a diverse people he diverse geography he diverse pre colonial history and diverse populations\nAnd the way you bring them together is to not may I say molest their diversity that is attack their diversity it's to celebrate it and you celebrate it by\nCreating this this national identity and yet by controlling it\nChecks and balance with a new more rated powers by controlling the factions and how do you control the factions you heard Madison well you don't destroy liberty\n\nYou create a government that is not a government based on pure democracy you see the founders of this country feared little D democracy as much as they feared monarchy because neither respects the individual\nNeither respects on Alan ... writes\nGovernment is a necessity but it's not the priority individual liberties so they created this this brilliant document this constitution\nTo protect each and every one of these imperfect men as all men are all human beings created the greatest governing document mankind is every now\nAnd then we have this force it's opposite force that is literally destroying the greatest document mankind is ever know\nThe greatest governing system mankind is that right now a governing system that is set up to control itself let me repeat that a governing system that is set up the control itself with checks and balances\nSpecific powers authority left to the states and the people\nAnd yet we have this force imported from Germany\nThey call themselves progressive all too radical movements call themselves something they are not the People's Republic the people's revolution the progressive movement there none of these things\nThey all overlap and what gets into their way is the limitations that are placed on them through our constitution\n\nIs that are placed on them through our constitution\nOur constitution as they held a lot of barriers if you're of a different mindset\nHagel Marx Engels Russo their modern day progeny Bernie Sanders in his ilk the constitution as a problem\nThe constitution needs to be destroyed while you claim to be supporting it it needs to be destroyed\n\nThis is why they talk about precedent and they never talk about the text of the original meaning of the constitution this is why they trashed the authors of the constitution\nAnd this is why we have a we have today\nAnd this is a battle that is much bigger than Brett Kavanaugh he is the latest casualty and he is a casualty and I feel very bad for him and his family what's taking place here is a national disgrace\nAnd yet and yet\nThis force has revealed itself it's revealed itself and the media it's revealed itself and academia it's revealed itself in Congress\nAnd its rebuild itself and Hollywood these are totalitarian objectives\nSuch as a totalitarian mindset that you're saying due process has thrown out the window presumption of innocence thrown out the window no evidence no witnesses no cooperation is necessary\nHang politically hang them\nWhereas I've been saying from that alliance\nLike the Roman Colosseum and we're losing this fight\nThey've destroyed much of the constitution we go through the motions courts go through the motions members of Congress swear to uphold but in many respects we go
