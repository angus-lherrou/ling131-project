the eleventh of August and just today I unloaded a forty thousand word Thirteen article\nA wave I called the suit me to catch up on everything is so much going on also I was traveling I I was traveling into the deep red state of Arkansas uh-huh to do the arc lent is\nConvention and also on the way a ... I met a lot of really beautiful people from Arkansas and it always strikes me as somebody who is\nA free wing neither blue or red in my in my tribal political identity that seems to be polarizing the country as your report said\nWhere's than ever before um but when I actually go out on my blue range into the red range of Americans I meet really decent beautiful people\nWho and I listen to them and I can see so much potential if people would just stop listening to this ratings the rating the horrors of of a mainstream news\nAnd just talk to each other\nAnd they don't talk anymore John ... nobody touch screen they argue\nBut I've actually found the people in the red states more willing to talk than I Do the people around me who call themselves progressive [noise]\nAnd I live in the deep blue western Washington part of what Washington state and uh it's uh it's intriguing to me because of the thing that I did back in January of this year I I put together a\nA this forecast which is the main essay at the end of ten predictions twenty eight team that you just mentioned\nAnd uh I was just reading it again after many months and I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put it is a that\nWas basically is happening\nIs a\nA level of if you're gonna defined it in planets there's two major planets and astrology and political strategy their plate right now\nIs a is you're honest and just recently come into tours\nAnd then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn is centered long story short it's a struggle you're honest finds itself in the tour in fine which means it's dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations whereas\nThe the earth the sign of Capricorn Saturn is is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and ...\nOne of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and so you have a long story short it's it it favors the establishment more than it favors those who are resisting the establishment\nUm because you run us into horses in its fall and it's in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in the least comfortable sign\nThat it's translating through now last time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into tourists it did two major changes in political astrology it brought the German Third Reich into being under adult Hitler [noise]\nAnd it also uh aged\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt new deal to destabilize established a banking ideas and things that were restructured that in in a positive sense created a this this longest a profitable wealth a period of history\nUh that happened because of the reforms of the banks those reforms have slowly been shipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms than Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same kind of demographics of the of the separation between the few wealthy and the\nMajority who have not so much wealth\nIt's almost exactly where it was in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash\nAnd so we are repeating a cycle and uh so the the issue is there you're honest if ever I saw something that expresses itself in in your honest in the fall the revolutionary the innovator the person with the original thinking\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to the curtain situation the White House and it is a it is expressing itself with great passion\nAnd unpredictability but its negative it's about destroying from getting the house back\nGetting sent back but for what\nIt's not really defining itself is what we know what the resistance is against when I hear it all every day here because I live in the very heart of it here but but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if and if you follow this pattern with much more energy to it than it happened before 'cause I remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said\nNope ah Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six I was on a show in Portland [noise] five hundred thousand Oregonians watched it in the man who had a meltdown said you're absolutely crazy that can't happen and of course four years later I said well no it will happen because if you're ... anybody but bill\nClinton you're you're you're you're fundamentally a you don't have anything to replace him except your one term down and then one and it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before\nAt least at least and and it's being I mean it's being the people of this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media news that it's really quite\nThis classic um Iran is confusion and it's fallen Taurus you know where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud or something it's a muddy place a swamp the muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays similarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come and save you from your cells\nAnd you know I have been how long long time first with art and then with the huge orange I've been\nTalking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it is really a hand now it's um\nIt's not going to be when I look at when I look at the um situation on the sixth of November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where you are on us as going retrograde its back going backwards and in the sky which means that it's a time to recollect where you've been and go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving tourists around or just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day and starts backtracking into aries now what that means is that if\nIf red voters red American voters go to the polls early especially in a lot of the areas which\nWill be in early times on hold on for a second John already at the break we'll come back and we'll talk more about this will get into some of his top ten forecast for this year she how close he's coming and uh also march twenty third you're living in Everett, Washington\nJust circle that date for two thousand Nineteen will tell you about that later to [noise]\nWhat's the website again home advisor dot com or just download the bring home advisor\n\nBecause I Am on news talk radio Katie WN and Katie Jay [noise]\n\nBy the way I view swimming visor dot com for some home projects and they are really good you just put in what you're looking for and you get a number of different than yours and names and uh they're all qualified picked the one you want a superb workers about John Hope with us\nAs we talk about prophecy predictions John we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen productions how many have come true already\nWell uh there have been a number I'm the more the most shocking been my my eighth prophecy what I did is it's basically short a chapters that takes a theme and then looks at it fully and\nWant to give us some headlines of some of the ten real quick\nWell yes they they were the the definition of the year being the year of acceleration\nDefinitely things have intensified that way second prophecy was or you're honest in the last chance sec style that looked at a play between you're honest in Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together and have more common ground but\nThat petered out by may ... and that seemed to happen in a way where there was also the third prophecy will Trump be impeached\nOr not in twenty eight team and it looks like that's definitely happening [noise]\nAh I've always said that both candidates and twenty sixteen were afflicted a astrological we both had the danger if not or if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means leave office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this\nBut that they could leave in scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January [noise]\nSo uh it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before that the first half of the day goes to the red states and the red voters they get out early they voted early\nIndeed it's really going to probably be decided in a week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots\nBut there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house of representatives\nWill uh see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon so it'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west\nThat uh might see at the eleventh hour or close to the polls are turned around so with that um you know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I Would simply say about President Trump that\nIf he survives this um these two years he will I still see has the potential to be a two term president ...\nWhat's what's so hard for the polarized people in my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other and I'm just quietly watching this and\nTry and taking notes yeah taking notes and it's like I mean literally as some of our family members and other things are getting quite involved and passionate about it and I'm going well [noise] um every everybody who watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in the fall and for us\nUh they're they're they're just watching the news and they're assuming that the other side is hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both sides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the the blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once\nFelt white working class Democrats that really went and voted for Trump because they've been neglected for few presidential cycles [noise]\nI Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until sixth year if he's a two term president according to my interpretation of the strategy\nThey're going to give them a chance when I talk to them and the red states I see it's very clear that they're not going to budge also the other thing that uh once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical vote I said\n... minister\nYeah I said ten months before Trump was\nElected I said the the big upset could happen through their\nUm and so it's it's my sense is that there will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving\nIt's almost like it's it's the musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes to the Democrats the same number of seats\nJust switching back and forth\nAnd in that there's not enough to create any significant legislative advance so it's it's just more and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more\nThis functional than anything we've seen before and it's almost unbearable now\nWell it's I I hate to say it to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not the end of this this this crisis that's going this evolutionary challenge that's happening to the United states and the world\nIs just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually think of a way to get out of the urgency it's going to have to get much worse and frankly astrology a saying that\nThey're not going to see a a tide shift until the middle of the next decade we're\nWe're we're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this prevail\nYet we're not even close it's going to get much worse in what's going to happen which kind of brings me to the issue of Kavanaugh and all this bull fighting about that\nKind of brings me to the issue of Kavanaugh in all the small fighting about that [noise]\nIs it I said very clearly in my back in August eleventh in my article send that Kevin I Would be picked\nThat um [noise] I I think people were stabbed washed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not saying they should be looking at according to their needs\nIf you look a cabin on the stars and what he's done his record I don't think there'll be way it has\nAny danger any of the social issues are going to be upset by this Supreme Court no I don't think so a lot\nBut I tell you these this time with the Iran is and Saturn the defining planet so next year and into twenty twenty\nThese these planets the way they're positioning way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two major corporate establishment will to power that\nYou're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote\nA hundred percent in favor of the corporations and you're going to see this creeping coup d'etat of corporate ah hedging money\nStarted with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's or sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great masses and sometimes violent citizen mass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened and so it's\nPossible that after twenty twenty the American people or or the working people people start really starting to get riled about situation or there will be basically in a completely corporate control the United states\nAnd so that's that's my call my hope I'm wrong I Wish I was more [laughter]\nA recently were on the History Channel you know the show called the last hope in the Catholic Church of course has been under fire for all kinds of atrocities Lee Lee ...\nHee huh it was um [noise] it was a unique experience and and it's put

I watched it in\nI moved slowly very very slowly so that I might not disturb the old man sleep it took me an hour and a place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed off with a madman events so wise as this\nAnd then when my head was well in the room I ended the lantern cautiously also cautiously cautiously for the hinges creek\nI ended it just so much that a single then re fell upon the vulture by\nAnd this I did for seven long nights every night just died but I found the ... always closed and so it was impossible to do the work\nFort was not the old man who ... me but his evil lie and every morning when the day broke I wouldn't boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him calling him by name and a hearty tone and inquiring how he has passed the night\nSo you see he would have been a very profound old man indeed to suspect that every night just at twelve I looked in upon him wildly slapped\nA ... night I was more than usually cautious and opening the door of watches minute hand moves more quickly than did mine never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers of mice aghast city I could scarcely contain my feelings of trying\nTo think that there I was opening the door and little by little and he not even to dream of my secret deeds your thoughts are fairly chuckled at the idea and perhaps he heard me for a moved on the bed suddenly as if startled\nNow you may think that I drew back but you know\nHis room was this black is pitch with a thick darkness for the shutters were close fastened through fewer robbers\nAnd so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door and I kept pushing it on steadily steadily I had my head in and was about to open that lantern when my phone's slipped upon the tin fascinating in the old man spring up in bed crying out who's there\nI kept quite still and said nothing for a whole hour I did not move a muscle and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down\nHe was still sitting up in the bed listening just as I have done night after night harkening to the death watches and the wall presently\nI heard a slight grown and I knew what was the grownup mortal terror it was not a grown the pain or of grief it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when over charged with all I knew the sound well\nMany a night just at midnight when all the world's slapped was weld up from my own ... deepening with the dreadful echo the terrorists that distracted me\nI say I knew it well I knew what the old man felt pity him although white chuckled at heart\nI knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise when he turned into bed his fears had been ever since growing upon him\nHe had been trying to fancy them cause less but could not he'd been saying to himself it is nothing but the wind in the chimney it is only a mouse crossing the floor or it is merely a cricket which has made a single Cher\nYes he had been trying to comfort himself with all these suppositions\nBut he had found all in vain all in vain because death in approaching him it's stocked with his black shadow before him and enveloped the victim and it was the more full influence of the on perceived shadow that caused him to feel although he neither ... nor heard to feel the presence of my head within the room\n\n[noise]\nThe clock is ticking toward a confirmation vote ...

so busy that I kind of dropped out for about a my last hope bulletins came the eleventh of August and just today I unloaded a forty thousand word Thirteen article\nA wave I called the ... to catch up on everything is so much going on also I was traveling I was traveling into the deep red state of Arkansas uh-huh do the arc lent is\nConvention and also on the way a ... I met a lot of really beautiful people from Arkansas\nAnd it always strikes me as somebody who is a free wing neither blue or red in my in my tribal political identity that seems to be polarizing the country as your report said\nWhere's than ever before um but when I actually go out on my blue range into the red range of Americans I meet really decent beautiful people who and I listen to them and I can see\nSo much potential if people would just stop listening to this ratings the rating horrors of of a mainstream news\nAnd just talk to each other\nAnd they don't talk anymore John that's no problem nobody touch the screen they argue\nBut I've actually found the people in the red states more willing to talk than I Do the people around me who call themselves progressive\nAnd I live in the deep blue western Washington part of what Washington state and uh it's uh it's intriguing to me because of the thing that I did back in January of this year I I put together a\nA this forecast which is the main essay at the end of ten predictions twenty eight team that you just mentioned\nAnd uh I was just reading it again after many months and I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put in is a that\nWas basically it happening\nIs a\nA level of if you're gonna defined it in planets there's two major planets and astrology political strategy their plate right now\nOne is a is you're honest and just recently come into tours and then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn is centered and long story short it's a struggle you're honest finds itself in the story in fights\nStory short it's a struggle you're honest finds itself in the story in fine which means it's dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations whereas\nThe the earth the sign of Capricorn Saturn is is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and so you have a long story short it's it it\nFavors the establishment more than it favors those who are resisting the establishment\nUm because you run us into horses in its fall\nAnd it's in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in the least\nComfortable flying that it's translating through now last time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into tourists it ... to ... major changes in political astrology it brought the German Third Reich into being under adult Hitler\nAnd it also uh aged\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt new deal to destabilize established banking ideas and things that were restructured that in in a positive sense created a this this longest a profitable wealth a period of time in history [noise]\nUh that happened because of the reforms of the banks those reforms have slowly been shipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms and Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same time demographics of the of the separation between the few wealthy and the\nMajority who have not so much wealth\nIs almost exactly where it was in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash\nSo we are repeating a cycle and uh so the the issue is there you're honest if ever I saw something that expresses itself in in your honest in the fall the revolutionary the innovator the person with the original thinking\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to\nThe current situation in the White House and and it is a it is expressing itself with great passion and unpredictability but its negative it's about destroying from getting the house that\nGetting sent back but for what\nIt's not really defining itself is what we know what the resistance is against when I hear it all every day here because I live in the very heart of it here but but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if and if you follow this pattern\nWith much more energy to it than it happened before 'cause I remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said oh a Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six I was on a show in Portland [noise]\nFive hundred thousand Oregonians watched it in the man who had a meltdown and said you're absolutely crazy that can happen and of course four years later I said well no it will happen because\nIf you're ... anybody but Bill Clinton you're you're you're you're fundamentally a you don't have anything to replace him except your one term down and then\nAnd it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before\nAt least at least and and it's being I mean it's being the people of this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media news that it is really quite\nThis classic um Iran is confusion and it's fallen Taurus you know where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud earth science it's a muddy place a sloppy muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays similarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come and save you from your cells\nAnd you know I have been how long long time first with art and then with the huge orange I've been talking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it\nIs really hand now it's um\nIt's not going to be when I look at when I look at the um situation on the sixth of November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where Iran is going retrograde its back going backwards in in the sky which means that it's time to recollect where you've been and go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving tourists around or just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day and starts backtracking into aries now what that means is that if\nIf red voters red American voters go to the polls early especially in a lot of the areas which will be in the early times\nOn hold on for a second John already at the break we'll come back and we'll talk more about this will get into some of his top ten forecast for this year she how close he's coming and uh also march twenty third you're living in Everett, Washington\nJust circle that date for two thousand Nineteen will tell you about that later to [noise]\nIt's ... am on news talk radio Katie WN and Katie

and ah they're all qualified picked the one you want but\nSuperb workers John ... with us as we talk about process see productions John we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen productions how many have come true alright\nWell uh there have been a number I'm the more the most shocking been my my eighth prophecy what I did is is basically short um chapters that takes a theme and then looks at it fully and\nWant to give us some headlines of of the ten real quick well\nYes they they were the the definition of the year ... year of acceleration\nDefinitely things have intensified that way second prophecy was a year on us in the last chance sec style that looked at a play between Iran is in Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together and have more common ground\nThat petered out by may ... and that seemed to happen in a way where there was also the third prophecy will Trump be impeached\nOr not in twenty Eighteen and it looks like that's definitely happening [noise]\nUh I've always said that both candidates and twice sixteen were afflicted a astrological we both had the danger if not or if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means leave office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this\nBut that they could leave in scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January [noise]\nSo uh it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before that the first half the day goes to the red states and the red voters they get out early vote early\nIndeed is really going to probably be decided in a week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots\nBut there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house of representatives will uh see\nA surge towards the blue in the afternoon\nSo it'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west that uh might see at the eleventh hour or close to the polls a turnaround so with that um you know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I Would simply say about President Trump that\nIf he survives this um these two years he will I still see has the potential to be a two term president\nWhat's what's so hard for the polarized people in my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other up is quietly watching this and try and taking notes\nYeah taking notes and it's like I mean literally is a large family members and other things are getting quite involved and passionate about it and I'm going well [noise] um every everybody watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in the fall and tourists\nUh they're they're they're just watching the news and they're assuming that the other side is hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both sides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the the blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt white working class Democrats that really went and voted for Trump because they've been neglected for few presidential cycles [noise]\nI Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until sixth year if he's a two term president according to my interpretation of the strategy they're going to give them a chance when I talk to them and the red states I see it's very clear that they're not going to budge\nAlso the other thing that uh once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical vote I said\n... ...\nYeah I said ten months before Trump was\nElected I said the the big upset could happen through their\nUm and so it's it's my sense is that there will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving\nIt's almost like it's it's a musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes for the Democrats at the same number of seats\nJust switching back and forth\nAnd in that there's not enough to create any significant legislative advance so it's it's just more and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more\nThis functional than anything we've seen before in it's almost unbearable now\nWell it's I I hate to say to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not the end of this this this crisis it's going this evolutionary challenge that's happening to the United states\nAnd the world is just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually think of a way to get out of this large and say it's going to have to get much worse and frankly it's Stalin Gees are saying that\nYou're not going to see it a tide shift until the middle of the next decade\nSaying that you're not going to see it a tide shift until the middle of the next decade we're we're\nWe're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this prevail yet we're not even close it's going to get much worse in what's going to happen was kind of brings me to the issue of Kavanaugh in all this all the fighting about that [noise]\nIs it I said very clearly in my back in August eleventh my articles than that Kevin I Would be picked that um [noise]\nI I think people were stabbed pushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not the thing they should be looking at according to their needs\nIf you look at cabin on the stars and what he's done his record I don't think there'll be weighed it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset by this Supreme\nCourt no I don't think so a lot\nBut I tell you these this\nTime with the Iran is and Saturn the defining planet so next year and into twenty twenty\nThese these planets the way they're positioning the way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two major corporate establishment will to power that\nYou're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote a hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see this creeping coup d'etat of corporate ah hedging money which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's or sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great masses and sometimes violent citizen\nMass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened\nAnd so it's possible that after twenty twenty the American people or or the working people people start really starting to get riled about situation or there will be basically in a completely corporate Lee control the United states\nAnd so that's that's my call my hope I'm wrong I Wish I was more [laughter]\nA recently were on the History Channel reality show called the last hope in the Catholic Church of course has been under fire for all kinds of atrocities leading ...\nYeah oh it was um [noise] it was a unique experience and and it's put me in a position that\nThat show uh I mean to draft are kind of talk about something that happened and it's a [noise] for my own sake of credibility I I'm Sorry I even have to say it but I'm the show [noise] ah\nTook you're talking about the last poll that yeah\nYeah the the the the show basically circled in the second hour around

interest or something like this you know leaking and letters and so forth no first of all you'd have to prove it so far they haven't proven in although we all know sheer somebody associated with her did it but that's not good enough\nSecondly I assume you would need a majority of the Senate you're not going to get the Three Stooges Sobhy a sideshow\nAnd ah my my next question would be if you could give us a sort of a thumbnail sketch of what a what happened with faith Forman a Supreme Court I mean as far as voting for now ... around with orange for person sorry\nWell if they vote for to for that means the holding in the circuit court below stands\nOkay\nAnd and there's there's there's no such thing as a recess appointment for Supreme Court now there could be is that what I mean that would\nGood to have a recess appointment for court wouldn't last very long which is why they don't do it oh you do is you get a certain senators including Republican senators angry but or you could do it\nA certain senators including Republican senators angry but or you could do it but the goal here is a lifetime appointment not an appointment for a year or two\nThat just you know hopefully something that would be a phone in their side we need to when you listen we need to we need we need\nTo stop acting like losers and be on the defensive and we need to ram this through don't worry about recess appointments and ... and all the rest\nThese people need to be crushed\nAnd so if you really want to do something you call one of the Three Stooges are you'd be polite to them and civil
