Vietnam no no for Fifteen Years he said he was a war hero he fought in Da Nang province we call him\nDon King Richard downing that's his ... he never went to Vietnam and he's up there saying we need honesty and we need integrity this guy live when he was the attorney general's Connecticut He lived I don't\nThen when he got out he actually dropped out of the race and they want anyway because Democrats are always went in Connecticut but he has a guideline and now he's up there talking like he's holier than thou you know what take a look at his record and want to get out\nAnd we apologize he was crying to tears were all over the place and now he acts like how dare you\nAren't that Donald Trump finally calling out on a minor scale Blumenthal liar\nOr which is a good start but they've he's got to get much much more aggressive so I've asked you if you have any allegations that you feel are found and in some way and reality about any of the other a Soviet era accusers on the committee\nEight five five or seven to eight to as a place for you to go let America and the American people decide whether these allegations are true or false you say well you're engaging in what what am I engaging anything different than what they're doing to the cabinet or no I just got this email from someone whose name I Will not read\nAnd he writes and he lives in San Francisco knows fines thing he said the speculation that judge Kavanaugh did something inappropriate in high school when he was a minor\nPlease have your listeners recall that Feinstein fully supported a president who as an adult lied under oath had his law license revoked at oral sex with the young intern in the oval office and was accused of rape or sexual misconduct by at least for women\nFeinstein also supported a U.S senator who has an adult drowned the young lady and a drunken stupor and then failed to report the incident for ten hours this is the holier than thou fines thing the crucial fire and then he throws a real bombshell out there which I didn't know anything about\nFinally on ms finds things ability to forgive or give a second chance please remember that her son in law Rick Mariano the father of her only grandchild was a heroin addict as an adult I'm told that her daughter Catherine met him when he wasn't a glance history program now I Can't confirm any of these statements\nI Can't deny any of these statements but I Believe that America is now looking very carefully at the accusers of Kavanaugh and saying hey wait a minute now you're bringing up women who are making stuff up\nAs we can see this is just a a scandalous hit piece on this man and so therefore let's see if any of this stuff is real I don't know I have no way to confirm or deny any of these things but we're going to keep going until eventually we're off the air\nOkay it's that simple\nAnd will be off they believe me I Will be off the air you know many of you are listening to me on some youth stations you'll not hear me in January you don't know why it's all political you'll hear other reasons but it's not no other reason it's all political and I'll tell you more about that come January but right now will continue with what we're doing on the Savage Nation let's not get ahead of ourselves\nWhat else do you have on who now I don't know if we should even run some of these because I don't know whether they're here or there but let's go to Yvonne ... von what's your point\nYou might find is that I Know lots of the female him down and the fact that he was headed for the supervisor in San Francisco and the half shell game how it goes by making the head of housing authority\nAnd so he was able to give its members are houses and then have them to vote for who said vote for\nAnd that he also was that happened was he left San Francisco that guy the guy at it the half\nOf them don't get the welfare checks from farther members that went over there with him\nBut she helped make sure the welfare checks went to the auto where he moved to people in the Jim Jones cult\nYes over that they they always get in their tests over that you\nKnow that's interesting and all for the patronage and the support well is there any more to this because I'm coming back to this lady from Oakland in a minute on the Savage Nation joy those Savage Nation coal no eight by four hundred seven eight bucks for a number seven to eight to [noise]\n\nSome [noise]\nThis story is called the ugly truth about timeshare rethink you've done your family a favor by buying a timeshare you name my help hello I'm ... now CEO and founder of Wesley financial group ten years ago I started helping votes cancel their timeshare contracts and then the process started what's now called\nThe Tom shirt cancellation industry Tom shares the only thing that you can buy that you can't tell me how much is going to cost or whether it's going to end when you my timeshare you give them a blank check to fill out any amount they want for annual maintenance and assessment phase sound crazy\nThe crazy thing is this never ends\nEven when you die your family is now going to be stuck with this burden stop the insanity to de calm office now I guarantee if we can't answer your time to contract you'll pay nothing\nThese are the tactics of the Nazis in Germany and the Soviets in Russia\nI used to think we're a nation of laws and that with defamation libel laws you couldn't get away with this but then I woke up and found out that the senators are above the law movies have been done about them\nBooks have been written about this kind of corruption remember I wrote a novel called abuse of power set in San Francisco it was a New York times best seller you wouldn't know it would you scold abusive power jak Hatfield was my character\nSo this is an old story kind of information and smear campaign and what's ironic here is that the left which was belly aching for forty years about McCarthyism and McCarthy on now actually worse than senator McCarthy ever was at its height\nBecause as I pointed out and stop mass hysteria McCarthy was actually right when he accused all of those members of Hollywood and of the media\nAnd of academia of working with the Soviet Union he was denounced as a crackpot even though he had been a war hero they made a mockery of them show you how smart the left is they took senator McCarthy who had been a tail gunner in World War two one of the most dangerous of all positions\nThink of it a glass bubble in the back of a bummer with machine guns facing enemy fighters he survived all that came out a war hero became a U.S senator the vermin on the left called them tail gunner Joe as if that was something to mock rather than salute but that was just the beginning\nThey said he was a drunk they said he made it all up well they destroyed the man he died a hopelessly broken man\nWhat they did to McCarthy is what they're doing to Kavanaugh and then you want to get in a way of the left wing failings that has destroyed America over the last fifty years now we had an election\nAnd we put Donald Trump in power we stopped there juggernaut\nAnd they're fighting to turn it around with every one of his major appointments make no mistake about it this is really a mandate on you I've said this you'll be four\nBy smearing cabin or their smearing you you could be a black transsexual woman in Berkeley and you're being smeared if you voted for Trump do you understand that you understand how this works do you understand the smearing you by smearing him\nAnd it's just the beginning and so the only thing we can do is fight back and again I say with the keyboard and a little native intelligence you could probably uncover things about the senators that might just have them running back onto the rocks that they crawled out of the sewers that they live in\nBecause the Internet as a very powerful tool there's a lot of lives on it\nBut somewhere in the midst of the lives there may be some nuggets of gold and I invite you to listen to become the detectives to turn on the committee members who have done this to a decent man I have never in my life seen anything like this never but again getting back to what McCarthy\nAnd the McCarthyism that the left you still want us about just for a moment\n... years later there was a publication and titled of an owner papers of E. E. N. O. N. A. I wrote about it in one of my previous books\nAnd even though the papers were written by former KGB agents and they disclose that in fact all of the people named in the committees and the hearings in the fifties by McCarthy Warren fact Soviet\nOperatives or Soviet fellow travelers every last one of them was guilty and so here we are now watching the equivalent of the quote McCarthyism were warned about\nTaking place right in front of our eyes and hardly one journalist in the United states of America makes the connection it's a very very sad day but the truth shell went out and I do ask you on Tuesday to vote with your credit card\nAnd please get a copy of stop mass hysteria but not just get the book to enrich me because I'm not going to buy a new car I'm asking you to carry it home\nAnd put it on your coffee table because I guarantee you there's someone in your family who doesn't believe a word that you say\nSomeone who was ignorant as a door post who knows nothing about history\nWho knows nothing about how the witch trials of Salem are identical to the witch trials of Kavanaugh but they are it's based on the same methods of mass hypnosis and mass hysteria that's just one example there are numerous numerous others and I invite you to take home this ... of information\nIt's not just a polemic it's a history book\nEight five five four hundred seven to eight to let's see some of the callers if I can they're run them a I'm a little afraid of this one ... WABC what's your statement Rick\nHi Michael yes they do to curb illegal immigrant so outrage over allegations from thirty six years ago yes yes no no knowledge about her father worked for the next train here with the opposite sex trafficking\nRemember and what what what what what ... where are you getting this allegation that her father worked in a sex cult\nOut of New York newspapers without a\nWhile but you're saying these ... only rumors about senator Gillibrand's father\nAh that was pretty much documented several other source [noise] really finding the right but I didn't know that that's what they were\n... I don't know anything about it but I'm sure she forgave her father for that but she wants to give a cabin or for having too many beers in high school how does that work\nYeah maybe her father to an FBI investigation and see what\nI think so I think that maybe there's some FBI investigation that should be done of every senator on the committee was become a new a new a new which hunter\nI wasn't invited an FBI investigation of Blumenthal not just about his Vietnam record\nBut about his finances why should we look into why should we not look into a senator who's forces have grown tenor fifty fold since they came into office why is that not fair play\nFair game rather for investigation I think it's long overdue for an FBI investigations of every senator on that committee whose falsely accused Kavanaugh and see if we can find out how their fortunes have grown so greatly er during the tenure in office how did that happen\n[noise] absolutely if the if only the mass media would participate in that Michael [noise]\nWell I'm participating in a while I still can't I'm sending you a copy of stop mass hysteria which arrive in a day or two this is the Savage Nation will be back in a minute\nDrawing the Savage Nation coal no eight by five four hundred Savage eight by four hundred seven to eight to salvage\nThe Savage Nation is sponsored by Swiss America the only company I trust with my financial future recall eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or Swiss America dot com here's the truth about\nHome security companies well they're like dealing with another bad you know old fashioned cable company you're going to spend hours waiting around for technicians hours on the phone to\nOld fashioned cable company you're going to spend hours waiting around for technicians hours on the phone to get questions answered and then when that you're a breaking point you remember I'm locked in a three year contract with these people that look if you're looking to protect your home go with simply safe home security why\nSimply safe as real comprehensive protection beautifully designed looks good on your home using and make your home is actually much safer\nSimply said has backups in place to keep you safe protecting your home even if you lose power into that or someone attacks the system best of all you got twenty four seven monitoring with police and fire dispatch for just Fifteen dollars a month\nAnd unlike other home security companies simply safe has no long term contract it's the best around the clock protection you could find that the best price get free shipping and free returns at simply save Savage dot com now go to simply safe\nSavage dot com\nDebate was so tempting free trip gifts then you got hooked by the sales pitch bought that time share and you've regretted it ever since the\nLate eighties catch increasing and we just didn't want to deal with it in on\nIt was not anything line they showed as many as I can timeshare time shares aren't a day at the lake there all catch and release unless you talked to resort to release we can release you from that time share legally and permanently a plus raided by the BBC a one hundred percent money back guarantee in our clients five star reviews tell the story they\nTry to start with the Clinton delivered on that wonderful\nBe the one that got away call now for a free consultation eight eight eight three oh eight fifty nine fifty five eight eight eight three oh eight fifty nine fifty five or resorts release dot com very\nSatisfied with the results fat resort released achieved\nThank you very very nice they catch we release resort release eight eight eight three oh eight fifty nine fifty five eight eight eight three oh eight fifty nine fifty five or resorts release dot com call now\nDoes your basement or crawl space of a damp must be smell will watch out that's a sign of too much moisture and not enough ventilation and that could mean increased mold growth and build up a harmful toxins gases don't bother with a D humidifier it just circulates the same on healthier now\nThere's a better way to remove these dangers in odors it's with the computerized way ventilation unit that reduces moisture in expelled pollutants\nWith wave units there are no buckets of water or filters and they cost only pennies a day to run wave can transform your home into a drier healthier environment satisfaction guaranteed ask about our indoor air package that\nIncludes the wave ventilation unit plus a six stage portable air purifier dealer opportunities available for more information visit\nDry house now dot com that's dry house now dot com or coal eight eight eight nine seven nine wave that eight eight eight nine seven nine W.

Syrian author of liberalism is a muddled his orders from war dogs is Michael's [noise]\nAnd here we go into the final hour of the Savage Nation [noise] so I Believe in equality\nAnd uh I Believe that women just like men are capable of great things and evil things and that should be an obvious thing to anyone but apparently the way the narratives being played out for the Democrats as a all women up to be believed in their innocence and pure and all manner of evil so you have to destroy the patriarch\nWell again let's go back in history in ancient Rome did you know that they're women gladiators would justice bloodthirsty as male gladiators did you know that you didn't know that\nYou know any of that there were female gladiators what justice bloodthirsty as a male gladiators they love blood they love the blood sport and so that we see the gladiators in modern times sitting on a committee\nLike an ancient Rome destroying a man cutting up two ribbons in front of the public in the public sits like dummies and doesn't see the blood thirsty ness of these women are they more like Venus the goddess of love and beauty or like a Vulcan the God of fire\nNow who was Venus Venus you know that the first five planets in our solar system are named after Roman gods because Romans casino without telescope did you know that first five planets named after Roman gods to show the influence of ancient Rome\nSo Venus was the goddess of love and beauty she was the daughter of a Jupiter and the on an ocean side ... and Venus was desired as a wife by many of the guards\nAnd she was promised by Jupiter to her brother Vulcan and guess what happened on satisfied with her marriage to the ugly guard\nVenus took many lovers including our own half brother Mars the God of war with whom she got several children well okay that's nothing to do with what we're going through today but sometimes I have to look at history or science of poetry or art\nOr music to get away from the insanity of our times and that's why I'm bringing you a little history today to lighten the load of carrying the horror that as being inflicted upon the American people by the Feinstein\nGladiators core out to destroy who I think it's an ordinarily decent man now remember\nKavanaugh has gone through with background checks he was a virtual unknown federal judge nobody ever said anything about him in all these years how come all of these poor innocent women came forth all of a sudden because they're set ups every last one of them\nAnd all you have to do is look at the last one who was unfortunately

M. P. before Soviet invasion well\nNow there are books in a television program um there was remember the lone gunman or that basically talked about nine eleven how strange these things are Bobby\nI Know and it's funny he mentioned that because of course EMT has been the effect of and he um he has been known since the thirties when nuclear testing first began\nAnd into the forties and fifties as you know the British the United states and others the Russians and into the early sixties began to test atomic weaponry and in earnest\nThey realize that the uh the MPs generated and I have been covered from research and and I'm going to pursue this further that general Schwarzkopf approached I'm the first President Bush\nI about the use of an E.

Nineteen Ninety One I've got to\nJanuary Ninety One and that the President Bush declined to use it as a preemptive strike because he didn't like the optics of of delivering a nuclear warhead over Iraq

you\n[noise] question it actually got to question the dog that that they get at all it does to order I Lived in Canada [noise] ah [noise] I prefer to watch the uh uh [noise] what\nEverything's happening or can they get what they are a lot of shit our route or a ... a ...\nA ... and playing basically playing with fire but everything that happened that we feel it added that ... what they know rapper type shit [noise] ah my first question what are the rapper caution uh uh\nUh anything happening to the U.S whatever Africa in Canada and the fact that you were saying earlier odd that the shit\nThat they are not in a way that I get the economy or how good what how good paper money ...\nAnd ... ... ... they wouldn't even know I thought\nWell that's see that's that's the problem in in let's let's take the second one first\nUh for Bobby ... and that is is the power grid goes down we're really for the future up a creek because they don't have enough like transformers to replace the ones that went down and they can't get the plays wired fast enough\nAnd you're not going to be able to use ATMs or gas pumps or anything like that so that's where your thoughts Bobby about silver coming right\nWell that that's true in silver to me is just a backup plan for not being holy prepared\nI prepare for it written down scenario which could call come as a result of a solar flare a massive coronal mass ejection it could come as a result of a cyber attack or a nuclear delivered the um the\nWhen the grid goes down in the in the inner connected grid system collapses which sadly for Canada would it would include I'm much of your country because both the eastern and western interconnected grits and the United states extend into your borders\nThen we're going to be living in a society that dates back to the Eighteen hundreds of paper money will will be worthless until our country can get back on its feet and and and sort of financial affairs\nA preparation ready to live his life with the necessary is I call them being band aids and bullets\nTo sustain themselves for a for a long period of time\nAnd then if for some reason they hit forgot something in their preparedness plan or they find the need for some item that they did not store\nThen if they have pre Nineteen sixty four silver I think it's going to be the most common form of barter currency um when so society starts to rebuild\nHere's the way I like to put at Georgia in and for um Peters well\nYour world is becoming come very small after the grid goes down\nAll of a sudden yes we do have the United states but with the distance that you can walk or ride a bicycle or ride a horse is going to be the center of your universe\nAnd small communities are going to start to spring up just like they did and in the Eighteen hundreds and create local market places and the friday a you know the the farmers will bring their goods to market and\nMarketplaces and the friday a you know the the farmers will bring their goods to market and and they make trade their corn for a horse in barter will become the way of life until until our country gets back on the\nWhat if you don't have anything to barter\nWell there's always something to barter there are those who have excellent skills\nFor example or a prep or may have tens of thousands of the stored but he never taken the time to learn how to grow food\nSo he'll go to his neighbor who happens to be a ... fish and gardening and say neighbor I'll provide you this packet seeds that grow this crop if you'll agree to let me have half of it back everything\nSubject to negotiation\nPeople who may not have the proper being banned dates and bullet stored may have a skill that is necessary in the community for example a doctor would be very\nValuable y'all ... absolutely and there's other part of his question was any kind of fallout would it affect Canada stemming from the United states\nWell in this this is really interesting because again I mentioned the if the grid down scenario would extend into Canada then there's also the reverse migration issue and and this will make for an excellent a novel at some point\nImagine now we're trying to close our borders to prevent a our southern border some being infiltrated and and and the northern border as well to an extent\nNow imagine American's playing our country because of this catastrophic event try to go to Canada try to go to Mexico and those nations say no thank you we don't have room\nThat'll make for an excellent uh uh ... novel but it's also something to contemplate that if you don't have a your bears and order from a preparedness standpoint you may not be welcome\nMuch less than another country you may not be welcome in in a local community or I can envision a scenario where small town\nWill close their borders who the masses of people fleeing the societal collapsed and I are in the city\nSo I I don't know if they're going to be able to stop it Bobby that that's the thing the influx could be so huge I Can't I don't think you can stop it\nWell it it it it will certainly come up as an issue and so in impromptu town hall meetings after the third rail stuff hits the fan when the first a wave of hungry mouth show up\nAnd they say we're hungry we need food in the city leaders are ... a little small town say well sorry can't have any in that mob turns angry and find ways to break in the ... the lower lewd or do whatever they can to survive\nAll right we're going to come back and take final phone calls in just a moment on coast to

bit farther out what that means distances\nBut if we were to um the earth's were to be hit by something like that causing a phenomenon and throwing the world in turmoil um markets once again would collapse a life as we know it would be over at least for a period of time\nAnd being prepared let you ride it out um that if they feel things normalize\nRather than being a I'm a burden on your first responders and a burden on your government um you know take care of yourself rather than waiting for the FEMA truck to roll up the doors and give you a few MR reason in a case of bottled water\nNow

when he was having back problems [noise]\nListen every night since then um [noise]\nMy question to the gas is a on water storing water um\nHow long is like if you generalize a milk egg and a fellow with the tap water\nA solar with ... tap water how how long is that that water good for\nThat's a good question so when you buy store water how long can you store it\nWell first come in for obey one is is please don't use a milk to the store water they're not made for that and and you're better off taking a a formerly used water bottle the clear plastic for that purpose okay\n... when we store water it doesn't go bad but as as out of an abundance of caution you could do one of the things you could either boil the water and and once again purify it\nOr you could add some simple um couple of drops of chlorine I'm a bleach standard chlorine bleach to purify the water and there's a um a two to one rule of you know a couple of drops per gallon just to ah keep your water pure\nOver I Would if you just doing a few drops it will not poison you\nThat is correct that but one thing I mentioned it you cannot store enough water to survive a catastrophic collapse of and it's just not possible and and I I hear the femur recommendations of of one gallon of water per person is just absolutely absurd\nThat may be sufficient to keep hydrated but it will not help you at all from hygiene standpoint and and the\nUnexpected or uses of water it wherever you live or or if you if you choose to move to your book out location on a permanent basis as we did\nYou need to identify a source of water even if it's not purified whether it be a ... a lake or a stream\nIdentify those sources make sure that you have sufficient purification methods or whether it be a device like a life straw or the use of um um you know bleach or boiling and then you can store the water is necessary\nYou know it's frustrating events of our control could really screw up our way of living\nWell that's the thing I mean the end of the world as we know it or the ...\nStyle events are always going to be out of our control but survival is wholly within our control in my opinion and it's just a matter of becoming committed to living a preparedness lifestyle um follow some of the recommendations that we have an freedom ... dot com\nAnd start small I mean the biggest complaint I hear it when when speaking to people who who are new to prepping is that they can't afford it but I mean it reality you can't afford not to prep I'm simply by extra food when you go to the grocery store it if\nYou like to eat pasta by an extra few pounds of pasta each time and if you have things that you spend money on um entertainment if you go to sea star wars on friday when it opens in your you spent forty or fifty dollars you'd have to make a conscious choice\nAm I going to spend fifty dollars and go see Star Wars and have a couple of backs of popcorn or am I going to go by twenty pounds of beans and twenty pounds of rice

do they do anyway\nWell they they had a lot of people there are a lot of dignitaries their their goals from the website where that they were run into a race ambition reduce climate change and accelerate climate action\nOr some big notable Tony Blair form of a prime minister of England spoke bond Ki moon from the United nations um actor Hugh Jackman\nUh-huh well the ... man the Wolverine spoken\nAre so quite a quite a big group also a big public relations steely claim a five hundred thirty five million people were reached and three hundred news articles written\nSo a a kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would the ... and a lot of folks there I think believe that if they change light bulbs they can save polar bears\n... if we all drive electric cars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build a wind turbine towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe and George we live in a in a modern age of superstition or there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo they are definitely man made global warming proponents aren't they they are and I have never been a fan of that\nBecause you know I I think one Steven I think you agree were polluting the planet there's no question about that and we need to fix that\nThere's a real pollution we need to fix that's correct\nI don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think we're in solar cycles a I think this this planet or has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbons in the atmosphere and anything like that\nThere are at least for periods over the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist eight thousand years ago when we've been gently cooling since then although temperatures go up and they go down\nAnd ah you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were so many people are conflicting with a cold real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment\nThings like carbon monoxide nitric oxide so for a day I'm like mercury\nParticulates with carbon dioxide which is a voter lists harmless invisible gas and what I speak to groups I like to say to them what to cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that there are so many proponents for man made climate change\nWell it it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress and they it was on a very hot summer day and he said he was Ninety nine percent sure that the earth was warming in humans were causing as he was a computer model or\nAnd or within a year and a half the United nations form Intergovernmental Panel on climate change and just three years later we had forty one nations and the European Community sign a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases\nSo in my opinion the the first thing is that the world kind of jumped to a conclusion quickly on this\nBut uh you know for the last uh Thirty years or so the computer models in predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it a temperatures have warmed just a little storms are stronger the polar bears are doing fine\nAnd then the second factor though is I think a much of this as being driven forward by momentum by money\nMhm uh we have a wind and solar and biofuel industries we have dean says sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability corporations and there are over there is over two hundred fifty billion dollars a year spent every year\nOn renewables to try and stop the planet from a warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second is there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nIt's amazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days they've been talking about fears of one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nBut you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee a governor of Washington state\nJust to post an article and CNN quote how to show Trump you care about climate change and he's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer and that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well we've had that one degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years\nOne degree or yet and I think it came from the sun while I Do too\nBut that comes straight from the climate research unit at East Anglia in England the the number one authority on this one degree so so in the last decade maybe we've had a tenth of a degree in ... in Washington for us to say that all these forest fires that caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work um the way we take care of our forests are for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous miss allocation of resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved\nToday eighty percent of the world's waste water is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago in Brazil the swimmers didn't want to swimming in the water\n'em and they're just building the first water treatment plants down in Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nA a electricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease yet we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming and the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun\nIt's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things you're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that the you know the the\nTemperatures there's no question that the you know the the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change keep butting heads but I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to\nFeel the way you do that we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\n[noise] well if you again if you look at ... at any of the well any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about\nUm what was Hurricane Florence mhm and last year we had a couple of major hurricanes are we at Harvey hit Texas\nOh we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida but if you look back at history this has happened before we've had\nA twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states and these are this is really nothing new a hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century\nOther ... and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see this storms are either getting more frequent are stronger\nOr the U.S government also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more floods are more droughts we had more droughts in the Nineteen thirties we have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never show data comparing the past to the president\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book outside the green box Steve Steve's website linked up the coast to coast am dot com spell it for you first name Steve G. O. R. E. H. A. M. dot ... dot com\nGo students ... the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for I'm bone in now enjoyed for ... listen live we're on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nOne popular business a phrase use over and over his think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they're forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and are populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction uh and the fourth is a resource depletion\nThose for fears are really at the basis of all of a or state and federal laws about energy\n'em and they're taught in the universities and taught in a high schools but if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been exaggerated to a very very big extent so\nI discuss the Fort horsemen and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries or energy materials agriculture a et cetera but it's a fun to read it say a color paperback and a\nLot of ... and a lot of great quotes and also but uh uh eight hundred notes in the back so people go deeper\nBy the way for size it's a heavy blocked\n[laughter] well I don't know about that but in lots of reasons for going to put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which got to summarize as some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\nMore with climate change with what's happening I'm I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you know\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago amazed that\nCould be temporary because Saudi Arabia is talking about turning out a lot of ... additional oil production but uh we're growing very fast the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned to us into the world's energy powerhouse and the biggest producer of crude now\nI Believe in Thomas golds theory of abiotic oil that the planet is got in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs\nThe oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs in plants\nI tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have have said that for a long time but we know natural gas can be created by all sorts of things including a\nKnow camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I saw I think there's probably a combination of of something that is fossilized fuel but others others that do come up from the ... of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase the phrase fossil fuels I like to use the coming into hydrocarbons instead\n... well you know what am I simple theories on why the ... theory is the probable theory is because most of the oil that has pumped on this planet\nWay way down there oh yeah Hi Lance in dead animals get down there\nThey're finding and now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah some of these very deep wells they find oil and you've got to kind of wonder the other thing is a lot of it has been\nYou know found in the polar regions too and and uh those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but I Know we have shipped shifting to the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I I Do think it's a\nIt probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the bowels of the earth\nWhat is the argument about overpopulation and then it's a major problem for all of us yeah so\nNineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world in up in until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy you know the big reason for that was we had declining um infant mortality has declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems\nAnd so a bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nBut they didn't uh first we had a global agricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled oh by two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output\nBut the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping the fertility rate reason number of of ah children a woman will have in her lifetime and back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average was having five children during her lifetime will today that has dropped down to two and a half\nThat's a drop in half and the reason is we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological a sort of a state we have more women entering the worst workforce there waiting to have children they're having smaller families\nSo all none of this was for seen it all occurred and the great news is that uh we're probably going to get the global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years and so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nAnd to benefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles for the red cross or feeling you can't fly in a as we were driving to get to the venue I saw things that I haven't seen in years because I spend a lot of time in St Louis\nI saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in June ... strewn all over the place\nWhere his dad was in California in Los Angeles yeah I mean I'm looking at is\nHomeless people in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so that really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call wasted dumped everywhere or pollution\n[noise] uh it certainly is it it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though that if I might if I might comment the government to California keeps making housing more expensive\nYou know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand they're they're gonna want everything to have a electric car plug in\nSo he just had about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California does isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right what would you recommend that people start doing personally to combat this situation\n... people and businesses or you know actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going in the land fills\nA vet piqued about Nineteen Ninety in the United states is now starting to trend down\nWe're doing more recycling um but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we've touched on before um nitrogen oxide so for dioxide particulates et cetera are not carbon dioxide\nUm so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide is what they're pumping into greenhouses and California to make their cannabis crop grow\nA bigger and faster its its plant food\nThat's right or the idea that ah that CEO to as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these\nPictures that where you have this dirty looking air over China if you can see the error that's not causing global warming all of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gases number one is water vapor but it's the biggest greenhouse gas to as carbon dioxide three has nothing those are all invisible\nSo if you can if you can see the air you gotta clean that up but the greenhouse gases\nAre are really not causing air pollution or so we need we need to get our our uh aims that the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nSteve you talked about in upheaval coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of upheaval is this\nYeah well we've had a basically a rate payer revolt now in Australia just this last summer in Australia\nUm we had a a Scott Morris and take over as the uh the new uh ...\nMinister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out and leading the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is called for withdraw from the Paris accords\nUm the prime minister Morrison says is number one priority is to reduce power prices while we keep the lights on wait a similar thing up and Ontario by the way both Australia and Ontario electric rates have gone through the roof more than doubled at the last ten years up\nIn Ontario a premier dug for took over and within a month he had cancelled more than a hundred wind and solar a contracts they eliminated I'm a ... the fourteen thousand dollar Canadian electric car credit\nAnd now we have five provinces opposing the Canadian carbon tax that California has said so we got to rate of pay revolts going on in California says they want to be a hundred percent renewable from the power plants\nAre electricity rates right out there right now are are fifty percent greater than any other western state\nIn the in the forty eight states ... percent\nFifty percent nobody you guys are fifty percent higher than any other state and um it's going to go much much higher deep deep carbon is Asian many studies have shown is going to increase the rates double or triple so I'm pretty\nNine Seventy

years you're going back to high school you're going back to college what\nHe has in fact you know he is in a ...\nThere's only one problem with that and that is Americans and I'll tell you what I say that\nWe our society that has a very very short attention span we our society that has a very short memory so if you're going to rely on Brett Kavanaugh\nBeing confirmed by his body of work I'm over the last Thirty years\nI got to tell you the truth I don't think Americans are real familiar with well let's say they are let's just for the sake of argument say they are okay I Will say to you\nThat most people would say if I said that was personally was the greatest singer guitar player of all time most people would say oh you gotta be kidding me why\nBecause they didn't see him we our society of immediacy yes if you don't see it and you don't get gratified by a maid you immediately but that doesn't exist\nThey can't tell you who won the world series last year who won the Stanley Cup I don't know how many of them even could tell you who won the Superbowl last year our attention span is so short\nThat to say and I agree I think Brett Kavanaugh is a very very\nGood justice I think he is a very good judge I think he would be great on the Supreme Court I think the fact that we're running through the coals like this is terrible because he has been guilty until proven innocent\nAnd I don't like that that is an American but on the other side of the fence\nI can see because I'm not a partisan and like all the other people were talking about I can see why people\nWould not vote for him because of those issues of these teenage and college years I can understand that and I think it's fair to get to the bottom of it and as a matter of fact the swing vote in this whole thing ended up being Jeff Flake okay Jeff Flake says\nThat if in fact the latest stories that came out yesterday the letter that justice Kavanaugh wrote by hand\nAnd talked about himself being of an of noxious drunk\nHe made it out like that alone his own admission of that was enough for him to vote against the confirmation\nAnd at that point it's over he said at once again I'm no fan of Jeff Flake in any
