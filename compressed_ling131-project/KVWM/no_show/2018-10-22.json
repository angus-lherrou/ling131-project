about the dying on him and let the ATF now that this man as a a shake a show they raided his house and they found a machine gun and unfortunately the machine gun also\nHad the serial number removed\nUm [noise]\nThe news reports on this are clear as to whether it was that way when he bought it or if he done that I got the impression that he was that when he bought it right and then complicating that was the fact that his wife had passed away a few months before she had cancer\nShe was smoking marijuana to deal with the pay and that's of course not legal the state of Texas so

show as always been\nAnyway All right so the M fourteen is that's a horrible story or what what what else have we got\nHere a little better story up on the corporate gun control debate I'm sure a lot of your readers remember after Parkland a number of companies cut ties with uh the n._r._a. a big bank\n... a little help from governor soprano in a New York um\nOr soprano in\nA New York I'm ... and so sure it's companies as well cut ties with the n._r._a. some decided they would not\nLend to any companies at all that made a semi automatic rifles they are ... so called military assault rifles that kind of like um\nTwo most prominent or a couple of days money center banks Citibank and bank of America\nA and a one of the ... piece of the blowback from that was that the state of Louisiana cut those two banks out of underwriting bonds the Irish ... writes the roads well\nSenator one of the senators from Louisiana Senator John Kennedy is just introduced a bill in the U.S Senate he's calling the no red blue bank banks act he's saying that are targeting gun owners and companies is\nThere a frontier responsible gun\nOwners are a threat to the constitution and the two way and basically what they're doing is they're trying to uh make it a red versus Bloomsday um\nAnd uh if this kind of thing continues since going to make it hard for businesses Louisiana or business is anywhere in the U.S for that matter to find banking services um you know these are legitimate\nLocal gun stores um gun makers uh um that type of thing and so what his bill would do\nWould cut those banks out of any federal business not telling who they who they can Lynch him and who they can or who they can do business with teachers thing that if they choose to pick and choose their\nCustomers based on political uh believes are activities or social justice reasons I'm the U.S taxpayer is not going to subsidize that activity\n\nI Would like to you know um\nHe's he's you know I don't know if it affects them out but I mean all of the most of these big banks took money\nDuring the bailout money during the bailout and all of them did yeah but yeah right so does this mean that we have a back door and who are being able to tell them how they conduct business or I mean I Know there are regulated\nAnd I know that they're regulated by various organizations but I mean is this can we make this price of doing business here in the United states where listen why don't you guys just figure out your best practices as far as business is concerned lead the legislation to us\nWell that's that's always the dream but there's always been a cozy relationship between regulators and\nThe regulate eat right from what I read when during the after the two thousand a crisis there were a couple of banks who didn't didn't even want to take federal money but we're told that they would um that and I'm not sure what the motivation was there\nUm but\nUh anytime\nAnytime you take a Uncle Sam money Uncle Sam can tell you what you can and can't do that and in this case I'm\nA Senator Kennedy for Louisiana's already said that he is a requested the ... general services administration cuts Citibank out of a seven hundred billion dollar contract they supposedly have a piece for I'm not sure exactly what those services are but that would be a significant piece of the U.S even back as big as a city back\nSo yeah I Would think that will get their attention that we'll see where that go see\nWhat happens or in three weeks with the election is to wear a bill like this bike how far it bike yet\nBut uh it certainly\nPlays well with the with the folks back home um that are centered letting people know that he's not going to sit still for those kind of thing and he uh going to make life as difficult as he can for banks that choose to discriminate against to their customers based on their position on the second amendment\nUsing it surprising that there isn't a law to implement already\nYes although how you would\nHow you would uh for something like that is always problematic you know the way if you if you're turned down for a for a long there's all kinds of reasons and are justifications that can go into that decision um however these banks both city NBA have\nOutwardly said look we will not lead to companies that make\nQuote military military style weapons available to the general public or they may no bones about that so that is clearly what these bags are doing right other banks may um make those tissues surgeons on I'm much\nA bore down low basis um we had an article\nOn that race

coast author also of rise of the robots technology and the new threat of a jobless future have Martin good to have you with us\nThanks for having me now what a story on Mark Zuckerberg wants a robot that is going to take care of his house his kid and help him out with baseball how realistic is this well\nI'd say that's a pretty ambitious goal I think that that that's more of a whole project on his part uh he'll he'll learn something from it but uh the truth is that these technologies are moving out moving along very rapidly um you know we're going to see a big impact over the next ten Twenty years\nYou know Martin I keep thinking of the twilight zone show a single body electric than Ray Bradbury wrote about a family who lost its mother she died a day or two kids a little boy little girl and the father was so distraught he went to the robot store and he got a nanny robot and she took care of the kids and\nDid everything a house made and the mother would do and then the kids got older and she went off to another household but\nI I mean robotics when you look at the way things are happening in in you know what the Japanese are doing with ... robots that look human ... ... it's really something else isn't it\n[noise] yeah we're seeing amazing progress I mean one one of the things that you have to say is true is that\nIt's going to be a long time before we have robot that can really act like human beings and do all the things that people can do but what we are going to the end and we're seeing already are robots and and other forms of automation that can be a big thing\nAnd you know having an increasing impact because the reality is that most people think I mean a lot of people come to work and they do the same kind of routine thing again and again and all of that work is\nYou know going to be increasingly acceptable on me so it's not it's not certainly at this point about science fiction type robot that are going to act like people but it's really about all kinds of of automation unfolding across the workplace and Medicaid software\nYou know it was born in Detroit in my late father worked for the Ford Motor company so I had an opportunity to see some factories and some plants on how they build cars\nAnd they had a automation a robotics long long time ago you know they don't look like people but they're machines that do the job of what people should have been doing a long long time ago and now it's the ball how far Martin\nHas it evolved since let's say thirty forty years ago in a factory\nWell the thing that's happening at that were kind of approaching what you might think of at the end game I say you know Thirty years ago they had robot and we've had automation in factories and as a result of that uh in in advance\nAnd we've had automation in factories and as a result of that\nAre in an advanced country like the United states all of the really ... routine manufacturing jobs you know the jobs that people used to have literally standing on the Seventy line those jobs have been gone for a long time they've already been automated\nAh but there have always been things for people to do because because there are certain tasks\nThat we live for example a visual perception and dexterity and so forth that robots just haven't been able to do and yet we're really beginning to the machines began to push into that that final front you know so that that\nThe group of jobs that really reserved for people is getting smaller and smaller drinking you know the machines are getting capable of doing more and more and that's something that I Would really expect to accelerate over the next decade or two\nI spend my time traveling between Los Angeles in St Louis and I'm In St Louis right now are getting back to Los Angeles next week\nAnd on Ventura Boulevard they've got\nAll the time was a human being I was driving down the road and there was a human being out there I thought holding the sign trying to entice people to come into the store and it's moving around in ... holding the sign\nAnd as I got closer to this thing Martin I realize it's a robot it's not a human it's a robot that looks like a human holding the sign and he's moving around these ... these in in you know what I'm saying that thing\nAlbeit it's not a high paying job but just took the place of a man or woman maybe they got paid minimum wage who knows what but that robot took that person's place job\nRight I mean and that's a good example it that's the kind of job that robot can't do it is very routine and she's standing there moving around um\nThe jobs right now that robots can't do would be something like being made cleaning a hotel room or being an auto mechanic or an electrician these are jobs that really require a lot of mobility and dexterity and\nAnd problem solving and so forth so those kinds of jobs are at the moment at least relatively safe but the frontier is moving very very rapidly um\nYou know we're already seeing robot that can duty more routine um repetitive thing and the important thing to note that it's not just about low skill jobs not just about the guy standing there holding the sign in many cases we're talking about jobs in offices\nYou know there that are held by people that might have college degrees because it's still relatively routine as people doing the same basic kinds of things again and again and therefore the object of automation\nWell in your key phrase was at the moment do you anticipate in ten years Twenty years more and more of these robotics will get so sophisticated that they will displaced people in jobs that you just mentioned\nI think it's entirely possible I mean it'll howling now and and remember we've got that acceleration going on with information technology most people have heard of Moore's law the idea that computers\nHave been getting faster kind of a doubling rate every two years or so and and you know much of robotics and artificial intelligence is subject to that so\nIt's not the case that things are just going to get more advanced gradually it's going to accelerate is going to keep moving faster and faster and as a result it it's likely to happen really before ready and it's likely to happen at a a very surprising rate you know it is something that\nIs going to be sort of on top of a long before we expect it because\nI think it'd be like the explosion of social networking and it just like you just like seemed to birth itself overnight\n[noise] that's right and I think you see for example you see something a bit similar to that happening with self driving cars now I mean it was really just a few years ago\nFive years ago during you know no one even consider that to be possible really I mean I I personally would not on someone that obviously think about this a lot I wrote a book about this in two thousand nine\nAnd I never really imagined that we see a self driving car within the next few years and yet Google demonstrated it and now it's just it's really just kind of accelerating every single automotive manufacturer and in companies like uber and Lyft are now getting into it a apple\nA reported the getting into it I mean it it's just becoming a huge phenomenon and clearly it is going to happen at some point you know I it may not be within the next five years but within ten\nFifteen Years or so we're we're very likely going to have cars driving themselves while\nYou know you're right I'm a little skittish right now to get in a car that's driven by itself\nBut you're right and you know as as technology gets better and better and better or they will do that I'm just concerned Martin if you know something technical goes wrong when you're doing sixty five miles an hour on the freeway and you're in the backseat let's say a man you're on a walk there aren't you\n[noise] yeah I mean there are certainly concern there I think that\nBecause of those kinds of concerns or the technology may move a bit slower I mean it may it may be essentially held back not by the technology itself but by regulation and buy a public insurance but I think you know the other side of that argument is that you know people are certainly not perfect driver I mean\nYou know cars are extraordinarily dangerous if you look at the number of people killed in that market auto accidents I mean it's one of the most\nDangerous things we do in life um and you can make a pretty strong argument that once the technology you know reaches maturity that the machines are going to be better at it that people are and uh you know it will actually result in in a much more safe environment with fewer accidents\nOr a Martin we're going to take this quick break we're going to come back and talk more with you about the future of robots rise or the robots as his book next hour will open up the phone lines fascinating subject dumped George ... and we'll be right back on coast to coast day I'll\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the ... letter signed up to the ... dot com\nBoom on no dog in my\nIs Jean room alone no no\nNo and then by\nDeveloping software was fairly labor intensive you know there there was physical media to be shipped so people had to pack all that up and put it in boxes and then and and shipped off to the customer and so forth and they were quite a few jobs there\nAre but all of that just kind of evaporated very rapidly so I saw what was happening just in my own little business and I came to the realization that that same kind of trend with likely to really unfold across the whole economy has artificial intelligence and robotic really begins to scale out across all industries\nIs a robot that the functions like our duty to does is it a computer is a walking computer\nEssentially I mean it's it's you know a robot in terms of a mechanical robot that actually does physical things that the combination of\nThe mechanical and and uh and the computer that you know the computer essentially acts as the brain that controls the actions of the machine um but as the two things come together it really enable things that that you know PBS the we we just haven't seen but you\nKnow the real driving force behind this artificial intelligence is this ability of computers to take on increasingly sophisticated tasks\nAnd to really at least begin to think at least a little bit in the way to humans are beginning to think you know to to start doing things like solving problems and\nMaking decisions and and most importantly learning you know computers can now\nLook at data and based on that day that they can learn to do things and that might just be a software program running on a normal computer on your desktop or it might be part of a robot\nBut either way it it's about you know machines in computers beginning to learn and think the way that human beings do\nOn one hand the robotics and AI seems to be fantastic on the other hand displacing workers in you know may be losing jobs\nDoesn't sound good at all the way this for us Martin ... is beneficial to continue the path we're going down\nI ... I Believe it is I think it's our only choice because if you look back at history one thing that really clear is that advancing technology is really the most important thing is made us better off I mean\nYou know everyone alive today is much better off than people who live say a hundred years ago I mean a typical person today has a has a much nicer life than a very rich person\nA hundred years ago in many many ways because of all the new technology we have the last thing we would want to do is put that progress to you know to a halt summer uh but I Do think we have to recognize that\nWe're entering a new age where they're going to be real implications for this and it's going to basically required adaptation and that's going to be the challenge for us is to adapt our system to this new reality so that we\nCan make sure that everyone in our society benefits from these advances as opposed to a lot of people being left behind\nWill this get scary in the future for for people the fact that these are robots will be doing so many things\n[noise] yeah I think a lot of people I I mean I already spent a lot of concern out there you know based on the questions that I get when I talk about this I mean I think that people are already concerned about me you know many people have already seen the impact in in their own workplaces or they know people that\nHad been impacted by technology so people are already worried I mean especially people that had kids that are\nMaybe it's going to be going to college soon and so forth and they know that they're a career paths are going to be impacted but if there's already a lot of concern out there and this will grow and and again that's the county trust is to adapt to it so that people don't have to worry so much and so that we can all\nReally benefit from your from this uh program\nYou know I I've not been in a post office processing factory or plant whatever you want to call it a world of male assorted but I have to believe that it's done primarily by robotics that that that the hand sorting mail is minimal these days I don't know\nI suspect so I mean I haven't been in the mail processing facility either but\nOne thing that we know is that the postal service is always\nStruggling to to you know deal with the number of employees that has basically had too many people you know\nAn error on the Internet is killed the postage basically you know people use the mail letters to each other they don't do that anymore\nThat's right so there's lots of friends impacting there you have actual um automation in terms of Paul thing about the thing the mail and then you had to they can which is I'm actually causing their left now so you know and that and that that's pretty typical there are lots of trends impacting across the board all of which I'm\nCan have an impact on jobs me the same thing with book that he would mail I mean books are becoming e books and then of course when that happens there's no jobs you know delivering books any more so\nThere are there are number of kind of we dated trends that are really unfolding across the whole economy and you know they're all kind of intertwining but you have the Haitian is that everything is becoming less labor intensive you know they get less need for human labor\nProminent people like physicist Stephen Hawking in the ... mosque are are warning us about robotics probably threatening humanity is anybody going to teach she'd do people like that\nWell I mean they're they're raising a warning that is not ridiculous it's something that we could take seriously um a lot of people kind of dismiss it in particular because it's been you know it's been raised in in science fiction movies and novels and everything so so many times in the Terminator and the matrix and all that\nBut I Do think it's a genuine concern but I also would say that it's not something we need to worry about any time soon I mean I think it's at a minimum of decades away before we can really build an artificial intelligence that you know is at the level of really thinking like a person and perhaps eventually become smarter than a person\nBut in the near term thinking out five ten years I I think that\nUh the primary impact that we're gonna have to worry about it is the job market you know the system through and get a lot lot better doing a lot of the work in the economy that's more routine and repetitive nature\nA lot of the work in the economy that's more routine and repetitive nature\nAnd cheaper to I guess\nThat's right and but it's potentially a huge number of jobs because there are a lot of people that come to work and they basically do the same kinds of things again and again you know the stuff that they do every day is predictable based on what they've done in the past\nAnd what that means is that these smart algorithms machine learning algorithms are eventually going to get better and better at doing a lot of that work and you know that a huge number of jobs has there been some studies that have looked at distance ingested that maybe\nHalf of the jobs in the economy or alternately going to be susceptible to this perhaps within the next couple of\nDecades so while we were you you look at like Amazon talking about using drones to deliver packages to people's houses and I I find that strange but you know what it was a UPS person out there that might be on a job because of the drone\nThat's right it could be drones are there are also experimenting with self driving delivery robot which I\nThink a little bit more\nThan having you know drone flying through the air um but I mean there are number of possibilities their rights so again there are several friends there's there may be automated delivery there may be more products going they should also that\nYou know they're they're delivered electronically 'em\nAnd God you know more of course if you're looking in warehouses that Amazon they're becoming\nMore and more robotic ties to I mean are using robots within the warehouses to move the products around so you know this is really\nDeveloped on many many front and um it's it's not necessarily predictable exactly which technologies are really going to take off and the most important um but what we can say that overall I mean this is you know clearly a pretty relentless trend\nMartin what about the human being that fights back against robotic sabotage or something um you know the person in a factory who realizes that this robot is going to displace him or her and they break it or something like that do you see any of that happening\nWell I you know I haven't personally heard stories like that I mean of course that's the first story about all of this is is the ... in England where the ... revolts where workers did do that with with a new kind of mechanical bloom they actually\nYou know rioted and they destroyed the machines could we see something like that again and and the thing of course we could uh\nI don't think that's a solution that anyone would advocate I think it's unfortunate if\nPeople end up in that situation but on some level it's easy to understand if people are having an our livelihood destroyed and\nThey don't really see a viable alternative so as a society that something that we all need to address we need to understand that that's coming you know the more and more people may be put in that situation and we need to\nEnsure that that we have for one thing an adequate safety net to help look after those people and for another thing is strategy over the long term to help us adapted\nThis well to to date a machine will increase productivity it'll increase speed it'll do all kinds of things not necessarily better than a human but quicker than a human so if you see beer down here in St Louis an on an anti Bush plant\nA conveyor belt being filled by a machine I mean it's like instantaneous since and these these bottles or just in cans or just zipping by if a human had to do it manually we'd never get anything done\nTo\nMigrants back on track moving no I I'm a carrot Fox News Central American migrants streams through southern Mexicali heading toward the

always looking at the companies that will become the next apple who is the leader in terms of companies public or otherwise that you know what is really ahead of the game in terms of robotics were were you get the robotic soldier and things like that\nWell there are a number of of companies that space like one morning here a lot it's typically in terms of robotic soldiers is Boston Dynamics which is actually owned by Google um so I mean I Would say that it in terms of the overall trend including both robotics and artificial intelligence\nThe biggest players right now are actually the biggest technology companies that companies like Google like Facebook Amazon or Microsoft these are the companies that\nAre really driving the core technology that's really making all this possible and in many cases uh especially with Google they've actually gone out and bought a lot of start up companies that are specializing both in artificial intelligence and and actual robotics 'em\nTo even you know to drive that that frontier even faster so that that's where\nYou know this is all coming from that's where the the advances are coming from\nSteven in Waterbury, Connecticut Hi Steven thanks for calling go ahead\nYeah I have a question too quick comment okay my\nMy question is if the robots word to replace ... workers were with the money come from to buy things like products and stuff like that to the people at work and they're not going to have money to buy things\nRight I mean that's um that that's a very valid point and it's something that I talk about ... extensively in my book um you've got to have people out there to come by to stop being produced and if we really get into a situation where there aren't enough jobs or where\nUm wages are very low because there's so much competition for jobs that are out there then it's hard to see how a a market economy or how capitalism can continue to thrive so that's one of the best arguments for figuring out a way to adapt today to make sure that\nPeople will continue to have access to an income even if all the job do eventually start to disappear\n... kid I Do look at number one of my first comment after that would be the robotics would they have in uh the surgery and things like that medical or they think that's fantastic what they're doing right now\nAre my second comment is if you look at movies like either Westworld or perhaps robocop you also see you know so down things that may happen with a chemical in\nComputers and stuff like that because so far they have perfected um effective thing so it can be pretty interesting what the future will bring yeah absolutely it's gonna be a very interesting next couple of decades I Would say\nGood time to be alive Martin like watching\nThis on ... what is fueling the robotics artificial intelligence I Know it's man but how did you get better every year who's doing this well\nIt's been getting better every year for a long long time and we it's been doubling basically that's what's been happening with computer technology but\nThing that I think is really key now if they did that doubling process that acceleration has been going on for a really long time thinking in terms of\nGetting in your car and driving at five miles per hour and then gradually doubling your speed like ten twenty forty miles per hour it kinda starts out gradually but if you just double your speed a handful of times you know once you get beyond eighty miles an hour\nYou you need to re tracking probably need a better car but if you could double your speed\nTwenty five or thirty times and that's how many times computing power has doubled I mean you'd be a science fiction spaceship you'd be traveling at millions of miles an hour ... you know factory anything we've\nActually ever built a and that's what's going on now that's where we are today in terms of of computer technology and that's the reason that we're starting to see all this stuff\nFinally be real you realized I think that's why now we finally have the robots that we've been talking about for decades and why we finally have the virtual reality that that people have been talking about for a long time you know it's because of this ongoing acceleration keep you know finally getting to the point where all this stuff is is beginning to be possible\nWell look at what the smartphone has done more to the world I mean uh I got a text today from a buddy of mine who just started using a smartphone I mean ... use a dinosaur and but he loves it and he said this is like\nI use a dinosaur and but he loves he and he said this is like a mini computer in my hand and I'm going da ... but\nIt is really revolutionized so many thinks it's become a portable office\nUh I I Know when I'm Out and I get emails from my staff or text messages or whatever I mean you cannot put a value on that in terms of saving time and the fish and sea it's amazing\nRight it's got the point where you can't imagine I mean I spent most of my life without even you know a mobile phone let alone a smartphone but\nAlready it's hard to you know how how do we live without it um you know I mean you you can actually thought that I used to live without it and you know what we've seen with smartphones me keep in mind that the you know the iPhone was developed in two thousand seven right now it's\nOnly eight years and I hear not\nLong it that the celebrated um and you can ... the the progress in mobile phone but for the back or you may remember the movie Wall Street which came\nOut oh yeah love that movie yeah and ... member\nAt and he's walking on the beach any voting at the cellular phone in\nThe huge thing you know men looked like one of those ... like he's holding a\nLittle refrigerator almost um that's how it started in one way to think about all day if they said it when it comes to the robotic and virtual reality and these technologies that are just taking off their like that\nThat bone in that movie that Michael Douglas ... yeah that's the stage they're at and you can sort of see where it's going by looking at you know today smartphones I mean that's the kind of progress that we're likely to see 'em over the next Twenty years or so\nWhy is small in technology better\nBut I mean it ... I think it gets smaller and more precise than you can pack more and more into the same side I mean that's part of Moore's law basically which has always been\nUm basically the way you can pack more and more yeah onto onto a chip pride and that's one of the things that's really driven a miniature is Asian but I mean it's really\nGotten to the point now where\nUm you know even if that eventually kinda Peters out and many people think you will because we're running up against them the physical limits in terms of uh the traditional approach to work law\nThat other approaches are going to mark you know people will start cooking all these smaller chip together into massive networks and things like that in order to build entirely new architecture so uh this is something that's going to stop it she's going to keep getting more and more dramatic\nHave you seen that movie um ex ... is it that the name of that movie\n[noise] right yeah yeah I've seen it um and you know there are lots and lots of science fiction movies that deal with many issues I I don't know any of them really get it right a lot of them are still far in the future in terms of what they are trade but\nWe're beginning to see and the real world some of these issues come up and it is you know how it's going to play out eventually over the next twenty thirty forty years eventually going the technologies like that it\nI I think so too let's get one more call in before the break a Westland or again Hey Tom go ahead welcome to the show\n[laughter] church or love your show thank you um if you took a smart phone with the camera and it's um and everything it's got a USB port on it you could put that into something called ...\nAnd drive to step promoters using the sixteen the output of the ... you know I'm so virtually you could\nUm cry a robot on the other side of the world I'm using a phone the second I've got a question for your for your guest\nWhere can I point an assembly line programmer for a robotic [noise] um they don't teach it in school and pretty much everybody is micro short Microsoft driven\nIn a microscope program is a crash master um I Can't have my robot crash\nBecause if it does there's nobody there to reset it which goes to the definition of what the difference between automation robotics is a toaster electrical alarm clock you look ... set and it runs forever automatically by itself without a burst [noise]\nThe toaster requires a person to push the tone down to start\nNext right hold on Tom we're going to take the break but we'll come back and finish up with your call in a few more on coast to coast they\nNever missed a detailed assure against sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise] yeah um that was pretty much all I wanted to say um but I also had um the question of where the heck kind of boring a um an assembly language programmer [noise]\nUm everybody does a high level stuff um for the audience for what we're talking about is the actual exit does some older two digits long chains\nThousands of lines long but they're only to ditch your wide\nAnd it into larger of commands\n[noise] um and you ... you have to go to India to find somebody in the United states they don't to treat into schools you can't go to a community college or university you have to go to engineering technical school and look to the the professor\nAnd talk to your guest over there where can I find somebody who can do low level machine language [noise] um for somebody who wants to start a robot company you can't unless you've got a programmer [noise] um\nIf I wanted to build a a robot chassis I Can't get the programmer because they're just not available to see what I'm saying\nWhere did you get it Martin that's a pretty technical question but ah I I guess the answer is you should look online um places like Craig's list or he lands those kinds of websites\nWhere people are available with specific skills that would be my my best guess\nI Hope that helps you Tom thanks so much next up and go to Audrey in Rochester New York ... Audrey thanks for calling go ahead\nOh thanks [laughter] than it's great to talk with Mike and George sure [laughter] um let's see I was thinking about the self driving cars and ...\nPretty much been looking mostly at the upside of robotics names thinking there in ... the occasion to then\nAnd the self driving cars throwback cards are the are completely dependent on TPS from satellite mapping technology Internet\nSo their their faith based on the Internet and uh we there have been several reports for fear of hacked cars or people have lost control of their cars and taken over by outside\nForces and I'm thinking\nThese are driving cars are extremely hackle [noise] um on top of that I don't think we're going to need police anymore or because being a\nLaw enforcement people can just basically take over a car and drive it to the police station and they won't be a need for any high speed chase [noise]\nAnd ah for people who are now mowing tens\nOr it's possible to take over a car and kidnap someone that's true or a you know just run them off a cliff or something if they want it to get rid of somebody so that I I could see this as being a very powerful tool of\nEither at a very a tablet Syrian state or a ...\nYou know we'll we'll let me know headlines on the issue you raise is absolutely correct\nI mean I'm definitely security and and the potential for hacking or to potential for a cyber attack from another country or something like that that there was a huge issues with self driving cars more broadly for\nReally this whole trend we're seeing where everything is becoming more and more connected uh and it didn't name for that where everything is connected together is is what's called the Internet of things\nAnd basically it means that everything not not just cars but appliances and maybe robots some day and all kinds of devices and everything will be hooked up together and and one of the main things that people worry about with that is is the security issue you know but if it gets hacked what if it\nComes under attack so there are definitely a lot of people that are working on that and and worrying about it so it it's an important issue\nWell we've just seen over the past several months hacking into cars on freeways people have that ability to do that now it's amazing that's\nRight yeah anytime you know cars or sexually controlled by computers uh you know the computers are ... that that's absolutely reality and and definitely one of our challenges going forward is to figure out\nA solution to that you know to to defend against that kind of thing\nIs is a good field to get into\nAbsolutely if you're\nSkilled in computer security that's one of the absolute the hottest areas right now I\nMean I think that would be a great career path for anyone who's interested in that and has that particular talent and skill set\nDanny in Richmond, California hello Danny it's your turn on the coast to coast go ahead\nHi George a great you know and I wanted to ask why I wanted to make a comment and then ask a question sure I think what we're ... I think what we're seeing is not robot acting as humans but humans acting like robots\nAnd this country has over one hundred thousand people complaining about being implanted with neural implant\n... men and jocks are over there at presidents bioethics a study on bioethics commission nor do they do anything about it like the government agencies but why is it sees the U.S military just do nothing about it\nMy question for Martin here do you think that we are in a multi diverse full of brains chipped rubbery looking humanoid clones\nWell I I don't know if any evidence for that that's a fairly radical idea I haven't really thought that it doesn't seem very likely to me is not something I worry a lot about\nBut ah I guess you can never say it's impossible\nSo if you were going to build a robot was human like characteristics what things would you include in Martin\n[noise] well I mean the the the greatest challenge for robot with human characteristics is gonna be a brain you know the ability to think like a human being and I said\nYou were a ways away from that you know that's not something we're going to the in the near future so that the most important Kelly he's not making a machine basically looks like a person I mean people have done that already\nThe question is can you make it think like a person and the answer to that right now is no uh no one is even gotten close to that so\nUm that's that's the primary challenge there\nIf humans were machines how would you can categorize us up there in terms of advancement I mean would we be one heck of a robot\nOh I mean that the human brain is extraordinary I mean it is the most extraordinary\nIn the human brain is extraordinary I mean it is the most extraordinary most complex system in the universe I'm you know there's nothing that we have ever built in terms of technology that can compare and sophistication and capability\nTo the human brain a ... some day change but for right now that certainly is absolutely true\nI mean you you you constantly have to keep thinking about an intelligent design because uh a brain where you can show emotion\nAnd laughter and anger\nAnd creativity and thinking it's just absolutely amazing isn't it\nIt's amazing but I mean I I Believe the evolution produced that I think that over the course of a great length of time that that certainly possible um\nSo I think everyone has a quite extraordinary\nI I think you have a Lucian is driven by some intelligence all by itself\nOr I mean that that's a debate but you know the the the point is that however it evolved the the human brain is something genuinely extraordinary and um it's gonna be a long time before we can build a machine that that can't compete with that\nBrian is in Indianapolis, Indiana with us now Bryan it's your turn go ahead sir\nHey George good evening made it very interesting that we don't hear very much about what's right thank you I\nGuess I can you see so many things going wrong with this uh I got a quick question is not take my answers off the air Okay Number number one\nHow many jobs are going to be this place because of these machines in the future as as we know now our economy and with his left all the hundreds of thousands of refugees into our country\nWe're American people are fighting for jobs now you know add on top of that these robots no hitter Fifteen Years hours do you think you're going to be around\nHow many jobs you eat it it's like at a number two with all these driverless cars you know the computer already fly the airplane you talk about you pee in a ... devices being voted\nIn our atmosphere what would happen in the future with all this uh all these robots running all this stuff and everything in my third question is what's going to keep the federal government what is your don't trust preparing these robots loose on the American people in the future\nAnd I appreciate your time George you guys have a good eating\nOkay and let's start with his last question robots that turn on us whether it's intentional by government or they do it on their own Martin\n\n\n[noise] border\nPatrol is getting ready I'm an Carrick Fox News the growing caravan of

I\nRead all of the heart literature I was actually able to go to the Alaska Liberia and track down some official harp literature that came out with the open the facility for the kind of read their um you know sales pitch so to speak but a doctor nicked did some experiments or showed us some experiments on that\nYou know how how it was possible uh\nUsing energy to use the energy to basically disrupt people's brainwaves\nAnd you know that's just one of the allegations with regard to harm the other of course being that they're trying to control the weather's somehow ah but the bottom line to me is the fact that you know there are actually playing God I mean they're they're beaming\nYou know billions of lots of power in the ionosphere which is essentially our protective shield it protects the earth from the from the sun from solar rays\nAnd uh uh you know as you know you know with chaos theory I mean a tiny tiny stimulus\nCan have all types of repercussions that we can't even conceive up\nSo you know even though they claim that they're not really doing or putting enough energy out there to really\nUh you know to cause any effect but uh I don't know I I don't know if I Believe that or not it's pretty scary stuff\nJohn and many older Texas it's your turn John thanks for calling\nA fucking or for taking my own like on the show or orange and not pay such to play a part of it was a hamburger or so ago prospecting a ... for a while which is a separate church or the ... or ... or junk\nAll they won by we have a reptile came out of a front of our town that was about three feet tall and to give a general\nA body type I won't say it'd be like that of a raft or Russia or that kind of like\nWow I Am a paper on Honduras have a common name for them\nUh uh ... uh about a call ... who is a pilot and Paul just as a curator of a a a ... and he said he didn't talk to ... that have been in Honduras those grabs a science thing\nAnd he said on the wrong way saw there was one a member of the ... that have been known to have small children I have ... years to try to ... just like him off\n[noise] I have served for years to try to ... just about him up\nHere that when Kenny\nYes it's actually very familiar I'm even here in North America we have accounts of something known as a river die nose or you know a century descriptions are very similar to what John is saying like a a by Peter ... dinosaurs like raptor type of raptor types of dinosaurs scanning about three to five feet tall\nA but apparently you don't have to go to Honduras to see them because uh just last year there were several sightings down here in South Texas\nA in a town of Hebron ville I interviewed a couple of eyewitnesses a couple of ladies who claim they saw these\nThese dinosaur looking things running around there uh and she's also been sightings from Colorado and New Mexico so I mean if a if you believe that the world is big enough and fast enough and still maybe an unexplored enough to to harbors some of these surviving dinosaurs you know I guess it's certainly possible\nDo you like this monster has been on your list as a non\nYeah it has\nUm actually this year has been a ... year pretty significant here for the Loch ness monster George I'm you know in recent years fighting has a lot this monster him really trailing off but uh in two thousand and Fifteen we actually had a big log five pretty darn good sightings\nOf something in in Loch Ness and it was the biggest year for the longest monster and over a decade uh the fighting started in March of two thousand Fifteen or a family of tourists who were by the ... castle there the famous castle a satellite ness claimed he saw a twenty foot\n... like shape come out of the water and then some merge they weren't able to take a photograph of it because they were in\nShock and awe but they did get some footage of the uh the disturbance that left behind and then the next month in April there were a two or three really good sightings of a of a large animate object in Loch Ness\nAnd uh then again in September a the thing was seen again so whatever is in Loch Ness nasty the Loch ness monster whatever it is a it seems like it's still there are the sightings are going on again\nOne of our guests Stephen Walt and believes it's a huge deal and you see in swimming up and down I'm not sure I think it's I think it's ... or a dinosaur\nThat's that's definitely a definitely matches some of the descriptions I'm In my new book Georgia actually put out a theory that it's not my theory it's been around for years but uh the possibility that the Loch ness monsters that giant amphibian or essentially like a related to salamanders in New in that same played\nAnd the reasons that I support that over the police use the words that amphibians are more acclimated to cold water than a reptile phrase\nA and in addition to that amphibians can actually suck oxygen breathe oxygen through their skin so an amphibian would be able to stay submerged for a longer period of time and say a reptile which we need to come to the surface for air a fairly consistently\nLike little submarines aren't they\nYeah so I haven't but who knows but the giant he'll theory is very prevalent as well but there's definitely something and Loch Ness\nLet's go to Gina in Denver, Colorado hello Gina\nHi can you hear me yep we sure can\nOkay thank you for taking my call um I just wanted to let you know however you came here can really unfair about ... ... ... ...\nHaving to other kinds of mention anything coming to 'em [laughter] so you've nailed it and I think Anthony evidence for a while now and trying to figure out how to present it to the world and I just kind of an attempt on ... on that sort of ... evidence\nOf exactly what you're saying in history I've actually up and you went out of their time when David ... was on yes around I\nI Know I'm from ... okay and I've got some initial contact with tennis I'm no further because other things have been happening but um yeah can you know you've nailed it because the pictures that I have now and it it's going quicker and faster for me and I I actually don't even know how to present it to people but yeah the actual photographic evidence of\nHurdles opening a dimensional things coming and going into it when\nYou drill down deeper into the picture you can see their ... everything from things that look Hi I'm not familiar with ... and everything that looks familiar ... um few alien to ... to eight looking thing um [noise]\nIt's it's uncanny and however I'd like to ask how you kinda figured that out that it it was ... related portal that's bringing things in ... now and I got the evidence to support [noise] wow\nThat's pretty amazing and in terms of the evidence to Gina where do you have\nGot well you know I started looking at the other lady with me and when the check housing happened it's really started picking up and then all of a sudden now here in this past summer I've been able to take pictures and whenever I took pictures they might feel presidents around me\nWhenever I take pictures there's other dimensional team around me all the time and now here lately and this is happening just unique seek out\nUm I've got this evidence that these portals hoping I'll be taking pictures of anything that's my apartment or and environments and and I'm\nJust neutral areas huh and I don't feel them in there and I'll take a picture and you look at the picture and you drill down and you see\nHere on your other ... Internet here these past few weeks the portal being open\nAnd are these portals opening and closing\nYeah [laughter] yeah it's it's ... like almost like a you know have like I'll take a picture to normal offering something for their yeah and then it'll turn black like something's\nTrying ... speaking of pictures and Gina send us if you you were just ... dot com or lacks that coast to coast am dot com and can I suspect that if there are ... holes and they've got to be pretty big swallow up so many people rather than just being you know maybe the side of the sidewalk well don't you think\nYeah that makes sense and again you know as a corpus of all this quantum physics is at one of my strong points but\nUh certainly I've read the works of you know I haven't Sanderson and some of other forty and researchers that have addressed the vortex theory and um yeah you absolutely would we'd be talking about something that has just an unbelievable amount of a math and energy\nWell that's that's more scarier than big foot more UFOs to me falling into a dimension and you can't get back while they were coming back with spinal calls in a moment and goes to goes down\n\n\nAnd ah it basically crawled up a tree in his backyard and he didn't know whether to\nUh to run away because he was afraid that might jump on him or or to you know running grab a camera you alternately went for a camera but by the time he got back to thing was gone but a guy was pretty credible George I mean this is a guy ah he's save people's lives for a living and he uh he swore to me up and down at this this really happened\nEverybody who's listening to us in bed right now there is a huge fight or on your\nPillow just [laughter] ah I'm not that I have a wreck the phobia but I don't like spiders skin I don't like I Know they have a purpose but I don't like them\n[laughter] uh most people don't George I think you're not alone there but uh you can imagine spider that big a particularly here in North America as a yeah you get a house restless night\nWhy did the great creator give them eight legs what did they need to eat leagues for\nWell spiders are actually uh they're they're pretty darn proven designed George I mean they uh they date back\nUh probably four hundred million years or so the slurry and if you're talking about like the the the ancestors of spiders which were like the the ... the the sea scorpions uh so uh it's it's a it's a tried and true design and it's worked for hundreds of millions of years\nLet's go to a amber and the coach Tom Pennsylvania to get us going Hi amber go ahead\nWell George how're you doing real good hope you are to\nYeah you almost no return of luck with that either\n[laughter] but then again it's\nNot like I lost very well anyway so I'm visually impaired [laughter] that's the way I'm kidding or what I call it outlasts I've had from last year for ... do say New Mexico well in the early ... thought about that\nI'm Sorry I didn't hear what about not being in New Mexico\nWas created do fall in Mexico\nOh so it was kind of like a like a covert government experiment or something like that is that your application\nA war you know what do you think that's not nothing's impossible but uh in my flying humanoid book um I actually um there is a case of a mosque man type creature known as the bird man of shopper out\nAnd it's been an countered by several residents of a tiny town called ... which is\nA not too too darn far for white sands\nAnd our some of those other kind of covert uh things have gone on through the years so uh you know maybe you got a case they're of a mosque man and a little bit closer to home if a New Mexico is where they're from\nOkay who's ... been in Florida it's your turn been taken away\nHey Jen I'm I don't know if you remember me but we we a cat that when I went back to the extradition yeah there we were looking for the ... yeah we sure well I found him in that six and I\nThink yeah where are you going to be coming back down this way to do further research and um [noise] ah because there's been some interesting things happening I'm\nOut with that area where we were at and I'm also since you've been doing Thunderbird stuff I spent last year up in North Dakota and they all feel working and I went to measure she state\nPark near Glenn dive Montana and if you're in if you're still doing it on your research you should go out there and take a look at some things that's awesome I saw some sparked out there last year that freaked me out I'm a wildlife biologist\nWow that's impressive press is out there can take some ... by the way this the skunk apes people think they're big ... right\nWell I think most researchers feel that they're potentially a subspecies so they are kind of a derivative of big foot but\nSince you're looking at a completely you know you're considering a completely different type of habitat the swamp the cypress swamp and uh and so forth um there are a little bit smaller than the traditional big butter sauce watched from the Pacific northwest\nOf they primarily walk on their hind legs or by Peter Lee but there have been a lot of accounts of them are going down on all fours\nA so in that respect to the floor to Scott Cape seems to be you know even more ape like if you will in the traditional big foot or sasquatch\nWere there any huge stories in two thousand Fifteen in their crypto world\n[noise] [noise] well uh in addition to the Loch ness monster thing that I told you about that was kind of big but um there had been a lot of sightings are accounts of something known as the dog man I don't know if you've heard of that or not but essentially it's aware wolf high creature that combines the characteristics of a of a canine\nA and a human and I kind of like your traditional Hollywood werewolf if you will but um there were at least four to six accounts or in a relatively short period of time from central Pennsylvania\nAnd these were followed closely by some of my colleagues who are researchers up in that area and ah the descriptions are again very similar now a limited Godfrey of course is a a colleague of mine who's documented these dog man\nYes ah last werewolf\nAccounts from all over the mid west or but it seems to be a pretty quickly uh seems to be a very polarizing topic I should say in the field of crypto zoology there's so many account\nIt seems to be a very polarizing topic I should say in the field of crypto zoology there's so many accounts now uh it seems like these things whatever they are they're they're really being seen in a with a lot of frequency lately\nHow much do we not know creatures well\nWell that's just the George I mean there's two ways to look at it you know one is that we've got it all figured out and uh the world's all been explored but uh uh I personally know that to not be the case I've had the opportunity to travel all over the world to the Amazon jungle to Africa to all kinds of amazing habitats\nAnd I can tell you that the vast majority of our planet is uninhabited and very accessible\nAnd in addition to that new species are being discovered on a consistent basis still so um you know there is certainly the potential for all types of strange and marvelous creatures to be out there just beyond the grasp of scientist\nRoberta in Baltimore, Maryland now hey Robert thanks ringing in there go ahead\nOh thank you George ... wanna wish both you and Ken a happy new year I think you\nGeorge one of the things I've been trying to do with your\nA story you see is integrate or the many gifts that you've had in the end of the things that they bring out that ah that do have some like strange nice heard before\nAnd the and in regard to what kind of talking about this for item is I'd like to to bring to your attention sure one is that ah\nThe ah we we heard quite a bit about it a civilization that have existed in and still exist on the earth\nAnd it would seem like a for example one of the uh one of these are species or the rebellion and I noticed that Ken talked about it ... features on some of the\nUh the animals that have been observed or another one is the fact that the explorers admiral bird and others when they've been in the Arctic and and it ties in with this ah I Lived in a being a location where you see many\nThese creatures that are that you found a whole\nAh they recorded a hole in the in the Arctic and then when I had my bird was sent down to Antarctica which was on another one of your shows a day of course discovered that there's quite a bit of activity going on underground in Antarctica\nAnd again that can be a location where other species could developed\nAnd if these are underground areas exist all through the country which we heard they do\nOr they could very easily be independent civilizations independence species living there and coming out through various ah\nAh areas that have not been explored unfair and timely or when you talk about

like platforms oh aha see I Would think literally crawling like you were feeling that probably wouldn't be a bad way to do it either coming down but company probably be the best way is to turn your

were not near a company that made radio parts of your work in a major city mhm do go to your local radio shack and find some way to go up and worried and\nThere's nowhere to go now anymore\nYeah there's not a ... and you mail on guitar or maybe if you have one of those or maybe but\nRadio shack saved a lot of remote broadcast so we did of course there's yeah and they had pretty useful line of a\nI don't know like ... and ... and they had they had a good catalogue and things like that ... obviously they have to move into the twenty first century yeah and they have to be more specific into

[noise]\nRight as we continue their ...\nThe ... as I call him a he's a great friend of mine these amazing he did something that nobody else did they actually took the time to actually look at Donald Trump's real background real roots his family his father and you know you tell a lot of gripping stories in the book about how\nWell the main horrible landlords actually weren't so mean after all when people came on hard times they would work with people and help people\nThat's absolutely true story that's actually the Carol won a family in thirty forty your friends and stuff and I wanted to relate that story you know an all tell it quickly or Fred Trump\nShowing up to collect rent with his twenty six year old son Donald J truck in and they're walking through the uh the garden apartments knocking on doors car one family cannot pay the rent the father has lost the job he's a blue collar worker Fred in his son are looking at\nThem saying okay no problem are very often guy let's wait a month let's see what happens I suspect you'll get a job well and behold a sixty short days later a he gets a job pays the rent that he was owed a and it's just a wonderful story that their family never\nGoing to be told by the mainstream media on both people talk about what does the president that compassion for these people does the president had the apathy\nAnd the answer is yes he learnt that at the riding shotgun with his father is he was easier building these buildings helping to fill the buildings are collecting rent from collar people that were living shot so so I Want to get a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story arc of the Trump family which is a great American success many ways to have any family [noise] is also an American success story the arts are different uh and the generational transfers are different uh put their goal part of America the ... part of that broke up America\nYou know the the generations the built this country and I don't know if Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations I built this country are just amazing people the immigrants that built this country by grandparents all for coming from Ireland\nUh anyway the book is called the Trump the blue collar president Anthony Scaramucci it's up on Hannity dot com Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere Anthony good to see we're going to see on TV this week we'll look forward to my friend and uh all the best on your book tour and I hope people will run out and get a copy of it because it's worthwhile reading I appreciate\nIt God Bless you meant\nThanks my front with Fifteen days till election day one of the important Senate races were watching is out in the great state of Arizona which by the way could be impacted by this caravan that had marching towards our southern border as we speak\nSenate candidate and war hero Martha McSally is going up against Christians cinema Christian cinema seems to be floating out there or will get the state of the race has the best election coverage continues Fifteen days till election day glad you are with us it's the Sean Hannity show [noise]\nAnd as we would we would line up on\nA taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there's not there's a silence there and everyone is leading giving our final salute to these American heroes\nOr who perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates and for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign\nAnd Arizona and should make a different choice to not vote for years and send it but this is really personal for those of us who served and was shot at by the Taliban and and saw American parish over this\nUh you know I hear the emotion in your voice and understandably so I mean you ... said six deployments that's amazing\nYeah well again it was an absolute honor there's so many Americans who have done that and more of those on the ground and the air and on the the I mean this is this is you know why we fight a to protect our way of life and our freedoms and our liberties\nAre in it you know this is you know in addition to this a comment saying it's okay for an American to join the Taliban to basically commit trees and she also was protesting right after nine eleven protesting our troops in a pink to to\nA flyers handed out at protests that she led depicting our troops as skeletons and saying stop the U.S\nTerror in the middle east so this isn't just a one off or her\nUh this is the pattern she advocated a shutdown Luke air force base\nI hosted the president President Trump at Luke air force base on friday to see what an amazing national security treasure it is she's trying to cover up or tracks and with George Soros Chuck Schumer and the millions of dollars that are flowing in to you know cover tracks and Turner into something that she's not in the greatest political cover up\nIn Arizona history a lot of people think she's moderate a lot of people think she's right of center a and it's just not true and we\nGot his only coming out on a three weeks before the election I mean it's almost on a daily basis it's like you know a a deep dive dumped has been made but I Would think that this was common knowledge or had to have been common knowledge about her I mean\nI I wouldn't underestimate remember the allegations against the blind shakes attorney that she invited to Arizona State university I mean that's another slap in these two people\nThat absolutely look at you know we are sort of joke that the Democrat Party should have done better in our internal opposition research on her before they had Herbie Chuck Schumer is top recruit for them to try to flip the Senate majority\nWe knew about her radical cats uh we've been telling people about it in Arizona every single day uh and that and the last few weeks you're right some some videos and and things are coming out every single day but unless you're on conservative radio conservative TV Fox\nOr another on social media you're not finding out about this and so we still have a ... a number of independents\nAnd Republicans who are not Tunisia and unfortunately that need to know every time we have to put up an ads have put some of these statements and like you just played it costs us about seven hundred thousand dollars to make sure the message gets out to the voters as they are voting every single day right now\nAnd she's had so much money dumping into her you know and if people do on a supporter of course they can go to make Sally for Senate dot com\nBecause we really do need to help or to make sure Arizona's are aware\nOf the Arizona are aware of all of this they will never vote for her if they're aware of your heroic background they absolutely will vote for you\nUm I've only got to get to know you in in recent months and I got to tell you I'm more impressed every single time I talk to you and I think you'll be a great senator from the state of Arizona I Hope you're not going to turn into Ben Sasse and run away from me after you get elected\nBut um that's happened more than willing to honor\nYou know it's on you may not remember but back when I was a major in the air force I took out in the Pentagon because they were making our service women wear ... when they were in Saudi Arabia and I put my career on the line and I actually sued the department of defense\nOr fought for eight years and got legislation passed to overturn this and I actually went on the Hannity income show during that whole thing ah to talk about how important it was to protect our religious liberties and not so it\nWas a very you know that was that was a gutsy move I mean I I don't like the idea of American Soldiers are are on foreign soil and were there to protect them and help them which is usually the case\nAh I don't think that we need to go by their customs were Americans we get to follow her own customs or else you don't want us there then you don't want us there\nExactly that's exactly oh luckily we were there it was with the U.S military policy it was ridiculous I stood up for it I fought for it took me eight years but I finally got legislation passed as a citizen or to overturn it and make sure that our values were ... were set up for it yeah\nWell I really wish I knew and here I'm a bit more than ... valley if you're not paying attention to this race in Arizona you need to pay attention Christian cinema you know supporting radicals like the Taliban while Martha McSally doing her six tour of duty twenty eight years serving our country ah she's got one of those crazy pink hats on\nYou know talking down our troops and accusing them didn't you choose the torture as well\nI see where the line with a radical uh anti border patrol a group down at the border trying to help uh you know help with illegal immigration and that group ah ... accused the border patrol of torture yes it was a ... again radical extreme group that she was very much involved in a in the inner path\nWhat do you think the president needs to do with the seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border if they make it to the border what's the best plan for the president\nOr this is absolutely ridiculous we have got to stop them from coming in the president needs to use all elements of power that he has shown we're seeing little mini caravans coming in every single day though because they're taking advantage of our loopholes in the law\nUh I work very closely with President Trump a it's often called the good that bill that was also the Knicks Sally bill that would provide thirty eight billion dollars for the border wall to secure our border and close the loop holes that the cartels are taken advantage of it has\nStop every single day right now there's people coming in in ... uh and that's a a sector that is being overrun right now all they do have been down there many times they ... yeah they're released into the interior of and I think sixteen thousand five hundred family member units in September the highest ever recorded\nThousand five hundred family member units in September the highest ever recorded\nThis is not Czech president John Fong it's a Democrat's fault for obstructing a closing loopholes and securing our border and the president as frustrated adding I and ... everything he's got and it took it to to put pressure on Mexico and\nThen they use the word building in funding and fully funding all yes and you have\nBoarded our belt thirty eight billion dollars including building a wall yes or\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell San I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on a house bill I'm getting my asking for it right now because of being misconstrued by the Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear and people in that family\nMember wait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare as they held in Arizona there's only one choice in fourteen if it really happy that it had no choice people lost their health care coverage we're people right now a tree that the conditions you can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I work hard to make sure that we were moving away from that uh and and towards something that gets more choice for people more flexibility at the state level more free market\nGet the federal government you know to not be doing that one size fits all top down penalty taxes and mandate it's failed\nAnd so we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ring that vote I voted to protect people with preexisting condition oh that's good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nOr a ... a really a rock star a hero who served their country unimportant race for the Republicans as they not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate\nIt'll make votes for Supreme Court justice is a lot easier going up against the very radical leftist in the name of Christian cinema thank you so much a Martha ... for all you've done for your country and and the positions you take and uh you should win this race\nFar and wide when the people of Arizona fully understand the record the background and the radical views of Christ and send them a thank you for being with us Martha McSally\nThanks on at present you signing a flashlight on ethanol advocacy and if people want to help they can go to Nick Sally for Senate dot com you need your support and help and donations and we can win this thing thanks so much\nThank you rod as in Florida crushed view on the Sean Hannity show how are you run\nA yes or a resolution on the show dedicated listener concerns my concern is the Supreme Court list that the president at actually a presented when he was Ron Paul is okay\nAnd the reason why my concern is is is because nature close is already a put the news out there that they do smear campaigns\nAnd they've done it can initially they want us to transparency and so we've given transparency it's like open up our playbook so they can actually investigate every person on that list\nSo whoever President Trump actually nominates\nThey've already got a team investigate and that's the so the person to attack on a smear campaign\nOther that's all you get from the Democrats that their only play book that's all they have that one on one one or two one oh three one oh five one oh nine that this is it you know and you know it's interesting to watch the Democrats now are trying to urge caution on blue wave and temper expectations they're scared to death", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Show Low", "day": "22"}
