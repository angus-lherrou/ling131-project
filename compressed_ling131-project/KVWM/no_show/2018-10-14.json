we were talking about um how with entrepreneurship sometimes you don't need all the knowledge you just need or the classes and everything else sometimes you just need to do as an article from entrepreneur dot com so you said\nOnce you kind of agree with it don't you uh well I definitely agree with that um you you do need you need it\nUh well I definitely agree with that um you you do need you need to look like if you don't have a general knowledge about what you're going to go into business for then you don't need to be one of the business well crime but you know there comes a point to where you can you know you can you can only learn so much\nAbout a certain I don't care if it's business or how to bake a\nCake you know sooner or later you gotta you gotta mix it up but it doesn't hurt at all you know and and everything so same read it so well yeah if you need to ... yeah but you know I'm not a cook so you can you tell\nYeah actually I Can't but there comes a point in time where you just you know you either you know they do well in here says knowledge is useless without action\n\nWon't you heard that before and many different things and you know a hard agree with that but I think that\nYou're here again you know I'm I'm just so so old school that I think you know the word action really scares me at times because it it kind of portrays I'm kinda portrays you know\nI've got a little bit this I've got a saying a lot of people a joke around at times when I say this\nIs let's let's let's get something done ... wrong you know I'll get up you know from a break or something like that and get ready to back to give back to work or go do something and I'm always tell everybody around me and the guy he's working was let's go let's go to or maybe it was wrong you know just as kind of look like say and everything [noise]\nBut that's what action reminds me of sometimes you're in such a hurry to put something in the motion or an action that\nYou know it's not the right timing and um big I don't know if it ever said this before but I'm thinking of timing timing is everything now you've never seen before well I haven't been in I guess I should ... wrote a blog\nAbout Tommy scares me a while and then here it says um there are those who talk and those who do\n\nThat up a good degree more well that's true I mean that's why there are some people that are just true employees\nAnd some people who are either [noise] and the ones who a lot of times on the talk and don't do anything\nFor talking while they're trying to do something as ever using nuts [laughter] they're always just talk [laughter] [noise] yeah sometimes it's good\nBecause you need talkers mhm you know you need you know I mean let's face it he got he got listened some while you're working I guess yeah you've got to listen to put its own zone [laughter]\nBut yeah it was [laughter] that was like I was like a mom and our earlier today I was you know\nThey never have said you don't have a pair of headphones you always bring a pair of headphones because the deeper the sitting beside me with a doctor and writer and you're like oh I'm Sorry once I'm actually put my headphones on and I actually didn't have my I bought or anything with may have known it was found to hit it yep like this is happening\nRight now so they're playing with a plug in your in your hand already my assuming I don't want to do that and I had already that but yeah well I'm I was reading the other thing is a seven forty seven percent of your people are ready to leave your business\nI Would think that much harder yeah I was interesting I mean you know you you just said\nYou just sit and talk to everybody who's\nAn employee of uh usually corporations\nYou know mom and pops in small businesses a little bit different than as this should be yeah um I Would think um they have some really ... that are owners of small businesses mom and pops too but um they shouldn't be a difference I Would hope they would know the way they run a business because\nYou know you should treat people you know you should remember how you felt you know it's one thing I Try to do all the time is I Try to remember\nWhenever I see a young couple that his two or three little kids and everything I Try to go back to you know what your mom when I went through ... you know financially and you know and and everything and and it's it's really a it was the ... did some of the best of our lives there's no doubt about it\nWould I won't have to do it again I'm probably not but I Would write and uh so you know I think that um\nI just you know I just I just feel sorry for these people who get up and and they don't want to go to work ... I mean that's the last thing they want to do and it's going to happen in the corporate world\nMore than anything it's you know I'm the way they treat each other and undercut each other and try to get out of each other\nMhm well speaking of corporate you know I was talking about that story earlier\nSo this is about that um\nThis kid who I Know I'm going to mess up his name was ... color Russia as well as I Am than\nNo regard it as I you know on a um ... it looks like a great great got a well anyway he was working as a paralegal her company um it was like a two hundred\nEmployee ... one of those big firms anyway and he was in um college and working as a paralegal and also he was um like a psychology major and everything so\nAnyway he actually well in the ... the paralegal then he was working for the firm was actually an e discovery which does for you know ... computer forensics and all that stuff they're like lawyers and everything else well so he started working on this case after Katrina happened for all the insurance agency of it all the stuff that\nSo he was going through when you do the discovery has to do a lot of sifting through paperwork and all that other stuff you know so I mean\nUm it became one of the things that he had this great idea where he's like\nI have an idea where you can like sit through it a lot quicker but it'd be a program and so the lawyers are the people he worked for\n... ... I didn't want him to do anything because they say here's our problem we charge a good bit of money and it takes us a lot so like the more time we put into they would lose building our right to exactly Lulu yeah he they told him to shut up about it so he made the you know thing where he said oh\nOkay well you know I just don't let you guys know that if I quit my job today with you and I went into my own thing I could start my own job or a ... company because of this idea is that good of course I was a ... I mean that's fair so anyway I mean I probably would have said the same thing\nMight along yeah is this is talk talk though I Know but anyway well they fired him\nAnd turns out so they ended up suing him\nBecause it must have been a good idea uh-huh [laughter]\nWell and the funny thing is if he didn't he didn't tell the entire idea he just kind of told him I have a great idea sure it can help but also shot so and when they heard Les ... such shut up basically will because the first year like why would they not want that you know ... and so anyway\nWhere they decided to um you know they turn around soon because they were scared he was going to share their trade secrets and all that whatnot whatever everything anyway\nHe decided to launch his own\nCompany ... and with that\nWe're going to come back so you got to come back to the next\nListen while he lost his company where we come back we're going to find out what it is huh what it is yeah soccer right uh-huh [laughter] so great and when we come back we'll talk about small business ...

I really don't want to be prosecuting the sky but I've been assigned the case so what can I Do then she tells the jury or you may not like me for bringing this case I'm not winning any popularity contest for doing so art psychologically nothing could be worse than to tell a jury\nThat you're not winning any popularity caught as because if you're telling them that that's like telling them the majority of people outside that courtroom\nDon't even want this guy to be prosecuted and by necessary extension if they come back with a verdict a guilty they are going against the majority of people garden\nIn his final summation unbelievably telling the jury nobody wants to hurt this guy we don't you know there's nothing personal here but the law's the law if you're telling the jury that nobody wants to hurt this guy art you're telling them that virtually everyone outside that courtroom was pulling for him\nSoon as she did set up a popularity contest by saying that one would she lost\nMhm yes very very good articulation but they were not force fought all the prosecution has the burden of proof and it's difficult to meet that bird and if you're not forceful they were not forceful here's darn summation telling the jury\nOn this question of whether Mr Simpson was guilty or not guilty that's a tough question and I'm Glad I'm not in your shoes are you realize what that was that a saying that's almost telling the jury that this is a reasonable doubt case\nAnd and the prosecutors should be conveyed to the jury of course that that the evidence of guilt is so overwhelming that you shouldn't have any difficulty at all coming back with a guilty verdict here's Darden saying boy that's a tough question I'm Glad I'm not in your shoes\nIt's beyond incompetence art or the ... the book\nHas many many instances where we're getting into the area of unprecedented unheard of bizarre unique and it's because of these revelations\nThat the media did not see the media was seen what they expected to see and what they expected to see what's competent prosecutors taking care of business they didn't see what it was actually in front of them now that they're seeing the American people are seeing what actually happened during this trial this is why the word of mouth on outrageous such that a shot the number one\nSure a clerk obviously at the beginning of the gates thought she had a slam dunk right right right um do you think at any point during the case she realized what did you never realize that it was becoming less and less slam dunk is they went along\nWell you know I wasn't down there but by everyone I've spoken to near the end they were very very worried and they would have settled for a hung jury at the end but at the beginning you're right uh she thought I was a slam dunk case right but not at the end not at the end\n... except to blame for that whole love bit right pretty much a is a ... or should Clark Sam steward in his face and said no\nWalk Clark was the chief prosecutor and the co prosecutor was a dark and a clock knew about what was going to happen she apparently was opposed to it but not enough to say no you can't do this if she had intervened and said no\nYou're not going to do that it would not have happened here's another area now of unbelievable incompetence we've everyone's talked in the country about the fact that even the first year law student is not going to conduct a serious experiment in court like this could backfire you\nWithout knowing what the results going to be an advanced ... everyone knows that but there's another aspect of that bluff demonstration and no one's talked about and I talk about it in the book that's perhaps even more incompetent and it goes it goes to the next issue the first issue as you don't conduct the experiment unless you know what's going to happen in advance\nThe second issue is if you do conduct the experiment how do you conduct it\nNow it was the position of gardening park that even though those gloves had shrunk\nAnd even those Simpson was wearing latex gloves they still would have fit him if Simpson hadn't prevented the fed by the way he positioned his hand\nWhat a fifth him if Simpson hadn't prevented the fed by the way he positioned his hands and fingers or\nWhen he was putting the gloves on and fact darn argue to the jury Simpson faked it to use the word Simpson fake that\nThose gloves art were extremely important pieces of evidence and as a prosecutor you don't turn over any evidence in any case to the defense of all people in the face of this earth and have him tell you if there's a match obviously what you do it if if you want to find out if there's a fit\nYou have a third party put the gloves on him\nFeeling his hands and fingers along the way to make sure he doesn't do anything to inhibit the fifth let me give you a ... not the best parallel but I think it goes straight to the point say the police find a gun on someone's person or or are in their home and they suspected the murder weapon what they do of course they testify or the weapon and then they take the test fired bullets\nAnd they put it under a comparison microscope with the evidence bullets and see if the strike Asians are markings on the test fired bullets match up all the evidence bull if they they don't turn the gun over to the defendant and tell him to conduct the test and report back to them that's absurd what what you have here and this may sound\nToo when I say it but I'm trying to be cuter sarcastic but this is in essence what you had here and it's unbelievable\nGarden give Simpson the gloves and in effect tell Simpson if these gloves fifth you're in trouble if they don't fit you might be able to walk out of court and play golf now knowing that advanced that if these gloves don't fit you might be able to walk out of your tell us the OJ to these gloves fit\nDarden literally turn the gloves or the Simpson and let him be incomplete charge and be the ones that decide if there's a fifth that's beyond incompetence are that's getting into the area of unprecedented on her to\nA you don't you don't make charges though beyond incompetence in other words yeah\nAbsolutely not knowing that there are people that say well maybe they want it to lose there was a pay off or whatever no no no these are good people they wanted to win a but they just did not know how to try try\nA criminal case and and what I told you so far we're just touching the surface\nAll right well let's let's go back to the beginning remember when they began to produce the domestic abuse or evidence right\nOr there was a kind of a controversy about how much of that to present and I think that the prosecution got the sense that some jurors specifically specifically burned them around for example that seemed almost put off\nBy the domestic abuse testimony or you know the shaking of heads we couldn't see all of that but apparently that was going on and so that convinced them to lay off that aspect that\nMay or may not be true and I don't hit them too hard in the book on that point although I certainly would have presented more domestic abuse evidence\nI Would have presented evidence for instance that the Simpson had stock they put no evidence of stock in All right that's a symptom that stock Nicole and her boyfriend she go to restaurants and he'd go to restaurants and set a couple of tables away and stare at them for a half hour you know I Would put that on\nThere was evidence that he was carrying through the window observing her or doing things other men\nHe was following her around uh uh uh in her car he'd be behind her she was at Starbucks once with with a Ron Goldman and and a friend Ron Goldman and he pulls up ... the car very angry and tells her\nTo come over to the car orders over to the car this was just a couple of months before the ... I think this would have been good evidence but that's not the main\nReason why I've been criticizing them for their handling of this case but I Do think they should have put on more domestic violence evidence\nOr at the jury seemed very impressed when they went to OJ's home aside from the ... the elegance of the home and all the rest of it but there ... there was a white robes and it was white a white rug white rock and they seem very impressed that uh if there had been all this blood where it was the blood on the white wrote\nWhy should there be any blood at all why should there be any blood at all the night of the murders\nThis guy has blood in his bronco his coroners home when they interviewed him at at uh one three five PM the day after the murders this was before now this is before they withdrew any blood from his arm it would have been any opportunity to plan for sprinkle it\nThey they said oh gee we got a problem here you've got blood in your bronco the driveway in your home how common and I like I told you he said he admits he said I caught myself last night I was bleeding how did you cut yourself OJ he's or is the exact words I don't know okay\nWe're not we're not we're not talking about ... neck or scratch you were talking about deep cuts to the ... left middle finger and in fact it was ban is at the time they're interrogating him and he says he has no idea how he got that cut so what I'm saying is that right he admits he admits that around the very same top up around the very same time of these murders\nWe'd have to believe that Simpson innocently cut himself very badly on his left middle finger and I think art\n... we're talking about being a numbers here the astronomical problems and look against something like that happening I Want out of five million one out of a million and when you cut yourself unless you're in a frantic frenzied state or is he must have been in you stop the bleeding with your hand you're happy kitten you put on a fan if you don't bleed all over the place you're so there was blood twenty five\n... watches a blood were taken from the bronco there was another twenty stains that we're not even taken because they were representative\nAll there was nine blood drops on the driveway there were five in the ...\nOne in the bathroom and if the juror said why wasn't there more why should there been even one blood drop on the night of these murders\nI recall some comment about going out to his bronco to fetch the cellular phone or something like that and he's already got cup when he did no no no no that's what the media is at ... and we're the bottom of the ... and we'll be right back after you uh it's called the outrage is number\nOn the New York times best seller list you're\nRun out and get it I Know you want this is a good\nAre listening to orange boom boom ... tonight between goes to goes down from July twenty bird Nineteen nineties [noise]\nThe main pieces of evidence in this case other than that that tape but I just told you you give me a hundred dollars and yellow pat I would've convicted him on that thirty two minute interrogation alone but the main\nItem of evidence against Simpson was his blood was that the murder saying okay\nThere was blood on the ... gate or which was also his\nSounded later though yeah no no no no it was collected later not found later no it was it was it was seen that night by five detectors all of whom will testify not collected that night\nAnd that was not collecting 'cause Dennis Fong was the criminal list and he did not pick it up that night and things like that happen that just in confidence to use picking up blood everywhere I mean it was awash in blood there and he did not pick up the evidence from the ... it would seem that night there was even a photograph of two to three blood stains that night taken by the LAPD that night\nOut they claimed that the stands on the ... gate were planted\nI'm Talking about the defense I was going on they claim that the glove in Rockingham was planet they claim that blood in the Broncos plan as they claim that ... that the socks and Simpsons bedroom but we're we're a planet\nBut even these defendants who I mean defense attorneys who possess the golden adds a ten thousand elephants even they even they did not\nHave the guts to allege that the five blood drops in for which were immediately to the left or the killers bloody shoe prince leaving the crime scene even they did not allege that they were planted here's what they alleged\nThey loved those blood drops there were exposed to the elements and lost all of their DNA\nBecause of the rules of element bacteria sunlight what have you and later on when they were on a cotton swab churches at FIT scientific investigation division of LAPD a piper tack\nThat those five blood drops became contaminated with blood from Simpsons reference while they had no proof of that no evidence but they said they the\nThe S. I. D. with a pool of contamination and possibly happen which is not that they had no evidence in any of that in any event\nMarsha Clark then did not come back and make two very very obvious arguments I'm no expert on DNA but I Know enough about being able to tell you this\nThat that if if in fact if in fact there had been cross contamination and she didn't make these arguments those five blood drops would have had ... P. A. and M. E. D. P. A.\nIs an anti ... it's a preservative that is added to blood taken from a PR for up from a suspects are right but in the reference wild and they put ...\nThese five blood drops did not have the BPA in that she didn't tell the jury that inner summation\nIt came out of the trial but she did not argue that in her final summation is true that there could not have been cross contamination 'cause if there had been there would have been ETA number two if there had been cross contamination and this is a separate independent reason why there was not cross contamination\nThe DNA would have been a lot higher on those five ... because uh if if the blood team from the if if the blood ah on those cotton swatch is actually at the DNA\nOn those blood on the cotton swabs has came from the reference vile there wouldn't have been any degradation at all whereas the blood drops taken from the scene had in fact the greatest because the sunlight\nThe moisture in the bacteria in fact only a PC our DNA tests was was conducted on for the blood drops in an R I felt the more precise type was conducted on the fifth so there had been degradation\nBut if there was cross contamination\nAnd it actually was the blood from the reference vile there would have been no degradation and the DNA would have been very very high she didn't make these too obvious arguments so what I'm telling you is that every single time\nThe defense made an argument to try to explain away or a ... evidence the ... response in time it was mind boggling incompetent\nMind boggling All right in the final submissions ah\n... the race card was played obviously and um how would you do if you were to switch positions hard for you I'm sure right but would you have done that\nNo no no it's okay to vigorously defend someone even though you know that they're guilty of a crime you can vigorously defend them but you don't fraudulently inject race into the case as these defense attorneys did you don't falsely accused innocent police officers of the conspiracy\nThese defense attorneys know that Simpsons guilty and they and they know there was no frame of they have to know that\nSo they went beyond the proper bounds of at a ... of advocacy they went way beyond that\nSo far that somebody ought to be taking it to the bar\nWell I'm not going to say that because this type of thing happens in court as it happens in court and and and lawyers are given tremendous latitude in court but I I don't think it was ethical at all\nBut do you remember when you do what you have to do\nWell ah some lawyers do and and these dead and I thought they were an ethical but whether it's grounds for intervention by the bar or not I don't know\n[noise] um I thought he was guilty I still think that he was guilty I always thought so however right at one time at one point during the trial\nA when there was a motion to suppress ... do the little tiny spot of blood zone in the bronco initially and then jumping the fence I saw the dot motion should have succeeded or do you have any comment on the\nWell I don't think so both the judges are Kathleen Paul Kennedy at the lunar and hearing and Ito at the trial ruled that a Simpsons Fourth Amendment rights were not violated um\nWhat what what you had here is rocking ... only about two miles away from Bundy and these are the the the please the detectors felt that it almost looked like an extension of the um of of the crime scene they go there\nAnd they find a bottom blood spot of blood above the door handle a ... on the bronco bats that alone is not enough to go over the fence but here here's the additional evidence and circumstances that the judges felt constitute a sufficient cause to go over the fence without a search warrant\nAll they had been told the detective vi ... that's a Security Agency that worked for Simpson right that\nThere was a a a a living made they've been told that they live in may now they went to the phone they called inside the residents they also rang entered calm at the gate no one answered inside even though there was supposed to be living made their lights on inside the house there were two cars in the driveway\nAnd those circumstances are called excellent excellent circumstance and justifying going over the wall because they're maybe someone might be dead or hurt that needs immediate attention now once they got over the wall and solve blood on the uh a drive\nBut once they got over the wall and solve blood on the driveway and in the fall you ate cetera then of course Simpson became a suspect that point\nHe was a suspect only in a in a generic sense that when a wife or former wife is murder the husband or former husband there immediately people that detectives are routinely check out\nBut that was a close call though well it may even a close call at the point before they jumped ... cents yeah\nBut there were quite a few things and the cans of them that some someone maybe inside a who needs help because with the lights on and two cars in the driveway and they're supposed to be living made how come no one's answering the phone\nCheryl sure All right judge Ito I'm right with your comments on judge Ito through the trial was he a duty bend over to our backwards was he afraid of appeals ruling a that would overturn and everything\nI think all judges are afraid of that I think he was democratic or in his incompetence but he was trying to he was very conscious need any try conscientious and he tried to be fair to both sides\nYou made some terrible rulings or perhaps his worst ruling was allowing the defense to get into the race issue\nA bus far the defense attorneys have gotten all the blame from the American people\nAre not injecting race into the case and they they deserve all the blame that they're getting and then somebody Ito prior to my book has gotten a free ride on this issue he doesn't get a free ride on my book I blame him a one hundred percent for allowing this case to turn into a racial case and the reason I Do is that he allowed the defense attorneys to do it and he shouldn't have done that\nUnder three fifty two of the California evidence code if the relevance of evidence offered in this case we're talking about whether affirmative use the N word right in the past ten years that relevance is substantially outweighed by the probability of prejudice the opposing side you keep it out\nIn here the relevance affirming using the N. word in the past ten years was extremely remote at best I mean it's a non factor\nAny broad jump of Olympian proportions to conclude that just because someone has used the N. word or even as a racist that they're going to go round framing innocent people murder but the probability of prejudice for the prosecution\nWas more than the requisite substantial was monumental so under three fifty two of the evidence code you should have kept it out it was an egregiously pour ruling on his part after\nHe ruled that way as you know the firm and tape surfaced sure and it changed the complexion of the entire trial if you know didn't want to follow the law do you want the ... uh uh at the law common sense common sense which he had precious little love throughout this entire trial\nWould have Nick paid it to him that you don't allow the defense to do that\nSingle day thousands of white police officers arrest or investigate black suspects does anyone really believe that when these thousands upon thousands of cases come to court\nThat's perfectly proper ask every one of these officers if he's ever used the N. word in the ... and you can show we did have a separate satellite trial on that issue which is exactly what happened in the ... case and that's absurd on his face Ito was off base here\nIn the prosecution had to pay for those sins but even with the bad ruling by Ito\nThe prosecution knew how to handle the ferman situation they could have mitigate the damage substantially I don't know if we don't have time to get into it but they they could not have handled the firm's situation worse we have time we can get into it\nWeren't a how much general blame do you do you lay on the LAPD\nNot that much uh they did an adequate job all they could have been better no question about it but the media are they somehow thought that uh the LAPD lost his case before I came to try I don't believe that for a moment you put any

somebody said to me she was right because I paid for an alarm system for a for for for my house\nAnd he says I never had a problem I said well you know you roll the dice you came out ahead you know I've had peace of mind all these years and there's so many people say well I don't want to spend the money it's expensive it's too expensive\nYou know I Am not saying blow the money you know what I'm saying pick the right people would spend the money\nRight right so in terms of that so even if you have a resourceful person so let's say I'm I'm the head of my family I Am a go\nGetter I find the time to do the things I Need to do so I decided I'm going to save some money and put the effort into using one of the online wells which I'll tell you those surfaces are very good say actually\nServe a very good purpose and you can find yourself learning a lot in educating yourself at the end of that process you feel very good about what she created however then fast forward to the time that she passed away\nAnd whomever you left in charge rather use made executor whoever you make trustee if you've got trust involve\nThat person then picks up the ball and the hand that they've got the documents in their hands but they don't have a contact from they don't have a contact person so now you've added at least two sets of their lives the first step is the state's out an interview and find an attorney to help them through the process\nThe second step is that from that\nThen picks up your paperwork may not have all of the back story that they need to truly be working in your favor all that they've got is what's in black and white and sometimes they're great issues that arise and those attorneys have no information from\nSo while you said yourself some money and done all this yourself you've effectively passed on more work to the people that you leave in charge when you're gone now perhaps you have you know just a a stable very um\nResilient go getters who despite their grief are going to be able to do that but it's not something I recommend I I understand that some people just don't have the fun\nBut if you have the funds it's one of the best places to to hire an expert in really have someone there and play for you\nKnow so what do you ... ... decisions I don't want to see there's a difference between being should we be ignorant people just turn on the other way and they think well this is going to be easy oh ... oh just what you might have said you have to each kid or I Will um\nUh give so much with Germany and a lot of it was obviously individual individually oriented and they don't even think about well who should be the trust of the year after that it was a good solid basis who should be addressed\nThe the executives and then you've got to be darned careful because it gets very entangled families expand\nAnd all of a sudden you have the repercussions that could happen to for your your daughter or your son is married and they just three or four grandchildren how should the money but yeah I was a kid at all I'm not sure I trust my son in law and put it in my daughter's name already put her to the kids may have paid out over X number of years\nTaking some some event because not do those on this is ... she was ... and you do you the advice of are professionals in their\nRight right so ... and first I'll start off with the professional Google which of course isn't\nBut if people who don't have professionals in place if you simply Google does make secular do what is a trustee do you know if you think that that list purposely matches and I'm just going to use it very\nSexist maybe outdated idea that it was hung around a lot of families choose if they have children the oldest son is going to be to try to stay in the executor and you look down those less than you think is the oldest son the one who should be doing this at eight to begin with\nAnother individual may be better\nBe you may find that just because of the way that the family operates it may be better to take family out of that picture altogether I'm ... and in terms of\nYour idea of things expanding and changing over time you know there are we live lives just society where there are second marriages um we also live in our society now we're seeing more and more people unfortunately you know falling to addiction\nAnd you have a child who is facing addiction then you face the\nOption of trying to protect them from getting too much money at the wrong time right it's not that ah this person is worth less than should get lots of this person really for their health needs to be protected from having\nA you know too much liquidity for lack of better words and you know at their ... their ability to get a hold of money so in a state plant here I'm saying don't procrastinate get it done and then you'll feel so good you do continue to look at it over time you look at it three years later five\nYears later when there's been a change when

charging for parking in this resort fees and you know all the things you write about it you feel like there were kind of at\nThat kind of point in some of the the city fathers and mothers are looking at this and saying are we going to make some decisions\nYeah I ... I think uh if it depends on who you ask because I think the casinos are definitely in denial about it or even A L v CVA the convention or visitors authority have not addressed it in any real way but I Am on Twitter\nAll day and all night and I will tell you that the travel patterns the behavior patterns of Las Vegas visitors have changed and they've changed based upon a perception of value\nVegas has always been perceived as a value destination as you said it is now perceived as the place you go to be nickel and dime and I think people have always been willing to pay for an extraordinary experience but what they are not they have clearly stated they're not willing to pay for\nIs things like parking that they've always got for free doesn't matter how many other cities have paid parking it's not relevant because it's all about perception they perceive that resort\nFees are Vegas problem there resort sees it other resorts in the world it truly doesn't matter there are a the other day who literally reported on\nA there was a fee at an uh an ex caliber restaurant called a Dix last resort they started charging Seventy five cents for a glass of tap water\nAnd the Internet freaked out and it\nWhat it does is there is a critical mass of the perception of get every penny out of me\nCosts for free information and one eight hundred six zero seven eighty nine forty five that's one eight hundred six zero seven eighty nine forty five again one eight hundred six zero seven eight nine four or five\nAre you ready to leave your corporate job behind him be your own boss\nHave you ever dreamed of owning a business\nDo you have fifty thousand dollars or more sitting around in a four O. one K.\nIf you answered yes it's time to invest in yourself by buying or starting a business or franchise\nIrish code allows you to use money you know four one K. to invest it a business with absolutely no penalties are taxes that guy didn't financial we've helped more than a eleven thousand entrepreneur is invest three billion dollars in retirement assets into those small businesses and franchises or their dreams\nSo if you've got fifty thousand dollars or more in a four O. one K. and you're looking for a way to start a business called guy didn't financial now for free information and to learn more operators are standing by for your call\nEight hundred five seven six six three oh eight hundred five seven six six three oh eight hundred five seven six six three oh that's eight hundred five seven no sixty six thirty\nAnd saying oh boy I'm Katie WN and candy I ... at ... ... talk radio dot com [noise]\nTo to Vegas favors leave we see the ... [noise]\nWell that's a good friend Scott rope and if I don't make that calm sending a fan of session with us discussing some of the perceptions about Las\nVegas in the days thanks in part to new cause\nThink slots are tighter I think when I go to certain places there are places where I just know that was not a pleasant experience there was no value that's not entertainment and a lot of the discussion is happening around younger people millennials that they're not gambling well\nAny age if you're not having fun why are you going to gamble and millennials are so smart they've got a game on their phones for money or not money whatever like why am I going to sit in front of this machine and if I'm not getting value so I I think uh it really speaks a question about is Vegas at a turning point I think it is\nAnother layer of this that you did not ask about is Vegas is being confronted by the fact that ... is everywhere\nIt used to have a monopoly used to have a monopoly on sports betting it used to have a monopoly in gambling overall well that is everywhere the term in the business world has come out\nTo have a monopoly in gambling overall well that is everywhere the term in the business world has come out of this nation it is a commodity that is in New Jersey that's in California it's on the the Indian reservations is\nGambling is everywhere and people tend to uh it's a nurse or right it's like I'm if I'm near if I got a place to gamble near my house to drive Vegas but I don't have to travel to Vegas and now if you give me that extra reason of I'm getting nickel and dime\nI'm going to that a casino on that reservation so that's a huge aspect of this too there's a lot of different aspects international travel has become more difficult um there's a multiple factors but a lot of that is tangibly going to affect\nThe ability to Vegas Vegas casinos to make money and to expand and build new things and that's always sad for me because I liked shiny new things\nAnd wants to talk about and what the possible solutions are I mean we can see while the numbers have been flat here in downtown Los Vegas they managed to keep going up and I think because people do sense of value there and we have all these beautiful arenas sports teams entertainers coming there\nIs that the way they're going to try to approach just up and do you think it's going to make the you know all of a sudden is going to become a a high in Branson, Missouri\nAll friends that I don't know too much of France and uh so I can draw any a parallel but I think the uh\nThere is going to be a moment of reckoning and I think it is already happening because uh obviously these big companies are watching their bottom line there watching their earnings reports on their stock prices and they've been hit hard and I think they're going to be hit hard over the next six months as well\nDo you have is stating numbers in terms of uh occupancy and room revenue because room prices are at free or next to fray in in a way that's never actually been true in Vegas so they're they're going to have those moments where they really have to think about\nWhat are we providing what makes Vegas special\nYou know do we have to roll back some of these fees that we've ruled out\nOr do we have to find other sources of revenue there they're going to have to ask a lot of serious serious questions and they're going to have to think about it holistically which is not happening at the moment every a casino companies are saying well you know we have these mitigating factors and we have these other other things that are affecting\nWhat's unfolding but I think the city itself has to think about what it\nWhat is Vegas going to be and what is it going to offer and it and is it that important I Know they're making a lot of money from some of these fees but is it is it that important when you're stepping over a dollar to pick up a dime because that's what's happening\nAny predictions leave us with some happy happy thoughts that maybe we can look for in the next year or two\nWell I think people that like sports are going to be really happy\nOr the raiders or creating a lot of excitement they don't have the best team at the moment I'm not a sports expert is not looking good ah Vegas nights obviously has had a huge amount of support mainly among locals but\nA ... for for people that are into sports I've heard rumors about a baseball team up for you know\nThere's this new deal with the the Las Vegas fifty ones and the athletics is that a sports team\nOr they're going to be the farm team for that uh so I think it's a great time to be a sports person\nA it there are a lot of concern or is supposed to stick to the positive stuff but there's a lot of concerns that some of these venues that are being built a is fear or\nA ... at the Venetian there's this stadium that there's not a lot of acts that can fill these venues so that's also of concern a the\nThe ah another great bit of news is going to be the Las Vegas convention center right so that's presumably going to draw a new a kind of scale for conventions Vegas is\nGoing to start being convention driven because that casual traveler maybe isn't as important to the casinos as that convention here who has a credit card and can spend whatever they want\nA the the other bright side is that uh I ... I think it has to do with the strong survive\nAnd uh some so to me that's good news is you weed out there to too much room inventory the good places to provide value we're going to survive the others are going to have a struggle it's going to be the same time as well um\nSo beyond sports I I got to say I think there when the casinos do have this kind of vision adjustment they're going to start realizing hey\nPlayers will go to somewhere that has a hundred times object perhaps\nIt's better than the two times three times five times so I think there are some of already done it when as roll back in the parking policy or they had paid parking they still do but if you spend fifty dollars you get your parking validated so those\nKind of tests and those kind of adjustments are going to be made and I say I think that's all part of the positive\nThanks Scott you can hear Scott each week a Vegas never sleeps and you can read his blog daily at by Vegas dot com timed out of each one of the giants and the world of wine\nAs\nEvery now and then you're fortunate enough to me a real superstar in a particular field mentioned meeting Babe Ruth in the world a baseball Neal Armstrong if you're going to talk to astronauts we have such a person with us today you're going to meet one somebody a any of ... the first one in the United states mind you\nFascinating guy he also has a great book that we'll talk more about a little later called power entertaining and it's just a whole philosophy and how you can combine the great taste the wind the the finest wind up buying as foods with selling a particular product or service but we'll get into that first I Want to\nAsk Eddie how did you get into this 'cause you know you always want to find out how did that guy really do that first thing so what made you get into the world of wines\nWell let me say this way first of all I grew up in New Jersey got a degree in psychology before jumped on the treadmill life to work so nine years old buddies said hey let's let's go to California so we went down to a travel agency 'cause back then that's how you did it\nWe got a one way ticket to California will get a summer job or work our way back and she looked at us and she said boys could back then we were boys she said for another Ninety five dollars you felt if you go to Honolulu\nYou know all of a sudden boom or in Waikiki diamonds and talk to the side so you know I I'm I decided I Need to stay a little longer before I Know this this summer vaporize mom's calling maybe a machine or a message on my answering machine when you're coming home so I fired back when convenient for me at three o'clock in the mornings which you wouldn't get hit and miss it ...

to get this thing from you know\nFrom paper it out there and the ... the you know out there in the marketplace and so yeah very impressive but you got the ... and you know you nailed it on so many points with what you just said whenever we watch these home improvement shows and design at a diner is just one of the best out there I Love your stuff on there but people get overwhelmed it's like sitting down a cookbook is such a good analogy\nBecause it's kind of like telling someone who doesn't have a lot of confidence in the kitchen why don't you prepared to huge twelve course meal for royalty that's\nHow people look at home decorating sometimes they see a blank wall a blank slate and they just go deer in headlights you know that's been me a couple of times I've got a you know reasonably well decorated home but it can be overwhelming so the idea of a cook book it's brilliant no one's ever done this before that don't you take a look at this website Kelly Edwards ... dot com

shows between now and Halloween if you have an idea for a fabulous Halloween costume I Want to hear from you I Want to hear all of your ideas and especially\nIf a costume comes in at oh here's another thing and Tony wanted me to ask about this to reusing costumes how do you feel about using a costume year after year I'm finding that my son\nMy now eleven year old son couldn't care less if you weren't his Minecraft costume which is actually a really good one year after year because he is still just as much into Minecraft has ever what is the\nSocietal expectations when it comes to Halloween costumes ... do you have to switch it up year after year or can you go with the same ... in great shape still very warm very wearable costume year after year and make it super\nEasy on off you know what I Hope the answer to be but I Love your input find me online WWW really vote and living dot com everybody out for a second we get back out of the brain off real estate right after this\nYou know there there's no reason for mortgage interest rates to go down for example you know money the cost of my mortgage interest rate is just across the money and the cost of money is driven by supply and demand and as our economy gets better\nCompanies are going to be needing more and more money to invest the returns are going to be getting better and better so is the demand for money goes up what's gonna happen to the interest rate going to go look at like a lot and it's going to go up interest rates ain't going to be coming down folks they are going to be going up so now is the best time you're going to have for the rest of your home buying lifetime to make that first by a good thing\nIt is a good thing so that's come either from a slightly different perspective you're a homebuyer and you and your significant other you've you've looked at your financial condition you looked at what else you need to do\nMaybe there's private school tuition for the kids maybe there's a new car maybe there is home repairs and need to be done et cetera et cetera et cetera but let's just say that yes you've decided that you want to buy that different house or you want to make that move up by\nBut that you only want to spend for monthly principal in interest somewhere between two thousand twenty dollars and two thousand and fifty dollars a month okay sounds good\nAlready so let's just take a look at what you could do with that two thousand twenty two thousand fifty dollars a month out yeah so mortgage interest rates right now are about four and a half percent so if you took out a mortgage for four hundred thousand dollars you could\nPay two thousand twenty six dollars a month for that four hundred thousand dollar mortgage okay now if interest rates go up to four point seven five percent and you want to keep your payment between two thousand twenty two thousand fifty dollars a month right now I'm kind of get them out in the weeds you know medical you'd wind up paying two thousand thirty four dollars for a month but you could only afford a mortgage for three hundred and Ninety thousand\nDollars and that does cut down the inventory of homes that you can shock from\nTheir down the inventory relative to shop for no interest rates get all the way up to five percent oh my God [laughter] and you still want to keep it\nIn two thousand one in two thousand fifty dollars a month well you could pay two thousand forty dollars a month for that interest rate of five percent but then the home the mortgage loan that you could take out would be only\nThree hundred and eighty thousand dollars yup so interest rates go up by half a percent\nYour purchasing power has gone down from the mortgage of four hundred thousand dollars to a mortgage is ready to leave thousand dollar credible okay no same thing if interest rates go up to five and a quarter percent and five and a half percent likewise\nYour mortgage purchasing power is going to go down three hundred and Seventy thousand dollars for an interest rate of five and a quarter three hundred and sixty thousand dollars for an interest rate of five and a half yes\nSo it's coming at it from a slightly different way than what we talked about with the combination of\nRising prices and rising interest rates but regardless of how you want a slice of the combination of rising interest rates and rising prices for homes is going to slice into your purchasing power in the future so the best time to make that move is now now's the time the best time to make that move is not get the\nFact that it's falling you know you might have it in your head I feel one point before I knew more about real estate I think you know it's summer time to time to do and it's fall hold off on that no way next summer is light years away when it comes to\nEconomic news when it comes to rates when it comes to your own personal finances and read the tea leaves to get out there play pen to paper and figure out what you can afford and get the ball rolling on you\nKnow another thing about you know some people are saying well you know John I'm I'm starting to see some reports that housing prices are actually starting to come down wow\nWell really yeah already well let's take a look at some of the facts around that situations just like a Disney calling to [laughter] yep like a one of my heroes or former President Reagan used to say facts are stubborn things that they are\nThey just kinda sit there and look at you and they don't move that's right but uh for an example\nOver the last several years a national home values increased by more than six percent annually okay who's kind of started out for like two thousand twelve two thousand Thirteen 'cause we had the big bubble busted in two thousand eight two thousand twelve two thousand Thirteen we hit the bottom yeah and since then we've been going up ... percent a year\nThat's that's probably unsustainable what we're doing is kind of recovering from that last time right out in two thousand eight to two thousand twelve to flee time so if you had a home or three hundred thousand dollars at the beginning of one of those years it'd be worth three hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars by the end of the year but at the appreciation falls to four percent mhm\nTo three hundred thousand dollar house would be worth three hundred and twelve thousand dollars at the end of the next year or six thousand dollar different than this I think is what people are reacting to the price of the home didn't fall but it didn't go up by as much as it would have still at six percent appreciation rates right so\nThe price of the home didn't fall it just didn't increase\nThat the previous level snow appreciation rates are expected to end this year at about five percent\nAnd then drop somewhere between four and five percent next year and I've got every expectation that over the course of the next five years we're going to get back to the same rate of annual home price appreciation\nThat we've seen in the United states and Canada three point five three point six three point seven percent a year we're getting back there now All right I'm making up for lost ground than if you if you extended the curves going all the way back to like Nineteen Ninety six a at a rate of about three and a half percent a year you're run 'em out to where we are right now we're getting back very very close to that\nNorm Fred of appreciation line\nBecause you know in Delaware in Chester county or in in our area crispy we had\nA home prices basically double from Nineteen Ninety six to two thousand six and the\n... that's clearly unsustainable rate of about eight percent a year and that was clearly unsustainable so we had to have that result in a bubble which was very very painful for lots and lots and lots of people but no I don't see home prices coming down now they they might in some areas\nAre and the way to get out that folks is to get with a good local realtor who's got his or her hand on the market\nAnd understands what is actually going to be going on in the in the future for okay\nTime flies as usual I think he's got like another time already I guess we'll see you again next week\n[noise]\nTalk news wants to be\nThis\nIs talk news wants to feed your your business as part of our discovery feature which\nHighlights

Avenue which is in San Diego restaurant row and the liberal pulled over and stops at a place called ... last resort which is a place where Twenty one year old throw food at each other and it's like what are we doing here as a whole to Fort\nI get out I mean so for about three minutes come back out open to limit or sit down shut the thing I look everybody in their face and what we've got that locked\nWhat does that mean ... not afraid of anything but that's what I just said and they're all kind of having like a you know what and this then it goes about three or four blocks down some God awful breezy Mexican place he wouldn't take your enemy to go in there I jump in thirty seconds later I'm Out I get back in ...\nOr something they didn't even our name on the\nSide so I don't also worked in Fifth Avenue we've gone nowhere ever is dressed up everybody's getting the angry you know it's like what's happening you know but there are these friends so there are still hanging on and it said to him\nTell you what driverless or try to justify the other one\nSo we're down there by Pacific avenue down by the airport and ah he pulls around the corner a Pacific avenue and he pulls up front of his baby and I said why would try this\nAnd you should have seen their jaws as they were on the floor gone\nPlot I said you guys are wasting time I should get on board a jet\nKnow okay so then they get on board and I'm an\nInner seats are little boats headsets that I bought everybody's a gift to put these on the eve I've been a pilot for thirty five years I Love flying so I told his pilots when this thing goes off the runway I Want this into thinking sixty degree banks people's faces are going to earn\nThat because you can it can do like to do that but you can and I'm so that the jet taxes out on the runway and starts to go down a runner and when I tell the story which is how I end every event a essay imagine is\nThe jet starting to go down the runway and then I dial in very slowly a piece of music and I go anybody recognize this song and the song is called games people play in the middle of the night by who the Allen Parsons project\nAnd Allen Parsons and every concert with this song if you've heard it you know if it's world famous and it does the stones I mean this thing was the claim was just the scans\nWill play in the middle of the night now that all the kids have grown up\nAnd as a thing takes off and this is a blessing and your ears out of the ... magnitude approved champagne and each individual buckets of caviar three minutes ago their bitch and moan and even with pride on which records and also now they all got their own personal bucket of caviar\nAnd champagne I mean they're gone they're gone they're they're jumping up and down and went down on the list goes any\nWhere we go and I said how about how to San Francisco sound maybe a year or so you know forty five minutes there pounding the champagne the wings or bumping like this ever having a good old time one guy looks out the window hey I'd I don't see the water anymore [noise]\nI I don't worry it's getting dark to worry about that one guy looks at the right when Edie Edie as the Eiffel Tower near man that's a San\nFrancisco since reader I just said has Francisco sound maybe this is my birthday Rona Vegas [laughter]\nWe get to Vegas a newly ... got to pull down the middle I won't really go too far in that direction but anyway I Would say that with that data received there and then we go and we go she served as slaves humanity which was pretty outrageous back then it's less now but at the time it was like\nPretty pretty edgy um we walk him with champagne everybody's looking at us like\nWould you get to champagne we didn't see we didn't you had to wear that was offered well it's not offered but to me is you make it happen you know I had a master somebody taking care of me so forty five minutes watching that show and\nOff to post real let's have something good with gangs restaurant I Know of getting pretty well so um we're ... the main table at the center everybody round going on his smells so good we want what they're having and the waiters going or an assault on the menu is white truffles I had flown in last night you know\nOkay let me go to a child a night club you know whether the two hour wait for you know three hundred dollar coverage charge we walk right in right up to get the best table or is it that it was looking at those guys you know and then we wound up a ... one more place and then uh I guess is that when we finished experiment rhino\nBack with more from ... gay and author of power entertaining and he also in just a moment we're listening to Vegas never sleeps with Stephen mangy talk radio network\nAre for sure I mean we have prime rib eye on the menu and we also have a five on the menu some of the best stake in the world so ah we're really proud of our menu and very proud of the state that we put put together\nUm we're also really proud of our service you know are we make sure that you're well taken care of and you feel like you're the only person in the room even though you might be one of four hundred people in the room when\nIt's really important to know what I'm saying it's everything in here right from the from the feel of the place I Know you said you don't want to scare women off women always think of the place where a bunch of guys sit around the smoke cigars any yeah Patty steaks and it's not like that here that it's a whole style thing\nYeah uh well we're definitely not scaring the women off I think that uh we get plenty of ladies in here and we we love that or we have plenty of guys and here's what we really get is a lot of people that are ready to have a good time and it's a great kicked off or your night in Las Vegas\nWell and that's exactly what we want to let people know it's a lot of fun and they didn't want to come with the food now like for example I noticed also getting your menu site orders you've got more site orders and I've seen it virtually any steak restaurant I've been to well\nWe we like to pride ourselves on variety and make sure that there's something for everybody\nAnd you know you talked about steaks and I know everybody wants to know some kind of more than one of the best chefs in the world is going to ask give us the difference between like you know Kobe beef and different levels stay what should we be looking at it from coming in for we want that one of a ... state meal um well\nI mean if looking at a raw steak I mean it's obviously the marveling and a color that you're looking for um if you're looking on a menu to see some are one of the kinds some great great steaks this is a good place to start\nA we do our we do our ribs caps here we do um our Monica shows um I think that uh it's how you cook it and it's the quality that you start with that that puts together a one of a kind of stick\nNow um he always recommend medium rare how does that go\nI actually I Would recommend different different temperatures for different cuts I you know I'd like a fillet I think should be rare or you go to a like a New York maybe mid rare sometimes you might want to take like a flat on steak and take it up to a medium I'm just kind of depends on the on the on the state that you're talking about\nSo what about the guy that come to the you know you must get them all my stuff well done is it like it's a shepherd that almost offensive or something like no no we're going to make this was the best we can well\nI'd like to quote Ronald McDonald in hold the pickles hold the lettuce special orders don't upset us you know um that's where we stand here will cook it just how you like it if you're going to pay for it we're happy to cook it for you and by the way we just want you to have a great time so if you know well done steak that's part of your great time and\nWe're happy to oblige that\n[laughter] [noise] well and and there's an entire meal we we chat or whether you're pastry chef she's great ah is that like it is putting together some as an executive chef it's not just a matter of knowing how to prepare some of these things it's like a whole team effort isn't it\nI I think for sure it's a team effort if it's not just one person for sure I mean you know the service staff my uh the cooks behind my line or are incredibly talented and you know my sous chefs\nAnd of course pastry chef a bridge it is very very talented so when you put us all together we really come up with a great product and we're really proud of it and we'd love to have you come in and check it out for yourself\nWell we certainly will uh you know and you put together that the team like that to personalities come into play I mean you have a certain style everybody knows Gordon Ramsay you actually see him going crazy and yelling at people but I Know all chefs don't work that way you look for a particular personality type well\nPersonalities are important we spend a lot of time together you know we've probably spent ten hours a day five days a week together so that's a big part of your waking weak or you want to have people you can get along with people with like minded a goals and I think we've accomplished that here and it's always a work in progress\nAnd finally let's talk about having a great restaurant and it certainly is a great restaurant in a place like Las Vegas where just in his hotel the cosmopolitan isn't it great restaurants I mean does that get your creative juices going I mean you can just drive within a couple of miles of his place in a sea bury a quite a few great restaurants\nThere's there's a lot of accomplish restaurants as well as accomplished chefs\nAt a very close a purse Timothy to Estee K uh this is this does raise the bar and keeps you challenge to be fresh and to come up with new stuff on a regular basis um you know some of my best friends are the fellow chefs that are\nVery close around 'em so we always get together and and trying to outdo each other as as much as possible it's just kind of the nature of being a chef you know the the ego thing I guess\nWell that's kinda cool so you guys do you you are friends that isn't like you know buying give dirty looks to some of the other restaurants in town\nNow no I mean the color of their community and in Las Vegas is very tight and uh we all have a great respect for each other and um we're always a happy for each other's successes and and more happy to be the one successful\nAnd like every other great restaurant you've got a great cocktail lounge and so forth here and winds were important that plays a big part of what you do what you have to have the right vintages and so forth to really match the food\nOh yeah I think that uh the the vintages for the wine and the types of wine and you know uh what's in style with the wind and what people are going for with the wind is is very important um we have a great ... a wind program here so we're proud of that as well\nYou are listening to executive chef Steven hock craft of S.

and after\nThis morning we have been that's a hard in with the subversive gardener joining us this morning to talk a little bit about the real uh gardening and some chips and tricks and what people need to think about\nUm I ran into business has ever mentioned up there at the heirloom vegetable expert that we were just an accident yeah and so therefore we were able to get some info and we're glad to have run the show good morning but that said welcome\nMorning thank you for having how're you doing\nA great great yeah it's a beautiful down here in San Diego right now it long I mean I like it is partly cloudy\nYeah I've got a rare for a year in the seventies and we love it or ...\nBut um but we're really excited because for us\nExactly but um we're really excited because for us the whole\nGuerilla gardening idea this is the time of year that we plan for the time you that we implemented because we're getting into the mall where it's a time of year for people to go out plants easy to do this right now we're where you're at Vanessa I'm\nDo people do the same way or is this something they wait until the spring and where is she which they are so\nRight now I'm actually I'm In New York I'm In New York in New York City I'm at the moment I'm by the time I I'm actually I've been I've been here for about seven months so my experience gardening in the states and I was in London for ten\nYears before it would make beer in London was also quite to pay them more extensive\nSo I can tell you what what I east coast people as well as as I should say west coast has of Europe do and I can say the right now if you're going to be guerilla gardening a lot of people are actually gardening um rather planting bald shortly before the ring or\nThey're uh they're planting um different types of of of cabbage really because that's one of the I guess the hardy is a type of um of plants that you can you know the weather at least you know perhaps a foster to before they get completely covered with snow\nOh okay I'm In Minnesota does a little bit about yourself and and how you got into this idea and let me clarify for our listeners to um subversive subversive Gardner so tell us about the name and where you came up with that as well please\n[noise] well I'm a little while ago um I was actually I was a I was studying ah I'm studying abroad and I was on\nDuring the day I'd be at university and in the evenings\nI Would either have to obviously do my homework on or I decided that I really wanted to get on and so I got together with a crew of gorilla gardeners in London um without you know ten years ago or so\nAnd we go out in the evenings and we would and we would garden different laws to round about the media and in in the city\nAnd the more I garden the more I realized that I Would have to say go to school in the morning with\nEither a shovel or bag of soil commute I Would get a lot of\nWeird looks and people were like what was this lady on and so um so I started designing tools\nFor gorilla gardeners are and that became the subversive gardening theories and from there it's the it's really a bean about gardening but a guerilla gardening but about developing techniques and and designs for gorilla gardeners\nYeah and if people go to subversive gardener dot net they can see some of those tools and some of those uh items that she's describing I'll put a link right there on our Facebook Live feed\n'em one of the things that I thought that you guys had was really neat was just these pills right does a little bit about the yes the pills\nWell I'm traditionally you have actually seen the bombers the ball and that's a very\nCommon and guerilla gardening a piece of a quote unquote are two very is is that we call it so I'm so if the ball or the bomb a is a bit of clay soil and in some seeds will make it into a ball and then when you're going by an area that\nYou need to be a situation that's been neglected or an area that's hard to get to\nYou just throw this ball and then of course you'd heard since grade question\nNow again if you're walking around the city with\nYou know say in diameter three or four balls in your pocket it's a bit um it just was nasty I'm no it doesn't really work well with your you know day to day\nCommute and so uh so the the pills are essentially vegetarian capsules are that are filled with soil and which means that it gets pretty nice that you can keep with you know they are your Tylenol\nOr or the pencil case or what not and then when you see the opportunity to ah keep unifying area you can just drop in details there and then it protects that of course until it right\nAnd what are some some tips that you might give someone as far as the variety of seeds you know I mean\nI'm I Know that there's a lot of plants out there that you get from seed to probably do really well and during certain areas but you know one of the the things that when you're really ... to consider is making sure you're not having like invasive species right\nYeah exactly and and I mean it again in very much depends\nOn on where you are in the world and where you're gardening and of course the climate um that you're dealing with um I find today gardening with wildflowers always a safe bet\nI'm because of course it's a beautiful area it it will often you know running and create you know fill in Brown's basis of what we call these neglected faces so so if you're able to use wildflowers always a really good one\nI'm also if you're able to do something a hearty because of course these faces they you're gardening are are not necessarily um you know the ... the soil is not necessarily very healthy so just something that's quite hardy something perhaps even like marigolds is always a good one ah poppies I heard you were mentioning copies of just\nA little bit earlier I think I'm well that's definitely a good one as well yeah for sure\nOkay and now\nYou know you you you got into this by treaty some tools and some\nTips for people um but also kind of got this community that you've developed over the years as well with other people this is just you write him\nYou know there's other ... and well what's your feeling like when you kind of communicate with these people because they're not just where you are you talked to people across the ... the world like you mentioned London or New York\nOr you came out here to California recently um or do they kind of have different thoughts are they're all kind of common in their own in their own beliefs\nOn it's all quite this and in fact last year I spoke to a ball um say a month and a half in Mumbai in India and\nThat was really a um yeah and and for me you know when I when I was bad guerilla gardening there is very different faith and credit gardening here so it's always quite different for for the bases that I was working in their\nRoom buys an incredibly incredibly dense city and it's hardly any spaces he has to be quite clever to find you where the Garden State is on that and also there's a lack of food so I wouldn't be gardening using to ours is perhaps not the best I'm\nNot to have come up with that plant using it might be wanting to do something that the edible\nUm so it's always really depends on on where you're gardening um the climate that you're gardening in as\nLong as the resources and the president African climate change too you know yeah and that's it we're going to take one ... of course a regret now and when we get back and we'll finish talking I Love the idea that you're talking about\nPeople are like when it be great to have some tomatoes\nAnd in it and it is funny because you see this as a community in you know meeting your neighbor meaning it gives the yeah gives you that opening variable to talk with someone like oh you're the one that plane to ... I I I just thought they came up I've been watching them come up there growing I think they're great\nAnd you know then you had been working in a conversation starts so that's really neat I'm Vanessa ... what do you guys have coming up in the future as far as the subversive garden or do you guys have any events coming up you guys are saying please tell us let's talk about\nWell we've got we've got we've got a couple of um things happening right now in the pipe works so we're working on a documentary series on so through the travel for the ... and are on sorry internationally or or locally and communicating with people so we're\nWe're a creating a I'm a short um who documentary it with a look at\n'em on different gorilla gardeners and how people go about gardening on everywhere and internationally so that's that's one thing that we have in the pipe works um another thing we have is we've been collaborating with a hotspot store here in uh in Brooklyn I'm called the season is so we've been planting\n[laughter] for them so we are going to be having a a\nA large chili pepper um dinner I'm aware of what's going to be inviting different people from the gardening\nOr community an evening of discussion and the\nProceeds will be going back to 'em and they use farm in Brooklyn so got a couple of a project on a ride right now and and there's there's a lot more also in in the works I'm up to the states to yes\nI I Love out in the heat in is it all your blog posts and it's funny because um she's got pictures of her of of the chili peppers in a blog post and I love how in in your face you are with some of this stuff it's it's a guy with the name of no I'm just kind of\nPut it out there for people to go and take a look at but he's got this shirt on it as if you don't like hot sauce you're stupid [laughter]\nAh basically it's basically there yeah yeah yeah\nI think you know what since you brought that up\nI don't want to go ahead John 'cause\nI've looked at that block to in that picture on the shirt bothered me [laughter]\nAnd I wanted to ask you was that intentionally that he misspelled your or is it really stupid\nYeah oh that's right yeah I I you know I Know no doubts ironic or it's really funny [laughter] uh\nYeah no I I yeah no no it's quite clever guy so I can imagine that uh I'm Glad you caught that meaning meaning that you're probably not in the other one sided yeah exactly\nSo I Would agree that the Iraq yeah that's good that's good\nOh yes Oh absolutely absolutely\nThat was young [laughter] but it's funny ... it's fun because through the through her blog post as you mentioned before but as you traveled the world but talking about a great resource for information I mean you're talking about gardens that people were planted all over the world and there are\nThere when when they've been successful what they haven't been successful what they're planting um lots of good info so for anybody out there listening I'm subversive Gardner dot net\nIs where you want to be able to go for this information she's got a shop with some tools and some items for to get your gorilla gardener started back going\nAnd then all that wonderful information that

A. L. K. I. N. that's radio right now we're speaking with Ken Foster he is the author of city of dogs New York ... their neighborhoods and the people who loved them and can I mention Jacqueline Woodson what's her story about in the book\nWell Jacqueline Woodson first of all he's an amazing writers she does a lot of young adult novels and children's books and um if someone that I've known\nThat mired for for years and I knew she was a dog person so that's how she came to me as a possible subject\nBut I'm In the book she talks about growing up with a variety of animals in the house and Brooklyn um but being terrified of German shepherds because one\nIn their building was not particularly knife and ended up attacking our cat\nUm and so she had a thing against German shepherds because of that which unfortunately happens to a lot of people when they have a bad experience with a dog kind\nUm but at the adults at one point a friend of hers rescue fisherman shepherd and couldn't keep it an ass jak when to take care of it for a couple of days which felt completely in love with it decided to keep it named mouth and um and\nFell in love with German shepherds basically um she now has a different second German Shepherd who's gotten older and I are young\nA difference a second German Shepherd who's gotten older and a young German Shepherd poodle next names um\nShadow they were going to name it ... it looks so much like a market um so we talk with her in the book and also walked around her neighborhood in park slope and have this amazing picture of her and her two dogs right in front of\nThe park and the art deco\nEntry to the Brooklyn public library I'm\nSo she sort of starts the book off with the layers of dory but also being a being a writer and storyteller as well\nAs you do you mean by the one dog was a mixed breed no I'm actually looking to come up with because he really does\nAnd wanting to he's got this long bushy hair but he has the body and the walk of a German Shepherd so it's a very funny combination to see that huge paws too\nYeah yeah I'm not sure how is how bleak around here was when we saw him\nI Want to ask you about I'm actually at the airports in New York I mean I Can't imagine most everybody it seems like Mary Lou through New Yorker into New York at some point and um whether it be ma Guardia or JFK or were you in Newark actually but the um the dogs that are used for security purposes um you did a story on them right\n[noise] yeah we got to spend the day there I'm going\nThrough each of the areas that they work and um and also seeing where they live because they actually live on sites at the airport which I didn't realize I didn't ... that either but they work\nGoing through the mail um yeah checking people as they come in from certain parts of the world for agricultural um\nContraband mostly um\nDoing security stuff as well and so we got to see a little bit of all of that which was amazing because they're so happy doing it like you know they save up all their energy all day and then they work their shift and exhaust themselves um they also while I was there I I\nAlluded to this in the section that I wrote but I didn't want to put myself in the story too much they had me put on it sent to what they said was offensive belt and put me on the line full of customers so that I could see\nHow the animal would signal that I had something um and the dog just sat and stared at me um and then they pulled me out of the line and it turned out the belt that I had was filled with crack cocaine\n[laughter] well [laughter] yeah I was like oh [laughter]\nAnd you didn't make a run for the door [laughter]\nNo I didn't [laughter] I was worried that I'm like is am I going to have that sense on me for a while now you know you're going to be in trouble and they send you a we've got to see also like they have a whole table of things they've pulled out of people's luggage\nUm mostly really bizarre exotic uh food items from around the world like meat flavored candies and I'm\nAt a whole bird's nest all kinds of things\nThat's a little strange but I can see where they they would be traveling which some bizarre things but what about will in the East Village and his Corgi 'em all I Want to hear all about anything from the love\n\nWe'll or in the East Village was he's not the first in the book but he was actually the first photo shoot we did um and he lives in the East Village where there is the first dog park um of now many throughout the five boroughs but the very first one was put in the East Village um and that's where he\nSort of fell in love with dogs decided to get one himself um decided he really wanted a Corgi and and found this dog that he has called Hobbs is\nAmazing sort of long haired Corgi um of course these are not a dog that I was too familiar with but partially for doing this book I kept running into them everywhere and became fascinated 'cause they just seem to be so I'm happy and cheerful\nNow he's actually a producer here Zach Scott one\nI have Walter at home yep my ...\n... you know like [laughter] which is very majestic and he knows he's handsome to\nThat's the other thing maybe a especially Hobbs a who is gorgeous looking but you can tell he like he's like I I'm here I Know everyone's going to appreciate me\n[laughter] and here I Alex\nIn the room and goes why is the attention not on me\nExactly yeah yeah it will be ... how is it having on his life and made them a little bit more responsible given him a schedule made them feel a little ambitious said you know provide for his dog [laughter]\nThe picture in the book of this dog it doesn't look like your typical Corgi like you said because one here it is very long\nHere when it's worthy apparently apparently there's a long hair breed but he is not that breed 'em so he just to sort of like a fluke oh he's gorgeous which make even more special I guess [laughter]\nYeah definitely well any dog especially you know or any kind is mentioned it to her you know the pet parents aren't they bring us a lot of love and like you said in the article was will about the unconditional love that's very true\nI mean the yeah I Know I I'm I don't have dogs in my life right now but I have cats and birds and I'm chickens actually um but um the thing is is that uh I I Know what it's like it's misery having the cats that you don't have to worry about than judging you on anything it just you know one hundred percent unconditional\nThere's one more thing and I think again but\nCan you stay with just a little bit longer a can because there's one more thing I Want to ask you about and I'm a we're going to give away another copies of both but can you stay with us for a couple more minutes sure okay great\nWell we're

question we worker or we welcome that as well but the book is yours just recalling eight four four three o five Seventy zero zero some great stories so I Know you're going to like it this is talk intense\nUm and so when it really started thinking about putting this book together and I wanted to show how dogs can really be an important part of people's lives and they don't necessarily slow you down there now has become incredibly successful he's on television is a chain of boxing gym is now\nAnd he did it all with this dog is part of you know the central part of his life really um and so they were a pair that I had in mind when I was sort of even just developing the idea for the book\nWill not for any other reason ladies if you want a a get a copy of this book a city of dogs you're going to want to look at age twenty three I'm just going to say that\n[laughter] right that's where ... was his dog [laughter] and I could tell you weren't out [laughter] what about um last but\nNot least someone asked me about was Alex from the Bronx I'm basically has a two pit bulls\nYeah and he always whenever we run into all of them on the street he um refers to me as their uncle [laughter] I'm stupid bulletin he I I also wanted to it's not just be a book about like the\nMost beautiful most successful wealthiest people going dogs in New York um and so there's a real variety of neighborhoods and lifestyles\nAnd this is Alex I'm there she is also a doctor Alex in the book but\nAlex in the Bronx I'm you know did time at Fort Dix you know has a record 'em and he talks in the book about how when he moved\nNew York after being released and got a dog he realized that having a dog and having that responsibility was going to be the thing that kept him out of trouble um been so it's a\nReally inspiring story and that sort of very unusual way um\nBecause it's the kind of person that we might not think of um as a role model necessarily and yet in a way the story you tell us very much one that we can follow and learn from um which is that the responsibility of taking care of dogs are people or both of them around us um\nOnly gives a sense of purpose but also you know offensive focusing on the right things in life\nWhat's amazing how much the ah you know the pit bull or has gotten a bad rap from ...\nI'm going to sound like Trump in this one I'm from the media because the media is you know you you always hear the stories about you know all of a sudden a pit bull attack somebody does or does that you don't hear about the Chihuahua that's been somebody's total off or something I'm so they do get a bad rap the lawn\n[noise] yeah and we I mean and there are a good number of pit bulls in the book um although what's interesting is that ... is a lot of cases they are just one of the dogs and a family um you know there's a there's a mother and her son\nAlso in the Bronx in little Italy in the book and they have a standard poodle a pit bull at a Chihuahua um and the and they're all dogs that they inherited from other people um but it's not you know it's not the dogs you know they're all dogs\nAnd I think ... trio the troublemaker was the poodle [laughter]\nWell your ... your book is absolutely phenomenal I mean in the photography is outstanding so I'm I'm recommending it everybody out there to get caught you you don't have to be from

wound up also given her her regular dosage and it caused her to are too much that's all I I Would like to know a country of explaining to the uh\nThe I don't know that should be given right away when the dog has too much insulin\nThat's a great question um I assume we're we're dealing with a diabetic animal here um so if\nA ... ... ... diabetic\nRip you should always have on on a\nNew refrigerator

actually rubbed the pancakes are okay rooms or on their guns and let them lick it off\nBut if you suspect hypoglycemia bring them immediately to your veterinarian I don't care what time of the day and night at his brain tumors it'd be happy because that's a life threatening mercy\nExactly exactly and and I'm a little bit further on on the situation or my on average Caesar and she came out of the seizure for about maybe ten minutes but during that time I didn't give her any any type of sugar\nI actually went into a second Caesar and I I took her to a twenty four seven and a emergency a good

general human or pet is always controversy um and especially human when\nWe don't get me started um you know when you need you need insurance so badly and the politicians don't care because they have government insurance and they were all set for life and their families and not so okay there's there's my I got my attention of theirs thing but anyway but I'm On had insurance for your pets do you recommend it or no\nI wholeheartedly recommend it for two reasons\nYou you will probably over the course of time spent more money on premiums because of pet insurance but when a vet bill hits Murphy's law says that you will probably not have the funds in order to in order to afford the vet bill\nBecause of the funds are gonna it's ... ... this is a car accident or surgery is going to be the three four thousand dollar bill that one thing you need to keep in mind is\nThat most than their insurance policies that I Know about you have to lay out the money first and then you get reimbursed and the vet night insurance company\nAlso my other thought about that in their insurance is as bill gets older it's true the premium goes up but also the likelihood of preexisting conditions and there are some breeds that just have\nPre existing conditions that take place like say for for instance a dachshund\nHas back problems that's more likely to come about when they're older ... when the premiums are going up but if you wait until they have a back problem or a ... in the river you broke this disease to start investing in that insurance\nIt's likely that the pet insurance will not cover that I that into ... this is\n... ... it is fury Ajmi though because you joined these companies just like in the human health insurance but because you get older and older everything seems to go up for people that growth has the risk 'cause it's just I I I see the point that the risk goes up but\nThat's not for um preexisting that's not your fault I mean that then you got cancer or something like that I mean for the most part if you smoked or whatever it okay who maybe that has something to do with it but I mean is that little for\nYou know a lotta times you can't help what you get or what your child gets in and meanwhile they they charge you so much or else they don't cover pre existing and then if you have to pay for it forget it there goes your house there goes your car I'm living under a tree somewhere I'm so for a pet insurance I mean\nHere I can in Georgia story that as those pets get older than their insurance premiums go up as well just doesn't seem right I mean you know what I'm ... I see what you're saying but I also see that it just doesn't seem right\nYou know a ... I I agree with you John\nBut insurance like anything else and I believe me I I see it all the time where an animal comes in and and they've got a disease and the owners can't afford the tree that I was put in that position once myself my own pet and I'm a veterinarian where I couldn't afford treatment\nUm but insurance companies are business\nAnd just like any other business they have to make money to stay afloat and there are you got to do your research but there are some pet insurance companies out there\nThat do cover pre existing conditions I Know one I'm not going to I don't know the name of it but I remember hearing an owner told me about one insurance company that covers preexisting conditions and that is insurance company worth investing in\nWorth you know buying insurance\nI thought that that company I'm\n... I'm ... I was seeing nationwide but I'm not sure um but do your research and find out what is covered what is not covered but don't wait until the last minute don't wait until your pet is twelve years old to suddenly decide to invest it in a pet insurance\nBut the thing that kills me is that okay so you get pet insurance when you know the puppy is six months old or whatever and doesn't have any conditions but you're paying that premium all the time all those years until it becomes geriatric\nIt's maybe mid to late teens and lived to be and meanwhile because of that they're not going to cover something\nOver because the dog is so old they are going to you know up your premium or in some cases they may drop you after they have to pay a certain amount of money and they won't let you have the pet insurance any more I mean it just it to me it's shouldn't be that way some of the little guy once again is getting hurt\nSome insurance companies though will pay for vaccines hot ones has and and don't forget you under the best conditions your your pet should be a veterinarian twice a year for physical exam\nThose exams are covered by some insurance insurance company\nSlows you down on that

veterans\nWho would be added are healthier and wealthier and so they're healthier\nAnd instead what we're now doing is outsourcing more care\nBetween two dozen fourteen into taboo Seventeen the budget

would be disastrous\nI understand what you're saying and I do not disagree however I think that a substantial portion without outsource she has to do with people that are too far away from a

I. B. L.

of warriors are going to continue this conversation now hey welcome back Matt thanks very it's a pleasure to be here give us a quick review of your time and mother army\nWow okay I started out kind of sneaking in under the wire at West point in the balmy summer of Nineteen eighty one I safety under wire because a lot of my classmates got their ... appointment through\nA congressman or senator and I sort of had an at large entry into the or the military academy but you know was able to uh fend for myself pretty well they're helping my classmates and I was able to get an arm or a slot was what I wanted so I ended up going to Germany for my first assignment\nTo the ah three twelve cab which was uh divisional cavalry squad and the third Armored Division and really enjoyed my time there a lot of good friends\nCame back to the advanced course Fort Knox and then went straight down to Fort Stewart\nWith a unit and eating the airborne corps and was deployed for the Gulf War in early summer of Ninety Ninety spent the next ten months in the tropical paradise of ah the middle east so and after that I came back I got out and went into explored the are\nThe jobs scenario out outside the I'm going to hang out with those civilian people\nThere was a number of reasons for that but we'll get into that later but I think it was it was a good step from\nThe gods must love civilians you made so many of them it's like okay we're talking about warriors\nAs we discussed last week with autumn there's lawyers at every level of society and and as you pointed out a couple of times\nYou have to be committed and focused as if you are to be a warrior we'll talk mostly military and again I don't want to put down the other word certainly as I've said a hundred times on the show people in law enforcement or not our brothers in arms but there certainly are first cousins and valor they put their lives on the line every day for people that don't even know\nMany of them don't even like him so\nPlease don't take that as an exclusive but we're talking about people in uniform right everybody puts on the uniform better be prepared to become a war is that a fair statement\nYou know any of that is exactly what I was thinking it's funny you should say that because to be a warrior you need to train to be a warrior I think inside a lot of us think of ourselves as warriors\nBut the men and women that are going into battle they need to train every single day as closely as they can to replicate combat conditions because you never really know how you're going to react so\nThe closer you can get to replicate those conditions in training day in and day out to be a warrior ants you know your enemy know the word battle the more that you know the more you trust the people around you the better you're going to fight\nAnd I think that is true in any scenario in life whether you're in business or whether you're in sports\nBut especially when you're a warrior you have to train and you got to know your equipment you got to know your friends and you gotta know the enemy preparation is what you said and that is one of the keys to being a warrior I think\nWell and in business you are not going to be competing for a contract and you wouldn't and I don't that's competition but it's not like a shot right nonetheless it's no less the same thing for and the people who joined the military may be they never deployed maybe there was a guard reserves are never activated but they still have decided for whatever reason\nAnd never activated but they still have decided for whatever reason usually a multitude of reasons with their lives available to be sent to combat you might be a medic or you might be a mechanic or you might be a finance clerk or you might be have a drummer you might be anywhere but\nIn the military you ask what you want to take what you get and my dad's best friend who served in World War two as a replacement guy in Europe said you come in and you're a\nMechanic and suddenly we need fifty to tank drivers you know a tank driver [laughter]\nAh that might be how you were trained but here's what we need you the arms of limits for that the officer and so therefore if you put the uniform on you better be ready to be a warrior regardless of what you're currently assign does and that's I think a key issue this is going to Gilman front lines of freedom and we're discussing the nature of warriors with math have\nThen there are those who suddenly find themselves in a combat zone whether it's in a combat role or not I suspect that would appear motivation\nI Would hope so yeah I mean in in that and that's a that's a bad place to be the it's a bad place to be in a combat zone but a non combat essentially non combat personnel and find yourself in a convoy that gets attack I think unfortunately\nMany people don't feel they're ever going to be in close combat situation but if your deployed to a combat theater of operations you need to sort of get your mind wrapped around that where your spirit and say we can be attacked that anytime\nPerhaps even by civilians for whatever reason so you always have to be on top of your game and that again preparation and I think the mindset of being a combat or your that's the biggest thing to be prepared for anything\nYeah I think the Marines have a sort of a model or something that says everybody's inevitable I don't care what you are your primary thing is you're also an infinite that attitude would carry then there are those who\nConduct combat artillery fighter pilots those kind of people who attacked the enemy but don't do it personally mhm and then there are the people the close combat people's the infantry armor special ops type people who potentially go face to face with the enemy those are sort of\nDifferent levels but all of them need that warrior mindset and all of them sort of need to be prepared to be anywhere in that spectrum right\nYeah I Love the or the marine mindset is that they train everybody to be a fighter and then after that okay you can go and be an electrician or a cooker because they need everything but all those and all that says they all knew how to fight\nVery similar to the Israelis everybody has to be the script into the army men and women so they teach everybody how to be in uniform\nHow to be a soldier and how to fight and protect the country and then you can go back to civilian life and be an accountant or a sales person or an inventor or whatever but everybody has a taste of what it's like to serve and to be in the military and to protect the country important\nYeah that's really important person is more likely to motivate you to do that if you have seen your school will get attacked by a rocket or something like that than here in the United states given that the warriors spirits a warrior attitude is something that everybody in our military needs it's something that needs to be appreciated understood\nAnd even replicated by we citizens because none of this particular want to be victims either\nSo that's something that is transferable to the civilian world\nThough not in the aggressive sense right\nYeah I think it's important for civilians to recognize the level of commitment and the level in the intensity and sometimes violence that the military has\nBut they need to also understand that we are just people just like they are we're not different kinds of people we're just dedicated ourselves to a life of protecting the country and to do that you have to be willing not only to sacrifice physically but also to be prepared to be very violent\nAnd that takes a toll on people you see all the pie TST coming back from the latest wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and\nI think there are people in our society they think that we love the violence and we're out there just to kill people and stuff that's the farthest thing from the truth I mean we come back damage from what we have to go through and what we have to do and I think it's so important to realize that war especially close combat takes a toll on everyone that's involved we talked about the difference between men and women last week\nI think one of the key things about men for better or for worse is that we were able to sort of compartmentalize things yes and in the middle of a battle your body gets shot you do not have time degree not even a second you know the guy that pick him off got his crosshairs right on you so what are you going to do to get out of this position and make things right\nAnd you know it might be weeks or even months later for that comes back into your mind and all of a sudden you find yourself breathing so there's there's an intense emotional toll that it takes on a person to be in combat but that's always got to be later it can't be in the moment\nAnd that's all part of the nature of the warrior right there is a lot more to discuss about this and folks on because they haven't met back on regularly as we pursue the definition of the idea of a warrior Matt thank you for taking time to join us today thank you for your service to our country and thanks for being part of the front lines of

ah\n\nLike today I went into a shopping center here in the state of South Carolina and\nThey had the circle on the door and they had the no concealed firearms allowed but they didn't have the gun in the circle which invalidate the sign which invalidate every sign in that building and I only know that because I went in that door I've seen the other doors at hand there\n\nIn other states and no guns allowed signed carries no real legal weight on its own unless it's posted on state on property here in South Carolina it does\n\nI mean there's no band against carrying a handgun in any of the average meant in my state they serve liquor\nBut if you do that in New Mexico that would be a felony level with them outside of their expectations\n\nAnd if you're going to fly you need to make sure

your bag because you can't touch it\n\nThis is why my carry on our my computers and my cameras and uh everything else it'd be in the checked baggage and they need to hang on to that\n\nThe other thing you need to do is prior to your packing tape your carry on an empty it and then throw it around a little bit and make sure that it is empty anti empty\nBecause you don't want to have anything like a

that person still get to win because they ultimately and the life of someone you love and then my my attitude is no they don't they don't get do that and my fight to keep that my people said continues and to my ability to keep blood in the body and keep that person alive long enough for the professional to Iraq now\nKaitlin we had a conversation earlier that really delve into that and as his mother this is a major part of our lifestyle which is a major part of our awareness\nMhm mhm and it's funny because not too long after we had that kitchen table discussion of you know why do you really not carry anything and and he when I explained to him that I did not want to become a target\nAnd I put it into terms that he actually could reconcile in his mind he started to see what I was talking\nReconcile in his mind\nHe started to see what I was talking about because the idea is that we blend in\nAnd we don't pick out like a source on we don't draw attention to ourselves you know and and that's that's what we want and everything and then when I said you know people stereotype and expect you to carry that they don't expect that from me\nYou know and I said and and that's part of that that's part of it um ... when we started to really look at well what would really be something that you would carry and I told him I said it needs to be quick easy I Need to see everything\nIn it immediately upon opening it\nAnd I said and it's got to be something that I can pop in a bag\nAnd take with me and not have it become this one more thing where mom got her purse than her diaper bag and you know whatever else I happen to have on with me so not long after that we were visiting with some friends of ours and\n... day um they had an accident at their house and long story short one of their kids came in and he had a nice big gash on his forehead they had no kid in the kitchen they had nothing available for any of that\nI thought to myself this is why we need this\nAnd so we started to develop something that would be\nAble to go in the vehicle with you or come into the house and hang out on it spreads and then for everybody that doesn't necessarily have the ability to afford that kid or doesn't want to have something that necessarily that big we came up with a no excuses kit which has\nAn amazing tourniquet in it it's based off of the idea of a dip tie\n'em it's called the ... and it is completely\nHow do I say this nightly it's completely idiot proof basically I'm a ... and that's the only way that I can put it I [laughter] I'm everybody knows what is it ... and so you know this I just worked on that same idea\nUm it takes minimal banking everybody can do it and then we've got you know one that has a just cause in it so that if you've got a wound that needs to be packed you can do that\nNow I just want to put this in the context of everyone listening\nThe everyday carried pocket kit and that was used to get it has a number of different components it has God that has that tourniquet this ... this chests feel you\nHave all of the very essential components in here and in retail for twenty nine Ninety five\nSo not only after you have no excuse but you have no financial excuse not to have these lifesaving too because that's one of the biggest target for many people as well just out at my budget can you forgive her ... dollars you're going to spend more than ... for me\n[laughter] that was that turn of carrots that tourniquet does is it addresses that\nGross motor versus fine motor skills a thing that comes up because when people are treating wound of our ... and you sort of get Jack ... and uh that sort of takes away from those what what do you think James about probably three minutes maybe that three minutes or three minutes or not bleeding so\nBack in regular definitely a lot faster yeah a lot better than that though\nBut it it is I mean at the post it'd be something that you can do with minimal training not everybody has time to run to treat that he tripled said he can't try\nWhen we get back on my point something out to your friend if you go into the side just so you know\nBut anyway we'll we'll be right back tonight is the
