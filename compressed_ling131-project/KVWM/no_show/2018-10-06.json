a\nNews talk from Seventy kj I Hope [noise]\n\nFound out about having a really ugly [laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nOh yeah by the way that's just some of what police have to deal with\nIs talking about the importance of supporting our beliefs because of what he goes on out there that's gotten a crap they were dealing with today in the capital as you have the the protesters I mean and again from a political movement standpoint\nWho doesn't want to be part of that is what I Believe ideology and by the wayside for a moment one of the things I've never been able to get my brain around\nHow especially young people go yeah those people make a lot of sense you know what I should be due I should be part of that now let's\nBe real for a moment ... those folks in D.C are pros they're paid these are folks who don't have lives the rest of us we got to work we have lives and we uh you know you go about our business letter of the day and go oh okay that's what the losers are up to today yes those are all the losers were up to today the losers that go out there and they get paid and\nIn many cases they end up getting paid more if they are willing to get arrested so yes they did they are those people but nevertheless\nJust in terms of winning hearts and minds it's fascinating now\nIs the second was talking about police talking about law enforcement and we've had obviously this immigration debate going on for ever and a seemingly no resolution inside but the other um aspect of\nThat conversation that often is ever liked refugees and I have long had\nMy focus on refugees\nFor a couple of reasons one is principal and the other the implications of refugees\nNow a lot was made though it wasn't big in the news cycle because obviously we know what the news cycle has been\nBut a lot was made that we ended up having the u._s. refugees in decades at least since Nineteen Seventy five according to the state department oh my gosh we're not importing you know even more people are into the United states and paying for all that to happen\nOr ... according to PBS at the end of August Nineteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety nine refugees had been brought in over the prior eleven months compared to forty five thousand that weren't dissipated oh my gosh and that was a bad thing right\nAnd then they went on to talk about how we're only anticipating three thousand being brought in next year oh my gosh that's just terrible now here's one is often not discussed the implications the implications when\nAre we going to be compassionate to Americans before we try to be compassionate to the rest of the world\nHere's the way this works what you're not told we as taxpayers pay to bring the refugees into the United states average cost tends to be around fourteen thousand dollars per refugee and according to the center for Immigration Studies that typical immigrant guess what happens when they get here\nWhere they live on government assistance for a minimum of five years and the average by your cost per refugee sixty four thousand three hundred and Seventy bucks now you're ready to hear how much it costs to relocate a refugee into a safe zone if we get involved\nA thousand fifty seven bucks so we can actually relocate Bronx only sixty four refugees into safe zones without importing them into the United states\nAnd by the way Ninety One percent of refugees we bring into the United states end up on food stamps and sixty eight percent also ended up receiving ongoing welfare other programs made available now how compassionate is that\nToday we found out that we have the lowest unemployment rate in many decades three point seven percent\nHow is it that we made progress with those that have been a long term unemployed those that had the toughest time those that were not educated that word skilled how have we made improvement in young unemployment anybody ever think that maybe cracking down on illegal immigration\nAnd not bringing in refugees to compete for entry level work might make a difference\n[noise] something that's never discuss back on June seventh of last year I actually made the case for how it could happen\nAnd we have seen over the past year plus exactly that is it anywhere near the entire reason no but it absolutely is part of the reason people automatically suggests that we have a responsibility and that kind of cost\nTo import people in the competed against the most vulnerable in our society if you're really cared about the most vulnerable in society you give them the opportunity that Donald Trump has been doing his policy once again [noise]\nOmission is the most pervasive form of bias in the media [noise]\nTwo sides to stories one side of the fact I'm Brian ... and for the great one more global [noise]\n\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel who owe the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the Irish they didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal\nTax relief so he engage them optimally got the IRS to designate Nathaniel ... case as seat in the status currently not collectible that's a big win because it basically says\nNo use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here optimal kept finding on Nathaniel ... by half until the IRS agreed to a deal\nThat saved them thousand to resolve this tax that for good optimal knows that behind every tax problem are honest hard working Americans with families homes savings in paychecks they'd need protection they resolved over half a billion dollars in tax that for their clients now phew oh back taxes to the Irish call my friends would opt them a tax relief\nLet's see ah I Believe we're actually getting in right now on the line that the police officer I'll go ahead and go right to you you get to the front of the line because you're another the police officer want to hear from you in\nGo ahead and see how are you tonight hey doing well\nFantastic now I just wanted to comment that I have to agree with all your saying I've been in law enforcement now for six years and\nIt's especially with coming from my department you you just see a face to face 'cause we are in a college town itself so I'm everything that the media puts out toward this you're definitely feeling it especially from the younger generation who\nOnly been taught that way and it's like one interaction after another where you're trying to change that\nGod Bless you man and are the folks who served with you um you know there is one thing I'll tell you in a again I Do the series down here in South Florida every week I Will tell you that there is a lot of support\nKind of like the silent majority that came out in may Donald Trump president elected more Republicans top to bottom of the United states of America in twenty sixteen than at any other point since Nineteen twenty eight\nOf us out there are a lot of good folks that that really do get it in that do support you and I know just often isn't depicted in the media and certainly with many politicians but but do stay strong and and

first they called an injection drug use now in San Francisco there actually giving junkies drugs to use can you believe this\nWhat else happened in a while I'm a republic that is akin to what's happening in America today weekend police authority rapid lawlessness arose because the liberal agenda led to weaken policing criminals subtly\nAnd that led to weaken policing criminals subtly proliferated what else happened couldn't buy firearms people were not allowed to have firearms\nWhat else happened well I can give you some more examples and then there was a backlash that's what I'm Talking about the backlash to this liberalism\nArose right now for example it's a direct parallel to the wine or Republican Germany and you have groups like on the far the\nBerman cowards and put on black masks beat people up kicking girls in the street attacking police breaking windows most of them are punks who go back to college teaching jobs or God Knows where they are\nWith impunity well we had the same thing that the world had seen the same thing in Germany and the into war period with the communist exactly the same thing you don't know that the brown shirts of Hitler we're we're a reaction to the lawlessness of the\nCommunist I don't think you understood this most people have it backwards now don't don't trust what I'm saying and Sam glorifying the brown shirts I Am simply giving you a piece of history lessons from history remember when I said you many times those do not know history are condemned to repeat it I Am telling you it's showing\nWhat do you think I killed myself riding mass hysteria for\nBecause I'm trying to send out a warning to the world where this will lead\nAnd I see what this really so I'll go on so just like on the fought today and the Occupy movements if today which are lawless and violent the analysis of today and gone by Nancy Pelosi says world is raptors same thing there so the communist weren't given the green light\nTo attack anyone they wanted as they were attacking Republicans now senators no one stops them\nIt's as though we're powerless to ... to protect ourselves from these ... so the Germans said enough is enough for what happened was a lot of ex military from World war one\nAlong with tremendous money from the aristocracy that was still in Germany they had secrets cells emerge and they put together some of the toughest men in Germany\nAnd they formed units coal brown shirts\nAnd they started beating of communist in the streets that's what happened I didn't say it should happen here don't condemn what I'm saying you don't want to know history you can be more on if you want you to be the biggest more on an earth but I Am going to tell you the story biggest this story is waiting to be told and not all of you can afford it will buy stop mass hysteria\nMost of you won't even understand or see it because it's being blocked by Fox News I wouldn't expect to see it on CNN they don't read books unless they support the liberal agenda but you're going to read that book my core audience will read this book and so what else happened next\nWhat worries me next the brown shirts went out in the streets with clubs and started to beat the heck out of the communist who are causing havoc in Germany and the people cheered them\nYou know that the German people who were very very middle of the road couldn't take the lawlessness and the disorder and they shared the brown shirts at first\nThis is all true it's all an absolute fact of reality what I'm telling you the average person cheered on the brown stretches so more men joined them and more money poured into the people supporting the brown shirts\nWell what is the lesson for those of you are listening to the show\nWell over a period of time liberal societies build up and opposition from the right wing the larger a liberal society grows so grows with it the right wing did you and I sent\nAnd so that's how Trump got elected by the way not because he's Hitler don't get me wrong because the left with like you to think he's Hitler's the furthest thing from Hitler you could ever imagine\nAnd so we had a little bit of a backlash we have a charismatic leader he has some solutions\nBut his solutions for example to block the immigration of criminals into this country has been blocked by liberal judges that too will pass\nThose liberal judges were not elected by anybody that time will come you will see there'll be thrown off the bench they may think that their immune from this but they are not immune from this and so what is what is the point in my show today\nMy point is there has been a right wing backlash in this country\nAnd we have a charismatic leader\nBut his solutions are not yet that extreme\nThe left would say any of us illusions are extreme to the left said that Kavanaugh was a drunk which he wasn't a is a cabinet was a rapist which he wasn't he drank too much beyond what college student and you know when you didn't what did they do in college what Jerry Nadler do in college what Charles Schumer doing college\nWhat he's doing he drank mounted ... drank too much about ... ... what do you what do we know what they did in college I don't know one boy I went to college and didn't go crazy and have a good time they\nMade that suddenly in operation what I'm saying to you is history is a very good\nIndicator of what's coming things go around and cycles so when I say stop mass hysteria if you think that the left than it's super liberalism\nIs a good thing for this country and the west you were a hundred percent wrong you're a thousand percent wrong it will bring about the exact opposite of what the liberals hope it will bring about trust me on that see this is what triggers at all\nIf we have an economic blowout in in the west\nA a right wing leader will arise that will make Trump look like what he is which is a liberal centrist\nAnd things will happen to you can't believe are happening and what happened so fast will say it's not happening and liberalism will be there was the reason for it you say it can happen here well it will happen here and the economic downturn that as being predicted by some\nEconomists is a is inevitable it's gonna happen and I'm afraid if it happens it will be worse than ever because we're in a heightened now of the stock market the inflation is out of control incidentally right underneath the surface they're printing money right now\nIn a way I've never seen it done in this country in the country's history\nThey're just printing money and under the Democrats when we criticized deficit spending we were right because I'm a fiscal conservative but all fiscal conservatives have dummy up they shut their mouths you but you're anyone in the radio talking about the run away and the the excuse me the uh\nThe deficit no not one person they all want to go in there and get the or the treatment\nThey all want to get a tour of the oval\nBut someone's got to say stop printing the money this is crazy because someone's gonna have to pay for that\nJust doesn't go on forever you want to wind up taking a wheelbarrow of cash or credit cards to buy a loaf of bread as happened in why mark Germany at the end just before all of this\nThat it takes a whole wheelbarrow full of paper currency to buy a loaf of bread that's how fabulous the money had become now several years ago I wrote a book called trickle down tyranny you'll still find it on Amazon but I Will bet that the company\nHas not removed the personal attack reviews on that book and all my other books the way they did by cutting nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book what happened\nYes that's right not enough you find stop mass hysteria next week up there what you will you'll find all the negative reviews left up there\nSome of them posted by the enemies\nThey're going to reviews left up there some of them posted by the enemies of America some of them posted by enemies or Michael Savage a but none of them will be taken down the way nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book or removed and this practice demonstrates exactly how that concept works\nSo if you think that things are great now good for you and I hope they stay forever but nothing stays forever if history teachers us anything there are cycles to wear kind of me there are cycles to a political views and I pray that as I ride on page three oh three\nThat is where when and how the carcass of the once great United States will become nothing more than ... for the masses as China and India rise we will sink even deeper and we may well do it without hysteria because Americans by than traditional Americans hardworking roll up your sleeves Americans\nWill be too tired and feel to consistently betrayed sound familiar will be too tired and feel to consistently betrayed to dispirited to fight back\nPage three oh three stop mass hysteria be right back\nJoined those Savage

possible zombie outbreak some kind of weird infection\nSmith cited several scientific studies news reports and fictional works the backup her research has listed in discovery the author specified three possible pathogens\nWhereas a cyber attack it is I like to say doesn't require any bombs and bullets or sort fights or just a few keystrokes on the computer and then we're done\nAnd when you when you look at all the possible calamities Bobby whether they are natural or created by people what do you see as the most pressing issue facing us\nWell my opinion as well as the opinion of the folks who frequent freedom peppers dot com is that economic collapse is on the minds of of most Americans they they have a feeling that our country is not doing as well as our political leaders might lead on\nAnd you know interestingly today the interest rates went up a quarter point and an economic climate in my opinion it does not warrant and interest rate rise in\nEconomic collapses is something that's a concern but I always believe that there must be some additional precipitating events\nTo force a country into a deeper um despair economically and that's why I wrote the fiction series at our wrote a book called the Boston Brahmin series and it takes a an America a nation and decline socially and economically and then\nThrows a cyber attack into the mix which puts it over to get into a a post apocalyptic chaotic world\nAnd and most of the the prep or is that I deal with that most of the raiders believe that uh right now economic collapses the number one threat we face followed closely by cyber attack or EMT\nAnd what if they hit us all at the same time Bobby oh my God\nThat would be bad news for everybody ... and ... and here's the way I see this happening yeah we were to go to war for example with Russia\nRussia is notorious for using cyberwarfare is a precursor to war when they invaded uh Georgia Sonia a Ukraine\nThey always ah initiate cyber attacks to stabilize the government communications the media before they are on you know undertake a traditional military style attack\nAnd if the Russians were so inclined to take us on it would not surprise me at all that they would use cyber attack or E. M. P. to stabilize our nation before they moved on us\nLet's talk about cyber warfare and we're going to go through a number of different areas here that that will affect all of us who do you see a biggest Koppel things ... part of the danger could be from some room ... grew up playing around with the green but who do you see is the main villain here China Russia\nPlaying around with the green but who do you see is the main villain China Russia or somebody else\nWell I like to describe it this way there's an inverse relationship between the capability and the desire of a nascent okay\nTo attack us fortunately the ability to do it or the desire to do it right there are two very different\nThings for example China and Russia clearly or have the ability to initiate a series of cyber attacks against the United states that would cause us a lot of problems are taking out our critical infrastructure communications\nThings that are also typically military targets would be the same targets of of cyber attacks but they are also in my opinion the least likely to do that simply because they know we would be able to retaliate in kind or maybe with even greater for right\nBut then you have what I call the the the vandalism levels in the cyber attack level nations for example Iran\nThey would love nothing more than to accomplish their goals with death to America um their ayatollah the spiritual leader of Iran recently said that the United states deserves to punch in the mouth\nIn my opinion they are becoming more capable of attacking America in the cyber realm and most likely would do it based upon religious beliefs and in a in an extreme hatred for our country\nBut then you have what I call the vandals and North Korea is a great example\nOh yeah I'm a North Korea to me it's kind of like a nap it's in your ear and it just as hell bent on driving me crazy and getting attention\nThat guy's not playing with the food that\nHe is not and and I call him little on\nYou swat at them and he goes he might go away for a while and then you North Korea is notorious for doing things that are uh you know saber rattling and then people give their maiden and countries throw money at the problem then they come back seven years later\nI Believe in order to get attention and recognition uh um uh you know world geo political stage\nNorth Korea would like nothing more than to bring down the United states or not it's down to our knees\nAnd they have thrown a tremendous amount of resources um in in that direction but to me the biggest uh the biggest threat actor right now is the what I call the wildcard or the cyber caliphate and that's ISIS\nAt this point in time ISIS is not necessarily capable of attacking the United states and bringing our entire grid down but this was what they want more than anything else they're extremely wealthy are estimated worth of over three billion dollars\nThey make two million dollars a day or selling oil and trafficking in a in a you know human trafficking and then in ransom and things of that nature and if ISIS ever put together the right team of hackers\nI'd I don't doubt that they would uh they would be the first a threat to take on our grid\nI think you're probably right on on those fronts and do they have the capabilities now\nWell supposedly they do not um I I recall a quote from sex and see the FBI cyber to visit and the ah John ... and\nHe's he quoted that they have a very strong at ten intend to do so but thankfully they don't have the capability\nBut the concern in Washington is that with their wealth and and as that continues to compound daily or will let them by that capability and they have made threats are back in the spring this year they they posted a very ominous message vowing and electronic war against the west and\nAnd and you know with their typical\nFacelift who didn't figure speaking in Arabic and we send this message and we're the hackers of the Islamic state and the electronic war has not yet but gun\nAnd those types of threats\nIn the past may have just been dismissed as a these are just a bunch of fools but every day in the news whether it be San Bernardino or or Paris or Chattanooga, Tennessee which is just a hundred or a couple of hundred miles from where I live\nUh you have operatives in this country who are prepared to give their lives in order to kill Americans and the the thing that would be\nThat bad pages or a tool to ISIS is they would be able to kill Americans through a taking down our power grid and they wouldn't have to put anybody's lives at risk and in doing so\nDo you believe a cyber attack is an act of war\nIt depends uh and I know this was discussed on your interview with Ted Koppel what's I listen to of course I think the uh if\nIf a cyber attack causes death then it could be considered an act of war but I'd like to look at it also from that standpoint and I think that Washington is doing the same if say our oil fields in Texas and the refineries that Exxon and\nAnd uh the BP oil and shell et cetera were destroyed or put out of commission for six months or a year as a result of a devastating cyber attack\nTo me that is just as it is as big an attack is if you dropped a bomb on the state of Texas you may not have killed anybody but you've certainly harmed the state in our country economically\nThe question is what type of retaliation is appropriate\nAnd then the bigger problem that I I wrote about in cyber warfare is are you able to accurately determine who conducted the attack the the problem of attribution is a big one is although you may not have to prove the typical criminal standard beyond a reasonable doubt\nIt's so easy to mask the locations of these cyber attack or an hackers in in their locations that you may think the attack came from India for example but it could have actually been re routed through several servers around the world in originated in China\nInteresting take their so with all these possibilities out there then we also have to worry about Bobby the sun in so many other things were going to come back and talk more about preparedness [noise] in a moment ...\n... email newsletters out six days a week is a great way to keep up on all things coast\nWe detailed program recaps the fascinating today in St Louis the upcoming didn't bow and weekly re audio clips it must have produced resign up on the ... dot com boom\nAt this type of ah at this level so if for some reason our economy does experience a downturn in twenty sixteen and and I would like to echo something that was set at the top of the hour\nMany economists including from your comments economists Citibank and bank of America believe there's a Seventy five percent chance that America will slip into a recession next year\nAnd if we go into a recession in a period of rising interest rates\nWe can look at a situation very similar to what we experienced in the late seventies early eighties after the Carter administration um sixteen Eighteen percent unemployment sixteen Eighteen percent interest rates\nAnd it'll be very difficult dig our way out of that because we've already used all the tools at our disposal to fix the problem a temporarily with a band aid in two thousand and eight and nine\nWould this be a worldwide collapse\nWell ... you can see the effect that that our problems and oh eight had on the entire world I mean our economy is the center of the economic universe in my opinion a globally\nAnd at the United states were to falter um because I keep it simple for for for our listeners if you if you can't afford to buy goods and services that means the Chinese economy falls because they don't have anybody to purchase their attorney\nAnd and likewise a look at gas prices normally you would think wow great gas prices are dropping but it's also a a great indication of a lack of demand\nAnd the lack of demand become because of a lack of a purchasing power or industrial output has dropped which again you reported on at the top of the hour there's so many factors involved and all signs are pointing toward the downturn\nYet we're finally raising interest rates probably two to three years too late and it it could have a confluence of events that can be devastating here\n[noise] so what happens once the courage to ... a lot of people come in and look into that crystal ball Bobby what happens to folks who might get laid off or or who knows what\nWell that leads into the concept of preparedness and and prepping in general\nAnd prepping can take a lot of different levels and and purposes I I Believe in prepping for the worst case scenario and and we can talk about that in a moment sure but just good for a galaxy and common sense and protection of your family\nShould have a huge saving money a Ford downturn if you lose your job if you have a month or two a food stored you don't have to worry about your family going hungry and so just just general preparedness for an economic downturn makes good common sense\nBut if you look at the statistics our nation is saving less money than ever before\nWe're living closer to a paycheck to paycheck society than than ever before and that's what I mean about our country is is is that our politicians are lying to the to the folks in America when they tell you\nA five percent unemployment rate but they don't tell you that the labor participation rate is in its worst conditions since they started recording the numbers with almost a hundred million Americans just completely given up looking for work or are marginally employed\nIt at some point in time this facade that's been created out of Washington has gone to catch up with this and if if it could potentially be ugly I Hope not I mean you never wish for this to happen\nBut an economic collapse could cause a real problem and I'm not sure that we have the ability to dig out because at some point in time and it's already started\nThe bank of China's gonna stop blaming us money\nAnd then we can print all the dollars and the and the treasury notes that we want but if we don't have a buyer for those in our currency is going to collapse as well\nYou have what you call the survivor rule of ... what are they\nWell it it's really just the basic rule of thumb that if you are put in a situation where your life is it risque or in the collapse of that is I like to call it\nYou can only live free minutes without air or you're underwater you have to get air within three minutes or you'll die in extreme weather conditions I'm cold for example or extreme heat like in the desert you can only live three hours without shelter\nThat's right your body can only survived three days without proper Hi grace and without water and then if you ah if your body goes three weeks without food then you're likely to die as well so the\nSurvival ruler three this is simply three three three three relative\nTo air shelter water and food\nOkay so if you are at least trying to minimize the possibilities that those things can be taken out of your life you've got a leg up on so many things right\nWell and and the and the good down scenario ... which is what I consider the worst case I'm a collapse of and\nIntegrate down scenario as as your seat of the listeners are very much aware or the power grid operates everything forget the Internet and the ATMs and all of the things that people think about think about the fact that you're not going to have water coming out of your cat and you know think about that\nThink about the fact that you're not going to have water coming out of your cab and you know think about the fact that you're not going to have the ability to turn on your your electric heat pump or your air conditioning\nAnd if if you live in the northern parts of Minnesota and where the temperature gets to zero and below a many times if you don't have adequate heat in your home you could freeze to death and die that's right\nAnd so the survival ruler threes tells you in the event of a of of a worst case scenario make sure that you have the ability to keep yourself warm in extreme weather or cool if it'd be living in the desert for example\nHave ways to procure and purify and hats and store water because they're not going to be able to get it out of the tap and I don't care how many water bottles you purchase from the grocery store eventually those will run out and then likewise have sufficient food to survive on\nYou know it's interesting Bobby we've got some very important sponsors to our program who are dedicated in these areas that you just talked about I mean they make survival water filters that you know takes up contaminated water\nWe've got to see Korean company with their survival radios we've got a my patriots supply with their food emergency food supplies these people are ... march because you know they built their businesses around survival\nYes and then and in in the ... business person will see trends in an economy and they'll pick up on those ideas you know run with it and and and create a marketplace\nFor consumers like myself in your listeners\nWho think yes I Need to be able to purify water but\nI don't know what to do so they might come to freedom ... dot com and and and read my article on a water catchment and purification and then they'll go to my patriots supply or some of your other sponsors and pick up the necessary a water purification infiltration devices\nAnd it's like insurance George this is the way I I've always tried to explain it to someone who doesn't understand I mean are you may have insurance on your home for a tornado an earthquake or flooding in most events may never happened in your lifetime\nAnd you hope they never will\nAnd you and you hope they never will and your insurance company hopes they never will but you have the peace of mind of knowing that if they do you have some form of coverage that's right\nWell prepping is just like insurance you're you're preparing against the catastrophic event at least you know whether it be a an economic collapse or a cyber attack cetera but you're you're preparing that if that event occurs you'll be able to number one stay alive\nTwo you know save your family keep them comfortable until then you know the either help comes or until you know the the nation writes itself or some other contingency and I you know I Love my wife that and we have a fabulous life and I want to live forever\nAnd if the Russians decide to take our power grid down I'll be dogged if I'm going to die\nBecause they one that's not going to happen\nHere point I'm a advocate as you well know Bobby listening to the show the second amendment yes in a calamity what about guns and what happens in that situation\nWell I have a saying that if you can't protect that it's not yours or a weapon is nothing more than a tool just like a hammer or saw\nThat you used to protect your family and your property or the second amendment is is the constitution it's the law the land or anyone who says otherwise I Believe it's wrong\nAnd to the buying the proper weapons for the proper purpose is definitely something that every ... regardless of their political beliefs\nBecause like I say if you cannot protect your family and you cannot protect your home you have to realize that someone with a stronger force is going to come and take it from you and and possibly kill you as well\nWell that is absolutely true terrorism we saw what happened in Paris we saw what happened with this crazed married couple

I think they're going to find that this was clearly a democratic yet and dragging this woman who is clearly delusional about a ... a you know a sexually assaulting her\nHouse [laughter] well you went to a lot of funeral homes sometimes as an invited guest because you could see the ... the person who died\nRight and that's what I mean in all honesty I could probably go to three funerals a day seven days a week that so many people want to talk to their loved ones for the last\nTime he was ... always near their cash skipped during a funeral or are they\nNormally yes standing at the foot of the casket because that's usually where the life family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects\nAnd so anything that said they can hear because they're very very nosy and as to what people are saying about them or how they look or you know they they like to know that stuff and but in the last seven or eight years\nThis business where the IRS table set off to the side with all these photos in and their life in pictures\nAnd if there's a group of people standing around by those pictures than this bureau will go over there and listen to what they're saying and it's funny because I've already been there where a man said the that lady with that had on over there I said yep\nHe said well she's saying that that picture happened when we were in Missouri she's out or her mind we weren't in Missouri when that happened we were in Pennsylvania\nAnd it's like okay no I'm not going to go arguing with your lady friend over there so\nSo they're very interested in what goes on it very interesting [noise] usually well it has to be an immediate family member that invites me you just can't believe how many nosy neighbors there are yeah I ... at any rate I go to this this particular funeral demand was standing at the foot of his casket\nAnd he looked at me he said you can see me I said I can and I told them why was and\nHe said I bet my daughter found you she would find somebody crazy like you\nAnd I'm thinking okay and so I said well I said yes your daughter did call me and he says I got my son doesn't know anything about this\nAnd I said to the to the daughter I said does your brother in law you called me she says oh yeah he's really into this\nAnd I just sort of looked at as you go out there and gave him aside look and so he said will call my son overhead her call my son over\nSo he says to me tell my son to go home right now that my brother bill is in my basement trying to break open my gun cabinet oh boy and I looked at him and I said now you're telling a crazy person that I mean you know he called me crazy\nWas it was his brother going to try to do so thin or what was his wanted the collection of gun oh he wanted to just keep 'em from Salem right\nSo I said to the sun I said your uncle bill is in your dad's house right now in the basement trying to break open the gun cabinet and the sun looks at me he goes no he's not I just saw on the half hour ago and I said\nQuaint them out to me he's lucky he says you know I don't really see him I and the father said my house is two streets over I says apparently your father's house is only two streets over and he would do this and she said I didn't tell her\nAnd I said please go home and go down the basement and see what your uncle doing\nOh sure enough this wrong bill was breaking open the ...\nOh sure enough bathroom bill was breaking up in the ... yeah\n[noise] so it it's interesting when things like that happened or were they telling me

they think\nThat they won't be able to see what's going on what their family or watch their grandchildren grow up and it's like no no no no no once you go into the light you can come back and forth you're not gonna miss anything plus the fact there's proof of that\nBecause if you take pictures and you get or herbs in pictures\nPerfectly round circles that can be little they can be big that can

who it is\nIf the or is like in the middle it's that dust particle don't worry about it\nYou have looked a lot of negative energy ... what did you concluded about\nWell I really believe it's pretty easy\nAnd you hate to put this out there but I it's actually pretty easy to put negative energy on somebody it's not as big of a ritual as\nPeople think it is I mean if you think about it you don't care for your neighbor and every day you're well what are you fighting about you're fighting but the property line\nSo every day when you see him come out of his house and go in his garage to leave or cut his grass you're sitting there in your kitchen watching him going oh you jerk I Hope you break your knee or I don't like you why don't you move\nYou know look at it this way if I said to you George tomorrow morning at ten o'clock I'm going to have some minor surgery say a prayer for me\nI Will say a prayer for you exactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen every time she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't debts get now\nCan that person one realize this is happening to them and to fight it off\n[noise] they can eventually but remember comma you know be careful who you try to throw under the bus you never know what\nGoes around comes true that's true right but I mean the the recipient of the curve ... for example oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI think if it's done with enough intent or if you actually go to someone for his cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody they pretty much know what easily\nThe three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one to all three of them and and no particular order is health money or relationships\nAnd you know of all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problem dating and you always had a good time and all of a sudden now you're going out with a new person after the second data which over right down the toilet so something's going on\nBut if you you know if you go to somebody like me or you look at my one book that he has the instructions and how remove negative energy once that's taken off and anybody can remove negative energy or somebody you can't do it to yourself\nBut you can definitely have a friend do it and once that is released and gone you're fine the same thing with health if a person has a curse on them and they've got a bad health\nProblem and you go to the doctor you go for an MRI you go for the peace and you'd have blood work done the doctor goes no\nEverything is normal there's nothing wrong with ... we can't find anything but gosh if you have a curse than you are negative energy and you what is

to take calls your calls next dollar as well Marianne let's get back into ... want to talk about the dream stayed what can be conjured up that way but when someone puts a crush on an individual mhm does the individual\nWhat happens to them do they feel something did they see I think someone put a curse on me\nWell when things start going bad and you don't feel good or your relationships go down to to where you lose your job and you can find a job\nUm then they start thinking that's when you hear oh I'm the born loser I must have a cloud over my head [noise] uh if I didn't have bad luck I wouldn't have any luck and people don't realize that especially if everything was going fine in their life or normal in their life\nAnd everything gets going down the tube and eventually they figure it out or they go to somebody or somebody that they know go she bit ... luck for the last\nYear what the heck's wrong when you when you start thinking about it and like I said you know what nobody has to live like that you don't have to be a martyr do something about it had it removed it's not hard to do you can do it\nAnd as long as you know ... actually the person doesn't even believe they have a curse on him and I tell them that they do sit down in front of me I'll take this off of you they don't even have to believe that all they had to do is give me their permission\nMy grand daughter got a promotion where she was working and uh apparently she got a promotion over somebody who's thought they were entitled to that job yet and she did it fair and square you know decent and everything she's great girl\nAnd but strange things started happening to her I mean things that would always go well\nThings were really kinda screwed up and she called me up one day it's a papa ... I think somebody put a crush on me and and I should Ari let's let's think about this for a moment ... who would want to do this to you I mean you're in good fun person you're nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over and I want a ha and then I said\nA couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes ... and sure enough it ended up being a person who apologized and took the curse off apparently and everything's fine\nBut stopped sending negative energy to hurry war off right exactly\nSo my question is when someone does get hit by a Kurdish mhm how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who put the curse on them\n[noise] that's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the remote vote is\nUm did you take somebody away from their spouse and other where did you have an affair with a married person\nBelieve you me a woman you know ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to find somebody in the nose a woman gets angry at somebody\n... women meaner than men she's gonna curse that person and because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens and but\nThe bottom line is this who cares who did it just get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself do you have to call ... ... how do you get it off\nNo you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and they can't they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and in one go speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nHe is every buddy susceptible to a curse word about someone who's got so much energy and positivity can they put up this force field to kind of block it and shield it\nNo unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the cruises removed that doesn't necessarily\nForever because once occurs is removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that may be has to be do something at every full moon or generational curses they just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were first\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed most people as long as they you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to\nHave a curse removed off of them again it does not affect them as a matter of fact about a ball players let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's a game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York and so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time there best hitter gets up the whole stadium is\nGoing oh leaves you jerk don't hit the ball given out and then they clap if he does\nIts negative energy thrown on that person\nOh yeah absolutely and that's why the home team is an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their playing to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's gonna be added on every other stadium that is not his home stadium\nSo and that's why I Do some any ballplayers all kinds of all players will\nHer ballplayers in a slump let's say ...\nGood a slump or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time and the other thing too it's especially ballplayers look at the dead fans that goes that hang out in stadiums\nYou know you couldn't walk up and stand next to LeBron James at a basketball game you would never get on court the guards and everybody would keep you away sure\nBut gee if your ghost who's going to stop you know exactly

with him though\nI just don't get it killer that's weird\nAny you got some strange things happening over there\nYes it has been for a long time in the footsteps upstairs in the air when all three of us mama grandma and me I was sitting here and we all heard the first steps up stairs\nWhile you know a lot of people hear footsteps like that strange things Tom thinks is houses haunted he says he your stuff not let's go there and in Frankfurt Kentucky used to the Rockies am\nHow am I joined Murkowski and I'm gonna say that\nEven though I Know judge Kavanaugh's gonna be on the court okay\nProbably outlined though\nI Am I Believe he well and I'm going to make a deal with them [noise] I saw a lot of less representation and deception on both sides\nAnd he\nWas there at and joined in on some of that manipulation\nAnd therefore I'm hoping that he will do what king Solomon dead and pray for wisdom and learn to love the truth so much that he could never\nJoin in any kind of manipulation of the truth he will learn to love the truth so much that maybe some day you'll be as great a justice on the court as judge Judy could be\nInteresting to them all of that would you vote for him\nI Would have to do it to like Murkowski yet he's not ready he might he might someday be the greatest judge we ever had on this for\nYou may you may end up with that indeed\nYou might do that

kind of want to say I ... I was listening a earlier and I was just wanting to say um we just need to really mellow out [laughter] [noise] we really do there's there's just so\nMuch negativity and so much pressure in culture right now that I I think it's just feeding this kind of mass\nAnxiety and uh maybe that's part of what what um you know I'll be talking about tonight with with the tower oh because uh uh tools like a terrible cards I Believe it or not [laughter]\nI'm a very very helpful for remembering who we are and I'm letting go of all of the [noise]\nUh [noise] beliefs and programming constructions and opinions and a cultural biases and all of that it's it's a way of suspending all of that stuff\nAnd taking a deep breath and receiving um through images two pictures that\nCome to us from a really a mysterious place nobody knows the origin of the ... car to tell you the truth we know some things about it\nIt ultimately the tower is a mystery we know that it it it descends from ancient mystery schools and a ancient wisdom that it has been called the perennial philosophy [noise]\nUm but there is something a universally relevant for everyone in the ...\n[noise] how far back as we've been able to track the terrible\nUh Thirteen Ninety I Believe is the earliest evidence\nOr fourteen twenty is the first full deck that we know about in the Italian Renaissance\nBut no one knows who the first designer was actually ... I I really like that I think it's part of what ... is ultimately it's it comes from the human imagination\nMaybe it was given to us from above huh\nUh from above or from beyond our or below [laughter] below\nOr within and you know I'm a union psychologist so uh we're then is to a place that I look\nLet's explain to her all the people who probably knew what it looks like but they might not know exactly what it is\nUm it's a tool for self exploration it comes out of the Italian Renaissance um it's not it was not brought a two year by the gypsies as is often miss misinformed\nOr actually the gypsies Cain quite a bit after the first ... started to emerge a in Italy or Spain or other places in Europe\nUh it is a deck of cards um and uh in in some ways it's it's not clear which came first the playing cards at the terror of cards actually\nIf you think of the standards set of playing cards that is equivalent roughly to what's called\nThe minor are ... of the Cairo\nYour child has an additional twenty two cards\nThat is called the major are coming and these are the cards um that people commonly uh think of when they think of Cairo card you know they have they have the magician\nLike an old picture card and you fool\nAnd wheel of fortune and things like that\nAnd deaths your favorite car George yes it is [laughter] a secret because I'm fascinated by it I Know I Know you are\nAnd it is it is an extremely a beautiful car the draft card as is the devil card and the tower ... usually three cards which people think are the most\nUh uncomfortable cards at the major economy but every court in the ... as a positive and negative aspect\nI'm In the modern tarot which is really my forte um has really moved since uh you know ... it can vary a cult oriented in the\nUh nineteenth and a early twentieth century England with the society of the Golden Dawn and that's where the modern Cairo really was bird with the uh weight jak the Arthur wait\n... the writer weight tarot and what what uh what happened then was very exciting in the world of gyros that\nFor the first time the minor are caught I which are like playing cards a deck of playing cards each one of the tips or the miners were finally illustrated with rich dynamic pictures that tell a story\nWith rich dynamic pictures that tell a story before that time only the majors only the pardon the expression Trump Card\nMhm where we're going to talk about that yes you're right\nBut I'm only those had pictures that you could actually just look at directly and\nUh get an impression of ... and kind of just kind of sense of what was going on there the miners before or the twentieth century\nUm just had geometric design so if they're forced suits you know like my heart's clubs diamonds and uh what's the other one uh age\nRight those are equivalent to the tarot the terrace huge of\nA cups sir words tentacles ... won and all of the those minor cards she's had geometric shapes on him so if it was a seven of cops there would be a just a picture of seven\nChalice is on it say and that's all you had to go by now there is\nA very rich and dynamic a image that goes with the meaning of that card and uh there are probably six or seven hundred ... a new and different tarot deck today out on the market\nBut they all pretty much followed this the basic tarot convention so that\nDoesn't really matter which deck you're using and some are very out there even my deck is pretty out there\nWith them or you came up with your own new\nYes correct um but it's the same architect\nSo you know the card is in the car has an image and the idea is that with an archetype an archetype is virtually any exhaust the ball but it's only known through an image or archetype ... image\nSo uh like Joseph cambell wrote a great book called the ah what is it called the uh\nUh ten thousand names of the uh I Can't even remember what book I'm referring to put the idea is slate George\nA lawyer in his late [laughter] I Love it though\n[laughter] but the the idea is that uh every archetype like say the chariots uh where are the hero here with a thousand with the housing faces or with whatever the name of that book as\nCan be a ... and many many ways if no one image that describes an archetype so that lends itself to artistic interpretation so\nTell us also a richly interesting a visual art and different tarot decks emphasize different aspects of the archetype but\nIt's the same archetype British the same a principle um in when we talk about the archetypes I'm In a union since\nI'm we're with terror we're talking about a special group of archetypes in these are called what Yom Carl you own the great a Swiss psychologist and philosopher center\nCalled the archetypes of transformation\nThat Iran with a thousand cases that's thank you think that was\nUm [noise] but it's it's the archetypes of transformation is what the major are kind of the ...\nThat means these are the images are the archetypes that are all about spiritual transformation and are not in a religious sense\nBut more in a sense of um the uh destiny of the human being the completion where the whole ... of um what it is to be a human being that\nIs believed to actually uh to be hardwired in the brain\nI'm In that through evolution we have been\nA unconsciously are playing out are falling a certain blueprint certain a basic what

went to a lot of funeral homes sometimes as an invited guest because you could see the ... the person who died\nRight and that's what I mean in all honesty I could probably go to three funerals a day seven days a week that so many people want to talk to their loved one for the last\n... always knew their cash skipped during a funeral or are they\nNormally yes standing at the foot of the casket because that's usually where the ... family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects and so anything that said they can hear because they're very very\nNosy and as to what people are saying about them or how they look or you know they they like to know that stuff and but in the last seven or eight years\nThis business where the IRS table set off to the side with all these photos in and their life in pictures\nAnd if there's a group of people standing around by those pictures then this bureau will go over there and listen to what they're saying and it's funny because I've already been there where a man said see that lady with that had on over there I said yep\nHe said well she's saying that that picture happened when we were in Missouri she's out or her mind we weren't in Missouri when that happened we were in Pennsylvania\nAnd it's like okay no I'm not going to go argue with your lady friend over there so\nSo they're they're very interested in what goes on is very interesting [noise] usually well it has to be an immediate family member that vice me you just can't believe how many nosy neighbors there yeah I ... at any rate I go to this this particular funeral the man was standing at the foot of his casket\nAnd he looked at me he said you can see me I said I can and I told them why was and he said I bet my daughter found you she would find somebody crazy like you\nAnd I'm thinking okay and so I said well I said yes your daughter did call me and he says I got my son doesn't know anything about this\nAnd I said to the to the daughter I said does your brother in law he called me she says oh yeah he's really into this\nI just sort of looked at him and you go there and gave him aside look as though he said well call my son overhead recall my son over\nSo he says to me tell my son to go home right now that my brother bill is in my basement trying to break open my gun cabinet oh boy and I looked at him and I said now you're telling a crazy person that I mean you know he called me crazy\nWas it was his brother going to try to do so thin or what was his wanted the collection of gun oh he wanted to just keep 'em from Salem\nRight so I said to the sun I said your uncle bill is in your dad's house right now in the basement trying to break open the gun cabinet\nAnd the sun looks at me he goes no he's not\nI just saw on the half hour ago and I said point them out to me he's lucky he says you know I don't really see him I Am the father said my house is two streets over I says apparently your father's house is only two streets over\nAnd he learned to do this and she said I didn't tell her and I said please go home and go down the basement and see what your uncle doing oh sure enough that's wrong\nGo down the basement and see what your uncle doing oh sure enough that's wrong well bill was breaking open the ...\nYeah [noise]\nSo it it's interesting when things like that happened or were they telling me were money's hidden or a I Can't tell you how many gifts I found for wives\nThat the husbands died right before their birthday or an ... and you know it's like look in this covered in his shoe box you gonna find a really pretty necklace that he's out for you you\nYou give them closure\nI Do I Do think about it you know ... it would have\nBeen really nice to talk to a couple of your loved ones before you couldn't do it anymore and I think people like that and it's not always wears the key to the safety deposit box a lot of times it is but not all the time\nWhen a when you're dealing with the deceased how many of them are you and generally you know that their debt\nEvery one of them\nDo you not come out of your body and looked out in your spirit leads the body and look down and go holy smokes I Am dead\nSo they're not in denial they are not and I know there's some psychic sent me the and said that they don't know they're dead but I mean\nYou know then you don't how do you not know usually I I Would agree with you yeah I Know you can do\nThis now I'm not saying they're happy about it but he didn't really know that they're dead\nYou know not everybody who dies moves on thinking this is all fun and games ha ha I'm dead and I'm going to happen it out to be depressing even for some of the uh the deceased I Would guess\nWell you said a lot of them are set because they think that they won't be able to see what's going on what their family or watch their grandchildren grow up and it's like no no no no no once you go into the light you can come back and forth\nYou're not gonna miss anything plus the fact there's proof of that because if you take pictures and you get or herbs in pictures perfectly round circles that can be little they can be big they can be any color they can be sparkly\nThough there's fear that have crossed over in our back for a visit\nIf there is a design in the middle of the or\nEnlarge it you can usually CSI profile or a face of who it is\nIf the or is like in the middle is the dust particle don't worry about it\nYou have looked a lot of negative energy ... what have you concluded about though\n[laughter] well I really believe it's pretty easy\nAnd you hate to put this out there but I it's actually pretty easy to put negative energy on somebody it's not as\nBig of a ritual as people think it is\nI mean if you think about it you don't care for your neighbor and every day ... what are you fighting about you're fighting about the property line\nSo every day when you see him come out of his house and go in his garage to leave or cut his grass you're sitting there in your kitchen watching him going oh you jerk I Hope you break your knee or I don't like you why don't you move\nYou know look at it this way if I said to you George tomorrow morning at ten o'clock I'm going to have some minor surgery say a prayer for\nMe I Will say a prayer for you exactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen every time she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't debts yet\nNow can that person one realize this is happening to them and to fight\nIt off [noise] they can eventually but remember calmer you know be careful who you credit for all under the bus it you\nNever know what goes around comes true that's true right but I mean the the recipient of the curve ... for example oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI think if it's done with enough intent or if you actually go to some one for his cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody they pretty much know what easily\nThe three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one two or all three of them and and no particular order is health money or relationships\nAnd you know of all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problems dating and you always had a good time\nAnd all of a sudden now you're going out with a new person after the second day to the job right down the toilet so something's going on but if you you know if you go to somebody like me or you look at my one book that he has the instructions and\nHow remove negative energy once that's taken off ... and anybody can remove negative energy or somebody you can't do it yourself\nBut you can definitely have a friend do it\nAnd once that is released and gone you're fine the same thing with health if a person has a curse on them and they've got a bad health\nProblem and you go to the doctor you go for an MRI you go for the teeth and you had blood work done the doctor goes nope everything is normal there's nothing wrong with you we can't find anything\nBut gosh if you have a curse than you are negative energy and

hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over\nAnd I want a huh and I said oh look couple of these people is there one day or that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes ... and sure enough it ended up being a person who apologized and took the curse off ... and everything's fine\nBut stopped sending negative energy to her a war off right exactly\nSo my question is when someone does get hit by a Kurdish mhm how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who put the curse on them\n[noise] that's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is\nUm [noise] did you take somebody away from their spouse in other words that you have an affair with a married person\nBelieve you me a woman you know ... ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to put somebody in the nose a woman gets angry at somebody ... women meaner than men she's gonna curse that person\nAnd because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens\nAnd but the bottom line is this who cares who did it just get it off how\nDo you get it off can you do it yourself do you have to call ... ... how do you get it all\nNope you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and they can't they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and in one week the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nYou use every buddy susceptible to a curse what about someone who's got so much energy and positivity can they put up this force field to kind of block it and she'll do\nNo unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the curses removed that doesn't\nI personally know that his work forever because once the curses removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that maybe has to be do something on every full moon or generational curses they just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were cursed\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed most people as long as they you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to\nHave a curse removed off of them again it does not affect them as a matter of fact think about it ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's the game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York and so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time they're ... gets up the whole stadium is going over leaves you jerk don't hit the ball given out and then they clap as he does\nIts negative energy thrown on that person\nOh yeah absolutely and that's one of the home team is an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their plane to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's gonna be added on every other stadium that is not his home state yeah [noise]\nSo and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players\nWill her ballplayers in a slump let's say ...\nGood a slum or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time and the other thing too it's especially ballplayers\nLook the dead fans that goes that hang out in stadiums you know you couldn't walk up and stand next to LeBron James at a basketball game you would never get on court the guards and everybody would keep you away sure but gee if your ghost who's going to stop\nYou know exactly\nWhat about the dream state visiting the dead and for other things\nOnce a person has crossed into ... they can absolutely come in and out of your dreams you can talk to them you can get all kinds of information from them you can get a hard\nA kid I mean it is so comforting to be able to talk to these people they look good they look at the uh happy they look healthy\nAnd but if the person has not crossed over you will never dream of them earth bounce spirits can not getting dream\nNow if an earth spear does in your bedroom while you're sleeping you're going to have the desired dreams technicolor Raul flashy\nUm well wakes you up and you're breathing hard but that goes was not in your dreams where\nWith Mary and when ... year website

suitcase and did you come here with your family come alone I came along for the ... so uh but it became a lawyer I guess you know ... English is the first language in India and the United states you really wasn't any difference was probably pretty easy to assimilate into the United states that's true and and and be able to\nHave that is true for fear of it yet ... being humble is so uh\nWhat was your biggest fear a stage that is what is out there for me\nAs it was it was the fear of failure of ah the pursuit in\nA way to it at the curiosity factor but I'm striving for the unknown\nDid you allow yourself to a to sink and consider the repercussions of coming back as as a quote failure having not done what he was out to do\nI I was not thinking about that because I I've done a fair research and I know what I'm\nGoing to do with ... that confidence come to just say I wasn't even thinking about failure\nI think it came from my prior experience from a little bit from my schooling and my parents and people\nHave businesses that started the sale of the time it's a ... where was the rose colored glasses mom or dad or\nA combination of both of it so I think it's my dad got the tenacity and strength and in what way [noise]\nUm it's okay to fail is something that I've and I've been going up and ah at home dad failed something of a couple of instances where it meant an indelible impression my mind but um\nBut in general I I go with him at his office and I see people look at him as a strong hardworking person so I just made an impression on\nMe mhm uh Brian what do you think of a fairly or in the green room you talked to a full a bit about what motivated you back when you were in India in school and that you were felt driven in school do you want to talk a little bit about that\n...

I think I have something different from them as being compassionate listening to people and and\nUh I think I I did a good job back then on and I'm doing the same thing and understanding the strength of weakness of people and and to a empower them it's\nGoing and you actually built a team and start a business even in in high school about India\nCorrect right I've I've got a couple of my friends close friends um I got them under me and then they are believe it or not right now still working with me in different businesses so that's a where or when\nYou were Seventy how old are you now I'm forty four forty four so when you were Seventeen you started a business in school in India you're telling me you're still working with some of those folks\nAre absolutely there Mike ... all the people I work with all this with me um as I grow up they're also riots I took um Roger you really enjoy their company\nWait a minute let's camaraderie we really enjoy the company so you you wow you really do understand where the where people can be where they can see the ... and also it sounds to me like people really trust you uh I I guess [laughter] John\nYou mentioned the compassion and empathy where did that come from ... from my mom and I and\nSaid growing up uh she used to be with me\nOr didn't yeah getting me homework and all that I had it those are moments I all the ... of member and to be to use the same skills what woman had a few church where he talked\nSo when I Lived down she confident says that's OK it that especially in economics and because of the end as they begin to kind of makes if I if I get second grade and stuff as a black\nShe will sit down and say that's OK that you're you're on a comeback bounce back you can I Do love\nAnd supported by your mother ... what's that have to do with how you've built this organization hundred and twenty people\nI I I think I ... I call kid the same thing in them I make sure that implies feel that I'm and piling them with what they can do John\nSo ah what sacrifices did your parents make decision here where the the rich\nThey're not that there are a working class and and uh they have to ... ... among all financial but then also they have to cut shots and all their um personal goal to see me and to hell and\nSo what do you think about your success today\nI uh that's all it's a feedback loop here I always talk to my parents more frequently and and their power and how are you paying that forward\nAnd I actually go back to the school that I that state and I I\nHad a ... as a small seminar to assemble the and the and that's my principal who has one moment or models and and although you went back to school that you went to how recently was that was about three years back and what'd you do\nI went there and I contributed to the lab and I I did some are made a financial country promotion\nWhy did you do that because it's it's a sense of giving I thought I learned a lot from there from my principal and she was actually my role model a besides my parents I wanted to give ... why would she role model\nShe wasn't Australia and she came to my home town and she felt that there's a need to put us to establish a school uh-huh and she ended up staying there and living there and she just died last year and what what did you learn from her that has anything to do with building a business\nIt's a if you believe in something you can be a compassionate showed the empathy and and\nFocus on what you're doing is also a lot of medical follow what part of her shows up at ... business consultant well almost every day and then I see I I Am always mingled with the team everyday rather different proposal lighting or a delivery or anything and I I feel like\nI should make them feel all this part of their um I'm there for them if they need any help\nTalk what problem does not have a test solve a for a business\nWise yeah but we we who are coming from technology back on our focus is on the emerging the technology we do a lot of a cyber and a cloud initiatives veto data analytics um mostly I Do more of a nation\nWhere I was just taken by your connection to the teacher and it sounded like you were impressed with the jury is coming to from Australia to your community and solving a problem there as a leader little people ... ... what website address for\nI did did you read a lot of books that as a kid constantly and what kind of books did you read history political science that we still got the newspaper every single day so I Would get home and I would read the newspaper and so they are the books to read all sort of have this theme of again the social sciences yes teams\nAnd is that consistent with all the conversations you said you had your parents or or at least we're listening to conversations you fear parents' health one other it was to a large extent and that you know the Nineteen eighties was a different area of documents the Cold War um the politics media\n... was a different area of document the Cold War um politics media things were happening on TV\nJust front and center and you could go back and I remember reading a book on Watergate at the time the Iran Contra affair was on TV that was my summer between sixth and seventh grade and how did your your love of the social sciences history politics all that how that drive you forward into your career\nIt's really all interconnected ultimate you know government is a reflection of people people are consistently the same overall we all have things we love things we hate things be what do we all generally want to make a difference\nAnd so you've got these bigger interconnected systems that if you can understand them and you can understand their place in time you have a better understanding of where you're going to be as a leader and where you can take your organization ... about how young were you when you realized everything was connected what happened [noise]\nUm probably fifth grade or the space shuttle exploded\nOn January Nineteen eighty six I think it was the twenty eighth or twenty seven so I was in fifth grade standing in the parking lot in front of ... elementary school and middle class and a big deal\nBecause Christa McAuliffe was the first teacher and she was on that shuttle when it exploded and that was our community and my friends over parents were engineers Kennedy Space center was you know thirty forty miles away it had a big impact on our economy or culture\nOr what was the impact on you yeah um they made me understand that okay you know this is a national program it's science that face but it affected\n... friends' parents lost their jobs and moved away um the the business slow down for my dad installing floor um it had effect we grounded the space shuttle hum\nAnd all that stuff I understand that you realize the ripple effects of everything how's that affecting your building this organization known as on the right\nWord trends or provider so we're in a in a sense it's we're connecting people were connecting alive so we transport you up the street we're taking you to work you're going to earn your paycheck and we're going to bring it home to your family\nBoy oh boy see about connections to to you or who's got the next ... is\nThere is is there a philosophy here that there is a elegant perfect\nSolution to something in your workplace or is the answer that the chaos that you saw that you had a lasting impact in Nineteen eighty six that things can just need to be pushed further into a better place what what's the operating guys guiding principle here\nHum it's this concept called sense making everyone that in my organization had their own experience if you brought everyone and asking these questions are all going to have a different answer and they'll see the same thing a different way stuff you can try to find that middle understanding of hey what drives you what polls you to be what drives you to be great what drives you to make an impact\nThan you can actually pull people beyond what they thought they learned in college or what they thought they learned from life experiences and it puts purpose behind what they do when you work at a public organization there is a higher calling sense to it even if it's from the private sector supporting\nYour your government your country or local politics and community it drives you beyond just what you went to school to study and it sounds to me\nLike a Rob Schneider

just you know to just words that really aren't than helpful in our everyday life of trying to make this transition\nGreat question and I think the language around this whole time period is very problematic and it's continually changing and so in answer to your question I think the important thing is that discussion\nNot so much that terminology for me the way that I define semi retirement is it's that period of time after you've left your long time big fulltime career and\nYet you don't want to be fully retired you still want to remain engaged and active and\nThat's what's in the retirements about\nNow you coach people you coach people to make that transition from retirement to what you call semi retirement in ... statistically or empirically from your experience or most

shows for all the past ... years because\nAnd of course you can always listen to all of our shows for all the past years because they're all archived they're OK Nancy let us go back we promised everybody that we would give them some ideas some learning by example\nReal cases that you've had that it just stuck in your mind or or been an important or in advancing the careers and the retirement of the folks you were helping it was a couple of examples\nSure um well I think one of my favorite examples from the book as a woman named Abe young she's actually from New Jersey\nAnd her her story is that she was a primarily a a stay at home mom very active community volunteer and by the way I wrote the book and in two thousand ten so a lot of the people that I interviewed where people who had been hit hard\nBy the financial downturn in in to that other than a yeah I'm so in any case he he's a ...\n... was somebody who her husband had his own business times were tough she quickly needs to get herself back to work [noise] uh and and she was trying to figure out what what she was going to do next um and\nEve is somebody interesting stories she's a Native American background I'm married to a Jewish man\nAnd she ah has and and because of her personal story has always been very very interested both in ceremony because that was part of her a heritage growing up\nAh and also in the whole issue of a cultural differences anyway happened to come across a training program to become a celebrate what's to celebrate well you've probably heard of interfaith a minister's people who uh\nDo wedding ceremonies funerals et cetera for people who come from different religious faiths and cultural backgrounds well there is actually a whole training program nine month training program run by a place called the celebration foundation\nThis really spoke to eat and so she went through the training program and she now a officiate at weddings and this is not just stay you know congratulations you're married type of thing she really spend time with the couples\nHelps them a figure out what types ceremony they want she does a lot of research to make it a really meaningful rich ceremony she does that and then during the week a purely by chance she happened to stumble upon an ad member of the show a Ugly Betty [noise]\nHappened yes stumble upon an ad for that that they were looking for acting extras and she went to the that the show she spent a day on set now you don't get paid a whole lot doing that\nUm I think she told me at the time it was about a hundred and fifty dollars a day\nUm but it was a blast she had so much fun so she signed up for additional work and here's what's so interesting I said to her I said you know if you're sixty you're African American you got grey hair\nWas that a problem in getting this work and she ... and she said are you kidding me she said you know how many twenty something blondes there are out there looking for work\nThat aren't that many people who look like me doing this type of work\nAnd there are dozens of TV shows and movies sets where they want people to look like me so I have a continual stream of work [noise] um so I I Love her story 'cause I think it's a it's a great illustration of just keeping an open mind keeping your opportunity antenna up\nUm and you never know what you're going to find\nI think there's two parts to this to\nThe end of your show a we have a little thing and obviously this show get out their kids and make it happen for the first thing here you can see about this about even she was very proactive\nShe ... and the second is it's a big world we do tend even if the sixty or Seventy years to become myopic it was so much out there it is just unbelievable\nAnd that when we're younger and we have to stay in a path and we have the responsibility to our children and the mortgage and all this sometimes you you you have to have\nA very restrained lifestyle but after retirement the great great part of it is the freedom you have\nTo be who you want to be and to say yes to a lot of things that might even just pay a hundred and fifty dollars which you couldn't have done if you were working at that time so the ability to say is is to me that's what retirement is\nThe right the ability to say is I I Want to pick up dancing on a couple of things first of all I Do want to remind everybody that Nancy book we'll read some of these very inspiring and instruct the stories sick an act careers and her and that's also available through her\nA website my lifestyle career dot com now\nYou mentioned something though which was the year two thousand eight other listeners have my show no then I'm a financial German colleges I won't even bother you with what that is but the point is it has to do with money as you get older\nAnd and I had to work it when people come to you do they talk to you about money in the sense that they're retired but they're not financially independent and they need to make money is is this particular example with somebody who really needed to make some money\nWasn't just you know for the self um actual is Asian of it all how much does that come into the picture\nYeah well you know as as you well know the financial side of things is a very complicated issue and so I hear about money or in different ways I also meet with people uh I recently spoke with a gentleman who it's sold to companies he has\nPlenty of money in the bank and yet getting paid for his time it's something that is still important to him just for his own sense of self worth\nSo money is and and another thing is I've spoken with people who say you know what I really have enough but the idea of having that little extra income even if it's only doing something sort of fun that's going to generate maybe a thousand dollars a month\nHaving that extra stream of income coming in as opposed to drawing down on savings is really comforting to me so absolutely it it always is is a piece of the puzzle and sometimes they have to think about\nAnd when we come back then to think about it is something again that I get a lot of response from from my listeners and that is a I promise to unpack the word unquote career you gave me some very good direction about that when we were talking off the air\nI Want to go back to that for the person who doesn't necessarily need money or maybe there is even though some salary and all of this payment and all this\nDoing good in the world we want to be volunteers volunteerism and volunteer tourism is a big word now but what if we really want to make a semi retirement career out of that and doing well well we'll talk about that\nIn a moment we met me for my I\nSo think about a couple of getting divorced they they're\nThey're most pray prized possession is the dog\nThe courts don't want to deal with it they go to her she helps them work work that out\nThat was a topic she felt passionately about helping families with those types of situations and helping the animals and she's both a very successful business around so in the book uh on my website I have different stories about this as I said on court dot org also has some great stories um\nThink about where your gifts like think about the problem is you want to solve and where's the intersection of those too\nYeah you know I'll give you a very personal very quickly and and then I Want to go on to something that we also talked about and I don't want to miss it and that is the mix about a semi retirement that we still harbor like it'd be very very quick example of what you're talking about\nUm I Am not retired I have a blog and of course a radio show but I'm also a financial German colleges and uh\nIt's something that I Love more than anything else and its interior design\nBut it was not something that was done you didn't go into that when I was a kid just not ... but all my life I have been doing this\nPersonally [noise] so ah as a finance major in college is the number one thing that you learn about his health care costs and what's efficient and what isn't the fish and now they have something called the healing space\nSo I'm going back to school too and that is for my career in health care designed puts them both together\nNow you're right uh I could not become an interior designer now would be impossible for me to start a business of any meaning at my age but because I'm already in the field and because I have that love for it and because I feel that it's a contribution to the world it really does help people heal\nAnd it built environment non touchy feely way which I have no skill in I I can do that\nBut I Want everybody to know it took me six years to figure that this is maybe with Nancy it would be a couple of hours\nTook me all the time to figure it out and it is something that can be done part time fulltime we do the work and so on but I wanted to tell you that as an inspiration that snap fabulous example\nYeah I mean it's it's a real example so he is the point though there are minutes about this one might be that everybody's doing it or you can't do it or you know it's only for people with money and tell us some of them is that you'd like the ... when it comes to semi retirement yeah\nSo I'm I'm going to challenge the something you just said which is that someone came to me they could figure it out in a couple of hours and I I don't I don't want to oversell what I can do for people the fact of the matter is and you know this from your own personal journey is that what I can help people do is I can help them become\nReally clear on what their motivating skills and interests and and what lights them up\nUh I can help them do that I can help them learn about all sorts of places that they can explore possibilities\nUm and I can help them figure out how they can go out and test drive their ideas but and this is a big but that that time period that it takes once you get out there and you start trying things out and you start talking with people and you learn about new possibilities\nThat can take months and even years and you know your comment about a turkey was six years to figure it out not unusual um so I don't want to discourage people but I think you have to be realistic\nUm this doesn't these are these are big important things and they don't happen overnight but the most important thing is spent some time thinking about it and they get out there and start trying things out because\nWhen you're out there and that's when the conversations happened that someone says to you\nKnow I Know of someone who's hiring or did you ever think about war I just heard about this training program it doesn't happen when you're sitting in your house and so you got to get out there have those conversations and that's when sir antipathy happens\nWe'll aren't which brings me to another point here and that is when is the best time to start obviously six years let's just take those six years if I if those six years started when I was fifty\nA instead of when I was sixty four that'd be bet so should people start thinking about this pry into retirement I made it yeah it's a time when it's so working right so I\nThink that what I usually advise people as a couple of years before retirement there are some things that you can do\nTo just start thinking about it you're not going to make any decisions but you can do things like you can sign up for my newsletter you can take a look at sites like next stabbing you\nJust you know you start reading these these interesting articles funds stories keep a file a an idea file and and you know you can spend Fifteen minutes a week on it um it's just to get get your thoughts cook it [noise]\nUm so that's step number one uh I think also it's never too early to just begin to start to think about what you might like to do again no decisions necessary just start the process thinking about it\nAnd then when you start to get closer to retirement you might want to pay more serious attention to it but\nI Am also certainly a big fan of people taking a couple of months off after they leave their job go have fun recharge the batteries get away from the old routine a lotta times by doing that it really allows you to just relax and\nFor a team a lot of times by doing that it really allows you to just relax and open yourself up to the possibilities for but start thinking about it\nI think we're going to take a break and and it's unbelievable\nThat then again in my land and what can you hang on hang on to higher happy can really

about everywhere\nYou know I I Am Alexa\nWhat the temperature is\nAnd I I'm noticing temperatures are dropping across the country\nWhere my daughter is Kansas the temperatures dropping\nWhere my son is in New York the temperatures dropping where my relatives are in Michigan\nThe temperature is dropping\nYou know that that is all happening it was Ninety three degrees here today where I'm at but I did notice something when I walked out the door this morning at about six thirty\nI walked out in my front yard\nAnd I just I just notice now we have not had that first major cold front to come through that knocks all the heat out of here he just has not happened yet it and when that happens it is absolutely glory as it is and this is the end of September and it hasn't happened yet but when I walked out this morning\nIt wasn't like I walked out into an oven\nBut then I went in and I asked Alexa what's the temperature was in at six thirty this morning it was eighty two degrees here which meant that it was going to get even hotter but the humidity or something I don't know I could just I could just feel it on my skin\nThere was a slight difference an even later today as the temperatures increase didn't it was into the nineties\nI could feel\nA little tiny change in the air is that is strange I I learned this from Dr ... the doctor a barn yard science Google him I have no idea if he's still alive he used to be a guest on the show I'm thinking probably isn't there if he is\nIf he's still alive he used to be a guest on the show I'm thinking probably isn't or if he is I I doubt it but ah he wrote a bunch of books and\nHe he he\nPredicted whether with a tree out on the side of his office the weather tree and hit dials into the thing in thermometers enter the thing and\nHe used the\nOld fashioned methods of predicting whether which sounds crazy as hell I mean it really does until I took an interest in it and\nAnd started you know learning a little bit and he\nHe actually sent me a couple of old books\nI mean old books about it and it's it's very difficult to do if you ever read the almanac says this is they use these methods in the ... which by the way require keeping charts and and you know measuring ground temperature and and all you know\nIt all kinds of watching where the stars are a ... it it it's hard\nIt's really difficult but I found it years ago I found it to be fascinating and Dick had it down but they could always he told me once\nHe said one of the best indications that the weather's going to change soon even if it's hot as you said you will feel it on your skin throughout your whole body where did that immediately I'm thinking the guy is totally weird but he wasn't\nBecause he was right because I started paying attention to this and today I Swear to you I noticed although I looked at the you know on the weather is ... and it says it's going to be hot all week and next seven days I Swear\nYou know I I just felt it today I could feel a little I was I'm that more aware of things and I just I just felt that it was coming\nAnd we're going to have to wait and see if I'm right or if I'm wrong I Will tell you that did was right eighty seven percent of the time people all across the country would pay him money\nTo tell what the weather was going to be on a certain date and they would go like months out you know someone who was planning an outdoor wedding\nThey would get a hold the deck and say we want to do it on this date and Dick wanted to know you know the exact address a word is and he would look up the longitude and latitude and it was going out there with his tree and he was you had charts and the all those\n... role and he'd come back and he called the people up he'd say\nMan you you have a planned on on a Saturday could you do it on Sunday because it's kind of rain on Saturday or how about friday in the afternoon it might be better\nAt you or you know what they say what about next Saturday he'd look it up the next Saturday is much better go the next Saturday the Saturday before one has a wedding on a Saturday he could do this and he could get this done\nI have no idea how he did it I have no idea why it worked but at work and people pay the money I uh another thing people paid him money for was to figure out when to plant crops\nAt you know certain longitudinal attitudes what you know when do I plant certain crops and he would get this thing narrow it down and I will tell you that there were professional mostly tobacco growers in Kentucky\nWho swore by him just absolutely swarmed by him but that's not all uh there was a hydroponic rural or in Florida that I knew that I turned him on to decry Meyer and he\nJust absolutely\nYou know he he said Dick knows everything when it comes to winter plant and yeah he he just does and this was all done\nUsing old folk methods it was old folk predicting\nAnd you know I was trying to learn how to do it it was very very difficult and I got to where I was a reasonably good at it\nBut it would take so much time in at the time that I ... I had my kids were young\nAnd I would be there on a Saturday after the radio show with all my charts and everything all laid out there and you know and my wife is saying I you know it's soccer it's time to go there and I'm just doing I I I finally had to give it up because you know I had kids I'd responsibility with them\nBut still fascinating now all my kids are grown all have these annoying cats\nI ... I could do it again but I wouldn't have Dick to call up\nLast time I talked to ... key we was in ... and it's been years he wasn't doing all that great he'd had a couple of strokes and\nUh you know he was he was old then so it's been at least Fifteen Years since I talked to a deck so I don't I don't think he's around anymore but sure learned a lot it it was very very interesting and he could predict this is this was the other thing\nHe could predict what was wrong\nWhich rubbery or any kind of plant in an area [noise] you know by not even being there by going onto his whether a tree and all of his dials and everything he could predict stuff as far as problems that\nWe were having with plants and I used we used to do this on the radio show or I Would have mine live and people would call and they'd say something's wrong with my shrubs and he'd say what is your ZIP Code or what is the address\nAnd you know that that's how it was done I remember\nAbout five years ago when I was sick when I'd been in the hospital and came out and they said you're going to be home doing nothing for two to three months I said I'd like to take this time to get back into this folk whether predicting type thing\nIt was more than my brain can handle it the time much more but something to think about and yeah I Do feel\nMy skin I Do feel a little bit changing now soon as it changes a little more I can start thinking about doing our fault planting which I Am just\nItching to get to it ching a ching itching to get to\nFall planting rocks it is my favorite thing to do you're listening to ask the garden geek I'm Michael crows [noise]\nThere is just a lot of debates that don't work there was one ah that had hydro medical non as the active ingredient it came out it's a brand name ... years ago and I could not get it to work well I just couldn't buy had to tell you this stuff\nThe reason that it works is because not because of the board catch it all the Bork acid is why it works but if the attracting if the stuff that the Bork acid was not tasty for bugs if they were not attracted to it and did not like it and did not go to it\nThen this isn't going to work at all it's just a total waste of time\nYears ago years ago there was a ... acid Roach bait called it works it didn't\nIt had the same amount there and there was another one called magnetic Roach bait that did work it was very popular I think it's still around and places I bought some at a farm store once it was great stuff\nUh but this product it works had the exact same amount of Bora gas it in it that you know the magnetic a Roach bait did but it didn't work why because the attracted to narrow the stuff that they put in there to get the bugs to eat it\nWas an attractive to the bugs and if the bugs were not attracted to it it did not work now this stuff this Mother Earth scatter bait\nThey say works on slugs which is great out in the garden okay out and you're shrub garden that it works on snails they say uh I don't know I haven't tested it on snails but they say it does but it works on just big goofy bugs crawl around out there and\nThe area I got to tell you the area on the east side of my house is a dark airy nothing really grows back there because it's dark my neighbors trees overshadow everything and my house along with my neighbors trees overshadow everything\nAnd it just doesn't work or you know nothing's going to grow so leaves fall in there I used to let it be natural but I gotta tell ya uh there's bugs there were there was a\nA two by six back they're laying on the ground pressure treated would it it was it was laying on the ground and I took the thing and um I needed it moved so I had second I at this was when my back which really bothering me\nI said back up his act I say we need to take that out of there I just don't like that they're so he grabbed as soon as he picked it up he totally freaked out the bugs that were coming out from underneath that which is you know kind of why I decided to put this bait back there\nThey all laid it yeah and don't you have areas on your property that are like that\nWe all do you know now I guess not all of us do but you know any of us\nWho have serious trees and things like that around you're going to have areas here property and you know in the old days we just took heavy insecticide we'd take tourists bad back there spray the bejesus out of it and they would all die but then you've got all those chemical there yeah and the older I get the less chemicals I really want to deal with\nAnd I and I think that's fine that that's what I Want to do and this I got to tell you\nThis bait worked wonderful I I was absolutely\nAbsolutely ... ah pleased with it so you know\nGosh that and that's just wonderful and there are some commercial varieties of that out there uh but you know just just take a look around uh I think I saw this at home depot also so there that is something that you can do now\nWent to a client went back to visit a client's this week that I had been to five months ago\nHad rental property\nHave very large oak trees growing over the top of it\nBranches were falling down on the building causing damage they you know had me look at it and said how much do you think it would cost\nTo get that removed I said why are you calling me why don't you call Ann Arbor as to does tree removal well because we trust you I said okay we just want your best estimate as to what it's going to cost and you can tell us for that I said oh All right\nSo I just you know pull out the old cell phone and took some pictures of it\nAnd I sent it I I right then and there I just sent the pictures over to a friend of mine who's got a tree surgery business he looked at over he said you know you're talking about four or five thousand bucks to get these trees removed out of their\nLow and behold they called me up and they said you got to come out and take a look at our our situation out here now because now we need advice on planting other plants there I went out and the trees were removed and the one large tree the trunk is still you know the they cut it down at ground level\nBut my goodness gracious I was so impressed it was a very large large trunk\nBut the middle of it was so rotted out that I Am surprised that whole tree had not fallen on the building and that's what they you know the the guy that cut it down told the home are very you know they said this is just a mess\nTrees nearby buildings bad just they just are you got to spend a lot of money maintaining it and in this case this these people had to spend about six seven thousand dollars just to get the trees removed and thank God they did\nBecause at one tree was ready to destroy everything\nSometimes business owners and

send everyone in his contacts list\nThe movie he was watching in a video of him watching that movie\nThat's just nasty now he says he's not too worried because of the time that he had that password the computer you had had no camera so unless they were outside filming and they're not going to have a video of him but he still wants to know what the heck is he\nOkay see now this is this is really common is this more common than you might think because I've noticed that as I've been going through my you know I read every emails from listeners I noticed that as I've been going through the email is that that seems to be ... oh yeah it's crazy stuff [noise]\nAll right so Roger you're not overly concerned about it but seven thousand dollars in a sex extortion scam as crazy isn't it\n[noise] yeah that that's one life word for it [laughter]\nAll right and this was the how long ago was this [noise] [noise]\nWell I use that costs were probably seven or eight years ago\nAnd then have you you ... not very often because\nYou know has become more difficult where you add numbers and symbols and everything and this didn't have any of that so it was an older passport [noise]\nBut I used it for everything so I don't know if they actually got it off adult website or if they ... the other a company or something right and just said it was often adult website it\nWhat what are the things that you can do is that there's a website have I been pond he W any day and you can type in your email address and it will tell you whether or not the hackers have gotten\nA any password associated with that email address but you gave a couple of clue like one of ... you said like you know you use that password on the same password on a lot of different sites which you know quite frankly don't feel like a dummy 'cause a lot of people dead until we realized that that was probably not the best idea okay I was a dummy\nOkay and you are still using that passed for that that if I were with you I Would just like you know slap you right across the face for doing that because you need to stop using a password okay\nNow what ... what's happening in is that these uh hackers are getting hold a username and password and then they are crafting these emails in in a classic sex extortion scam or you don't want to pay them they really won't go much further than this\nThey may send you another email but don't feel beholden to actually give them any type of bitcoins but just for safety I Would go ahead and make sure that I'd change any passwords they actually use this particular password\nI

[laughter] I mean he said yes I sure do but we're planning on going back and it got me thinking next time we go to Russia how can we prepare ourselves and be secure\nOK so a friend of mine who lives in London and eager now okay is that um she was telling me that she went to Beijing\nAnd so she had her windows laptop they're connected to the hotel why fight [noise] okay and she said all of a

they would not do that at all gosh God neither what the Russians what are you worried about\n[noise] [laughter] well I Would love to add up to talk to you before we called but that was the option and in fact I have a kind of a two part question number one\nThe ... always been ours devices or less vulnerable and Android or PCs now if you just first confirmed that then I Want to talk about the peons\nOkay um [noise] the the reason why that people say that Iowa devices are more secure is that there are ... that apple keeps a hold on everything okay\nSo in order for you to penetrate through the operating system is that you have to go through multiple levels of encryption you can jail break an iPhone if he wanted to and basically take all the security and the trolls and right away\nBut if you are trying to get a piece of malware onto an Iowa device that it is more difficult than say Android or window so yes that is true [noise]\n[noise] well what I did do sorry on this trip\nWas caught a little bit of a fold [laughter]\nNot do [laughter] it's a it's a VPN but I wondered if that was enough or if there was more the U.S should be doing in a situation like that [noise] what\nDid you do everything while you were overseas I mean did your bank and pay your credit cards and check Facebook in business and stuff like that\nDid have to check my bank once or\nAnd this and stuff like that\nI did have to check my bank once or maybe twice but I Try to avoid that didn't do anything with credit cards except Oakland obviously ... to ... um [noise] uh it was mainly just to tricky meal\nAnd then did you do everything through the VPN or did you fall like eh we're where you go like well you can check email one\n[noise] it wasn't so much that is there were several types it seemed like the the PIN prohibited me from getting on a website and I don't mean that particular website ... just like anything getting on the Internet period\nAnd it couldn't do that depending upon what lockdown can be in a particular community and a particular country and so I'm a lot of the pie and if you look at their coverage maps and then you want to make sure that they have multiple access points within one particular city\nAnd so that this way you can get out if you want it to ... you know it's it's a it's a really interesting topic because in my email this past week I also had a note from a gentleman who was in China and couldn't go anywhere because he was in China you know of course the they didn't have the great firewall there\nAnd they're stealing anything that they can but that's a whole another topic\nWhen you are ... traveling in countries like Russia and you do come back you know the general rule is that number one before you go is that you make a complete backup of everything a sudden it this way if you need to restore it then you'd be able to because sometimes coming back in the country are going to a country believe it or not that you may have your device confiscated\nAnd if it is confiscated weather here or abroad uh three or six months you might be able to feed again but quite possibly a year and nobody wants that to happen so that was not your issue I Would recommend that you change all your passwords to any account that that you have had access to\nA especially your even though you didn't use a VPN\nBecause I wouldn't want you to take any unnecessary risks and then be sitting here thirty days after a trip and typically they're going to wait until you you're at home for thirty days and then you start seeing some weird stuff happening you know what I mean\nUm and if you haven't already set up some type of authentication on your bank account I Would definitely encourage that but in my wallet I carry a\nAbout the size of a thumb drive I don't know if you've ever seen news in the sun Dr has a rotating code on it even now I can tell you I can show you that there's a coat on it and every thirty seconds I get a brand new code if you don't have that

observance and behavior we know the spiritual impact and the deep and lasting conversion that can be achieved in the home setting years ago a study established that for young men\nThe influence of the

that you might teach my people with authenticity he then went on to express how this experience had bless him with perspective about the great realities of eternity\nSuch glimpses of eternity can help us to travel the next hundred yards which may be very difficult to help us travel and triumph over are hard times with such glimpses of eternity may I suggest two things we must face hard things first by forgiving others and second\nBy giving ourselves to him we father\nFor giving those who may have caused or hard thing and reconciling ourselves to the will of God can be very difficult\nIt can hurt most when our hard thing is caused by a family member a close friend or even ourselves as a young bishop I learned that forgiveness when my steak president Ruth Sam Cooke shared the following story he explained\nDuring the late Nineteen seventies some associates a nice start a business although we did nothing illegal some poor decisions combined with challenging economic times resulted in our failure\nSome investors filed a lawsuit to recover their losses their attorney happened to be a counselor and my family's bishop Rick\nIt was very difficult to sustain the man who seem to be seeking to destroy me I developed some real animosity toward him and considered him my enemy\nAfter five years of legal battles we lost everything we own including our home in two thousand to my wife and I learned that the state prison saying which I served as a council was being reorganized\nAs we traveled on a short vacation prior to the release she asked me who I Would choose as my counselors if I were call this the new state president I did not want to speak about it but she ... persistent\nEventually one name came to mind she didn't mention the name of the attorney we considered to have been at the center of our difficulties Twenty years earlier\nAnd she spoke to spare confirmed that he should be the other counselor\nCould I forgive the man\nWhen elder David ... Sorenson extend it to me to call to serve as the state president he gave me an hour to select counsellors through tears I indicated the lord had already provided that revelation\nAs I spoke to the name of the man I considered my enemy the anger animosity and hate I had harbored disappeared in that moment I learned of the piece that comes with forgiveness really atonement of Christ in other words in my state president did frankly forgive him like me five old\nI knew president cook and his two counselor in his counselor as to righteous priesthood leaders who loved one another I determined to be like them\nYears before during our misadventures in Alaska I quickly learned that blaming our circumstances on others the pilot launching the food out in the fading light was not a solution\nHowever we experienced physical exhaustion and lack of food sickness and sleeping on the ground or in a major storm with only get to talk to cover us I\nWith God nothing Shelby impossible young people God requires hard things that view one fourteen year old young women participated in competitive basketball she'd dreamed up play in high school basketball like her older sister\nShe they learn that her parents have been called to preside over mission in Guatemala upon arrival she discovered that a couple of her classes would be in Spanish language she did not yet speak\nThere was not a single girl sports team at her school she lived on the fourteenth floor of a building with tight security and the top it all off she could not go outside alone for safety reasons\nHer parents listen to her cry herself to sleep every night for months just broke their hearts\nThey finally decided they were sent her home to her grandmother for high school when my mother and her daughter's room to tell her our decision she saw our daughter nearly man prayer with the book of Mormon open on the bed the spirit whisper to my wife she will be okay and my wife quietly left the room\nWe never heard require self to sleep again with determination the Lord's helps you face those three years valiantly at the conclusion of our mission I asked my daughter if she was going to serve a fulltime mission her answer was no dad I have already served I was just fine with that\nBut about six months later the spirit of ... me and the night with this thought\nI called your daughter to serve a mission my reaction was heavenly father she hasn't given so much I was quickly corrected by the spirit and came to understand that her missionary service was part of the lord\nI sent my daughter to launch from across the table I said guarantee do you know why we're here she said yes that you know I have to sort of a mission I Do not want to go but I'm going\nBecause she gave her wield the heavenly father she served him with all her heart in my mind and strength\nShe has taught her father how to do a hard thing\nIn President Russ Limbaugh Nelson's worldwide devotional for you the request he requested some hard things of the youth\nPresident Nelson said my fifth imitation is for you to stand out be different from the world the lord needs you to look like sound like act like an dress like a true disciple of Jesus Christ\nI act like an dress like a true disciple of Jesus Christ that can be a hard thing\nYet I Know you can do it with joy remember that men are that they might have joy with all

children of men\nBecause of that love and kindness Jesus Christ suffered the atonement\nAs a result he says to each one of us in the world he should have tribulation\nBut be a good cheer I have overcome the world because of cry sweet to can overcome the world\nAs we face hard things in the Lord's way may we lift up our heads and rejoice at this sacred opportunity to testify to the world I proclaim that are save your lives and guide to church in the name of Jesus Christ amen\n\nAs parents and I and we have a sacred responsibility\nA duty to awaken within our children passion and commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ to the light and the truth of that gospel\nWhile raising our children we establish traditions within our home and we build patterns of communication and behavior within our family relationships\nIn doing so the traditions we establish should ingrained strong unwavering characteristics of goodness and our children that will infuse them with strength to confront the challenges of life\nFor many years our family has enjoyed the annual tradition of camping high in the you went to the mountains of north eastern Utah\nWe traveled twenty miles over a rocky dirt road to arrive at a beautiful green valley with towering canyon walls and through which runs the river filled with cold Clearwater\nEach year hoping to reaffirmed the value of gospel doctrine and practices within the hearts of our children and our grandchildren Susan and I ask each of our six sons and their families to prepare a short message on a topic\nThey feel is an important element in the foundation of a Christ centered home\nWe've been together for a family devotional in a secluded place and each presents their message this year our grandchildren wrote\nThe topic of their message on stones and then\nOne by one buried them next to one another representing a short foundation upon which a happy life has established woven among all six of their messages was the immutable eternal truth that Jesus Christ is the cornerstone of that foundation\nIn the words of I say a therefore the lord God behold I lay in science for a foundation a stone I tried stone a precious cornerstone ashore foundation\nJesus Christ is that precious cornerstone in the foundation of Zion it was he who revealed to the prophet Joseph Smith where for being not weary and well doing

alleged abuse in her case um was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen\nAnd then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nAll the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mr Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't Shaw shore herself civil is Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that should go away and this one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News any more if they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate the stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nWell even the Democrats are declined to fully embrace the Julie sweat mix story\nBut on the original story that Christine for a story I think what we're going to find and what we're already finding is that the people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like Peter Smith and mark judge amazingly enough\nThey're telling the FBI at the same thing I told you this shirt committee which they have no memory at all to support this\nNow I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections or you know remember a Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big deal with this party entry in the capital calendar July first Nineteen eighty two thirty six years in three months ago by the way\nI'm In it or who is that the party and it didn't match up with a with Christine forks account of this but they thought this was a big deal so let's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that that I think there are three additional people calm Bernie and squeeze\nA who had not been interviewed earlier\nA and I think you're going to find three more people who don't know anything about\nA Christine ports are allegations so uh I listen I I I don't think this FBI thing FBI investigation is a bad thing I think that they will find out\nThat there is no evidence to support this declined out actual real evidence to support it than I changed my mind but I don't think it's fair\nWell if you go through I thought it was really devastating new report by Rachel Mitchell um now he's the independent prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes and she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be\nExtremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so they brought in an independent prosecutor to to question professor Ford who showed incredible respect to her\nBut she pointed out of he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove itself\nAnd then she goes on this cases even weaker than that and then she Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues there was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault\nHappened I mean the dates keeps shifting back and forth dramatically actually the failure to previously identified judge Kavanaugh's the assailant\nA inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember key details\nWho invited forward to the party how did you get to the party where did the party even take place how did you get home from the party\nUm and and it goes on from there but every case is similar in as much as there's no collaboration there were big holes in the stories and at some point when do we ask is this becoming a witch hunt we know that that Bert Katz says her friend sending out emails\nAnd she's a woman that went after Paula Jones and supported Al Franken so she's not exactly consistent on the issue of of sexual misconduct and they're sending out letters to gear so and so do you know anything please call us do those letters when I went\nI Know please some core operation you know ... ... right in the time they said they call they talked to dozens of people that can be set says twenty four people were more I mean that is a lot of people look at it on on the Rachel ritual thing\nYou know she was a lot of criticism of her and um I think that the way she approached it was not\nA really good way given the limitations of a Senate hearing where they always did she have to be interrupted every ... minutes but she did\n... I was looking today at her questioning of a Ford about her therapist and ... notes and the white we even know about this because remember\nFord says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty thirty\nSix years to two thousand twelve and she ... she says she's in marriage therapy with her husband and she tells\nThe therapist about that and she later also tells an individual therapist about that as well and she checks the therapists notes and therapists notes do not mention the name\nBrett Kavanaugh and she says as a matter of fact it's only her husband remembering that after session she brought up Brett Kavanaugh's name\nThat is the only evidence that it took place in the therapy sessions and by the way you would think such therapy sessions and the note there would be confidential but of course she gave them to the Washington Post so there's probably no longer\nA confidential so even even her account of how she finally mentioned this to someone after thirty six years raises a lot of questions\nIt really is amazing now we have Judiciary Committee Democrats now they want a new investigate the quote ice throwing incident in college you know this is what it's found I'm\nRight here on the trivia but that's what they say\nNow we have the the democratic hope uh Hawaii senator the one that said to men to just shut up and sit down on Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants that investigation into the ice throwing incident I'm\nAt a ball game and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity about was he truthful about is drinking he said he ... he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college in high school kids I drink too much beer but they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event um\nNobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said to somebody I blacked out correct so does he still a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him\nOh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him so here's the question I go ahead where ... ... yeah\nWell I'm an emphasis on the effects misconduct allegations too was he truthful about his drinking and I think that's one of the fact\nThat there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking ... mentioned many times in his testimony that you are in fact drink\nToday rocks published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking tricare mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr they gotta let it go there thank you so much Byron York uh with us sanctions on Washington Examiner eight hundred nine four one Sean has a toll free telephone numbers we continue from Washington DC we'll get the very latest from Senator Lindsey Graham who's been in the forefront of are literally pointing out the madness that this has now evolved into\nA listen we all have just gotten through summer and a lot to be have you know little sun spots\nAnd skin irritation from the summer well look good friends at ... and Jen you so well they now have a brand new product it's there's sunspot correct her and you can watch your sunspots aged ... read in plain patches vanish right before your eyes right from the swamp and the sewer it's the Sean Hannity show\nWe'll get to your calls we have Lindsey Graham and much more Hannity tonight\nNine eastern on the Fox news channel as we continue [noise]\nNow\nThe same mind name Sean Hannity damn right and this is Sean Hannity show\nHannity on\n\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender\nWe've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your eight stays locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRicher look we've only got when I turned thirty year ... permission and conditions people having liquor licensing office he takes animal that number thirty thirty visual conditions are exclusion may play\n... kills you just taken lives destroyed families and ruined childhoods\nWe need to take action immediately the missile field a patient registry active twenty Seventeen we create a patient registry for researchers cancer in a a less habit missile researchers needed to we need to find a cure for this devastating disease\n\n\nDear brothers and sisters is the marvelous to continue receiving revelation from heaven through president Russell M.

wholesome creativity\nThere is joining imagining learning during worth while new things this is especially true as we deepen faith and trust in heavenly father and his son Jesus Christ\nWe cannot love ourselves enough to save ourselves but heavenly father loves this more and knows this better than we love or know ourselves we can't trust the lord and lead not on to our own understanding\nHave you ever been the only one not invited to someone's birthday party\nHave you ever been chosen lapsed or not chosen when teams were selected have you prepared for a school chance to job interview an opportunity you really want it and you felt you field have you prayed for a relationship that for whatever reason has not worked out\nHave you face chronic illness been abandoned by her spouse agonized for family\nThat's been abandoned by a spouse agonized for family\nAre said your nose or circumstances as we exercise God given agency and engage all our faculties and humility and failing our savior Jesus Christ can help us meet life's challenges and joins\nThese includes the desire and choice to believe faith also comes from obeying God's commandments given to bless us as we follow his company path\nWhen we have felt or feel uncertain alone frustrated angry let down disappointed or strange from God in his restored church you maintain and take an extra measure of effort in fate to enter again on his cabinet\nBut it is worth it please come or come again on to the Lord Jesus Christ God's love is stronger than the courts have death temporal\nOr spiritual are saviors atonement is infinite and do you turn on each of us strays and fall short we may for a time loser way\nGod lovingly assures us no matter where we are or what we have done there is no point of no return he waits ready to embrace this second\nOur campfire faith can encourage us to minister new\nAnd be willing to take up on a the name of Jesus Christ and thereby qualify\nLike my young eight year old friends to be received by baptism into his church\nAll who's sincerely desire to take the saviors name upon them must qualify for and received the ordinance of baptism as a physical witness to God of their decision\nBut baptism is just the beginning the word take is not passive it as an action word with multiple definitions likewise our commitment to take up on us the name of Jesus Christ requires action and has multiple dimensions\nFor example\nOne meaning of the word take is to partake or\nTo partake of or receive into one's body such as when we take a drink\nBy taking upon ourselves the name of Christ we commit to take his teachings his characteristics and ultimately his love deep into our being so that they become part of who we are\nThe ... the importance of president Nelson's invitation to the young adults to properly and vigorously seek to understand what each of the saviors various titles names means personally for them\nAnd to feast on the words of Christ in the scriptures especially the book of Mormon\nAnother meaning of the word take as to accept\nA person in a particular role\nOr embraced the truthfulness of an idea or principle\nWhen we take upon us the name of Christ we accept him as our savior and continually embrace his teachings as the guide for our lives\nIn every meaningful decision we make we can't take his gospel to be true and obedient lead livid with all of our heart my mind and strain\nThe word take can also mean to alignment oneself with a name for a cause most of us have had the experience of taking on responsibility at work or taking up a cause or a movement\nWhen we take upon ourselves the name of Christ we take upon us the responsibilities of the true disciple\nWe advocate his cause and we stand as witnesses of him at all times and in all things and in all places that we may be in\nPresident Nelson has called upon every young woman and every young man to enlist in the youth battalion of the lord to help gather Israel and all of us are grateful to take up the prophetic call to profess the name of his\nRestored church has revealed by the savior himself the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints\nIn the process of taking the saviors name up on us we must understand that the cause of Christ and all of his church or one in the same they cannot be separated\nSimilarly our personal disciple ship to the savior and active membership in his church are also inseparable\nIf we falter in our commitment to one our commitment to the other\nWill be diminished as surely as nice follows day some are reluctant to assume the name of Jesus Christ in his cause because they regard it to be unduly narrow\nThe name of Jesus Christ in his cause because they regard it to be unduly narrow\nLimiting and confining in reality taking upon us the name of Christ is both liberating and enlarging it awakens the desire we felt when we accepted God's Plan through faith and the savior\nWith this desire alive in our hearts we can discover the real purpose of our divinely given gifts and talent experiences empowering love and grow in our concern for the welfare of others as we take upon us the saviors name we truly lay hold upon every\nGood thing it is important to remember that taking the saviors name up on us does a covenant commitment\nBeginning with the covenant we make it baptism president Nelson has taught our commitment to follow the savior by making covenants with him and then keeping those covenants will open the door to every spiritual blessing and privilege available\nOne of the parental privileges of taking the saviors name upon us by baptism is the access it provides to the next ordinance on the covenant path our confirmation\nWhen I asked one of my eight year old friends what taking the name of Christ meant to her she replied simply it means I can have the holy ghost\nShe was right the gift of the holy ghost is received by confirmation after we have received the ordinance of baptism this gift is the right and opportunity to have the holy ghost as a constant companion\nIf we listen to an obey is still small boys he will keep us on the covenant path we entered through baptism warn us when we are tempted to depart from it and encourage us to repent and adjust as necessary our focus after\nIs to keep the holy ghost always with us so that we can continue progressing along the covenant path\nThe holy ghost can be with us only to the degree we keep our lives clean and free from sin\nFor this reason the lord has provided a way for us to continually ... refresh the purifying effect of our baptism through another ordinance the sacrament\nEach week we can witness that we are willing to take up on us the name of the sun again\nBy reaching out and taking the emblem of the largest flesh and blood in our hands the bread and the water and partake of them in to our various cells in return the savior performs his cleansing miracle yet again and qualifies us to have the continuing\nInfluence of the holy ghost is this not evidence of the infinite mercy found only in the name of Jesus Christ\nJustice we take his name upon us he takes our sins and sorrows up on him and yet his arm is stretched out still to encircle us in the arms of his love\nThe Sacramento is a weekly reminders that taking a fond of the name of Jesus Christ as a living and continuing commitment not a single event that happens once only on the day of our Baptist and\nWe can continually and repeatedly enjoy that sacred holy offering by man least understood to have our sensory admitted and take his flesh\nAnd blood it is a little wander than that when ever the children of God to understand the powerful spiritual blessings that can come from taking upon them the name of Christ they're feeling\nIs always of joy and their desire is always to enter in to a covenant with their God\nAs we follow this divinely design covenant path our commitment and efforts to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ will give us the strength to retain his name written always in our hearts we will love of God and our neighbors and feel a desire to minister to them\nWe will keep his commandments and yearn to draw nearer to him by entering into additional covenants with him and when we find ourselves weak and capable to act on our rights as desires we will plead for the strength that comes only through his name\nAnd he will come to our aid\nAs we endured and faithfulness the day will come when we will see him and be with him\nAnd we will find that we have become like him that's qualifying as to return to the presence of the father\nFor the saviors problem is is sure those who believe on the name of Jesus Christ and worship the father in his name and endure and faith on his name to the end will be saved in the kingdom of God\nWith you I rejoice that these incomparable blessings are made possible by taking upon us the name of Jesus Christ of whom\nAnd in whose name I testify a man\n\nWe're great for for all who spoke to us this afternoon and for the beautiful music that has been provided by this mission or require\nAs you're all where we have made changes to the general conference schedule which become infected with this conference we will have no\nPriesthood meeting this evening\nInstead we will have a general women's session for all sisters ages eight and older which world commands and the conference center this evening at six PM mountain daylight time\nThat children may draw near to God and he will draw\nNear to you this is a promise to all\nWho see to believe the scriptures reveal that the more we love God and his children the happier we become the love Jesus spoke about however isn't a gift card throwaway move onto other things well\nIt is a love that is spoken often then forgotten\nIt is not a let me know if there's anything I can do sort of love\nLove God Speaks off is the kind that\nEnters our hearts why did we awake in the morning stays with us throughout the day and swelled to our hearts as we give voice to our prayers of gratitude at evenings and\nThis is the inn express civil love heavenly father has\nFor us it is this endless come passion that allows us to more clearly see others for who they are\nThrough the lens of pure love we see more to being self infinite potential end worth and be a lover sons and daughters off almighty God\nLungs received through that lens we cannot discount disregard or discriminate against anyone\nThe famous work at a softening\nBiased small and simple means that great things abroad to pass we know that are direct fires repetitive practice to become good\nAt anything whether it's playing the clarinet taking a ball into a net repairing a car or even fly airplanes\nIt is through practicing that we may become better and better the organization or a savior created on earth\nAt church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints helps us to do just that\nIt offers a place to practice living the way he taught and blessing others the way he did his church members\nWere given calling responsibilities opportunities to reach out in compassion administered to other reason to leave the church has placed a renewed emphasis on ministry or serving or love each other\nAnd this is\nTruly a a wonderful way to minister on a way to all of those around us\nIt is\nA more refined ways to love and serve our\nFederal beings by ministry to them in many ways grade saw last takes you to determine\nWhat we should call this special emphasis one of the names considered was shepherded offending a reference surprised invitation to feed my seat however\nIt had at least one complication using that term\nWould make me a German Shepherd [noise]\n\nConsequently yeah I'm quite content with the term ministry [noise]\nOf course this emphasis now is not new it seemed to provide some renewed and refined opportunity for us to practice the saviors commandments to love one another\nRefined way to implement and practice the purpose of the church just think about that mission there weren't\nThe courageous humbling confidence sharing of the gospel is a wonderful example of ministry in to the spiritual needs of others whoever they are\nOr doing temp work seeking out the names of our ancestors and offering them the blessings\nOf eternity what a divine way off ministry\nConsider the act of seeking out the poor and the navy lifting the hands that hang down or blessings is sick and afflict are these the very act of pure ministry the lord practice when he walked\nThe earth if you're not a member of the church I invite you\nTo come\nAnd see come and join with us\nIf you're a member of the church but preferably not participating actively\nI invite you please come back we need to come\nAt us strings two hours

all things become you God chose that's the direction to move forward\nAnd apart he says if you love me she might come in\nThere it's all work together to become the people God intended for us to be ... this is the kind of gospel culture we decided to cultivate throughout the church of Jesus Christ\nWe seek to strengthen the church as a place where we forget one another\nWhere we were since the temptation to find fault gossip and bring others down where instead of pointing out flaws we lift up and help each other to become the best we can be\nLibyan bite you again come and see joined with us we need to\nYou both five at this church is filled with some of the finest people just wrote has to offer\nTheir white coming loving kind and sincere they're sacrificing hardworking and even Harare at times and there are also painfully imperfect\nThey make mistakes from time to time they say things they shouldn't they do things we wish they had but they do have\nThis income they want to improve

up being a far south as an eye for an as a ... a true for every three to four hundred miles an annual\nTrip back\nWow you know or or last or I Want to do it by Fannie or cats get on that and that stuff out there or a place that this area or a a at a gas or if a particular a\nLot of ... like ... or write it for\nLike ... I feel your show\nA chord of oil every hundred and fifty to two hundred miles seems like\nA law couple on the ground yeah that's a that's a lot we can now that may be a head gasket or something else you're gonna have to find out where the leak is from first and see if you want to go on with any further repairs cause of it was the head gasket Lincoln and it was run an outer belt covers yeah those\nAre really unusual on a big ... like that yeah it ... normally when you get that kind of oil consumption out of the cause I'm assuming this to be a Fort Dodge GM chassis which is going to be either a three fifty or or or three fifty one or or or you know or sixty four yeah there's just different things like that it can be an ... they're going to be\nEating that and we'll not leaking it most likely what as far as the valve the valves go if if it was if the liquid something separate and you could identify how to fix the leak\nThose older the engines is not always a bad idea to to remove the heads and fix the fix the valves at a machine shop and put that motor back to health again with his long mileage as you have on the bottom in yet\nTo Jim Jim you're on the end of the ... what can we do for you\nRecently wrote an article about a company in England that has developed a new engine gets rid of the time and change in time and bill ... springs in the valves are controlled by computer controlled electric motors\nAnd by doing it that way this company has been able to do die in a mom and her testing with this engine and the emissions are reduced by about twenty percent\nAnd they explained that the way they get the computer to time the opening and closing of the valves is safe place a sensor of some kind of on the Korean shaft\nAnd from reading that article it just really interesting it seems like just when you sing\nA gas engine really cannot be improved the very much\nSomebody comes up with this new system to control the opening and closing all the valves and\nIt just looks super cool I just hope that they can continue to develop this engine and get it into a vehicle someday because it's just a huge advancement in terms of using computers to make insurance more efficient\nAlready got some similar to that in America here in in our cars now they've taken the throttle body off the car completely\nAnd what they've done is they use the they're using oil pressure to power the valve and then electronics on the open and close it and they open the valve they open up more or less to control the Airflow so they open up more than its like opening the throttle bodies open at last\nIt got down those those are still using timing change\nWhen you were describing as I looked at too\nTo cut down on those those are still using timing change\nThe one you're describing is I've looked at too and it's it's one step more advanced than that but these these cars that you're talking about they don't even have a throttle body on them anymore they just have a whole like a diesel does the intake with an air filter or a turbo chargers\nBut there's no there's no blade in there to control the the Airflow at all anymore which moves all the or slow change everything just changes on them and like a better mouse trap you never thought they could come up with a better one\nThen they came up with a piece of stinking tape but uh [laughter] you know these inches it is true they are coming up and we think that's as far as they can go advanced I'll bet there'll be something\nThe manufacturers are there are screaming and screaming would be a bit of exaggeration but they really want us to get high octane fuels across the whole fleet and if they can do that there's there's\nThe sky's the limit type of things they can do eight six six five nine

like starving for us we have replaced ... um but I don't have any other answers or hopefully you have an idea\nWhen we get those cars indoor shop that only ACT UP on certain days certain times certain temperature certain drives they can be very difficult to diagnose and some of them we just flat out turn away and say you unless this thing does it when you bring it in so we can get in it and drive and check it\nWe're just not going to do it right now you're going to have to put up with it until it gets worse\nAnd in some cases they've already been to other shops and said well I spent a hundred two hundred bucks and another shop and they looked at it and they didn't find anything and then I got a charge that didn't get sick so I feel a little butter when I say I'd rather not touch it then and do it do you uh service then just walk\nAway and absence of any lights or any sort of an indication that you could find out that makes it very very difficult ...

from Hackney corporate speak or he did not get a timeline for the ... roll out but this is the part this is the part that I found interesting and I think going to be a major thing in the vehicle will be manufacturing the current GM plant\nAnd what they said was a partnership but this is between two giants shows the importance of scale and the legacy manufacturers in tech startups Jackie for position\nTesla has proven how difficult it can be be to produce a car from scratch without infrastructure in place or decades of assembly line experience GM and Honda have well\nThey do so that's a ... and that's what everybody keeps saying is that Tesla\nIs is pushing the market is amazing way and there there was an article I I I called the headline on when it got to be careful of headlines teases now in days but uh the fact was that BMWs recognizing the pressure that you know is being put on their midsize sedan by the by the model three I'm ... and it it's it's a real\n... but uh the the challenge for an upstart make or just like you said is that they could be innovative they can be pushing the boundaries\nBut they don't have that head start on actually having the facility to get built and if the other manufacturers decide it's our turn to jump in all of a sudden the game just changed and they have to be so established to withstand that\nAnd now the water and I've learned about living in a pool by myself but everybody else gets it gets harder to swim why loan or whatever might not be watching and seeing what was going on while I was there at a Tesla store and talking to some people that were a little more knowledgeable than me which was everybody was there at the store\nThere are gearing up and they know that they're behind in production and they know they're a start up ... when you look at Tesla or any car company that's I mean look there there quite a ways they ought to start now they were right but they were they were a nobody I think it was they said it was\nTwo or three college kids that were coming up but it wasn't the yuan must that came up with Tesla it was these college guys and then it was kind of taken over\nSo as an electric car but they started with nothing and the brutal where they are and they're ... imagine a sky is if we decided we wanted to start up a bicycle company and compete which when you know it's not going to happen so you start they've really made a mark\nBut one thing they did say they said no\nLook our plants are smaller and we're trying to do this right to get it the way we want but once we get there\nThey said their technology they have to build the cars once they get it to capacity is far beyond what the manufacturers have their like\nGuys come on we can send a rocket to space and landed on a platform that's moving in the ocean I just don't I mean we can have a an entire plant that assembles cars with less than a third of the moving parts so they go together quicker\nHundred percent with robots can work twenty four hours round the clock and quickly they said if we ever hit that mark\nWe can do it and I think the other manufacturers are going to follow suit hopefully that'll bring her car

I don't know what they think we think but the listening\n\nThey think we don't know that somebody accuse somebody else a sexual assault but the somebody that's accusing doesn't know the only thing they can remember is that he did it and nothing else and witnesses that she put forward a corroborated that they think we don't know this\n\nBy the way we have not taken a sign on that because we were not there and why we get to take a side\nHow do I know what happened I was not there\nWell we can do is go by the weight of some evidence that than that to us and the people that are cues how\n... what is supposed to just go in the tank well I guess they do it because it works with a lot of people they say we don't know any of this\n\nAnd they think we're stupid will they just lost again\nAnd you know what they're going to keep repeating they're stupid never learning a lesson and you know why because there are about rules\nRegulations fees fines mandate higher taxes and more control over things in your life that they shouldn't have control\n\nAnd they keep coming up with more thing the people that are deciding on our future\nLocally state federally\nDo you know I was reading somewhere that I Believe somewhere in California you know when you sign up for driver's license of voters you know used to be your male or female\nUsed today and of course I Know there's a there's one city they have twenty four different things you could sign on as I Want to do just put on there or or FARC\n\nThese are people that are in government that are making these decisions\nAt some of the things on the ex foreign be five I'm thinking like they're playing bingo\n\nThat's not me be literally anybody and who they want to be ... what's going on\nAs Mr logic I always ask the question where\nIs the logic\n\nAnd when I watch Bob Menendez what does the senator from New Jersey oh man that should be in jail that was even on ethics violations by his own people\nAnd of course the things he did we go to jail he doesn't the man who's also\n\nBeen accused of seeing underage prostitutes down in the Dominican Republic accused\n\nAccused I don't see anybody on the left who were saying that Kavanaugh was guilty just saying straight out\nI was guilty he was accused and that's why I don't give a crap what they have to say on the left because what if it's not good for the goose and the gander sorry I Can't help you\n\nAnd that's what's going on so message that Jim Acosta\nHey no body losing their rights because of a five four Supreme courts\n\nThe seas are not going to cover Miami Beach\n\nIf women want their abortion that they can still get their abortions\nThe Mets are still not going to go to the playoffs he manning still not going to be able to pass pass and yards\n\nThese people are a joke and that's how you get the Twenty one trillion of debt all these people up and running the country into the grounds\n\n\nSpeaking of it to the ground a leading up to this week all we had to say was that the market is still very narrow all these areas not working foreign markets underperforming this that and the other thing and then all of a sudden they started coming after growth\nAnd you never know kind of sort of what's going to lead to let the ice is getting a little bit thinner and thinner and then so\n\nAnd as we've stayed in a couple of things are going on right now that I have to be taken note of and that is higher interest rates and higher energy prices and we've said forever it has been ... lower interest rates that a buffet\nBuffered backstop equity markets asset prices around the globe easy money\n\nTrue true that and at least here on the long bonds ten years now with three point two to five without the one the half at one time which means the mortgage rates have gone up about a point and a half\nWhich means on the thirty year or two hundred just the two hundred thousand dollar mortgage thirty year the payments are going to go up about thirty five forty thousand bucks over the light that goes just towards interest and nothing else\nThat has an effect energy prices I Believe gas at the gas pump is about fifty cents and the last year right maybe even more than fifty cents over a year period represents over fifty billion dollars out of the drivers' pockets\nGoing towards the gas instead of anything else that matters\n\nSo you combine that too I think that may be a little bit of the cause and effect right now\nAnd I think that is correct because you know what the weakest theory the market is housing housing is directly affected by heart higher mortgage rates as well as the affordability factor of ... bubbles\n\nSo to some stuff going on pay attention up ness will tell you what things life I'm Gary this is one only investors that
