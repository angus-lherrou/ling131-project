California Tom go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call land that's really a pleasure a comment and then a question um I ... just you know your audio watcher programs one called living the field\nAnd the other one called living with intention and boy those audio compact desks or in Costa rotation on my CD player\nI just want you to know that that just have so much information now unique unique about\nRetro causality\nRetro intention and you cite a number of experiments that\nAppear to prove that we can not only in ... for the president but we can chat and for the past that the past is not\nFixed and stone so to speak that there appears to be with experimental proof you cite a lot of researchers\nThere appears to be a robust cross talk between the past and the future\nAnd you cite Aleppo Vicente how much met a job up here a group in Princeton and each of the experiments that they did that appear to show that you can influence the past that the past is not fixed my question for you\nCan you utilize retro intention retro causality for healing [noise]\nThat's such a great question thank you um yes the answer is the short answer is yes now I Do this all the time in my master classes in workshop semi just random retreat in Italy last week and we were doing a lot of retro intention\nOne I tend to do though is you can't\nChange the test of what of what happened in the sense of\nIt happened what you can do though is changed your response to it going forward and in a way that is part of this whole thing of time being really elastic time being one big smeared out now\nAnd that's what the studies you're talking about demonstrate is that you know we what they really show is that\nAnd this is a weird thing um we don't change the past we changed the president as it unfolds the future affects the present as it unfolds all those studies show\nBut just to answer your question when I tend to do is ask people to go back to a seed movement\nMovement in their health just when something\nJust started before it blew up to full blown disease a moment where they first argument argued with somebody in a relationship\nAnd it then deteriorated afterwards just that moment when it started or a moment when somebody told you you weren't good enough as a child or you were terrible at some things were just just did something like that\nAnd to go back and change your response to the teacher and you say no I'm not used the math I just don't understand is now I Will later\nSomething like that or imagine\nThat that healing that that illness doesn't blow up into full blown disease I'm actually had somebody who got ... from an infection go back and imagine that time\nAnd I swear to you she told us her skin was starting to re pigment in the workshop it was extraordinary\nAnd loads of people where they were they were told something\nAnd it's in his since released it for them going forward so it's an interesting little technique but there's plenty more to mess around with with retro intention because even stayed and physicists now are saying to us all um you know time is it what we thought it was it's not this\nAre saying to us all um you know time is it what we thought it was it's not just for we're going era that we thought from cradle to grave it's much more as I said like one big beard out now and one big smeared out here for the\nRich in Monterey, California is with us here hey rich go ahead\n[noise] [noise] yeah it can you hear me all carry a speaker phone a little too good pretty good okay 'cause it's kind of hard to hear you\nI Want to thank you and when\nI'm your conversation is so right on\nIt some of what you have all the time let me give you a\nA thing um I grew up\nOn a Catholic and then I heard the story that you know some people will never die of them are Feinstein says that energy only changes for him so you know that kind of back me up my whole life so all the little kid I liked the revolt bowl\nI'm like oh let the karate learned how to heat and\nIt talks about one percent of the doubt and get your nose broke right 'cause your focus is gone I'm so no\nI'm divorced from the same life twice I have a daughter she's not talk to me all the stuff happens but I'm such a positive person I knew I Would be sixty one years old\nNot working being taken care of and I am ...

DJ\nOn news radio Katie WN Katie\n\nWe are back with our final segment with Lynn Mick Jagger blend in the book the power of age what would you say was the most compelling aspect of it that you came across\n[noise] well I think it was\nThe probably that so many instances killings\nAnd I think that it was really shocking to me that it wasn't just health that was healing 'cause you know you could almost explain that by saying well it's the big feel good effect on the immune system things like that\nI'm not for instance Natalie Lancaster I mean I it was shocking to me cases like this she was one of the receivers in a power of a group and she wanted her intention to be that her family business expand in all directions and be prosperous and always\nAnd [noise] she and her husband had a computer support business but it had been built on just to meet your clients and they were you know they ... they had just heard that one of their two clients was about to take their business elsewhere and they were really worried because\nThey had lost money from a Ponzi scheme about a decade before and they had to file for bankruptcy and so she was really frightened that she was going to have to take a job I'm In real estate again flipping houses in order to survive\nSo she can't during the group session she kept visualizing both her and mark opening up their car doors and money spilling out\nAnd afterward her feeling about it for fear and their depression seemed to lift but what was really interesting is opportunities just started opening up for them they suddenly their business received a steady stream of smaller clients and within a few months\nShe they learn not only did that major client decided to stay with them but they completely diversified their client list\nAnd she and her husband had other big opportunities to um she had kind of a certain offers she paints is a hobby and she was a given offers to\nHer painting and mark was trying to do a sideline business training for a program that took off\nAnd it was just amazing for her she thought that something about the ... group not only perform magic but helped her and her husband trust in self empowerment and the possibility of prosperity\nAnd I think that's what's so incredible for me is to watch everything in people's lives begin to heal\nCan you do develop intention in your dream state\n[laughter] that's a great question I think we are intending in our dream state in a weird way though you know were intending you know somebody calls a dreams are be real you know we felt weird weird stuff going on there and dreams thought\nThey are often times pre cognitive you know they're forecasting all the time I mean I was fascinated to see when I was studying\nYou know time the fact that time is so elastic and not this one way arrow I was really interested to find that that\nPeople a lot of people pre dreamed that nine eleven um average interests to tax a looper children did a study of it and found so many people had dreams of it of planes going into buildings that has a high rise buildings\nAnd maybe not even in New York but they had that kind of very very specific dream and also they know that the Titanic had a record number of people um cancel their tickets for that maiden voyage the one that sank\nAnd the the somehow they knew ahead of time so we're picking up all\nAll kinds of information ahead of time if not beyond that you know the realm of possibility that we're also sending out what we want to have happen we're thinking about it the key though is I think being really specific as I mentioned before\nAnd also the power of a group you know we had before our break we had that caller call in about how to fix all of his his illnesses you know his pain and\nI really got to say that the one way is to get a power of a group together because let them in ten for you be very specific about where your pain is that you want to heal the\nPain in your you know if you've got to painting your left to I'm left big toe you know focused on that the really really specific about it\nAnd if you don't have I should say if you don't have seven other good friends to be part of physically we have a place on our Web site limit ... dot com forward slash forum which allows people to just sign up uh either advertise\nThey want a group and their time zone or they can join in existing group and we have hundreds and hundreds of groups that are meeting all the time on on there so you can just set up a group virtually that way\nHave you ever seen anything backfire doing is\nNo nothing I mean we've had people who say they feel worse for a little while you know after they've done the intention maybe they feel a little bit more pain but it usually resolves and it's so much better\nSo I've never had an instant yet where somebody has really got worse over this and nothing you know at worth nothing has happened but in most cases if they persist at it if they keep meeting with their group big things and big changes to start happening\nOkay let's go to the phones was picking up by going to correct truck driving in Louisiana first time caller ... go ahead\nRight on a story greet\nUm I'd a goal or a for permits Linda I'm Alive a has lupus\nAnd it seems like every treatment that we pursue has done out of a negative effect on her they put her on the uh the steroids and that ate away or a joint tissue and it's like everything as a badge on and do this I I guess the depression or\nShe ought to leave the room and the more ... than it she just everything is done negative and it's we have two teenage daughters and it's fallen out on to them\nAnd I just wonder if you talk to your group and those either gender some some good some good here in the lens or even though he just didn't happen to her\nYou know she I 'cause when I tell her you know you know stop living in the world and and stop blaming the victim I just I like and I oh yeah\nOh I'm so sorry to hear you about your wife um we do intentions of the week for people um I get my whole community you know all of my followers just send an intention for three people every week I'm On

and Washington and voters are starting to pay attention and Republicans are saying we want to see results in Washington and we don't want this to function and that's castle resist and they have struck that the Democrats are putting forward we like what Republicans are getting done three point seven percent unemployment the lowest since they put a man and the man and the numbers are being backed up by\nHigh fundraising dollars a small online down are they really are energized when the majorities keep those majorities in November\nSo in that first met ... about a sitting president that party in

that's moving three point seven percent unemployment and ...\nWho are running on resist abstract wet spring more dysfunction in Washington more investigations as very very clear and Republicans and

there's upsides and there's down sides I think that maybe the Kavanaugh confirmation did\nKind of stave off the blue wave kind of situation because I think it was building some momentum there and I

right Trump was actually I I don't think there's any accurate way to gauge anymore or you've got the human factor um\nAnd the president can't stop with poking fun at the me to sing and I don't think that is to his\nCredit but adds up to his credit but I don't think that matters right and I think you're missing the point on that I only knew that the Republican women are not running under the meat to ban or the Democratic women are normally he goes to a rally which is one hundred percent and attended by Republicans\nAnd says something against the me too movement is saying it against democratic opponents and that's the reason why he's harping on it now here's one though\nI don't see it that way at all but that's just what you're seeing where am I wrong I preaching to the choir for ... yes yes okay I just think he every chance he gets he likes to poke the\nBut there's a method to his manager so he is calculated yeah once again he's standing there beside a Republican\nWoman who is not part of that movement by design and so when he goes up there to support her he goes against that because he knows she's against it or she would not be in that position\nWell I think when it comes to

knows my feelings on it but\nI don't think there's a preponderance of women who happened to be Democrats more more abused or assaulted than there are Republican when there\nAren't but with this is

have a uh I've I've had conversations that basically\nSaid that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being a Democrat they say you know first of all it it is a limit to amount of jobs are so the the father's lose their jobs and they say we'll give you more money for having more kids\nIn your home and then we got rid of the mental health Institute in the eighties and nineties and the prisoner re just shot up now you ...\nWhere people called ... which is actually our murder rate is going down by ... percent every year I just talked to the superintendent level Microsoft Access Ron ROMs a right hand man so uh I think it's the Waverly\nThat helps you see this game called\nYou know they try to scare me to not ready to have my own friends but his hat it gives me it gives\nThe power in a way you know my dad and my mom separated so I didn't have a lot of mail energy in my home and also a I'm married to a family that I'm\nNot a lot of mail energy going on a beautiful though what there's times where you know it's something about [noise] you know I Love Hillary I Love everyone right but the campaign I'm with her just didn't\nMake me feel as a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time like a guy that could play catch with his son it was something about when I put his hat off and made me feel like Superman\nYou made a Superman that was that's my favorite superhero and you made a Superman case for me also at the guy that looks up to you looked up to ... to American\nIndustry guys nonpolitical no bullshit and just go there and it's done right now you gave me the heart to go to a seat is because that is ... when I went in\nTwo thousand Fifteen we're fourteen billion dollar company losing two billion dollars a year now we have a thirty eight million dollar market cat it's called the ... effect\nAnd I went to cast for we had a meeting in Chicago and I said you have\nTo bring manufacturing\nOn shore instead even shore into the core that about the borders the core of a sea to Chicago is the core of middle America\nWe have to make America strong I I mean the the thing made me a billionaire and I\nCould have lost two hundred million dollars walking away from that deal but even with that I knew it was more important to me to take the chance of walking away from that deal than I have no fathers in Chicago with no home and when we do have written a reformation for no good as a as a hunger limitation not\nRehabilitation 'cause they didn't have the ability and the first place we never had anyone that taught us we didn't teach us and we had no one the powder\nRight so I'm a it's more important than any specific deal any anything that we bring jobs into America\nOne of the movies that I Love the liberal tried to do with how to control a black person to the cost\n[noise] ... how to control a black person\nTo the concept of racism because they know that we're very proud of emotional people so when I said I like try to like someone is liberal they'll say oh he's right that you think race is okay\nAnd physical while\nI was like to know what you would like to President Trump to force\nAnd the thing that uh that the head of the police and um my ... when the left side of the so hard about what we feel that stop and frisk\nA does not help the relationship in the city and every one that knew I was coming here to ask about stop and frisk that's that that's a the number one thing that we're having this conversation about uh another thing is open it up\nIndustries and we've got to get some tax breaks\nTo because we know we're making um we got to the factory in Atlanta but she was a cost us three hundred dollars to his confidence to too much to make things so we need some prototypes here so we can get people back working so tired I Can't just beat us in Vietnam and we just got Levi\nThe greatest genius company in the world making their jeans and a and Vietnam so we're going to need to get a few breaks to be able to have some places in my hometown of Chicago and the two point seven million ... million\nSurrounding suburbs where we can create some factory\nI think it would be code for them to be Trump factories 'cause he's a master of industry he's a builder and I think it'd be cool to have easy id Asian center which should be a mix of\nEducation that\nGoing gets the modernization like sometimes people say this ... you know he's goal\nWe are thinking you know he's gone\nI got I think if we had I think it more curriculum like God of all\nWhy you're doing math you you\nYou learn to use it while you meditate in the morning we have to stake mental health and our programs\nAre back into the uh back to the city so\nThose are ... and also very Hoover is an example of a man that was\nTurning it around as soon as he tried to turn his life around they hit him with six like Senate ... where you say don't tear down the statues\nLeary who ... statute he's a beacon for us that he just the fish family there needs to go out and represent when you have a black leader on every single ... they can own a block it out and that's something I learned from\nJim ... from America can we need to put curriculum for people who really came from the streets now people who are just trying to set us up to go into work system were written system that apply\nTo what people are really going through which Jim Brown is created when I'm On my lunch with all the debate of the second amendment going on the problem is the legal\nOr illegal guns and the problem not not not legal ... we have the right to bear
