arrive every year and the racist to run a Harvard with all these forty thousand down to two thousand acceptance letters unfortunately\nThose accepted or not being accepted based upon their qualifications they're being accepted based upon race straight out race discrimination that is what's coming out in the trial right now or that as a result of Asian Americans saying enough is enough\nBecause they're sending SAT scores higher for Asian Americans and higher for whites\nAnd this is absolutely violating the civil rights of everyone as a matter of fact because affirmative

suggest that um all of the wonderful good liberals out there take one of these people in their own how home taken because you don't have a secret yet you may as well get some or as we discussed yesterday if you'd like one of the polio like symptoms or you can just bring it right into your household\nBut you don't want it in your own backyard you don't want it in your living room you want to take them in and then of course the liberal argument as well with all that money is spent on the military we could be spending the money on the immigrants and on the poor and on the homeless I've heard it before\nI heard it for Thirty years\nAnd so this is a big story there's a question about it is for sending the military to close the southern border long overdue as I said yesterday the solution is simple there in Mexico\nThey're they're moving through Guatemala into Mexico we have a new deal with the Mexican people based on NAFTA\nThere are new friends great friends we heard it's the greatest deal on the planet a beautiful deal a wonderful meal it's a beautiful Neal it's a great deal it's a wonderful deal we've all heard over and over again it's a beautiful beautiful deal a wonderful deal a beautiful deal a wonderful deal a beautiful deal with Mexico well now's the time to ask a Mexican friends to\nKeep them in the holding places that they're in they have 'em down they look at the pictures so they're down there and um don't let him into this country's a thousand percent right to put troops on the border excuse me what are our troops for\nOur thing they have to defend the protect America water troops for what the living for the pension asserted that muscle over white they can't even pick up a gun\nThey belong on disability so put the ones that are able to carry a gun on the border and say you're not coming in and that's the end of it let Mexico take care of them and send it back where they came from after the given the care that they need what is wrong with you people how many people can we take into this country cowards on the run I saw this this morning I got so angry I was live at the\nMoment it I looked at her turns on cowardly hunters after they gunned down a bull elephants\nIf you'll listen to that the sounded those elephants after one of their bull elephants are shocked by these too fat pieces of garbage so there's a herd of beautiful noble creatures a family of elephants a herd of elephants which are more nobility the most human beings\nAnd these two fat disgusting so called hunters both saying for the same below ... makes a shooting between the eyes this was in Namibia\nSo these two fat gunman aim at the beach from a distance as one says the other hand it between the eyes or both of the fat ugly hunters hit one of the bowls\nAnd stumbles and then the two men too fat white man in shorts turn and run screaming as the the herd turns on them you'll hear you trumpet interrupting from one of the elephants as the hunters become the hub [noise]\nNow I got to tell you something I Believe in self defense not hunting the defense was right that one down [noise] I Believe in self defense not hunting defenseless [noise]\nWow

process actually at points attractive for their overall score\nWalk for being for being too smart correct or so that was there so it's a reverse IQ in other words ... using a reverse IQ to admit people the dumber you are the better off you are\nWhat you have to understand is that true purpose of affirmative action and these quotas the the true purpose is to make sure that a white liberal maintain that at least the ... but a ideally a majority on campus because if they don't have the numbers\nThat we will reached a tipping point where white people no longer want to go to schools like Harvard\nYou reached a tipping point where white people no longer want to go to schools like Harvard and the wound up like Cal Tech in Berkeley were basically they're dominated by age not because Asians um\nHave necessarily a the ... of everything but white liberals no longer want to go there because they don't feel like they're the majority and\nSo what are you actually saying there is there are there isn't discrimination against Asians\nThere is discrimination against their agents where is that what I'm trying to say that Asians actually have the highest benchmark the highest standard of all the races followed by white there the standard basically the benchmark and blacks Hispanics Native Americans access points added during the process of admissions to their formula\nRight well that's what came out during the ... the trial now in in Cambridge the Asian Americans sued Harvard and found out that they are being top loaded against them their scores have to be higher to even be considered\nHigher and higher than any of the race that's the that's the main point and the purpose behind that again is not for diversity\nBut to make sure that white liberal do not fall into the minority because then they would reached that tipping point right just like we have white flight in the cities and yes white flight here in northern California white people no long no longer want to live in neighborhoods that are what predominately Asian\nSame with the colleges to Harvard and gals\nAnyway you're white people don't want to live in Asia neighborhoods does that affect\nEver have you ever seen neighborhoods in Fremont Cupertino San Francisco where all the white people do when I go to the public school\nWell how wait wait a minute how come Nancy Pelosi has fled yet\nBecause first of all she's a grandmother and second of all her kids if they go to school for grandkids I should say we'll go to private white high school\nOr in other words it doesn't apply to heart\nCorrect\nSo what what do you think needs to be done to make things fair for everyone\nWill obviously the missions formula has to be a done apply equally for all races you can't have a penalty for being Asian and a ... a points just for being black or Hispanic Native American the way it has done today and we have to let\nThe urine admissions consulting so let's look at Harvard for example or yellow printed in the same thing applies to all of these schools have subjects that are extremely difficult that you can't fake\nWhether it be astrophysics organic chemistry or things like that are you telling me that the kids who admitted with these are rigged scores are able to compete in those classes\nHit the nail on the head they don't major in physics or electrical engineering\nOh so what the kids who are admitted under these weeks is what are they major in\nThe major anything with the words study that there was African\nMen [laughter] ... that's funny you let me get the studies the examples of what they major and\nI ... even environmental science which is a bogus site\nYes of course that's environmental studies which means whatever you want to make it into this not a science social studies going through a metal and there is if you want to if you want to go look at bums in the street that social studies\nDon't go into a math department at Harvard or the electrons in parliament at MIT and what do you see it's all Asia the white people don't want to go there anymore\n... wait a minute it's all Asians because whites can't get in because they're not smart enough or they don't even apply\nApply their intimidate they get one or the ... what what are they intimidated by\nYou know exactly what I'm Talking about their intimidated by seeing so many hardworking Asians and they sit there and they think oh my God I'm not going to be able to fly through college I'm going to go and major in something easier and usually the cop\nOut you're actually saying the white kids are afraid to go to Harvard now\nOr the yes they are for certain majors I of course they're never going to have any trouble majoring in history right as long as they follow the party line\nWhat I don't know where you're coming from actually you're starting to be willing to me now I don't quite know what you're saying on one hand you're saying that the admissions are rigged against whites and Asians and then you're saying that whites are cowardly and don't even want to apply\nWhat I'm saying like it was that there are academic get ... academic ghettos for Asians or guess what the STEM fields the fields where they dominated by the the lesser students go away towards away from them because\nThose are you you're not in ... you're not implying that there are white students can't make it an electrical engineering or are you\nNot at all not at all I'm I'm implying that there are many fewer or because they are many of them are intimidated by the\nSo where where there's a white kid will stray apply if he wants to go into electrical electrical engineering we already apply\nRecord applied MIT they can apply to Cal Tech or even Berkeley right but\nWell and they and they don't have the same skewed admissions policies\nWell they can get in based on a formula but they're not to ... for their rights\nOh you mean ... actually the one of the worst examples\nOf course they are they they set the standard for everyone right they they plan\nTo to say they set the standard for racism now Harvard that's the new ... new distinction\nCorrect they they uh they penalize Asians and everyone else followed them because again they didn't want to reach a tipping point where the student body because majority age when that happens that all the white liberals are going to leave and where do they go from there\nI I have a PHD from UC Berkeley and I remember what was going on with so many Asians because they're good students they study are they come from families that pushed them very hard the whole tiger mother thing their background has won a scholarship and learning or else you're a loser it's that simple so I admire them and I would see the number of agents growing growing growing you don't want to say that people\nI don't care if it's a hundred percent Asian it wouldn't matter to me if they all got an based on brains it wouldn't matter to me at all\nAnd so said Reagan back when he was governor of California but basically go to Berkeley saying what you see you see hardly any white students\nCorrect I haven't been there and twenty I won't even go over the bridge okay [laughter] okay well [laughter]\nYeah I Know I ... I basically never go to the East Bay I have nothing joined me there it's kind of sad I used to love Berkley I won't go there it's heartbreaking to go there the last time I went there and looked like a male stream of insanity all they do is ride on the campus I mean there was no reason for me to go there\nSo you're saying that the the world has shifted so dramatically but isn't this um lawsuit going to straighten things out a little bit\nWell it depends you and I both know that it's probably gonna why the court system for many years and of course Harvard and all your uh\nDidn't leave a paper trail and they were they were given carte blanche to do this by the hockey decision back in Nineteen Seventy eight where you could use race as a factor long have explicit quota so they didn't they didn't write the quota down they just put it in their heads and say okay every time we get an Asian students attract points\nEvery time we have a black Hispanic Native American\nIn your opinion has society\nBenefitted benefitted from affirmative action\nNot at all because when you look at for example at the top two universities the the under represented minorities have a much lower graduation rate than the whites and Asians and they don't tend\nTo what about the lawsuits against the university I as anyone calculated what percentage come from which race\nYes of course it's been calculated for example the acceptance rates by race so the acceptance race race a race by race a white people with the exact same standard as an Asian have tripled acceptance rate event an Asian student\n... one example and a a Spanish student conversely has tripled the acceptance rate of all white\nA Spanish student conversely has tripled acceptance rate of the white students with the exact same statistic [noise]\nIt's a terrible situation when you're a young person who's working hard to be knocked out because of the way you you'll look reading your race it's horrible and I and it's the opposite of what our U.S Constitution and bill of rights permits more specifically it violates proposition two oh nine\nWhich state law but of course in a lawless state propositions don't mean anything unless they advance the Marxist agenda\nCalifornia this to to get around it as they hired more black Hispanic initials officers readers for during the ...\nAnd those missions officers were\nObviously more than it was like ...\nOr you yourself or Asian or Caucasian or what\nI Am an agent who attended uh Berkeley and Ivy League schools as well wow\nSo you know what hard work is weren't you driven by your parents to succeed\nYes I was so we're all of my family as well\nAs I was I I mean ... either we made or do you consider the outcast in in my world\nI mean real honest to God we were pushed that's how that's how it makes you can't tell them that if he can't study you as a ... what is it called now learning anxiety that's now with the sort of can you believe this tat tat white test anxiety is a new disorder\nRegime but thank you for doing this work it's amazing it's a it's astounding to me what kind of people we get calling the show from across this country\nSuffer the pain of discipline or suffer the pain of regret put that over your gym mushy your exercise machines just hand write it on a boat on a piece of cardboard suffer the pain of discipline to suffer the pain of regret and it goes for everything you're doing in your life I'll be right back\nI'm Seventy KB WN Trump Seventy gay DJ I\nListening to talk giant nine Seventy TV show Seventy Katie Jay ... service that you're\nTrying to stop ...

adds to the season which these events would occur and in this hour they're all being full field you know if you look at the fundamentals the reason we wrote the book the new tactics of global war was to explain in real world terms\nHow close we are to World War and it's a complex analysis it it took an entire book to unveil\nThe bottom line is our enemies perceive a window of opportunity in a window of American vulnerability if we were to elect a conservative president in America where to change course\nThen America would be better protected five or ten years from now so for many many reasons the world is that a financial crossroads where to point of maximum economic risk the\nPolitical the colors on the map are already beginning to rod and the nations of the world they're all

back George Tiller what those joined shall we were talking about the story where you were walking into lakes sinking in down you were going and an angel underwater is there to help you what happened\nRight absolutely and she said you know you could come without if you'd like but it would be better if you stayed here because we have a lot of work for you to do\nAnd I said I'm really not interested and at that moment I don't think I had much choice because my cousin George realized my sister and I are in trouble came and told us both out and kind of a ceremony faith or with on the beach and that was back in my body\nBut [noise] ah I wanted to tell you that it was a glorious experience and I've had many that was really one of the first and uh I learned a lot from that I learned not to let my sister teach me how to swim for one thing it probably in the mail message from that\nExactly it's a scary thing I got to tell you the same thing happened to me when I was a kid except I didn't have an edge elect experience I was with my father's brother my uncle he was the twins and we're walking in a lake\nAnd ah I'm side by side next to my uncle and uh I hit a hole in this lake\nIn just like you down I went I must have been about eight years old Joyce\nAnd I'm gone I and I thought this is it I'm dead [laughter] and now we're back something upon me back up my pop right back up and then my uncle didn't even know I went under just kept walking but it was the weirdest feeling but I thought that was it for me it was a strange feeling\nGood I wanted to tell you I don't know if you ever went to my website but I was home lots of times Oh thank you I was at the world Trade Center when nine eleven occurred because my husband and I had an apartment very close to ... like a thousand feet from some of the world Trade Center\nAnd we moved there about a month before buildings came down gosh yeah I mean is there a month and on the day we moved and Jack and I looked up and the world Trade Center with towering over our little building\nOur liberty court and ah I said you know we said to each other boy this thing comes down we're finished well exactly a month later that come down as you know and we were\nWe had to leave the building because it was unsafe to be there so many people in that area had to leave\nBut we came back a few days later when it was safe and I had the most phenomenal experience and that's where my website where I'm\nGoing to happen I I I actually had gone to sleep and that was awakened until it to go on to the living room and to help people to cross over because they were coming through had created quite all in my building and in my apartment\nAnd people who were had just died were coming through and being released out into the onto the harbor by the statue of liberty that was Battery Park\nSo that was one of the many incredible experiences I've had and thousands of people keep saying they just kept coming coming I guess you know\nAre you still out in that area Joyce\nWe saw that apartment when my husband passed away and then now I'm In Florida\nBut uh just like so many incredible things that people were just try to remember some of the things that happen to them I think most people say well if it was just something that just happened but write them down recording your dreams as I'm sure your your next guest is going to tell us\nBut write everything down and try to analyze what you're experiencing the best way to develop yes pay is to try to remember and to try to record with you're experiencing and really happen that way or open up more of that that consciousness you'll be able to help other people as well\nSo that that's my primary recommendation record your dream to record your experiences\nI had a I don't know if I should if you're ready for me to tell you another one of a one my phenomenal experiences about a\nLot of money yeah sure absolutely\nTruck thank you I had never heard of a thing but I had an out about maybe four years ago I had this out of body experience where I did ask to travel which I had really no memory of doing ever before I think we all travel and we just forget or don't we don't know about it\nBut this was unusual because I went to a a Tibetan Rami Khouri\nAt to see the llama whose name was ... and you know in Tibet George on the day the babies born that's the first name he was born on Tuesday says named Tuesday lob sang rampant and if you go to his website it's a lot saying ramp a dot org\nBut he came to get me and I went on this phenomenal trip\nTo mystery and he had a the ability to answer many crushes that this man had many walking experiences supposedly he was over\nThis man had many walking experiences supposedly he was over many hundreds of years of age he had taken different bodies on the last one more out he took a new body on and he was living as an Englishman and then finally kind of nation on earth and Nineteen eighties\nSo I was at Islam is Terry and it was phenomenal and I came back to my body brought me back and I was waking up\nHe said to me don't forget my name and I had never heard I couldn't remember it but my husband was there and I said jak before I wake up please write it down and\nI spelled it out ... and I misspelled it slightly different age on it birth didn't belong and then he was a lot of things gone but I went to his website and I was blown away because he has written\nMaybe a couple of hundred books that are free anyone go to his people listen\nYeah extremely cell and just really an amazing amazing man and not only was he a doctor but he was also it just so many different incarnations it makes you realize that we don't really have to die I said your main also was walking and George do you believe that that's possible you could take on\nA further uh incarnation\nI think Joyce many things are possible mhm\nReally do I mean I'm I'm Still wrestling with the\nLiving in dying process and exactly what it is we cross over um ... it's it's kind of strange for me I mean we've got a picture up the coast to coast damn dot com bubble goes on the Titanic a strange picture and you've got some spirit to talk

we're living in a dangerous time\nLet's say in terms of sue this you're I'm agreeing with you ... what really got exposed to me that scares me a lot and there's two things one is we ever do justice system we don't have equal justice\nOr equal application of our laws needs to be looking at Hillary Clinton she ... the biggest obstruction of justice slam dunk case ever but the problem here is we had one party literally before the American people you mentioned Kavanaugh abandon\nAll principle constitutional law and the and and literally core values that have served do so well which are due process the presumption of innocence the Republican for the first time in their life that something right they handled it with the seriousness of the topic deserves\nThey were thorough they did it right and at the end of the day there was no corroboration to the allegations being made\nNow we see people like what Eric Holder kick them we can't be civil Hillary Clinton getting their face Cory

that's what she said no where\nWe want to use its amusing that you ran down the list and uh we we could at ten more and then Trump goes to Montana and makes a joke a joke about the Republican candidate for Senate they're um slam dunk ... reporter [laughter] you know\nAnd it was obviously said ingest and the press goes while crazy yet all the things that you pointed out are somehow over look\nNot overlooked it they they\nWell they do not fares will because now they're in concert there the the American media is in concert with the Democratic party and that's I don't think that's ever happened before in this republic\nWhere the the eighty percent of the media now is promoting a political party so it's going to be fascinating to see the backlash in the election coming up in November I Do believe there will be one I don't know the extent of it\nI don't think anybody does anything anyone that says they know a dozen no I don't think a lot of people saw what happened on twenty sixteen I said it's absolutely possible that Donald Trump is going to win then the then the the five\nDays a on a factor five days before he was going to win because people didn't like Hillary Clinton and they're they're either going to stay home or vote against her and that's exactly what happened but I Want to I just want to reinforce just because I Know you can't say it on your TV and radio show but when\nYou go you saying then they're going to attribute it to me and then I got an ally had a lot so rightly say the stuff he won't good\nThat you have no idea what I'm going to talk about because

Wisconsin Josh your next step on the mark within show I'm Larry O'Connor\nAerial\nI'm good I I'm concerned though because if the Democrats do get the majority in the house this is going to be a rough two years\nAnd I have an idea I'm Talking to your street car and I said that a good idea that they should do is they could show Detroit when it's ran by businessmen like Donald Trump's and Henry Ford and the strength that Detroit once had\nAnd then what Democrat liberal take over and how it just falls into corruption in squalor and just show them side by side and then even better for my own state I think they don't know\nIf you let politician and take over you get your choice if you what Republicans take over and have ideas you get Foxconn and he's due to for jobs that were getting shocked I yeah I Wish they upheld that more and more more and they don't\nYeah and and you know Josh I'm Glad you brought this up because I I Love Wisconsin and I think that a year Governor Scott Walker has done some great jobs in his incredible turn around what he's been able to achieve in that state and of course they all said that people would be fired and people would be starving in the streets and no one would get an education and it's been\nPhenomenal yeah we saw Scott than ever and Madison there were all yes and that took on our capital and we fought right short and look at what we've been able to accomplish that choice is second half of the term of Donald Trump if it if we fight the good fight and vote on November ...\nThank you Josh thank you for the call appreciate it thanks for calling into the Merck within show ya I vividly remember those mobs taking over the capital occupying the capital of Madison during the early years of the Scott Walker or the governorship but that was back when I was working with Andrew Breitbart and Andrew Andrew got on a plane\nThe next day he sent us all a text message I'm going to Madison\nIn the winter in Southern California guy\nAndrew why are you going to Madison look at what's going on there look at the mobs look at the riots look at the ... look at Scott Walker needs us Republicans need us\nConservatives who are trying to bring sane rational governance to the state of Wisconsin need us and he sure did go there by the way right next door to you there are Josh over in Michigan\nThis is a remarkable thing\nYou know everywhere you go right now on cable news broadcast news all over the Internet who do you hear about running for Senate this young upstart appealing good looking guy who's who's a defining the odds and has a real chance to win all you're hearing about is this guy beta ...\nThey don't work doesn't have a chance to win in Texas\nBetter better work is not going to win the Senate seat in Texas\nAnd it's all made for TV we've seen this game before every\nTwo years every election they tell us about the new rising star in Texas has finally going to take paint Texas blue you know when Hillary Clinton was a deciding not to do any sort of polling or appearances in Wisconsin Pennsylvania well not Pennsylvania shipped to the parents in Wisconsin or Michigan\nOr that she was actually at that time\nContemplating spending more money in Texas because she was so sure she was going to win Texas and Georgia and Arizona and she ... she wanted to to this was going to be a transformative election with Hillary Clinton and the remaking of the map\nWe hear this all the time but it's not true\nAnd meanwhile in Michigan there's this guy John James last poll there showed him in single digits now this guy a running against Debbie Stabenow I mean he is he's a former military uh did combat in Iraq\nUh this guy is African American this guy is conservative this guy is right on all the issues are they here I Want to play a little bit of of him because because this tells you exactly how the media so corrupt\nBecause all they care about with federal Rourke it has to do with two things it has to do with forcing this fake narrative\nThat the Democrats are really not that Texas has moving blue Texas is going to be a Democrat state Texas is not the same Texas because the Democratic demographic changes because uh because of all of the radical conservative policies that have hurt that state which I haven't I mean\nPeople are flocking to Texas people are flocking to Texas because of the economy there is one of the only state to persevere through the eight dismal years of rock Obama because they had Republicans in charge of that state there's no way that people have Texas would reverse that trend but also because they hate Ted Cruz\nThe media hates Ted Cruz because he's so good so smart and so conservative so they're they're they're puffing this beta will work guy out and

the they all have by the way everyone in this uh this migration this this it it ... invasion this reprehensible intern\nInvasion this reprehensible international crisis they make no mistake is absolutely organized these things don't spontaneously happen it's impossible\nAnd if you if you go to your favorite search engine and type in Honduran caravan organizers they'll give you the list of several names couple of them just got arrested in Guatemala the Guatemalan government arrested them and send them back to Honduras\nBut there's still people organizing this of course that have you noticed that that all the people in this they all have brand new backpacks\nWeird isn't it I think\nThey all brand new backpacks full of all their personal belongings and they're all waving the flag of their nation El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras and they're demanding entry into Mexico and they are saying to whatever reporter will talk to them we are going to the United states of America and you can't stop us\n\nAnd if you listen to most of our elected officials guess what their rights we can't stop them\nWhat are we gonna do\nYou know the Democrats and sadly many Republicans on Capitol Hill\nDon't hesitate to criticize President Trump for his policy of securing our border enforcing immigration laws as they are written prosecuting criminals who break our immigration laws deporting criminals in this country for violating our immigration laws\nIt's a very clear cut policy by the way one that believe it or not used to be embraced by Democrats too\nAnd Republicans\nUntil they figured out that they could get votes and or campaign donations respectively\nFor being an international list for being all about open borders for being compassionate\nUh you know what's compassionate\nCompassionate does not enabling people to continue\nTo follow the same broken destructive patterns that they have year after year after decade after decade you know what's compassionate wanting the Honduran people to be empowered to alter and change\nThe Honduran government or the Mexican government you're terrified for your life in Honduras I get it guess what we were terrified for our lives hundreds of years ago here in America we made a change\nWith\nThe ... remember when we all love the Arab Spring where we had people rise up against their governments\nAcross the middle east because they were set up and they were done I is it time maybe for a Central Americans spring why is the default obligation for America and for the mainstream media to be all things are awful in these countries come when we got your back\nWhy is that suddenly the definition of compassion why is that suddenly the definition of being a real American oh if you don't open up your borders and allow anyone into this country you're anti American you're not really upholding American ideals are values are you kidding me since when\nAnd how many by the way this is a caravan of four thousand if we let them in the think that'll stop it hasn't for the last five years it hasn't they keep coming\nWhy because we left that man\nAnd said earlier today I actually got to speak with a Democrat Senator Ben carton\nAh he is a senator in Maryland here in the greater Washington area is running for reelection and I asked him that I said what what should we do to stop these people from coming into the country led listen 'cause this is very this is very indicative of of how they think and how they talk what should we do to stop that should we stop that\nFought for one of the reasons we've had a program to try to improve the living conditions in Central America\nOh it's been supportive bipartisan but Democrats or Republicans it's who the President Trump's budget or we want to improve the living conditions for those of our neighbors who live in Central America\nHit and he goes on on this and and think about what she's saying here and this is this is considered to be the the the ah highest level of statesmanship in Washington DC\nWe've got thousands and thousands of people who make no Bones Are secret about the fact that they are a demanding entry into our country because they hate the country they're living in\nAnd the politically correct acceptable wise old man on Capitol Hill response is well how many billions can we get to that government down there to improve conditions\nAnd by the way we've sent billions and billions and billions and billions already and somehow it hasn't solved the problem\nAnd and\nThink about what the basis of this argument is to stop people from invading our borders we must throw billions of dollars to their countries it's extortion\n\n... we're bribing them we're bribing the government's down there to get control of their own citizenship and then you get the Mexican government leadership and for that matter hunger and that all of these countries in Central America where their citizenship is leaving in droves to go to another country\nAnd they're angry at us for saying no they can't come in the thick about that for a minute you're an elected official you've been elected by your population in El Salvador in in Guatemala in Mexico you've been elected to represent them\nYou've been elected to run the affairs of the country\nAnd the people who are elected you are fleeing your country to go elsewhere\nAnd your response is not gee maybe we're doing something wrong maybe we need to fix our country you know your response is how dare you America not allow my citizens to fully my an apt to corrupt government to come into your country\nThese countries spend more time focusing on our policies then fixing their own and then you got a Democrat like Ben Carson who ... who enables that by throwing more money at it\n\nSo I came back we went back and forth on this earlier today and if you want you can get the whole interview over at my radio station W male dot com but I I came back around I said All right listen I Know you want to throw a bunch of money at this government and you want to do all of these things on the ground to keep them from going but that's not going to stop these four thousand okay there on the way\nAnd frankly whatever money you send down there you've already sent plenty and that hasn't fix the problem I don't know how much more money you got to spend\nBut let's focus on what's happening right now 'cause you have a lot of criticism for President Trump for saying he's gonna send military down there for saying he's going to cut funding if these countries don't stop their own citizens from playing yeah you have all this criticism of him for actually trying to protect our borders so what would you do your senator for crying out loud\nWhat's the solution how do you stop these people from coming into our country when they reach our border what are we supposed to do\nAll of a gray with you on that\nOrder what are we supposed to do\n[noise] well I don't know if I'll agree with you on on that statement I I I've been embedded with the FBI down in Central America I Know how dangerous the numbers are\nBy the way I real fast let me just the the the ... I had just said that there's a criminal element that there are dangerous gang members who are coming along with these than we know that to be true he's telling me that it's not true\nYeah I find you you you you reach your own conclusion I report you decide do you think maybe there was a violent criminal element over the last several years that came along and cross the border\nWith these unaccompanied minors don't or they were all seven year old children really they all had tattoos ... we quibble\nA I have interviewed a gang member who actually came to the United states is set up sister gangs including in Maryland so I I I understand the danger factor as it relates these gang activities\nI think most of the families that show up in our border or people who see themselves as desperate they're trying to escape Central America in some cases the legitimate fear of their lives should be able to seek asylum\nRight okay so fine so so let's say they're coming to this country to seek asylum what do we do\nWell if they have a legitimate claim for asylum claim should be heard no one should be admitted to our country without proper bidding\nOkay bit that hold on I'm Sorry to stop you but wanting a better economic situation and being afraid of a criminal element in your home country are not legitimate claim\nTo agree with you I'm not I don't agree with you one\nAnd then I'm going to pause it for a minute 'cause that's terribly important because the Democrats and open border Republicans are doing this all the time\nThey say well you know these people are just seeking asylum in our country they're looking for a better life and we need to be compassionate and we need to follow international protocols for asylum seeking a better economic life is not a legitimate claim asylum\n... living in a crime infested country is not a legitimate claim for asylum otherwise my friends in Chicago will be claiming asylum in Toronto right now", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Show Low", "day": "19"}
