Turkey where your mouth shut Coby the Saudi journalist ah was missing\nNow we have two reports from from the British newspaper one from the the New York post talking about audio revealing that Jim all cause show he was tortured and decapitated I you know I\nI shutter to get to go down this road I suspect ... all of this is true\nBecause we know he went in Istanbul, Turkey to the Saudi console he went in and he never came out that we know\nSo uh do I suspect based on his criticisms of the kingdom Saudi Arabia um you know that you're not dealing with the best of actors on either side of this\nYou know just this week we had an American pastor released after being held two years in one of their prisons why because he's a Christian\nSo I'm not exactly that confident in Turkey\nOr ever won the you know lunatic that he is now emerged into\nAnd norm I confident you know I'm the one that's most critical of Saudi Arabia than anyone else in the media and their mistreatment of women their persecution and murder of gays and lesbians their persecution of Christians and Jews\nYou know it's I I I Know they gave to the Clinton Foundation and seemed to get much criticism from any Democrat or

are certain elements of our relationship that has to be immune\nFrom the vagaries of our bilateral relationship just over the weekend former director of CIA John Brennan with whom you know I've had my differences are\n... that we should consider halting routine intelligence collaboration that would do nothing but put our our citizens and our homeland at risk so we need to not do that or and and what we consider policy measures I think the president is going to need to own that the the appropriate time there's a bipartisan consensus\n'em to go pretty far and and consider freezing military sales and sanctions I think the president is going to have to reach out to the Congress and manage that to ensure as as Sebastian Gorka has said\nThat our interests um are are taken care of them in

government officials but security clearances or providing um that that information to our enemies very very serious issue Sean\nWhat do you think Dr Gorka last word\n[noise] uh we need to find that in America if lady justice though with a blindfold or your last name is Clinton you got to a committee of it's really about it\nReally is the double standard just reeks die having 'em anyway congrats by the way of uh his brand new book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies uh I'd say that's something we really need to remember as a country\nUm thank you both for being with us I when we come back to ... Anthony Scaramucci we'll check in with us James O'Keefe his latest undercover video also is it possible Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren loses the Massachusetts Senate race as she really wants to run for president\nHe refused things an anarchist could do whatever they want\nSo the politician did what every red blooded American would do she tried to catch the incident on video and then the assailant was having none of that cursing at are backing or into the street and tell her to go kill yourself then walk to a nearby BP presumably to stop stock up on\nYou know whatever she does a mountain dew whatever it happens to be\nThe go to source or whatever but Anderson gave chase in her car the man charged her again leaning through the window punching her\nYou know I I mean it's unbelievable\nAnd that's fine incident came two days after another House Republican candidate Shane\nNeck one was punched in the face\nIn St George township northeast of St Cloud is just campaigning in a bar in a restaurant with a larger guy approaches them described the conversation is Amy a bowl until the guy literally and invoke the hallowed name of the middle class the man we can only assume didn't wish to hear another politician talking about whatever\nThe punches the Republican in the face\nOh getting their faces oh or create a crowd you know follow them\nInto a grocery stores gas stations department stores restaurants they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnthony Scaramucci is with us by the way next week he's got a great book I've been reading it I got an early copy it's phenomenal and it's called the Trump the blue collar president\nUh I notice that it's too early to talk about the book but you'd tell some amazing stories about who really Donald Trump is where he came from and and his background and you know a whole story that the media is never told about him and I learned a lot of reading and how are you my front\nUm you know Sean I'm doing great but you know you're you're you're mentioning a lot of very interesting things and one thing I always remember that the president\nHe may hit hardest Sean a buddy always hits second any often hits last I've never seen him unilaterally calm after anybody it's only after the attack him\nThat he doubles down and starts to counter punch you know so Elizabeth Warren attacking him he's ignoring her and then bam Pocahontas or a Republican candidate in the primary Jackie and then he fires off the nickname you're sort of the point being is that like he is actually a very civil guy\nUntil you start shooting at him then once you start shooting at him he's gonna hit you were ... or ...\nOr ... are very important distinction between what's going on between the Democrats\nAnd let me tell you you know I mean it's so funny because I remember a conversation once I had with the president and and you were at the White House for a pretty short period of time and\nHe he talked about you which is very interesting to me and he talked about well this Harvard Anthony and then there's the kids in the street and he and a and I know both I mean\nYou know he yelled at me he yelled at me after the cursing gotta remember like the the guy Ryan Lizz have legs of total liar cheat basically faded me into the call but then he's asking me to do a profile with them and then that's when I have responded with the expert but you know what\nIt is what it is ... ... what the the president yelled at me he said hey man I Need less street Anthony I Need more Harvard Anthony but you know what John what makes you great on the radio and and uh and the reason why we're so close is that we both have a little bit of that and I don't like when you were busing\n... when I was washing dishes bussing tables I was a cook yeah that's right but you know something a little bit and I wouldn't trade that experience in life for anything or the years I spent in construction which was two decades of my life\nAnd I don't know I mean I I think a lot of us in that are blessed and lucky and successful I met too many people that forget what they come from and I'm not going to forget where I came from and I'm just on and so it's not in me\nWell that's the point though that's the point in the books on I really do try to explain\nThat your story or my story is a classical American story a law where we were in these aspirational working class families and our parents wanted us to do better and they were fully bought into as where our grandparents\nInto the American dream and so uh what the president is trying to do what you try to do every day what I tried to do in my small way you see if we can make that happen\nFor people that were similarly situated or currently ... similarly situated the way we were\nIn the Nineteen sixties and seventies growing up and so that's one of the reasons why despite getting far from the White House I never broke ranks are never broke my loyalty from the president because I really do believe his horse in the right place and I really believe\nThat uh you know he is the right what was I\nWas in line the proof is in the ... I mean when when you go ... eight years adding Thirteen million more Americans to food stamps eight million more poverty you can't get three they only president never to get three percent GDP Growth\nThe worst recovery since the forties and all of a sudden we got four point two percent for the second quarter GDP Growth projections are way over four percent for the third quarter you know now we have four million more Americans working eight million out of off of food stamps and out of poverty\nI'm thinking okay finally the forgotten men and women the young Scaramucci's Hannity's are now doing better why ... why would we want to stop that\nI you know not not and I agree and it's going to get better\nThat would really want to stop that I you know not not and I agree and it's going to get better because he's continuing\nTo eat layer the process of regulation\nOr he's continuing to find ways to incentivize corporations large and small to move their money back\nOn shore of the United states I Know you talk a lot of that uh the re engineered now after the U.S MCA now uh Shaun I'm going through that you know I'm trained as an economist and I'm running an eleven and a half billion dollars on that I found it a that is going to have\nMonumental positive benefits to middle and lower middle class families the re engineering of that trade agreement because just the configuration of the cars\nJust the uh the manufacturing point and the price on ... oh that's been agreed to in those agreements is going to mean more disposable income working class family\nAnd by the way you know where was the establishment politicians thinking about those people over the twenty five years of NAFTA shock well where where they know where I could\nBreak right pack will continue more with Anthony Scaramucci on the other side and your calls eight hundred nine point one Sean hey I've got the best home security system to protect your home your family\nThe best the greatest in the industry and it's simply say home security and I know look you got to know the craftsmanship matters the most you can't get out on corners of cut corners I Know that as a contractor\nWhen it comes to protecting your family only one company I trust simply say home security\nThey make really small sensors that don't destroy the look of your home there's no insulation the it's a simple set up without frustration you can even take the system from home to home even if you're renting it take it with you when you move and the great thing about simply say home security\nWorks even if there's a power outage or downed wires why this is the type of incredible craftsmanship they have unlike any other home security system you never signed a contract you never pay for installation these you don't have to pay huge monthly bills like fifty bucks a month no fourteen Ninety nine a month\nJust go to simply say Hannity dot com you'll say ten percent on your system to protect your home and family today that simply said Hannity dot com simply say Hannity\nDot com [noise]\nFind our round up as an action you not want to miss it adds to the final our free for all the Sean Hannity show\nHave [noise]\nAll right all friends of dollar shave club they deliver every single thing you need to look steel and smell your best and they keep you fully stocked on the products that you use so you never run out now determine what you want and when you want it and but once a month for every six months it'll show up right at your door\nPlus they have their hands to discount the more you by the more you say and get one of their starter kits were just by bugs no obligation at all\nAfter that you only pay for what you buy you never pay to be a member of the dollar shave club called a dollar shave club dot com slash Hannity dollar shave club dot com slash Hannity I'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's\nPremier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates stays locked\nBuddy of rates go down your rate drops either way you win\nCall us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com racial the crew only about a hundred and thirty or pick great mountains called across the nation and conditions equal housing winter licensing office he takes animal is number three thirty initial conditions exclusion may play [noise]\nYou're both here ... savings [noise]\nTwenty to Toyota models have got to go with ... snow is the absolute best time to do with the biggest surgery ...
