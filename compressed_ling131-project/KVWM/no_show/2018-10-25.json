solutions to empower their lives and here she is on coast to coast corridor welcome to the show\nWell how do you like to thank you so much for having me on I Am so grateful and honored to have the opportunity to share my information\nAnd you were considered to be a good which aren't you\n[laughter] well I I Hope so [laughter]\nAs opposed to ban which I guess but no you're you're you're an upbeat person you're you're friendly you care about people who know how did this all started for you how did you get involved in witchcraft well\nYou know I started working with a ... and and she's also happens to be of I I consider to be a very powerful which and and he took it need to magic and instead of doing the work for me because you know she I feel like her healing um\nBut I I feel like whatever she does with just so amazing but instead of doing the work for me she empowered me and taught me how to do it myself\nSo I just you know I picked it up really quickly and I I mean the rest of history I feel very very confident with with what I Do you know it\nI feel very very confident with with what I Do you know with the spell that I've been executing so that's how I got started it was it was more\nAbout healing and then that's when she just introduced me to it and now I feel like well I probably don't need a healer because I'm I'm using magic as a form of killing\nHave you ever ... never\nAnd I want to make that very clear that I Will never ever ever cast a spell to hurt anyone um to try to bring love my way to try to win the lottery [laughter] it's not what I don't\nKnow ... what what what good are shows that if you can't win in either\n[laughter] you know I think that the power of our minds because I have discovered one thing I have discovered with magic is\nThat in my mind is more powerful than I realized so I think that when we start healing on so many different levels\nThat we will be able to tap into unlimited amounts of financial abundance and spiritual abundance so I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will conjure up on money spell and work that\nBut right now I've just been focused on doing the um healing and an crossing and reversal\nWhen you talk about magic what do you what are we talking about we're not talking about David Copperfield we're talking about something else or\nAbsolutely and magic can be used by anyone I think people\nYou know use magic every single day with the power of their minds so when I talk about magic\nI'm simply chanting to spell and when I work my rituals I chat between anywhere between one and two hours I don't just trying to say ... I really that long I really do I mean I think my neighbor's probably think I'm rehearsing\nFor Jimmy intense second chance just want to get an idea what you're doing\nUm [noise] well when I exercise my house is kind of fun because you have to put on like this magical persona so all the uh negative negative beans leave this house like what we can say what is it I Know I Know it I Know I'm just a little nervous George\nWhat are you nervous for talking to millions of people write\nAbout it so excited though I'm Still when I exercise my house because I Do do a house ... every single month to keep out the entities and any you know opportunists that happened to be sure crossing by\nAnd I will say on negative beans leave this house never to return I cast you out I test you out I cast you out so I Will do that while I'm throwing charge salt water and the candle and every single corner of my home and really really works and then I'll ward all the windows\nYou know the the ceiling and the floors and everything else\nSo um that's fun it's really really fun and then when I when I chat spelled like when I Do and crossing rituals which I think everyone should learn how to do and and do it very often\nAnd I know real capable of learning\nAbsolutely I think that we are we have become very lazy\nAnd we are we I mean we have given our power away to not only our friends and family but to the government and it you know we just we don't want to do anything else I feel also that we\nWe feel very entitled we feel like everything should be given to us and so this is one of the reasons why in extremely grateful that my sharman didn't do the work for me\nWhile I got to tell you it is it is indeed magical when it works doesn't it\nIt really is and I have not only felt results but I have seen results that actually creeps me out [laughter]\n[noise] well I got to tell your courage though you ... to demons Savage I have I had um you fight them off what do you do with it\n[laughter] yeah I Do I have a story of my head even Slayer [laughter] well it's it's not as tragic as that but I have had one experience and I I Will share that with you I Would say about Nineteen Twenty years ago and this was my first experience with a real\nLive demon men this wasn't like a portal it was in my house and it came out and you know want it to play it was actually a demon that was summing up by a very evil some federal and he sent it my way\nWhich is a bit I think they do is ... is a religion and um they can either be good or bad I don't know much about this on the radio religion but I Do know that there are some powerful sunset\nOr shut down the you yes ... it's a religion okay\nAnd so they work with magic and they work with the ... shots which are different spirit [noise]\nUm so this ... battle had sent a intentionally of course the sent a demon my way and this was after I had had a reading with them a psychic reading and of course I was so naive and I didn't know I didn't know anything about the cold or anything about metaphysics I was just you know whatever just living my life\nAnd I that same evening that same day in the evening I um [noise] as soon as I turned off my light so I Can't even blame it on a dream as soon as I turned off my light [noise] um I was ... down to my bed [noise]\nAnd I was terrified I didn't even know what it was because I didn't know anything about demons and um\nIt was\nJust like I couldn't move so my first reaction was to pray the Lord's Prayer out loud and it didn't work so I you know after a few words my job locked and I felt

coast am dot com right now we'll get to your calls in just a second with her courses so we're talking about this demonic situation and you said it wasn't going well what was happening\nAt that point I was pinned down on my bed and then all of a sudden it felt like hours of course all of a sudden I fell on my ear going up and down I don't know if there's a pall over a half foot but it was going up and down\nOn my left ear and so it was really really crazy so at that point it was either fight or flight and I obviously couldn't sleep because I was pinned down\nSo this wave of courage just came over me and I just thought you know I ... I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just fall and as soon as I\nI made that adjustment in my mind I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just peeled off of me\nAnd at that moment with my right arm I dress warmed up when I went up and I'm not kidding George I felt a hairy leg that is insane it's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone\nBut it just like it flew away obviously that's freaky it is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't believe me but I did go back to that psychic woman that look like what happened but yeah it's so freaky and I will say it never happen again after that\nTime so I Know that this man some and that human and sent it my way but I did not sleep without the light off for about three months after that it\nTotally terrified me who ... who is susceptible to demonic possession and in situations like that in general well you know\nI'm not going to list the say the obvious ones like people doing drugs or having a cocktail or drunk or shine\nYeah we're we're going to the ... or the cemetery it you know and having a cocktail at midnight [laughter] but I Will say that um there is\nOne reason I think that many either way you ever to laugh you don't have a ... which uh which should have a capital you\nKnow a which is actually a wise woman so [laughter] that's the definition of a witch but yeah I think you [noise] um\nI kinda wanted a ... [laughter]\nI Can't do it even if I tried\nAnd so one of the reasons that I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand\nI'm considering we all lived thousands of lifetimes I'm and I'm Glad I haven't remembered and the other um some of these lifetimes we were not the best of people and um it's very possible but this is my theory that could be wrong but\nI have proof from ... who kind of confirmed um my you know my thoughts about this um it's very possible that some of these people these victims who are experiencing what is known as karma so they can be you know\nHarassed and molested in this lifetime\nWith the demon the danger with in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in his lifetime\nAnd the demon the pet is is usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I'd ever heard of a demon die unless you like well you\nCash them out but the they don't buy\nExactly there's thousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at George it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demon and what's going to happen when we read incarnate and the demon is going to probably her bathroom and molest them now that's\nOne one theory and I can say\nWith confirmation that it it it's probably very true because my sharman has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days\nHas a lot of cases of the people who are being molested harassed and just you know possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a ... journey into their past life\nAnd and mail it and nine times out of ten these people have made packs with demons or they were maybe a big\nPowerful black which and you know I don't know it's different for each of them but for the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does is she just\nIn things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does\nIs she just\nBreaks that agreement that they can finally be free\nAnd um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in this situation and you know these demons or not bothering her neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified sharman who can really just put an end to this\nWhat are these dark for she wants to ... ... what do they want\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity\nDuty we'd also\nAbsolutely and I'm sadly a lot of black magicians\nWill cast spells against people who they feel they can steal like from and they can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and the book into us however they do it and\nWhat this does it will make their incorrect magic more potent so this is why it is extremely important especially right now\nUm to to really really really really clear ourselves on a daily basis and do managing rituals prayers and and ... our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases\nOf the demon intrusions in people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely um manipulate our thoughts\nLet's go to the phones for you know Kathy in Redding, California to get started hike yeah go ahead\nHi George how are

a weed you board the proper way he felt\nAnd it was to burn it and he said as he was burning it he could see little sparks coming off it and screams she heard screams coming out of the board you believe up\nWell okay so I have the stories right and again I'm gonna I'm gonna references again we all have our stories based on our perceptions belief\nOn how we view the world her own fears or own desires and so I mind is a powerful thing it can create many things that we have and truly measure and understand and we don't fully understand awareness or consciousness and how we might even a factor worlds to creating are manifest yet\nI'm going to say that the story but what I Will comment on some board don't burn very well because they might be made out amazing night and the worst thing to do is really burn a board I mean you could sell that on ... said to us\nAt the ... society will take them and we'll refurbishing and selling it given to a loving home they really wants to protect us the history and heritage of these devices\nSharing what's the oldest board you were ever come across\nWell for me and my oldest boy the circuit Eighteen Ninety to Ninety three board so I got a raft they start being made in Nineteen Ninety One in production minds one year after that\nSorry how do you explain this back in St Louis when I'm doing my night talk show must be Nineteen Ninety seven Ninety Ninety eight\nSomebody gets me a weed you board I've got it in my studio and I'm going to do a little bit with them and I've got a producer there\nAnd this we gee board is in the studio with me\nThen I never had any technical issues with in the studio all of a sudden everything is going wrong my commercials I couldn't play 'em because the computer board went though the board that monitors you know my voice levels that was all screwed up the lights were going out I didn't know what was on and what was off\nIt was weird and I finally told my producer Howard at the time I said I Would get this thing on the year he took it out and within two minutes everything pop back up working on the computer the board everything and I want this is weird anyways what I didn't know what the time was Howard\n... widow news guy named Daryl and hot word game Darryl\nLuigi board he should've done Georgia doesn't walk this you try to get him so he took it as a gift I didn't know that\nAnd um you know I Do my show over there and work and I was fine uh about two days later Darryl is no longer employed at the radio station which was kind of strange what he's gone and I won't bore that's weird uh\nAgain not knowing that he had the ... board\nI I run into him about a week and a half later\nIs at a restaurant and I went Darryl ... heard you're not one of those anymore and they weren't George nothing has gone right with me ever since Howard gave me that we gee board I got fired I lost my relationship I Can't get a job\nI I got rid of the thing and hopefully things will get better ...\nWell it's always all too easy to point the finger at something out there then to look at yourself you know maybe the filing down any way on a path of not doing very well working there or maybe he wanted\nWell what about the studio thing with me in the beginning\nWell I you know you want to blame that we've all by something that you want to make a mysterious you don't want to look at something logically first it was ironic that it it's\nVery ironic I but I have to give you that George but I gotta say we we we ... the ... for it because it's so controversial\nAnd it just causes all kinds of meetings and and visceral reactions in people we really got to look at um what's really going on inside herself and what's really going on in the world around us and not just quickly jumped to say to board did it but that happens too often 'cause it's almost easier like end is to blame for that external\nAnd to think that the reason now now hold on us another way to think about the two\nWe create a lot of things we could just have the fought in her mind that ... is scary dangerous bad and then we can draw those things to us just for the power of our minds isn't powerful unconscious mind and then send her on and go I told you the it's like a self fulfilling prophecy\n[noise] I don't know I don't know you know all these years I've known you Karen you haven't been able to convince me yet to use the review board\nI Know it that happen sometime\nI mean could you be wrong could you be wrong\nAnd there's something very wrong about what aspect of it um\nThat it can conjure up evil spirits let's say\nI'll say that you can conquer anything evil in your mind because I think evil exist in the heart of humanity I hate to say that evil people there's evil all over the world look around at people caught evil\nBut what I say it's eagles not a force outside yet we can draw these energies to withdraw other evil people too if we can have equal things happens and they are real bad evil things\nSee me just because you get a piece of wood out or cardboard or there's numbers on a piece of paper or letters that that's going to cause any problems so I I I from my world my life and what I've experienced with this tool\nAnd away from the tool I'm convinced that you cannot now but having said that people have their own beliefs and their own beliefs will still become a self fulfilling prophecy if that they truly truly choose to find\nI mean do you recommend kids play with this as a board game\nI recommend it if a child wants to use it I the best thing to do it and I don't do that because they're going to want to do it and sneak what better thing to do is say hey what is it about the ... why would you want to use it what ... what do you think about it what do you like about it what\nDo you want to know about I Want to go to come through that they want they you know what they want kids like touch them\nOf course some adults do too I mean look ups popular these shows are and colonel investigations and I think the best thing to do is say well if it goes kept what's that going to do for you how's your life going to be and how the conversation I don't know where that conversation is\nGoing to go and it may go where you decide to for example I live in southern Cal you may decide to go take a child that Queen Mary and go on one of their investigation\nSure hold on for a second term will come back\nTalk more and we'll take phone calls next\nDo you have a photo that you would agree to go to ... audience wrong was along with the images ... poodle you just read

I got this right I got her right so I've gotten two or three right that's pretty good sixty seven point seven percent not bad\nParents website is her name was the middle initial shorts Karen a dome and dot com and it's linked up for you don't have to worry about spelling and ... we've got to win for your coast to coast damn dot com\nAs well Karen you had mentioned that the using the board is somewhat like a permission explain that well\nWe have the ability to interact and reach into the unseen dimensions from when we came up where we go again I definitely believe in an afterlife or the for life and in between live\nAnd so I I came into this world as a very young child scenes they're having imaginary playmate having positive experiences with them as well and I knew there was something so much more and for me the wage war became kind of my lifeline to have connections nicotine throughout my whole life [noise]\nUm so it becomes just that permission allow me because my allowance become my a gateway or becomes just the channel I used to do what I actually could do I mean I did this as a child\nThat we put that stuff away as we get older and grow up and were told not to do that and not to talk to beans that aren't there imaginary playmate and go to school and I was told those things\nAnd so I found myself putting away but this is the one tool that worked really well for me to be able to have those communications and to this day I'm I have communications that I used to have the child and I could do it on the board in off the board and I know it's not the board that lets me do this it's\nMy self with my ... my beliefs about the ... my allowance of the buildings to come through and this again just becomes that kind of a door that threshold that left me moving around and interact with them\nHow often do you use the board\nNot as much as I used to I'm doing a lot of work George direct channeling uh with my voice or writing off the board more often than I mean he's the board but I use the board would say about once every two weeks maybe twice a month I might go as much as an only doing it once a month but I I prefer to work with a partner at\nPart as a very busy probably schedule himself so we do get together we will do a session I might laugh anywhere from three to five five enough hours\nHaving said that I Do a lot of ... a sessions for my YouTube channel where I Will do as A People's questions and let them have readings\nUm and I do live shows like that like I didn't want to Halloween evening as well um so I I I really try to interact with people with a tool and when I'm not you that I'm most the time talking about writing about it or answer people's questions about it\nWhen you travel with the ... board does anybody freak out\nWell yes [laughter] yes they do I do it yeah you\nKnow you can always hide them um and I do to help my boards I always have a traveling or with me and if I don't have one forgot one which has happened all you gotta do is get a piece of paper right the letters down put the numbers down yes and no in a way you go with the coin\nWhile the rest of the several hours gonna fly by so let's get some calls in for you Karen Angie in Ohio welcome to the program Hi Angie\nI thank you for taking my call and say we want to write great ...\nBack when I was a teenager I had a boyfriend that he could do out of body experiences and a feeling that really religious and they didn't like the things you practicing they put him at a home for a while while and not me if I had a we ... and I had been ... actually I Do\nHe said well if you talk to me I can leave my body and I can come visit you so one night me and my girlfriend our baby my brother and sister\nAnd after they liked it that we decided to try it and it was really calm quiet night it was warm and the windows open and we had the front door of phone you know it was\nEarly eighties we had really nothing to be afraid of mhm\n[noise] and we're trying to talk to him next thing we know we heard a weird noise and the front door the screen door open and there was one way and open so we jump up and when I Am the doors are locked it\nAnd just started setting all the money to because we were like oh my gosh somebody tried to come in\nWell the next day he called me cause for good behavior he was allowed to make calls so he called me and he says why just shut the door on me so what are you talking about he goes he tried to talk me last night I Can't while you were on me I said that's it I get rid of that we haven't looked\nHumbling things Angie ...\nAndy that I I Love when she shared it what I've learned about the border over the years is that you don't you can talk to people is higher so\nShared it and what I've learned about the border over the years is that you don't you can talk to people's higher sales you can talk to people that are still alive you can talk to animals that are alive or deceased so it's an it's what it is it's really too you're communicating with their consciousness you communicate with that part of themselves that exist\nLike the higher self that exist beyond their corporate ... existence or experience and so you start having these other dimensions of a person so I don't one bit doubt that you can do that as I have done that myself\nAnd that one didn't have a real bad indeed no\nNo no no and I think she spoke yourself because it is kinda weird at first we start doing this and you go how can I talk to that person is still alive isn't\nAboard that he uses the deceased person will no I've learned that this board can become your costs make the phone I I use it as a conflict zone like I Would have wireless phone I dial on the frequency through my intention to my thought through my feelings and then I can tap into connect\nBecause I've trained myself over these years to all these different things that are in and around and for me I use it for personal growth self development and helping people with closure from Greece or just evolutionary expansion\nGene truck driving in St Louis ... gene go ahead\nAging George or you know like Mike all in your yard\nWith all due respect I'd like to disagree with your biggest record you know but what do you say that\nWas only on the board is things that are coming out of you and you know but I really can't buy that good that you're talking about ... people who never met this man we're able to board\nThe board shoulders man these people have no idea who it was really there was more jobs being coming through the board game man before they ever got there and you know were warned not to have\nCommunication would spirit because it is that people will go on and the living will die but there's no not anything I really believe that you're going to find them in your bank with evil spirits and they will ... where did you you can you do that\nGo ahead of journalists to react to that thanks Jean\nYeah thank you Jane I'm so listen when I'm Talking about abilities\nWe all have a six sensibility we have ability to be intuitive and path to gut feelings your heart feeling we'll talk about your guy or you had you had sneaking suspicion something was right or wrong\nThat's the abilities and how that turns out and human life we often have will have dreams of prophecy will have 'em sock them like something just doesn't feel right here or\nGosh I've known the person for years it's those things I'm Talking about when I was born people use the word on this level of using the board you're able to bring out your own six sensibilities so these people using the tools were able to tap into that weather is there any a motor using a subconscious mind which includes\nThese abilities of psychic abilities or medium ship or um even just tapping into just your your knowing this or\nThat connects the spirit now I'll address the second part of that he talked about you were told not to do this often told not to do things that will keep us in control and keep us down and so what I've found is we are told you have to have an intermediary to talk to spirits you have to meet any Mary ... intermediary to talk\nTo God and I find that I have a direct connection to all these beans which has been nothing but loving and beautiful so with all due respect you and I disagree with you but I think we both can have an opinion because you're going to find George that's the extreme and on the other extreme you'll find people in the middle to and that's OK\nPam's with us now in Washington very Connecticut hey Pam good morning\nPam Hi I'm so thrilled to be able to\nSpeak with you I Can't believe it this is this is what I've been thinking about so strongly this is the most amazing thing and I wouldn't call it a coincidence either um and ... a man that I agree with you completely um I saw spirits when I was like six years old\nAnd I had wonderful experiences I feel like oh\nI don't know if I'd been touched by God I have a very strong belief\nIn God and uh I was brought up in the ... and I felt God and in church I had perfect attendance when I was I think it was five or six years old Sunday school

powers that everyone has ... believes that we all can heal ourselves with magic can protect ourselves from evil entities or fight against the dark forces allows her to\nHelp others with solutions to empower their lives in here she is on coast to coast Kerr is a welcome to the show\n... how do you like to thank you so much for having me on and so grateful and honored to have this opportunity to share my information\nAnd you were considered to be a good which aren't you\n[laughter] well I Hope so [laughter]\nAs opposed to ban which I guess but no you're you're you're an upbeat person you're you're friendly you care about people ... you know how to dissolve start for you how did you get involved in witchcraft well\nYou know I started working with a ... and she's also happens to be ... of I I consider to be a very powerful which and and he introduced me to a magic and instead of doing the work for me because you know she I feel like her healing um\nAnd like I I feel like whatever she does with you I just so amazing but instead of doing the work for me she empowered me and taught me how to do it myself\nSo I just you know I picked it up really quickly and I I mean the rest of history I feel very very confident with with what I Do you know with the spouse that I've been\nWith with\nWhat I Do you know with the spell that I've been executing [noise] so that's how I got started it was it was more about healing and then that's when she just introduced me to it and now I feel like well I probably don't need a healer because I'm I'm using magic as a form of healing\nHave you ever ... somebody never\nAnd I want to make that very clear that I Will never ever ever cast a spell to hurt anyone um to try to bring love my way to try to win the lottery [laughter] it's not what\nI Do know shown and what what what good are shows that if you can't win anything\n[laughter] you know I think that the power of our minds because I have discovered one thing I have discovered with magic is\nThat in my mind is more powerful\nThan I realized so I think that when we start healing on so many different levels that we will be able to tap into unlimited amounts of financial abundance and spiritual London so I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will conjure up a money spell and work that\nBut right now I've just been focused on doing the um healing and an crossing and reversal\nWhen you talk about magic what do you what are we talking about we're not talking about David Copperfield we're talking about something oh sure\nAbsolutely and it can be used by anyone I think people\nYou know use magic every single day with the power of their minds so when I talk about magic\nI'm simply cantina spell and when I work my rituals I chat between anywhere between one and two hours I don't just trying to say was I really got along I really do I mean I think my neighbor's probably think I'm rehearsing for\nJimmy in ten seconds ... chips or get an idea what you're doing\nUm [noise] well when I exercise my house is kind of fun because you have to put on like this magical persona so all the uh negative negative beans leave this house like what would you say what is it I Know it I Know it I Know it I'm just a little nervous George\nAudio nervous for [laughter] you're only talking millions of people write\nAbout it so excited though I'm Still when I exercise my house because I Do do a house ... every single month to keep out the entities in any you know opportunists that happened to be sure crossing by\nAnd I will say on negative beans leave the house never to return I cast you out I test you out I cast you out so I Will do that while I'm throwing charge salt water and the candle and every single corner of my home and really really works and then I'll ward all the windows\nYou know the the ceiling and the floors and everything else\nSo um that's fun it's really really fun and then when I when I chat spells like when I Do and crossing rituals which I think everyone should learn how to\nDo and and do it very often\nAnd I know real capable of learning\nAbsolutely I think that we are we have become very lazy\nAnd we are we have I mean we have given our power away to not only our friends and family but to the government and it you know we were just we don't want to do anything else I feel also that we\nWe feel very entitled we feel like everything should be given to us and so this is one of the reasons why in the stream Lee grateful that my ... didn't do the work for me\nWhile I got to tell you it is it is indeed magical when it works doesn't it\nIt really is and I have not only felt results but I have seen results that actually creeps me out [laughter]\n[noise] well I got to tell your courage to ... to ... I have I had um you fight them off what do you do with it\n[laughter] yeah I Do I have a story to Maya demons later [laughter] well it's it's not as tragic as that but I have had one experience and I I Will share that with you I Would say about Nineteen Twenty years ago and this was my first experience with a real\nLive demon men this wasn't like a Puerto ... was in my house and it came out and you know want it to play it was actually a demon that was something up by a very evil some federal and he sent it my way\nWhat's on but I think there is some ... is a religion and um they can either be good or bad I don't know much about this on video religion but I Do know that there are some powerful sunset or shut down the you\nYes ... it's a religion okay and so they work with magic and they work with the ... shots which are different spirit [noise]\nUm so this ... battle had sent a intentionally of course it sent a demon my way and this was after I had had a reading with them a psychic reading and of course I was so naive and I didn't know I didn't know anything about the cold or anything about metaphysics I was just you know whatever just living my life\nAnd I that same evening that same day in the evening I um [noise] as soon as they turned off my light so I Can't even blame it on a dream as soon as they turned off my light [noise] um I was pinned down to my bed [noise]\nAnd I was terrified I didn't even know what it was because I didn't know anything about demons and um\nIt was\nJust like I couldn't move so my first reaction was to play the Lord's Prayer out loud and it didn't work so I you know after a few words my job locked and I felt like I had something shoved into my mouth you\nStay with us sicker Russia will come back and talk about the demons and just a moment on coast to coast there you\nGo students honors the new version of the coast to coast am apple you know I don't know Android bore down on a boat listen live on demand anywhere anytime go to go to ... dot com and downloaded today\nNo long long\nWay gene\nLong oh\n\nNational debt relief has helped tens of thousands of people just like you reduce more than five hundred million dollars of debt national\nDebt relief results so many people there a plus raided by the better Business Bureau you\nDon't have to declare bankruptcy or take out a consolidation loan\nYou have the right to settle your debt for a mere fraction of what you owe reduce a large portion of your debt no goal national debt relief at eight hundred sixty eight three forty five forty six eight hundred six eight three ... eight hundred sixty three forty bucks forty six\nThis is Michael Mad Men here with my ... from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage the news reports say that the rates might be going down\nThe government projects the costs of Medicare plans will decrease this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate help markets offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide help folks maximize their benefits and save on\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind\nEnrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go it won't get unbiased help to find a plan that may cost less uncover more with lower co payments more choices like dental and vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act\nNow our health markets Medicare assistance as freaked\nThanks Mike this is Michael med bed for health markets\nFor your free Medicare assistance Colleen unrated six nine for forty five forty two that's eight hundred six nine for forty five forty to eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two because I\nAm on news talk radio Katie WN and Katie Jay [noise]\n\nBan will come back we're backwards a practice in which the good which current unreal on her website is linked up the coast to coast am dot com right now we'll get to your calls in just a second with her crucial so we're talking about this demonic situation and you said it wasn't going well what was happening\nSo I Would point I was pinned down on my bed and\nThen all of a sudden what it felt like hours of course all of a sudden I fell on my ear going up and down I don't know of as a pall over a half foot but it was going up and down on my left ear and so it was really really crazy so at that point it was either fight or flight and I obviously couldn't sleep because I was ten down\nSo this wave of courage just came over me and I just thought you know I I ... I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just thought and as soon as I\nI made that adjustment in my mind I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just killed off of me and at that moment with my right arm I just woke up and went up and I'm not kidding George\nI felt a hairy leg that is insane it's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone\nBut it just like it flew away obviously that's right Ricky it is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't have believed me\nBut I did go back to that psychic woman and look like what happened but yeah it's so freaking and I will say and never happen again after that time so I Know that this man something that even and sent it my way but I did not sleep without the light off for about three months after that it\nTotally terrified me it was crucial who is susceptible to demonic possession and in situations like that a child ...\nWell you know I'm not going to list the say the obvious ones like people doing drugs or having a cocktail or drunk or shine yeah we're we're going to the ... or the cemetery at you know and having a cocktail at midnight [laughter] but I Will say that um there is one reason I think that\nMany other were you ever to laugh you don't have a tackle which uh which should have a capital you don't have\nA which is actually a wise woman so [laughter] that's the definition of a witch but yeah I think you [noise] um\nI kinda wanted a chemical but that's all right [laughter] I Can't do it even if I\nTried and so one of the reasons that I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand\nI'm considering we all lived thousands of lifetimes I'm and I'm Glad I haven't remembered any of them on some of these lifetimes we were not the best of people and um it's very possible that this is my theory that could be wrong but\nI have proof from my showman who kind of confirmed um my you know my thoughts about this and it's very possible that some of these people these victims who are experiencing what is known as karma so they can be you know\nHarassed and molested in this lifetime\nWith the team and the danger with in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in this lifetime and the demon that how it is usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I've ever heard of the demon die unless you like ...\nYou cast them all but the they don't want by exactly there's\nThousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at Georgia it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demon and what's going to happen when we read incarnate and the demon is going to probably harass him and molest him now that's one one theory and I can say\nI'm with confirmation that it it it's probably very true because my sharman has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days\nHas a lot of cases of of people who are being molested harassed and just you know possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a shower Monica journey into their past life\nAnd and mail it and nine times out of ten these people have made packs with demons or they were maybe a big\nPowerful black which and you know I don't know it's it's it's different for each of them but for the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does is she just breaks that agreement that they can find\nAs is she just breaks that agreement that they can finally be free\nAnd um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in the situation and you know these demons or not bothering her neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified showman who can really just put an end to this\nMotor these dark for she she wants to ... what what are they want\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity\nDo they feed off of ...\nAbsolutely and I'm sadly a lot of black magicians will cast spells against people who they feel they can steal like from and they can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and the book into us however they do it\nAnd what this does it will make their incorrect magic more potent so this is why it is extremely important especially right now um to to really really really really\nClear ourselves on a daily basis and do vanishing rituals prayers and and he'll or our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases\nOf the demon intrusions in people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely um manipulate our thoughts\nLet's go to the phones for you know Kathy in Redding, California to get started high gas go ahead\nGeorge how are you I'm good thank you I got I'm losing my voice so I Hope you can hear me Marshall good okay Hi Chris Hi um my husband\nAnd I both bully that I think curse is ex girlfriend oh boy [laughter] [noise] [noise] it wasn't but a year\nAfter he and I had gotten together than an accident occurred with me and I brought it up to him a couple of months later said\nYou know do you think that this person is 'cause I I mean just fucking out or the rights for her she was a witch but not a good way to know and I mean she might even have to go\nBut I told him I said do you think that it's possible that this person could have put a curse on me and he looked at me and said absolutely\nWhile she obviously when they broke up you're not going away peacefully didn't you\nKnow and actually she helped him move into his apartment it was like God open the door for me to leave

Sebastian Gorka just mentioned dusk Elise\nNobody match skull lease yesterday an attempted assassination of the United states congressman on that Virginia ball field companies talked about that you know what do\nI Know that they don't ... I mean the only reason those guys are alive today and this goes to something I Know this is near and dear to your heart is because you had to Capitol police officers that did what probably their training told them not to do\nAnd that is they walk in an open field with pistols\nGoing up against a rifle a at a guy hidden behind a barrier now that basically is is a suicide mission to save someone else's life that's how brain watch\nOr listen these these men and women to what all the time it's just like the better whether it be a joint terrorism task force now or the FBI to New York

don't know I I'm I'm starting to have a a real and claim that\nThese may not be real devices a ... and if that's true\nUh were a lot better off nobody's going to get hurt but I find it really suspicious that you bet eight or nine at these things so far it usually the trigger mechanism for these devices is the actual opening up the package well there's been several open and none of them have detonated which tells me\nThere is some sort of problem so I Hope it they're not real ah and I hope that the authorities find up sooner or later I think\nThe ... billion in cuts search go because they have so much now forensic evidence ear I'm assuming you know we we talk about this yesterday that it well none of this is easy but I'm I'm assuming by now they probably have their eyes on

evidence that they been able to capture because these things did not get a date and I think we'll see some good so\nAll right Dr ... will you be a little less word today\nThe bottom line is we run these people to ground we released the plot how we throw the book at them but it doesn't matter what side you're on\nThe the responsibility for the normalization of violence as started on the left when you have a former general who worked for President Obama say when they doubt you kick them\nWhen you have Hillary Clinton say we're going to be civil often we win the election nobody on the right says that it's the left responsible if you could ...\nI Want to thank you both doctors Sebastian Gorka congrats by the way on your new bestseller why don't you try to Feeding America is a enemies with no apologies and former NYPD Commissioner Bernie care he also wrote the grave above\nA the grave and that too is are selling well thank you so much for being with us Bernie eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number if there's any chance of a great night on election night twelve days from now it has to be starting in Tennessee with the wind by Marsha Blackburn we'll get to that and much more straight ahead\nAnd so that's why the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today or I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with them when they count so you know I don't like to count on naming a post office is a procedural vote\nAnd I'm not ... well let's talk about the votes where he Donald Trump really could have you on his vote health care being one\nWell that's right so Joe mansion said no to getting rid of Obamacare and having a really high quality affordable health care options in the mountains state\nSean in West Virginia premiums have risen over a hundred and sixty percent in four years and matching said no to fixing getting rid of Obamacare\nAnd I think that West Virginia's didn't like that they also didn't like the fact that Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts that are really giving a big left to our state providing economic opportunity better jobs\nJoe mansion how to side with Chuck Schumer the leadership on every issue when it matters Manchin says no one even I have it all\nWhere people say oh he ended up voting for Kavanaugh reality is he waited he actually left the Senate a voting chamber and waited until Susan Collins cast a vote and then and only then to Joe Manchin step out because he knew if he didn't do that he\nWas politically death is toe so I you know I kind of view a lot of those votes as you know election conversion your votes and that's the point is you have over the tax cuts um and you know maybe not as extreme as as everyone else in his party but the reality is is that he's going to vote for Chuck Schumer to be the majority leader\nAnd I don't think Chuck Schumer can get ... votes in West Virginia which makes mansion out of touch with the people in West Virginia and it was important issues like tax cuts regulation energy those are three main fundamental issues that that affect an impact\nThe economy in West Virginia also I Know West Virginia like a lot of places and struggled with a opioid issues and we do with the president did yesterday and what he's been doing since he became president\nWell that's one of the big issues in this race that Joanne since first vote will be for Chuck Schumer and Chuck Schumer is made no bones about the fact that he's going to head out\nThe obstruction resistance impeachment caucus and if you're part of that Schumer leadership team and Joe Manchin is and you're powering these liberals\nThe folks that really created all the rock destroying the Kavanaugh hearings then you're part of the problem so that's why people were so focused on Joe mansion first vote because you know he's not going to be with West Virginia and he's going to be part of a team\nThat's tearing down the president West Virginians don't want that\nAnd that's why we're gaining so much momentum in our campaign\nHow much money is the Democratic party putting into West Virginia ... to try and keep in other words how much you're Schumer and company and below sea and company or are they investing in these negative ads about you\nWell they've put a fortune and I think by a by all accounts they're going to probably be up over twenty four twenty five million dollars and this is West Virginia this is not New York California or Florida they'll probably end up spending about ... million more we're going to look at the final counts\nAnd that's what happens on you mentioned earlier you know if you get pounded for months on end of that and you can't respond it makes it difficult but now\nThe president came back twice he's actually our side we think is going to come back again and we start to come back twelve ten eight six to or to to you know to even and that's because President Trump has made this a top priority\nWhen there is Arlene voting began in West Virginia and started your\nEarly yeah early voting started yesterday and so we're starting to look at the numbers one thing we see is that the Republicans have a lot of energy and\nPeople know that the future of the Senate could really be at stake what this election and that there's a clear choice so uh we're feeling good about it we're not hockey but we're going out worked Joe mansion that people are going to know\nOn the conservative fighter will help the President Joe mansion he's a dishonest Washington did liberal and he's never there when you need them\nAll right we're watching the race now put this in the ... column a where we once thought it was a leaning Democrat now the state of West Virginia and play attorney general Patrick Morrisey would support the president's agenda or is this Joe mansion and sadly would vote for Chuck Schumer said\nAnyway it's a deadline and race at this point and uh with early voting a there is a very good shot that that could change hands that would help\nA future endeavors in the U.S Senate and we wish all the best Patrick Morrisey\nHey Shaun thanks so much than anyone

forgot to mention the severed head of a president they didn't seem to outraged about that most people\nAnd now they're again this is selective moral outrage being about Russia\nOr being about sexual assault or allegations of such or about you know vitriolic rhetoric or actions I mean you have people threatening to beat up the president destroy the president bomb the White House and I didn't see the type of outrage we're now hearing from the left\nHates them you know I think this is happening on both sides and I think there's no excuse for it you know I listened to have a clip that you just played and people are hard at work or doing the same thing that we had the ... about the extent to which the president has also made threats and it talked about violence\nAnd out of the I ask you one question and ... and what you do is you give me the the predictable liberal talking point I asked you very very specifically\nAbout all of the rhetoric that has led up to where we are we've now in the last month watch woman after woman after woman being run out of a restaurant by left wing mobs and the same left wing media didn't have anything to say\nAnd every one of those young rich as a matter of at the news CNN wouldn't let their anchors use the word mob well because that's a ... for the call a point it's reality you don't win you know you don't have those those are mobs going after those people I Do\nNot going to defend it I don't think it's right is it a mile to be able to eat in Sinai looks like a month to me I also think that presents unique\nTalent police officers in Long Island ... when they get in the back of the ... you know calling the media the enemy of the people because you and I both know that for the most pot journalists from across the political spectrum I just people trying to you know we all don't respect\nBut I don't see that I see a media that has been corrupted and complicit in advancing conspiracy theories wise and pure hatred of all things Donald Trump what do you use the Jonathan\n[noise] will tell you one thing uh I\nI Will say that I don't think it's a mob I think it is organized gangs and that's a big difference in a mob\nA mob or people that may or may not have the same interests that gather a to do a certain thing but in this case these people have organization they don't just show up somewhere a ... once these people show up again and again and again that's a very important thing that we need to look at um\n[noise] uh it is to the the way the conversation is going over the past couple of days though\nI I Want Sean I think everybody needs to look at one thing or all that rhetoric that you played at the beginning of this was very specific about violence very specific about who to target\nAnd when I look at the at the response which you had and which are seen from other people are when bronco bomber was an office\nUm in in the case of the shooter that shot to\nUm the Mr squeeze 'em what you saw where people not blaming Bernie Sanders but what you see here and I find that is so hard is that uh these devices have been\nOut there that somebody went the distance to to put these things together to uh to carry out a plan covertly to put these things in place all at once and none of them went off and immediately the rhetoric starts in a way that is organized\nAnd now I'm not saying they have something to do with where ever put these out there but the organization of the rhetoric is so disgusting read alone on the political chain that it it does make one pause and asked um was this rhetoric prepared\nIt's a it's a very alarming thing\nWas that I got Daniel\n[noise] you know I just I just want to make it really clear I'm not blaming the president's it is I think that there is playing the light across the entire political spectrum\nAnd what I think regular people like me see if\nI go out and the world I deal with people who I don't necessarily agree with I get my job's done I just said I I work hard and somehow I can manage to get around the world around this country to get around my city\nI without inflaming tensions are the people around me and I just don't understand what is wrong with politicians that they cannot get their job is Don\nUnderstand what is wrong with politicians that they cannot get their job done without that kind of rhetoric\nJonathan the way I look at it as this is now gone on two years of vitriol hatred lies conspiracy theories on a level we've never seen before and what's worse is you know when the president says the fake news\nA lot of it has been fake news it's not even news all of his political commentary clogged up as news and it's not news at all these are not news channels these are opinion channels\nYou know I don't see much real reporting from fake news CNN or or even NBC ABC or CBS anymore they're all run by liberal activists George Stephanopoulos agenda\nHe's a he's been Clinton's ruined through his entire life and he hasn't changed one bit\nAnd it's not any different on CBS or NBC or any of the two cable channels\nAnd you know it's interesting I say I'm a talk show host part of my job is to give opinion but I also report straight news we do investigative reporting we've been doing it for example but we've added Obama when no one else would we be vetted the deep state more deeply than anybody else in the media\nAnd so that's part of what we do giving opinion as part of what we do we're like the whole newspaper they say they're only the news part of the newspaper but they're really the opinion part\nYou know Sean I I've been on your TV show on the radio show I've been around you for five years now and one thing that can truly say whether it be you or anybody else on Fox News and and a lot of these other networks out there is that\nWhen when something like this happens\nAnd all of these Democrats are having these devices deliver to them you're not going to see what else on NBC today where they have the the uh down below where they have to headline a blow to the reporter and it says that Trump opposition is getting devices delivered to their to their addresses Trump opposition\nThat that's the way that they're they're playing this so they're automatically putting suspect on Trump just by the way that they are labeled the lower half of the screen\nI mean it it is it's it's it's such political um\nThis tasteful rhetoric that when you\nCouple that with the things like Madonna said\nWith the things that are these politicians are are\nInstigating people to go out and carry out these things Trump never never has said anything that inflammatory and by and large\nThe reason his words are so ah inflame is not because of him it's because of CNN and MSNBC and these leftist politician that go out and\nPump it up to something that he never made it to be\nWe're gonna have to leave it there uh Jonathon Gillum author of sheep no more thank you Danielle McLaughlin attorney a and a soon to be\nA mom

constantly interfere with our economy one industry after another\nOne industry after another degree with me\n\nThe Democrats are always wanting to regulate industries they're always wanting to tell them what to do they're always wanted to set up their price structure and their employees structure and all other structures in our industry we don't support that do we\n\nI mean the way you create more products in the way you drive down costs is worth less government right less government interference\nI mean that makes sense\nThe Democrats constantly want to drive up the cost of domestic steel\n\nWhich results and you're paying more for pickup trucks and you truckers out there for your Eighteen wheelers and people who want to buy purchase a car drives up the cost of homes because believe it or not they're stealing your homes are still in a lot of stuff so it drives up costs and the Democrats are always wanting to drive up costs why use that\nAs a payoff to certain unions is that it\n\nIt makes it much more difficult to export our products because it's much more expensive to create them to to build the right to construct to manufacture them\n\nAn automobile for instance if it costs two or three thousand dollars more to build an automobile in this country because the Democrats drive up across the steel well then we're not going to export as many automobiles and what happens to the to the auto workers well\nThey don't fare too well do they what happens to the American manufacturing a auto makers while they're going to fare less well to\nSame of the people who built motorcycle so I'm really tired of the Democrats doing\nThe Democrats have been talking for decades about basically controlling pharmaceutical companies controlling the costs of pharmaceuticals well how's that going to control the costs of pharmaceuticals\nHow do they know what the cost of pharmaceuticals ... the we talked about this the other day the billions of dollars that these companies spend\nTo find to make to figure out what works and what doesn't work and most of the time they fail that's why there's a significant cost for certain types of medicines\n\nAnd we talked about the poverty programs they have for people who can actually show that their income is at such a level that they can't afford super expensive medicines and so forth but the Democrats want to control that

energy basis for ethanol now none whatsoever not\nNot\nThere is no basis breath and all that sort of there's no basis it was originally brought in to deal as I said well with that OPEC and the hope was to be relatively simple way to compete with ads but we've had other technologies fracking and stuff that's unnecessary\nThat does damage to certain engines an auto parts\nSo why is the president extending it for the entire year\nWhen we know we know\nNow or steel is the most expensive steel in the world\n\nSo manufacturers who use steel and tried to export it will have a very difficult time exporting their products including automobiles\nTrucks farm equipment\nAll kinds of tool it's all kind of consumer goods the costs will be much higher\nNow I understand the steel industry preferred and I understand the argument they may for the last half century but these things have consequences when you take or are you more than take her with the economy from top down government action\nIt's the way it works\nHarley Davidson is not an unpatriotic company highly David since been around forever a hundred years it's a magnificent company it's an iconic American Company when they complain about the price of steel they're not doing it because they're on American they're doing it because they are American they're doing it because they do believe in the market system\nSo they're making their money now\nIt's just so they're making their money now by moving production overseas where the steel is cheaper not because they want to because they don't want to go into business just\nLike steel mills don't want to go out of business automobile manufacturers don't want to go out of business just like pharmaceutical companies don't want to go out of business\n\nIf you're going to force price controls on them and that's what we're talking about government top down price controls like the left\nWhile you're going to get less trucks less options less new developments and inventions and medicine and technologies that's not good\n\nIf you can show there is some kind of antitrust violation or something like that go for it but that's not what we're talking about here\n\nWhite House decides it's too much and I'll go in there and hold on the prices\nI mean that would be same thing same to develop or you're charging too much for your condos you're charging too much for office space you're charging too much for this that or the other wires certain industries\nUntouchable and other industries are endlessly touchable why is that\n\nI told you yesterday that the media are a joke they ever\nHorrifically comparing the president to Hitler is terms the Hitler because he says I'm a nationalist and it is outrageous that they use such rhetoric is grotesque\nBut also I pointed out yesterday\n\nThat the man who made this nationalism frame famous in the last century was Theodore Roosevelt a progressive\nAnd he gave this famous speech called the new nationalism speak and they talked about all the things big centralized government was going to do and that's when I said to the president at least on the air\nYou don't want to be that do you were not talking about national as we're talking about American is\nWhen you say America First you're not seeing nationalism first\nWe believe in federalism\n\nNow I Know what the president meant you know what the president meant for the left it was just another opportunity to be fame the president and the dumb down what Hitler did it's sick\n\nBut words that meaning they've consequence\n\nYou listening to me you're not nationalist nationalist you believe in big centralized government the national government at all times these would be the state governments are local governments that's not what you believe it's not nationalism versus globalism it's constitutional isn't\nVersus globalism it's capitalism that we embrace constitutional is individual is\nJust to put a fine point on\nThere's no reason the government should be involved in what goes on to your tank on your car your gas tank or your or your pickup truck you're Eighteen wheeler all they do a screw it up and drive up the cost\nThere's no reason to pay two or three thousand dollars more for a vehicle in order to different jak one union and one industry\nThere's no reason that the subsidized people who grow wheat that was done in the seventies and
