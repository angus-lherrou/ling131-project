saw these\nThese dinosaur looking things running around there uh and\nShe's also been sightings from Colorado and New Mexico so I mean if a if you believe that the world is big enough and fast enough and still maybe a unexplored enough to to harbors some of these surviving dinosaurs you know I guess it's certainly possible\nDo you like this monster has been on your list has not\nYet has and um actually this year has been a ... year pretty significant here for the Loch ness monster George I'm you know in recent years sightings as a lock this monster him really trailing off\nBut uh in two thousand and Fifteen we actually had a they log five pretty darn good sightings\nOf something in in Loch Ness\nAnd it was the biggest year for the Loch ness monster and over a decade uh the fighting started in March of two thousand Fifteen or a family of tourists who were by the earthquake capital there the famous castle on the side a lot ness claimed he saw a twenty foot\nComplex shape come out of the water and then some merge they weren't able to take a photograph of it 'cause they were in shock and awe but they did get some footage of the uh the disturbance that it left behind and then the next month and April there were two or three really good sightings of a large animate object in Loch Ness\nAnd uh then again in September or the thing was seen again so whatever is in Loch Ness nasty

not my theory it's been around for years but uh the possibility that the Loch ness monsters a giant amphibian or essentially like a related to salamanders in New in that same played\nAnd the reasons that I support that over the police use the words that amphibians are more acclimated to cold water than a reptile phrase\nA and in addition to that amphibians can actually suck oxygen breathe oxygen through their skin so an amphibian would be able to stay submerged for a longer period of time and say a reptile which we need to come to the surface for air a fairly consistently\nLike little

don't even know how to present it to people but yeah the actual photographic evidence of\nHurdles opening a dimensional things coming and going into it when you drill down\nDeeper into the picture you can see their Hans ... everything from things that look I'm not familiar with ... and everything looks familiar to ... um few aliens have ... looking thing\nUm [noise] it's it's uncanny and however I'd like to ask how you kinda figured that out that it it was ... related portal that's bringing things in ... now and eyesight I've got the evidence to support [noise] wow\nThat's pretty amazing and in terms of the evidence to Gina where do you have\nGot well you know I started looking at the other lady with me and then when the check how it's going to happen it's really started picking up and then all of a sudden now here in this past summer I've been able to take pictures and whenever I took pictures they might feel presidents around me\nWhenever I take pictures there's other dimensional team around me all the time and now here lately and this is happening just your leaks ago\nUm I've got this evidence that these portals hoping I'll be taking pictures of anything whether it's my apartment or an environment and and I'm just neutral areas huh and I'll feel some in there and I'll take a picture and you look at picturing you drill down and you see\nHere the ... other ... Internet here these past few weeks the portal being open\nAnd are these portals opening and closing\nYeah [laughter] yeah it's it's ... it drove down to like almost like you know it's like I'll take a picture to more often than there yeah and then it'll turn black like something's tranquil\n... speaking of pictures the genesis of you your just goes to goes to um dot com or lacks that coast to coast am dot com and can I suspect that if there are ... holes they've got to be pretty big swallow up so many people rather than just being you know maybe the side of the sidewalk don't you think\nYeah that makes sense and again you know as a corpus of all this quantum physics is at one of my strong points but\nUh certainly I've read the works of you know I was interested in some of other forty and researchers that have addressed the vortex theory and um yeah you absolutely would we'd be talking about something that has just an unbelievable amount of a math and energy\nWell that's that's more scarier than big foot or UFOs to me falling into a dimension and you can't get back while that's horrible were coming back with spinal calls in a moment coast to coast down\n\n\nAnd ah it basically crawled up a tree in his backyard and he didn't know whether to\nUh to run away 'cause he was afraid that might jump on him or or to you know running grab a camera you alternately went for a camera but by the time he got back to the thing was gone but a guy was pretty credible Georgia I mean this is a guy or he saves people's lives for a living and he uh he swore to me up and down at this this really happened\nEverybody who's listening to us in bed right now there is a huge bite or on your\nPillow just one [laughter] ah I'm not that I have a record of phobia but I don't like spiders can I don't like I Know they have a purpose but I don't like 'em\n[laughter] uh most people don't George I think you're not alone there but uh you can imagine spider that big a particularly\nHere in North America uh yeah you get a house restless night\nWhy did the great create or give them eight legs what do they need to eat leagues for\nWell spiders are actually uh they're they're pretty darn proven designed George I mean the uh\nThe date back uh probably four hundred million years or so the slurry and if you're talking about like the the the ancestors of spiders which were like the the ... the sea scorpions\nUh so uh it's it's a it's a tried and true design and it's worked for hundreds of millions of years\nLet's go to a amber and the coach Tom Pennsylvania to get us going Hi amber go ahead\nWell George how're you doing good hope you are to\nYeah you almost no return of luck with that spider\n[laughter] again it's\nNot like I was very well anyway so I'm visually impaired [laughter] that's right and the way I'm kidding or what I called about why is that that's something last year for mark and mark Martin was created do say New Mexico well when ... bought about fat\nI'm Sorry I didn't hear what about knocked me in the New Mexico\nWas created ... ... ...\nOh so it was kind of like a like a covert government experiment or something like that as a ...\nA war you know what do you think about that not nothing's impossible but uh in my flying humanoid book um I actually um there is a case of the mosque man type creature known as the bird man of ...\nAnd it's been an countered by several residents of a tiny town called ... which is a not too too darn far for white sands\nAnd our some of those other kind of covert uh things have gone on through the years so uh you know maybe you got a case they're of a mosque man and a little bit closer to home if a New Mexico is where they're from\nOkay who's actually been in Florida it's your turn been taken away\nHey Jen I'm I don't know if you remember me but we we can't that one I ought to fix that extradition yes they are very and we were looking for the ... yeah we sure well I found him in that six and I\nThink yeah where are you going to be coming back down this way to do further research and um [noise] um because there's been some interesting things happening I'm\nOut with that area where we were at and I'm also since you've been doing thunderbirds stuff I spent last year up in North Dakota and the oil field working and I went to measure she state\nPark near Glenn dive Montana and if you're in if you're still doing on your research you should go out there and take a look at some things that's awesome I saw some birds out there last year that\nFreaked me out I'm a wildlife biologist\nWow that's impressive press is out there can take some ... by the way this the skunk apes people think they're big right\nWell I think most researchers feel that they're potentially a subspecies so they are kind of a derivative of big foot but since you're looking at a completely you know you're considering a completely different type of habitat the swamps the cypress swamp and uh\nAnd so forth um there are a little bit smaller than the traditional big put her sauce watched from the Pacific northwest of they primarily walk on their hind legs or by Peter Lee but there have been a lot of accounts of them are going down on all fours\nA so in that respect to the Florida Scott Cape seems to be you know even more ape like if you will than the traditional big butter sauce watch\nWhether any huge stories in two thousand Fifteen in their crypto world\n[noise] [noise] well uh in addition to the Loch ness monster thing that I told you about that was kind of big but um there had been a lot of sightings are accounts of something known as the dog man I don't know if you've heard of that or not but essentially it's aware wolf type creature that combines the characteristics of a of a canine\nA and a human and a kind of like your traditional Hollywood werewolf if you will but um there were at least four to six accounts or in a relatively short period of time from central Pennsylvania and these were followed closely by some of my colleagues who are researchers up in that area\nAnd ah the descriptions are again very similar now are limited Godfrey of course is a a colleague of mine who's documented these dog man\nYes ah last werewolf\nAccounts from all over the mid west or but it seems to be a pretty quickly uh seems to be a very polarizing topic I should say in the field of crypto zoology\nUh it seems to be a very polarizing topic I should say in the field or crypto zoology there's so many accounts now uh it seems like these things whatever they are they're they're really being seen in a with a lot of frequency lately\nHow much do we not know about creatures\nWell well that's just the George I mean there's two ways to look at it you know one is that we've got it all figured out in the world all been explored but uh uh I personally know that to not be the case I've had the opportunity to travel all over the world to the Amazon jungle to Africa to all kinds of amazing habitats\nAnd I can tell you that the vast majority of our planet is uninhabited and very inaccessible\nAnd in addition to that new species are being discovered on a consistent basis still so um you know there is certainly the potential for all types of strange and marvelous creatures to be out there just beyond the grasp of scientists\nRobert ... in Baltimore, Maryland now hey Robert thanks ringing in there go ahead\nOh thank you George ... wanna wish both you and Ken a happy new year I think you\nJudge one of the things I've been trying to do with your\nA story you see a is a great or the money that you've had in the end of the things that they bring out that ah that do have some like strange nice and heard before\nAnd the and in regard to what kind of talking about this for items that I'd like to to bring to your attention sure one is that uh the uh we we've heard quite a bit of bad civilizations that have existed in and still exist on the earth\nAnd it would seem like a for example one of the uh one of these the species or the ... and I noticed that Ken talked about the ... features on some of the\nUh the animals that have been observed\nA another one is the fact that the explorers admiral bird and others when they've been in the Arctic and and it ties in with this ah I live in a being a location where you see many of these creatures that are that you found a whole\nA they reported a hole in the in the Arctic and then when admiral bird was sent down to Antarctica\nWhich was on another one of your shows a day of course discovered that there's quite a bit of activity going on underground in Antarctica and again that can be a location where other species could develop\nAnd if these are underground areas exist all through the country which we've heard they do\nOr they could very easily be independence civilizations independence species living there and coming out through a very it's a\nAh areas that have not been explored unfair and timely or when you talk about shape shifting Ken I I think we always want to keep in mind the possibility that\nShaped shift or maybe isn't it shaped shifting but he's projecting a a\nA a holographic image tell a perfectly to the receivers that when you look at him he's very much directing an image and I wonder and many of these cases where maybe they are shaped shifting but it is ...\nAlways have to consider that possibility\nThat they're not and I'm I'm another subject you brought up before I went to make a comment on hard or that one of the major uh objectives for the people researching harp and that isn't just in the United states is you know\nA Russia had done quite a bit of research in that area before hand but the one of the purpose is military yeah and when you start looking at the military objectives\nYou no longer take as much consideration for what the side effects\nAre might be to the popular local populations\nSo uh uh I thought you might want to consider that and explaining a I Believe the various creatures that you see you you may tired in with some of the not only the extraterrestrial but also the inner terrestrial\nA phenomena that has been emerging recently the Georgians

story called into the need to twenty two in his website is linked up the coast to coast am dot com it's in some detail twenty two dot com want to introduce you to Jonathan Gabriel rescues Jonathan I Know this is going to be tough for you but thank you for joining us tonight\nThank you thank you very much for having me\nI Want you to tell or means you know audience that will truly\nBe very sympathetic with you tonight exactly what happened to row because this story is so important for so many people to understand a bomb let's start let's start from the beginning he was a vibrant young man what happened\nYes for Ralph was a vibrant young man with no\nMedical history whatsoever was admitted to the University of Missouri Kansas City prestigious six year bachelor degree empty program were children graduate and six years with a BA in an empty\nAnd after completing the first year that program he got food poisoning [noise]\nWent to a hospital in Kansas City he was administered very controversial drug by the name of ... or ... G. L. A. and the generic version of it at ...\nThis is a black box drug that was used as a first line of defense or something like food poisoning\nAnd from the moment that drug was injected within days Ralph both physical and mental condition began to deteriorate and there are many many many cases of this that can be found on the Internet\nAnd when you see and begin to deteriorate physically and mentally did you notice that change with him\nAbsolutely within a day or two he and one of his medical school room mates had done research\nAnd the changes I noticed or his anxiety began to increase he began to complain of strange pains that he had never had before and this and a slow deterioration that I Would call something like this doing this whole lot of the human body\nAnd at this point Ralph took his life\n[noise] over the course of a\nEarly in twenty Seventeen he was I brought him back home to St Louis and he made three attempts on his life\nTo take themselves out of this horrific condition that was bringing him intense pain and from what I understand the form of anxiety times a hundred [noise]\nUm and on his last attempt he was successful and um I did hold his hand and was there he passed away\nHow old was he just he was twenty [noise] and how does he take his life\nHe tried with two other attempts that runs successful but on the last attempt a he used a gun\nAnd at that time\nI wasn't there he sent me a text that really began the marketing of the year but the text came to me at exactly eleven eleven\nThat's where we are going to talk about tonight the ... that have occurred for you especially after this\nAnd that's where we're going to talk about tonight the ... that have occurred for you especially after this tragedy occurred I mean I remember being in St Louis when I heard about this\nAnd it was a it was a shocking situation for anybody to have to go through a ... it it is my biggest nightmare of course as a parent\nTo lose your trial before before you go and uh I could only to what you were going through at the time with this kind of pain but the synchronous cities then started so tell us a little bit about the name ... and then twenty two which is the name of your book\n[noise] well I I looked at that tax George again and again and again it in some way I found solid and connecting with that last tax\nAnd as I began to stare at it again and again it occurred to me Lebanon eleven well Ralph was born on two twenty two [laughter] and so the number twenty two began to resonate with me a firm that was the beginning point I Would say up that resignation\nI Want to tell our audience does a little sacred a city here when I was talking with Jonathan several weeks ago about the this situation in his book and of course the tragedy that occurred now he had mentioned that you know his his son roles\nA was a you know just a delightful young guy and a news is ... use the name Gabriel of course uh you took that name as well did you not\nI did Ralph middle name was Gabriel and so I changed my middle name to Gabriel I felt they unison or one this and doing that it was symbolic was spiritual and brought me significant meaning\nAnd on and I was talking to Jonathan and I said to my dad's name was ... and uh you know he was born on February twenty seconds which is the same date that Ralph was born in\nThese weird synchronous and if you started coming up all over again and Jonathan's eyes just opened up and everything else do you believe that your son is Cindy ... messages Jonathan through these strange occurrences\n[noise] I I Do believe that I I've always been a rational analytical regimented person and in my personal life in my profession and Avi aiding [noise]\nAnd with the pain of what happened it began to open up my thought process and I said wait a minute there's just got to be more and I took down the wall of what was my personal rationality and began to read I began to study\nA I've been studying a ancient ... text in Hebrew I look to other religions and mystical world and I do\nBelieve that in finance is communicating with me\n[noise] what message do you think ... is trying to pass on to you what does he want you to know\n[noise] I find comfort in knowing that he's letting me know that the existence of him has not the best\nLife on earth for him has seized but the existence in the cosmic soup if you will does not stop and that has brought me tremendous comfort\nI I I was going to say it it must be in a very strange way of\nCourse to give you the kind of comfort to know that his existence continues that he's out there somewhere ah in trying to get you little messages every once in a while just to make you aware that you know hey Dan I'm here\n[noise] well you know it it hasn't been always once in a while sometimes it's a little more frequent uh about two weeks ago I've been wearing his watch that I gave him on his twentieth birthday which is an automatic watch okay and I've been wearing it for the better course of a year and a half [noise]\nI've not touched it it always keeps the correct time ten days ago I woke up I put on the watch I got in the car I went to work at my watch was twenty two minutes by\nAll\nI had to look at it a few times but it was twenty two men\nAnd do you get behind the car and you look at a license plate did you see twenty two there to do these numbers pop up all over the place\nYou know they do pop up to me and at times I think they're popping up and at times I think they're not coincidences so I really created a work for myself coincidences I'm calling them coincide and says\nBecause as a recent trip to Los Angeles and I'm thinking a lot about him and hotel I check into and they hand me a kid I Walk up to the room and the room number is to twenty two\nJeeze random they just give it to correct you you didn't request it\n[noise] but I don't think it's random I'm I have removed random from my thought\n... yeah I mean there might be random on the hotels side but somebody else's directing this and they stuck patterns Jonathan stay with us we're going to come back in the moment and talk more about these strange synchronous these of course a you've got some more stories to share with us we'll also open up the phone lines for a couple of reasons\nFor folks who want to just ask you a question about what you've

in the need to twenty two dot com linked up the coast to coast the dot com we're talking about his latest were called in for twenty two about the life of his son ... cities that have occurred since rough tragically passed on\nJonathan I Know how tough this was for you when this tragedy occurred how're you doing now\nWell George I'm I'm definitely doing better one of the things that's really help to me is to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the infinite\nAnd in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings has this ability\nBut I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body as the finite zone and for the anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body and so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite\nAnd so in meditative thought and thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infinite zone where each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat did you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\nI have to say that I I question that I didn't think about it much\nAnd ever since Ralph passed away I set out a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nJonathan culturally then we'll get to them in a second but there are three strange occurrences that occurred I Want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the were drivers situation what happened there\nSo about eight months ago I had a gun in a new or from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want\nAnd he looked at me and a very strange stare and said I'll just tell them Ralph set it\nOff and I looked at him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said no\nShe how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] I Love it how about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning\nAnd after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it and the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\n[noise] I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and said we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\n... gets timing in secret the city again and then you had an occurrence with some strange bedroom lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and I turned off the lights and I was leaving in the house was empty and\nThe lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me during the lights back with the light switch back down and put it back up put it back down and they went off the lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off at that time I left the house\nAnd just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\nIt was a point where you got angry about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing [noise] um [noise] I don't I don't fault Tam I\nHave struggled to try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shielded themselves\nFrom any and all liability from every American citizen\nWell they're they're protected by a federal law aren't they\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJohnathan which was we're all subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\nNo Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student\nOr frequently making jokes he was just if you ask is friends they would portray just the most on us um you know likeable young man you could you could think of\nNow that do go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stay at home they take some stuff uh you know they're going to the bathroom as often as they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the hospital\nI I think I think he was vomiting proof usually there was a lot of blood that with his friends who were all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he\nMedical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that call\nWell I got the call after medication had been given to him about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOh okay let's go to some culture for you Jonathan let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington question story Hi Patty\nHi ah I've I've got a little story and I hope it's a relevant to a distinction in cities that I think I've got more and then you can shake a stick at\nUm it started with my son ah who incidentally was taken away from me when he was born we somehow managed to to make a connection\nThat we could look back for each other on that he was born on my birthday three minutes apart from the same time\nI was born in from their synchronous cities just roll in um\nUm we were both born nine fourteen I was nine fourteen fifty two it was nine fourteen sixty eight and every number we'd have to deal with this is a night at nine I mean ... of fourteen or a seven or its divisible by seven\nYeah um so you get certain numbers as Jonathan gets twenty two you get certain numbers popping up all the time too\nYeah exactly well a ... first thing was we noticed

the southern chair to responsible gas drilling a Governor Cuomo votes will not let it happen my opponent repeatedly thoughts against that and this is how scary my opponent is getting a debate last night he ever voted four times\nFor government takeover\nOf our health care which is single payer\nWhich would cost the taxpayers of New York this is bragged about by the socialist leaning guy who's just sponsored the bill would only cost the taxpayers of New York Ninety two billion in New taxes on an annual basis\nIt ... ankle or [laughter]\nThat's it led to believe but Ninety two billion when we're already take half your money anyway a credit bureau Henny ...\nThis is a solution not voted\nFour times for late term abortion this isn't a moderate you this is a radical\nYou this is a guy who is trying to pretend he is that I support the president he's not going to support the president he's going to support Nancy pillars he's going to support the impeachment caucus is going to chime right in with all these Democrats you never shown any effect on he's never stood up to Sheldon Silver in fact\nYou can't pick by Sheldon Silver for the job to get to the assembly\nNow we can't take by Chuck Schumer\nWho brags about it and Andrew Cuomo funny none of them have come to the district to help him get elected but she never came to our district President Trump the first time in my home city of Utica New York in Seventy years we had a sitting president ...\nAre you also had his son Eric I'm there and his daughter a bunk up there they recognize the importance of your race and that's why they are having you on this isn't the only thing I can say is to the the people up in the ... area in northern New York in that area you this was a district that you can win it's plus a Republican\nAnd you have about thirty thousand more Republicans and Democrats in the district so you have a political edge there the key is to get the vote out because otherwise you're going to end up with a Nancy Pelosi Democrat Nancy Pelosi as speaker and that's going to be a disaster for New York I can promise you\nYeah absolutely and by the way they are raising incredible amounts of money have been talking to my colleagues all across the country to mount a money they're dumping into these racist attracted to see the voters Israeli it's outrageous to me and my opponent star outspending may\nI've always been a very independent Republican I'm One of the top conservatives in New York uh when I served in the assembly and still you know one of the conservatives but we have got to continue to stand up for our values and be able to read these elections to fight the fight because we've got a ticket to Washington\nWe gotta support the president's policies which are creating unprecedented gains even upstate New York\nWhere we have a really tough economy we are actually helping or small business community or small business humidity\nIs about Ninety eight percent of my life the businesses in my region and they create most of the jobs that says the health is alive by Nancy Pelosi that somehow the wealthiest said the only one benefiting it's absolutely false we voted to make the tax cuts permanent and the recent Governor Cuomo is suing the federal government over the tax cuts\nIs because his wealthy donors wanna leave New York because they're not getting the lifeline that they used to get there actually paying more it's all a y coming from that side and we've got to fight this is this is a tough battle because\nThe Democrats have the money to deceive voters and fool them into thinking that this guy is somehow a moderate he's not and I encourage everyone\nTo support us get to vote out its most important we can beat the wall money but we need our Republican voters to understanding each took it out but it's really really port\nAlright uh Claudia Tenney are running in New York in unimportant seat this will tip the balance of power one of our thirty seats we've identified on Hannity dot com as the main\nYou know ground zero seats that will that will literally tip the balance of power so called ... and we wish you the best things will be with us and hopefully we'll be sending you back to Congress and eleven days you deserve it and New York deserves it we don't have many good New York politicians at all\nUm by the way just going back to direct to re what he said earlier today a
