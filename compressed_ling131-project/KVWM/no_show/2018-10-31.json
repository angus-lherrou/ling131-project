country so easily and the rodeo that was expected around our polling places may not be conducted as the left wants so they're slowing down\nAnd apparently they're being turned back some of going back on their own that's the good news\nAnd uh let's see what else is going on the uh Pittsburgh thing is not over with the president is arriving in Pittsburgh shortly\nAnd the left wing anti American creeps had the nerve to make believe that those Jews these left wing fanatics of this uh bend the the arc group funded by Alexander ... speaks for all Jewish people in Pittsburgh or America it's sickening because it only stirs up anti Semitism\nBecause when you start to make believe that your small band of Marxist new world order one world order however you want to be defined you anti Americans on the left\nYou make believe you speak for all Jewish people and you don't there are many many conservative Jewish people were never heard from by the government in the media and yet what you do by speaking for the Jewish people when you don't make you believe you do is you stir up anti Semitism\nAnd yet they want you to believe that all of Pittsburgh St Jewish community doesn't want Trump to the exact opposite is true\nAnd he's on the way there and I pray to God these left wing fanatics funded by Alexander Soros\nJust cooler today and don't make a mockery of yourselves and pretend that you speak for the Jews in Pittsburgh when you get there saying are not welcome I pray to God that you just for a few minutes have respect for the dead and don't use their dead bodies\nAs fuel for your horrendous agenda against the president and against most Americans by the way\nJust give it a break for a day can you do that survivors huddle huddled in closet during synagogue attack terrible story I guess I should throw in what I said yesterday I spent three hours on this uh self defense self defense self defense self defense\nChristians Jews must learn how to use the weapons they must learn to defend themselves I Know it's a shocking thing to say in a liberal democracy like ours over we're not that kind of notion why\nYou would like not to be that kind of nation but we are\nYou need to learn to defend yourself the Israelis learned it can't just be done with love\nThey learn to have a ... in one hand and it was in the other that's why they develop the regime submachine guns\nThey learn they needed a gun in one hand so the chief rabbi by the way of Israel was a paratrooper at the time remember that store he would parachute out of a a plane into a battle zone with a machine gun in his hand in a in the Bible and the other he learned he understood what it meant\nAnd so when we're going to learn I don't know when the average liberal in America comes to understand that someone else is not going to defend you you have to defend yourself\nMaybe they wouldn't have to huddle in a closet maybe they could learn that they have to defend themselves as terrible as that may sound and if they don't want to do it then they have to hire armed guards I've been trying to warn people about this since Nineteen eighty to eighty one\nIt's only a matter of time I said you just throwing the dice sitting there like just waiting for a maniac to come in\nAnd it's happened before in the past it was um Islamic fanatics who killed Jews mercilessly chopped them up and slowing them remember the Mumbai disaster you remember that one but because it was in India you know it came in when this one hit home because it was a white man who did it a crazed Nazi type\nAnd so it fits the liberal agenda they've got someone to hate that they can hate with all their hearts when it was a Muslim who did it against the Jews that didn't fit the agenda that well and so they had to let it go a little bit they didn't focus so much on the perpetrators I mean is there is the uh the the the slaughter in the gay nightclub they didn't focus on it\nThe other slaughters they just always looked the other way because it doesn't fit the bill left wing agenda I mean it's not clear if you're looking at it with open eyes you know it's hard to have open eyes open heart with all these new stories that have taken him to do it for a living it's very difficult\nI had a tough time over the weekend after this happened it hit me very close and very hard and I brought everything that I could to the table yesterday but today we're talking about something that's entirely different\nWhich is we're not talking about so much about the gangsters hidden in the in the in the women and children in a caravan of which we know there were several everyone knows that I mean if you were a if you were a gangster how would you come into the country you hide\nWhat would you walk in Santa gangster and I want to deal drugs in America\nYou get in line with the thousands of them with the women and children you have to push the carriages in front of you and you get the ... the the American people is oh they're all just wanting to come in there all poor that's how you would do it\nSo it's slowing down on its own momentum is slowing down the momentum and that's because the president is speaking for most American people you may not notice\nForget the liars in the media who do this to incite hatred\nEvery poll one after the other no matter what the state shows that the largest majority of Americans even liberals do not want open borders they do not\nThis is a a a small percentage of radical fanatics funded largely by the billionaires like George Soros I guess I'm not allowed to mention his name anymore suddenly the victim all of a sudden if the victimizing America for all these years with all of his money suddenly he's the victim\nHe funds let's see on the far east funded black lives matter is funded occupy groups\nTo me that's not American by the way that's a quite something else and he was thrown out of Hungary\nHe's not welcome in many European countries all George Soros because he tried to destroy their sovereignty as well they can all be Nazis what every Hungarian our loves their own country as a Nazi according to George Soros they throw them out of out of Hungary for what he tried to do to that country\nThey closes universities in some countries because of the Haiti was preaching against nationalities against the nation and nationalism\nAnd then there's another thing I said yesterday that should not be lost in the ether of the airwaves it's about so called white nationalists that's the new bogeyman white nationalist just say wait a nationalist together and immediately you have a boogie man you can hate right\nIf you live in a liberal community is since I was a white nationalist white nationalist white nationalist togethers feels good when you say it doesn't it what is a white nationalist\nIs not too broad a statement white nationalist\nSo if you're white and you believe in America and America's sovereignty what you're a Nazi now so look at every cross in every war memorial cemetery you're going to see an awful lot of white nationalist and they're going back to the revolutionary war\nSee a lot of them were white most of them were white in the cemeteries as a matter of fact that our military cemetery just population was and is and the military\nJerry's as a matter of fact that our military cemetery just population wasn't is and the military was comprised largely of white people and what let's go back to World War two just for a minute\nSo most of the man who wore enlisted to fight many of them are fighting we loved America not all but many war and so they fought why well they will nationalist they loved America and they didn't want to speak German\n... simple so what they're white nationalist Joe so you know to find your terms a little clear\nWhat I mean white nationalist was it actually mean not every white person as a nationalist as a Nazi and yet to the left wing in America they've conflated the terms into having you so you can believe that anyone who is proud of the flag\nProud of the nation's history proud of the culture proud of the language is somehow a bad person\nThing very carefully

there are a problem for him\nWhat is it goes to yours is what the president is what did they do so wrong\nWail [laughter] in in my opinion ah before we got into the position where [noise]\nUh we started getting addicted to migration as a growth industry we got into the business of making lots of money in the arms industry uh there\nAh to the best of my knowledge weapons of mass destruction I think we got into Iraq on a questionable pretext ah I think that uh the way Congress hasn't been systematically ignored in\nTerms of war making powers from Clinton well going all the way back to Vietnam on\nA we have we have been ignoring the the right role of Congress in the promotion and funding of wars or I don't think that ah going back to what I said about a lobbyist I don't believe\nThe bushes work anymore immune to the effects of the Washington law firms and lobbyist then was the Clinton Administration nor the Obama administration from a policy standpoint they're they're virtually identical except in the window dressing\nExplain\nWe'll take something like a U.S Middle East policy the the background of us Middle East policy or was that the\n... the Clinton Administration uh was running a somewhat balanced approach\nA to things like the Palestinian problem at it as it was called at the time\nAnd along came the project for new American Century\nAnd the notion of regime change started making the rounds and this was adopted and uh was taken up as the right way to sort things out in the middle east uh we started attempting to change government\nAnd so far our success record in affecting regime change has been that where we've where we've gone in and actually done it we haven't really read any particular benefit and in fact we have caused some of our own problems of today\nOr even the Obama administration's policies with a Libya for one example uh have have yet to yield uh any net positive effect that I can see\nNext up Tom in Concord, California Tom let's uh

before the up and because the ATP a jobs numbers will come out but um\nYeah I I mean we're in this period where\nUm my cycles and my view of the markets has been suggesting that\nWe would have let down a some time between the first of December and the first February a and that would uh back the markets way down and uh we had the first issue of that drop on the China declined Monday\nSo this should finish up this move down as the ah the guy in North Korea or the fear about Korea worked through the marketplace where whether he's nuts\nUh I think anybody who build satanic weapons has to be looked at as little suspect\nYou know it's not exactly the the warm\nFriendly fuzzy kind of relationship builder that I like but on the other hand uh when you've been raised in a culture of paranoia and everybody in the country is a a oriented toward hating the west over a long enough period of time uh this is what we get\nAnd it's really I hate to say it but it's great for the uh the world's defense industry because it's huge\nHung in and see that's what people forget when when they read news stories they don't they don't sit back and go well if this guy lights often H bomb what does that really mean there was an article\nUh speaking of the U.S lack of success in regime change there was an article in a air force magazine Monday about how we're out of bombs\nNot entirely but getting very close to the point of rationing so you know the war on ice ... ice is a is really turning into a a major cash cow we don't have an incentive to quickly and words\nVia strategic move because they are what is keeping the global economy alive the problem with democracy or the democracy and capitalism as we uh have built it in America\nIs we absolutely depend on having continuous growth\nAnd we ... without growth of some kind\nInevitably we have a collapse of debt and that takes with it a collapse of savings\nAnd so in order to maintain the wealth of the people I hate to say it but we got to have growth in order to have growth where do you get it get it from migration do you get it from environmental works I mean that's really what\nThe the uh global warming issue is it's not really so much about global warming it's about extending government control and coming up with a new environment that tax\nAt a global level and that in turn can be ... by the make or maniacs at the top into the world government so we don't really fits together it's not a big mystery but when people read singular headlines they don't sit back and go well let's see if this happens then\nThis has to happen and if that happens then we'll have to bump up our troop levels in South Korea and we bump up our troop levels in South Korea what does that do to our ongoing presence we're looking at a semi permanent force in Afghanistan\nAnd what does that do to our worst commitment in places like NATO and in the middle east so there there's there's a huge ripple on effect and as I said before the real left wing or left a field a possibility\nIs that North Korea with an H bomb will partner up with somebody in the middle east and now we've really got her hands\nFull that's right let's go to Tom in Concord, California now is yet to hit a\nA thank you very much um I was just concerned on what you thought would be about the seemingly emergence of\nWhat I call megacities and I live in the uh San Francisco Silicon Valley area which seemingly has ... ah economic\nEnvironment which exist along with other international cities such as London or Beijing are such things I'm In a old working class neighborhood in the house next to me three bedroom two bath just sold for nine hundred and fifty thousand dollar while\nUm and it seems that certain cities uh San Francisco bay area Silicon Valley attracts the best and brightest\nI'm the median house in the city or condo is one point two million dollars and a lot of its international allies\nAnd what kind of a future is that going to report\nIf it's international law is and what kind of a future is going to portend for what we knew as America and old rust belt cities\nAnd um are we becoming just a a world of huge economic cities like London Beijing San Francisco Dubai or or things like that and where do you think that's\nGoing to head well there's a a long answer a there is a very good series of books are written by a University of Washington retired professor emeritus of economics by the name of Dr jak lead singer\nA lesson to wrote a book um that I I read and I've I've tried to jak several times a he wrote a book called ...\nOr ... years ago and and then a book that dealt with the ex urban phenomena that's one of the reasons that uh we're still out here in the back of east Texas because it's one of the few places that is still relatively inexpensive and\nIt's a big day when we see five cars on the Thirteen mile drive into town [noise]\nUm yeah and and and this is from me and I used to drive the four eighty

contrast\nUh a few of us think that holding small family farms size pieces of property is a really good plan\nA to infer family wealth in the long term but not everybody agrees with that and certainly a if you can get founder stock at a high tech company\nA yeah that's going to outperform rural real estate but for the little guys rural real estate is probably we're to be in a very short term uh I think we still have one more leg up in the market\nUh I I take this as being the last leg up before a big depression\nAnd yeah we're selling our airplane this year for that reason and it's about a real fancy airplane\nBut ah we're looking at structuring are personal uh income and expense so that no matter what happens ah we're always cash flow positive the other thing that you have to consider a in addition to the strip city and where are you going to live and\nHow much is going to cost to get around the water oil prices going to do and that whole stew or you also need to crank in what\nThe future of Social Security is a for those of us are I'm sixty seven in a month or so you're drawing you join our\nAbsolutely absolutely and and and believe me it's it's a it's not a bad thing um the

and I think that what you have is you have the ability now to\nUse digital radio to scan the frequencies more quickly a fellow by the name of Frank ... in the nineties figured out that if you hack a digital FM radio you can\nLiterally break it in such a way so that is that scans the frequency is it doesn't stop at a station when the signal comes and clear it just continually sweeps and again that\nThat's that continuous sweeping has ... ... if you do that voices and others sounds sort of a rise out of that noise\nAnd again people will write these words down that they will capture and these very quick sparse moment says it scans the frequencies and see if they can have some or attempt to have some kind of communication with was a a magic has the spirit world\nHe came up with one of his cold springs box which is ... ... exactly that isn't it\nThat's right Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful very creative um\nDevices that he made and he they became more and more complex so eventually he started to think that maybe in fact it was it spirits at all but that it was he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nPeter as you were putting together strange frequencies did you come across anything strange yourself\nWell I did some experiments and you're a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly odd but I think what was important was that I was able to sort of get into that\nHad space where I felt that I was doing something that had been\nBeing done for centuries I mean I'm I'm would like to make the argument that even somebody like John the who was using his scene stones to try to communicate with the angels and and as a result created what magicians called the ... language\nThat that you set the scene stone is the same as using radio to communicate with the spirit world that if this is something that human beings have been attempting to do with some\nMedia mystic device some material device where we take something and we read purpose that we use it in a way that it wasn't originally intended\nAnd in fact the magician or the medium becomes a kind of spiritual hacker\nWhere we're really trying to interact with our technologies and our material world in a way that some would say really is that what we're supposed to be going with it and yet as we know it's really the hackers\nThat have work early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers we probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our home [laughter]\nThat's true Peter ... with us his latest book is called strange frequencies you start to book with Jewish mythology and legend surrounding the goal and tell us about that\n[noise] yeah I mean I like to think that the goal is really the first piece of technology right where we try to build something and in the U.S with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend of the goal of as it's called particularly the goal of Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal\nIt's called particularly the goal of Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to help the Jewish people who feel um we're being attacked or there's a poll rum and they're trying to defend themselves\nAnd eventually the goal of becomes it goes you know it it it it it there's chaos ensues the rabbi can no longer control it and he has to destroy it or you have to put it to sleep\nIt one of the stories that goal and gross so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder and race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbles into dot sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories but if you look at the actual Jewish ... missed this as a mystical writings about the call them\nThe goal of them is in some ways a\nA means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their spiritual\nAccurate man it's it's almost like a test to show that they are prepared for greater mystical magical knowledge\nBut the goal in itself is was understood by the rabbis to be just kind of a dumb machine here's a wonderful tell my story where\nA rabbi go to the head rabbi and they show him the goal him and he says to them well what can I Do tend to speak and they say well no it can't speak and he says well then what good is it it's just a it's just the toy\n[laughter] which is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures right right so we can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that then we're just pretend there's to the throne as it were\nHere what about the Sherman says well you know in Native American\nTradition and other types of was a cultures the showman also seemed to be the person connected to the other side\n[noise] that's right and the Sherman would also use utilize\nSound and light off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to introduce the states have consciousness in their people and I think that what the showman does and what the stage magician does in many ways this is very connected and it also\nCan access it connects the technology to the history of spiritualism and the staging of spiritualism which spirit cabinets and the different ways in which people were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet\nBut they were using technologies to be able to create the state\nOf consciousness in the audience and so I don't think that it's necessarily well we we don't go to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to be in ... we watch it in that state of mind\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advanced I think it's something that we have long\nBeen excited about it I mean even watching a film about spirits in the movie theater is almost like a ... sure experience isn't it\nThomas Edison the great inventor was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build his own machine I don't think he was ever able to do it was you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have very interesting thing here we're we're people who are considered scientists them rationally\nAnd it stopped it they were the bunk and because they want it to just be cynical skeptical because they really want that there to be the truth is this true Houdini\nHoudini really want it to him he really wanted to find a medium who could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his eerily departed mother but he couldn't find one all he found was Charlotte but his but he believed that it could be possible\nAnd I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where\nLet's just for a moment pretend even if it's just the pretend moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves and ...\nThose are new Houdini by the way you write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on the right yes that's right ... going to be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy but as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job\nThat's right if he had today's equipment do you think he might be able to do something [laughter]\nMaybe but I think that he would also find which unfortunately I sometimes found is that people were using these things but if you sort of\nA move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraption think is most quickly try to hide the fact that maybe he really wasn't as magical as you thought\nWere going to be back in a moment to talk more with Peter a beeper goal his book strange frequencies we got a link to his publisher Random House to make it easy for you to get the book if you're into this it's a magnificent story the subtitle is the extraordinary story of the technological quest\nTo the super natural and stick with us we're going to take calls with Peter next hour will even take your stories you paranormal stories and just your general questions more to talk with him about though about strange frequencies high technology\nAnd its ability to maybe communicate with the other side\nCaused insiders who you version of that goes to goes to a a map you know available ... bone in now Android ... listen libre on demand anywhere any time going to go to ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n\nYou know Protestantism in the spirit of capitalism that something about the Protestant American Spirit is something whereby we want to\nProve our righteousness we want to prove that we are loved by God by by being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right and I think that that extends even to our sense of our own spirituality\nAnd that this idea that we are in charge of our own salvation\nWhere we want to be right in front of\nOur experience with the divine is is again something that's very human I think particularly American often\nAnd so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say you know what I'm gonna do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with the spirit or with God or divine or whatever\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something that pre existing eye opening it up and re purpose in it\nAnd so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people have practiced magic for millennium right\nJust another example of magic of\nA of a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between\nRight right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to have this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool I\nCould we put you Peter in that category\nMyself yeah well I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that um I tend to ah believe though that\nWe have to be careful about how much we try to rest that you know from it that we have to put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer them maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\nYeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it I mean there is\nYou you know why some people seem to be more sensitive to their so why some people are but\nThis goes you know back to the whole idea that we once used to think that a that a profit with somebody who had special information for us and now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so\nYou know it's a for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce art that we called visionary art or spiritual art are often considered outsider artists why is that why is that people were working with these teams considered to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular\nAre you know mainstream artistic community and I think it's we live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience\nAnd what's interesting about technology is that it and this is really key here to see if I can explain this somebody takes all radio\nAnd they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio when I'm when a ... or a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world\nBut the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to east Saudi Arabia and have another effect take place\nThe science behind that that even made this radio or something that you could find a store which said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't exist and yet we can take the things this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that\nIs underneath the scientific method and scientific understanding of the world it's\nSouthern effect and divorced and turn it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can fix about technologies in ways that that the science connected to them might actually be in opposition to\nWell if you didn't own a radio or have a computer where you could listen online and somebody came up to you and said Peter ... voices of this guy at night\nTalking about ghosts and spirit snow these strange things he's out there he's out there and you of course we never had a radio you never went on line like that to listen you're probably saying what's this guy talking about he's insane\nOr but my voice is out there and it's being heard by millions or if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to use the right kind of receiver\nWell fascinating that you say that because when\nSpiritual is or was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started developed ... telegraph technology\nAnd people called medium spiritual mediums spiritual telegraph [laughter] they really believe that there was this link between this\nThis new version and technology and how you're right it was a special and new kind of receiver and transmit her and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iraq his really augmented in shape things were spirituality and technology tell me why well\nI mean the TV itself is kind of a ... very strange and scary oh yeah it is the ... the there's a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four called the clue television company and they actually\nTeen thirty four called the clue television company and they actually they this is how they advertised on TV this is what they said\nThe dreams of witches have come true oh my God so they they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird but to increase its\nSense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether right [noise]\nUm and so the the fact that you know week that we used to call those the after effects on TV you know in the when we were used to watch you ate shepherd VHS stations with an antenna\nWe used to call those ghosts right so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically is is filled to the brim right with these supernatural on a cult metaphors and I think that that's really important I think that even when we talk about technology even if we're not believers and even if we're just\nUsing it we still use these this language to try to make sense of it\nAnd I remember those days to not that this has anything to do with our discussion tonight that's but ah ... radios televisions were built into very heavy son or to remember those\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely yep\nMy dad had an old silk all radio and this thing must have been about four feet tall and you know where was it was in case in this beautiful piece of wouldn't ...\nAnd had silicone written across it uh you know it was it was a piece of art in the same way or the TVs in in the stereos others started coming out with\nThe track these are meant to be central pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like corporate guys comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nAre you a hundred percent convinced Peter that the other side exists\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I you know I live in a very limited all place what I what I like more than anything and what I liked about this about technology is that I really believe that these ambiguous states\nAre in chanting states that when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical than somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nGet into your time machine and tell me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regards to trying to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well let's talk more about um maybe it's not that we will communicate with the other side but we will have transcended to the other side by use of artificial intelligence upload in our consciousness to computers\nThere's a movement of what's called trans humanism and\nHost humanists who believe that we will become so merged with technology that that we will become the new spirit world that it's going to be our consciousness inhabiting this electronic\nDigital realm I'm so I'm I'm more convinced that that it's going to be a that we ourselves will become transcended via this technology\nListening to the top nine Seventy Seventy [noise]\nUnder protests I'm Dave Anthony Fox News [noise]\nAnd many other demonstrators president from Pittsburgh demanding he further than

because they thought she had star quality\nThey thought she could bring her audience with her from the other network\nYeah but to her audience on the other network as a pittance to the audience that they needed NBC to be successful you don't just walk into things and\nShe said no body a no talent and not only is she has been but she is a never was so you know what ... yesterday I have to give her ... credit what does her claim to fame\nShe was very popular she had a very strong fan base over\nAt Fox when she had an opinion show and ah I don't know she she's a pretty lady there's no question men like that and and network all know that that's so I don't know\nUh what the lineup was an evening because she was on right around dinner time depending on what you're going to the right now you live under the sun and that could have been it to a dig at Hannity has a primarily male audience\nA which is coveted I'm at that age group of and that's that gender but wait let me finish\nA Megan Kelly was in a spot and I believe Bill O'Reilly came in after so that's how\nI met her she came before or after him I meant in a line up your ... that's what I said in the daily lineup not her getting to them that was already gone when she came onto network which network ... no ... no no no\nThere's three main people after dinner or the dinner hour was Hannity her and Bill O'Reilly\nOkay I'm not going to argue so that's a much and I think NBC I I Do remember reading that they would hope that she would she had a built in audience that they were hoping would follow her over to NBC\nOkay fine they were wrong completely an orderly Robbie asleep so that's all I'm saying I I don't think she ever\nI think you have to pay a price to be a good news person and I don't see any price that she paid Walter Cronkite\n... made reports in World War two out of a helicopter okay Dan Rather reported the assassination of of John Kennedy OK Frank muggy set in the shooting of Reagan\nAbout the shooting of Brady\nWas get the store or whatever that situation was when Brady was shot\nWas get the situation right on ABC News ... when they said he was dead I always earning your bones I don't think they interview somebody poorly is not getting your bones in this industry I'm Sorry\nI had a news anchor chair I always thought however that ... ... it's I'm wrong on this but that was always the most coveted seat on air in a newsroom\nI agree with your situation but I don't think she was ever named her half to or not I don't think she was ever an anchor\nI don't think that she's qualified news person in any way shape or form but you know what she did yesterday afternoon got hired because she stunk at her job and she insulted Eighteen percent of the American people\nI I don't know what okay she blamed the Fox said they had a conspiracy against her and from the day that she set foot in the NBC and the third Iraq they were out to get her and ruined her career now do you believe that for one second\nNow I don't watch a those network morning shows I watch prices right I Believe in some markets she was on up against prices right wildly\nOut he was on the today show she was on from eight to nine oh\nOkay you've found the today show so I'm usually watching another network at that time but you just don't step into a network or time slot and expect people to come to you do you think Fox cared about making Kelly the day after she left you know I don't think so either were rod and re and this is the break you [noise]\n[noise] and I feel guilty because I was laughing at the bit\nOr you know that that makes you as terrible as him apparently he had had you that I write that down please do tend to\n... I was gonna say it's tough because you know Bill Cosby what people ask me what my favorite comedians are Bill Cosby and master long form storytelling and and he was a guy for that it was also the guy for clean humor for very long time as well and\nUh you can't say that any more how dare you say that that name any more than ... it's it's interesting part of the book that what I wrote was that Democrats have set these new a social rules and and and the standards by which everyone has to follow\nA or have their careers trashed and and one of those rules as you know you can't say that you like Bill Cosby is work or even though he ended up being a terrible person\nDoesn't it seem as though oh ... ... does does it not seem as though people are completely fine was being defined as one thing\nAnd that falls into the bill Cosby thing whereas yes his work was really funny and as you said he long long form storytelling and also that he was clean about it funny funny\nBut um it it seems like people are completely fine with being defined is one thing one thing only as opposed to having many many sides\nOh yeah no I I\nI think a lot of people and and a lot of times it's that they want to play a victim you know suddenly you know um and I know that there were actual victims but what's what's really taking away from the messaging and what's taking away from a lot of uh actual problems in the country is that normal human beings but I have to keep going back to it\nGo on line now and say that they're a victim merely because someone that something and that that takes away from the actual problems than actual victims in this country\nRight\nNow who who are so you like Cosby obviously a George Carlin would come to mind and that group but we've had comics that had been one trick pony he's a guy who's like Kenny Young men are Rodney Dangerfield or guys but I mean you don't guys who made careers\nJust talk about their wives are women that have made careers just talking about their husband fang like of a building or something\nYeah you know and it's people always ask me if I if I still like a live comedy and I felt because I've seen it all now and it's so rare for something new and fresh to come along um you know it's it's you can almost predict someone's going to say by looking at them help out there and make something like that\nBut you know like a fat comical make jokes about being fat and hide behind a microphone and say oh you can't be me\nUm you know women always complain about dating and and men or men are are are always you know I'm making comments about you know like the same like the difference between men and women it's it's the same stuff over and over and over again because I think there's\nI mean I hate to say there's only a limited amount of things you can make fun of in the world uh except for politics because you can always make fun of stupid people\n[laughter] I you know I Can't disagree we absolutely love Lewis Black do you have any particular favorites\nWhile he was he's not bad you know I\nI hate to say it because a lot of people always ... me when I say this on the right it's in particular but you know John Stewart really master the make one of the new\nUm you know he he I thought he was pretty balanced for being in a admitted that he leaned left a but he wasn't carrying not as many talking points is the current host of the Daily Show and then you have a folks like Jerry Seinfeld and\nUh one of my favorite because he wasn't necessarily a comedian as much as a ... which is a a kind of more like a performance artist was Andy Kaufman who would\nFreak out audience members by doing outlandish thing\nI I saw the comedy store Andy Kaufman doing this thing where he was impersonating Elvis and I didn't stop laughing for an hour I gotta tell ya and he was a great guy and a very very funny and unique comic and I guess that's the key right there too among fortunately\nThe word unique probably

to votes into three to five\nAnd then possibly even more because our kids took the message to their friends their college classmates\nAnd some of them ended up voting as well so I'm a couple of weeks

tactic they people let me tell you what I think Mr Speaker see if you agree with those\nYou know I think the Ninety nine percent of people that were in a caravan they see America as the land of milk and honey and opportunity which we kind of take for granted sometimes as Americans and I'm sure that Ninety nine point eight percent of them are probably good people but just want a better life\nUm we can't vouch for any of those people in terms of other enemies of America that mix themselves into that group\nThe idea that we're going to have five seven fourteen thousand whatever the numbers are different estimates room everybody just get to our border in charge across a there is no respect for American law our constitution\nOur sovereignty or we don't know we need to be able to vet people I
