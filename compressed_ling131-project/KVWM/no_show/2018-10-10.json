you feel and belly again but I'm going to continue on us\nBecause I make a new point as the only major conservative TV outlet I say they're like a public utility and yet they're engaging the same censorship as Twitter and Facebook you know you can't have it both ways\nAll the conservative scream about Twitter and Facebook censoring them and their right to do so and Twitter and Facebook should not be allowed to do that why well although they're private companies they become so large and so dominant they are like public utilities and based on that argument the same can be applied to Fox News\n... because as a conservative outlet and the only conservative outlet and television\nIt is like Facebook and Twitter for conservatives is it not\nSo if they blacklist someone like me and I'm not the only one but I'm the most prominent one I Am a best selling author I'm revered by millions and yet because of personal vendettas within that company\nAnd outright fear of an ignoramus she'll never graduated high school the pretends to be a great genius and I've been told is straight up front for Twenty years he's terrified people will find out how stupid he actually is he is as empty as the as the left says about him he knows nothing\nHe's nothing but a script reader and yet he runs Fox News like a Nineteen fifties cardboard factory\nIn Brooklyn New York\nThink of a smokestack industry or a boss ran around like a little tyrant that's what Fox News has become\nAnd so therefore yeah I'm angry of course I'm angry that isolated like this of course I'm pissed off that you people who are good or easily hoodwinked by everyone who sits there were smiles at your makes believe they're your friend and they're out for America they're not out for America there are a lot for themselves\n[noise] make no mistake about it it's a business like any other and the answer to a higher power and Fox News is Eighteen percent owned by a Saudi businessmen you get the get the picture of who makes it to the Fox news or shows with or without the shoes and the legs\nUnderstand that knowledge is power without knowledge you have no power when I come back we have a surprise for you yes a real surprise and it is about stop mass hysteria it's out today\nPlease go and check it out for yourself you will not be able to walk out I guarantee you you're not be able to walk out for thirty minutes if you start reading that book\nJoined the Savage Nation coal no heat by four hundred server [noise]\nStopped George Soros and has paid agitated before they ignite a civil war in the United states remember I alerted you to borders language and culture they are trying to destroy this nation stop mass hysteria you need to own stock mass hysteria it's a history book a political book\nAmerica's insanity from the Salem witch trials to the Trump witch hunt stop mass hysteria\nGo wherever books are so the Savage army once you buy a copy of stop mass hysteria now\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollar saying some experts say another crashes coming you can't fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins an IRA from Augusta precious metals\nMy book under a this topic in mass hysteria I said that racism and bigotry have to defining parts immorality and their legality\nThe problem for progressive is is that the first is subjective and off didn't clashes with the ladder for example the bakery that refuses to make a case for gay couple when any entrenched group feels threatened by a newly formed identity be\nThey marry gays free blacks or transplant that Hispanics who don't necessarily speak the language hysteria on the local and national level is invariably that result\nHow that is manifest whether by the formation of the Ku Klux Klan or massive deportations depends entirely on the wisdom and broad base to passion of our leaders\nYou'll notice in that paragraph that's not really exactly a right wing position is\nNo not as some of the other things and and that's what I Love about you by the way is that you don't do what the mass hysteria by the way sometimes on both sides do and that is his group think enough of that already we look at each issue independently it doesn't matter whether you're a Democrat or Republican and it's so refreshing that that you do that\nWell first of all I'm an older American male number two on the phone a social worker\nI'm the son of immigrants actually to immigrants so I grew up with one foot in the old world one foot in the new tend to see things in a multiplicity of ways or through with a tally of ways and I want to I Want to close with one line actually at the book closes with a line that I Hope will be some benefit to America kind of doubt it\nAnd I write this I said one of his many scores it plays on words Benjamin Franklin set of Americans just before you fix the signature on the declaration of independence we must indeed all hang together or most surely will show hang separately does that not apply today\nAnd applies exactly to what has been happening not just with Kavanaugh in this case but with all of these smears against 'em you against other people in the media and and it can absolutely go if if for example the me too movement can also be used against Democrats of people are going to sit there and use it as a\nPolitical weapon and so it looks like the pendulum swing way too far and you're pointing out that this mass hysteria and the guillotine at the end of the day comes for everybody if that's what you if that had a revolution\nThat's right that's are pushing it seen as a thirsty blade\nIt has no political affiliation and when the left starts dropping it on the right and then the women started dropping another man they don't understand what will happen that study any revolution whether it be a lot of mouths China Soviet revolution the Bolshevik rather\nOr um Castro's Cuba after they got to killing their enemies they started killing each other struggling for power\nAnd so you know Aaron when the left has removed all the statues of Columbus as they want to do in New York\nAll the Confederate flags all the monuments to our founding fathers when books like mine I've been burned and removed from libraries when we have allowed hysterical cries to terminate or terrorize rational discourse\nAs I write we will all I've become a cop and made their and Hassan ...\nAnd those who a wreck the test them into their own infamy with the bones of others and what I mean by that is we're all potential victims of hysteria doesn't matter what side you're on and what I'm suggesting to people to listen to this broadcast and read stop mass hysteria take\nA deep breath before you vilify your enemy biggest tomorrow and maybe you\n... and learn what is happening in society today and the way that you can do that is is by the book stop mass hysteria America's insanity from the sand on which trials to the Trump witch hunts available at Amazon bookstores on Tuesday if Michael Savage thank you so much for being here on air and climb investigative radio and Breitbart\nWell thank you what a pleasure Sharon [noise]\nWell that was my interview I did it over the weekend where they are inclined to want to thank Aaron and I want to thank Breitbart one in the last\nBright spots of the conservative media out there they were not afraid to publish a review of the book or interview me as was crushed running of Newsmax stood by me stood by the movements that by the message\nBut I Want to say to you that you cannot be consistently vigilant if you're hysterical mass hysteria permits you to go along with the unlawful incarceration of people sometimes as was done with the law the unlawful incarceration of Japanese by FDR\nWhich is why it had to be done quickly you see hysteria subsides and passions app as the enemy vanishes if the government had allowed its citizens to become rabbit about Germans instead of Nazis\n[noise] uh I I meant instead of a Japanese we would have turned on ... on Dutch or Hungarians are polls in much the same way that Sikhs were targeted as Muslims after nine eleven\nBecause hysterics confused the turbans with the Muslim head dress and that's from page to hundreds of a stop mass hysteria that's for those of you who are skeptical of me and don't really know who you're dealing with and like to categorize me is what I Am not\nI'm taking you on an unprecedented Journey Through the long history of mastering the United states and I come to conclusions you would never ever predict if you want to just a predict in advance through your prejudice\nSo that's what I told you and uh\nI think we need to go on now because what we're witnessing in this country is unprecedented in almost every way\nI'd like to believe we've seen it before and perhaps we have with the red scare and in a few other times or the war of the world's bias in wells hysteria\nBut what we're seeing now where you have the pillow sees and the fines things using the propaganda tactics of Joseph ... to whip up the masses against their targeted demographic meaning the heterosexual Christian white male this is something new in history\nTo presume an individual is guilty in advance is something new in American history and by the way these women did this to cabinet in his case with impunity\n... father has been no cool to central Dianne Feinstein\nOr Blumenthal or the other inquisitive tours less far there's been no call to say turnabout is fair play we're going to demand an FBI investigation of all of these senators to see what's skeletons they may have in their closet because you see my friends once you reach a certain

to us the whether or not the message when just that simple\nNow I realize many of you are sick and tired of hearing me talk about my book I understand that but let me ask you something\nI Want to ask you a sincere question\nHave you heard about my book on it and the other esteemed conservative shows have you ever heard in the audience about Michael Savage on Fox News or any of the other so called conservative stars no you haven't\nSo I'm Alone you're alone but the message is really most important today because unless we stop the mass hysteria you will see a disaster in this nation unlike any we have seen in modern history there gunning for us\nI saw an article yesterday in Oregon and I put it on Michael Savage dot com it's a fourth down I Believe\nAnd the shocking it's a video of Soros funded anti ... took over the streets of Portland, Oregon directing traffic block\n... took over the streets of Portland, Oregon\nDirecting traffic blocking cars threatening people didn't obey calling anyone white\nA Ku Klux Klan member or a white supremacist you add militant disgusting so called feminists you had airtight whites in the streets directing cars and the way that gets worse a Portland policemen on a motorcycle sat there and did nothing\nAnd I couldn't sleep last night thinking about the anarchy that is raining in San Francisco and in Portland and in Seattle and in other Dennis ... of extreme left us um that is spreading like a cancer\nBecause of a mass hysteria where they think anyone or they've been told that anyone who opposes they're communist agenda is white supremacist\nWhat they don't understand what I Do understand is that this is a civil war that has been fueled for a number of years by Nancy Pelosi\nWho at UC Berkeley that's University of California at Berkeley like you are in a commencement speech three years ago said we're all just ruptures she encouraged people to go in the streets and cause chaos to block traffic what does she think what happened or how about Maxine Waters who should be in jail for what she's doing\nA encouraging leftist fanatics like those in the far to beat up Republicans harassed Republicans or drive them out of restaurants I refused to live in fear and I will not cower myself I'm a public figure\nOr perhaps the most prominent member of the opposition in the San Francisco area I Will not\nCower to these people I Will protect myself at all times\nI'm an old boy scout I remember the boy scout motto I Will protect myself at all times and if I feel threatened I Will react accordingly I Will not be driven out of my own city on my own home and I hope you feel the same way what began with Trump witch hunt has now spread to anyone they disagree with so of course there's no ties to the news\nYou won't see any mention of stop mass hysteria on Fox News because it really isn't news hysteria there's no history and the air what you saw against Kavanaugh that wasn't a a result of mass hysteria\nThere was a witch hunt against Kavanaugh he wasn't a pornographer all white\nMale heterosexual Christians was of course he was well that's the fact of the matter is we're living in very historical times and very dangerously hysterical times and the purpose of my book is not for me to buy a new car or a new house I have a new car and too many houses\nNo what I'm trying to do here is save America before it's too late\nAnd so I'm asking you the Savage army\nTo help me and that means have you gone to your local bookstore to look for the book was the book where it's supposed to be I have a list of where it's supposed to be in Walmart and Sam's it's in bestsellers and I heard this there\nAt the books and millions on making news table I heard it's there but I'm getting mixed answers from Barnes and noble it's a purchase to be on the new released table between the night of October which is today and the twenty second of October which is not today and I have gotten one picture after another of\nThe book not being on the new release table or buried underneath the books on the new release table so it's up to you to go there and demanded the book we put where the publisher\nOf paid for it to be put because it's probably the most important of our time in fact I Would say can you tell me about the more important book tell me which is more important right now is I don't know of one\nAnd so what happened when you went into the bookstores and what are you going to do with the book many of you are buying the book for yourself and friends to try to have a dialogue with them [noise]\nAnd that's the main thing\nDid you buy one for your liberal neighbor to read will they even read the book [noise]\nSo [noise]\nAre you taking my address and tired of paying fifty dollars per tablet\nMolly John

ten\nHe told me to take to know it has the number one cardiologist recommended form of co Q. ten are very important nutrient for healthy heart and healthy blood pressure levels ... with three times better absorption\nAnd now we're talking about my book stop mass hysteria what you found in the book stores or on a more intelligent level\nIf you've gotten the book through Amazon in advance and you've read some of it what are the best things in it\nSo here we are on the day of the launch of the book and you're not seeing it anywhere in the media because of the black lifting a Fox News which has now spread to virtually everywhere but there's some some great news on the horizon the you and for me for that matter\nGovernor Huckabee has his own show\nAnd for me for that matter Governor Huckabee has his own show\nAnd it was left off last year by those people in uh the cable world certainly Fox News dismissed him and left them off they thought he'd be marginal I've learned today that Governor Huckabee\nAnd his show has one of the most loyal and phenomenally large audiences amongst country and western Christian people\nAnd it's become as important as Fox News\nIf not more so in its own time slot wherever it is seen now last year\nGovernor Huckabee was kind enough to have me on his show at the grand old Opry houses where it was broadcast for God faith and reason in the book took off like a rocket after that\nAnd I'm going to be on Governor Huckabee show this Friday I've invited the governor onto the show to be with us today and I just got an email it can't joined me because she's prepping U.S House for the hurricane he's in the panhandle of Florida\nBut he's going to join us tomorrow granted his phone's not out from the storm and try to reach us either on the land line or on a cell phone again we want to thank Governor Huckabee for standing with the American people in these dark times especially in these times of media blackout some remember he's been\nHe is himself has been a ... a blacklisted by many many in the media and written off and\nHe rose from the ashes like a Phoenix as I Hope we will do as well on the Savage Nation\nThere is no hysteria out there and none whatsoever the Washington Post says it's not hysterical or Marlboro not at all judicious timing I Would say well I Would say so many of my loyal listeners understand uh the timing of mass hysteria is perfect right now and we're talking about that\nBut we're talking about the news in the day so Haley resigns and immediately later in the afternoon reading right now we hear that Trump is floating the idea of a Goldman Sachs banker unnamed Dina Powell to be the new UN ambassador\nYou say well what's wrong with that\nDidn't we elect Donald Trump to clean the swamp\nDidn't we elect Donald Trump to not be a global is to not appoint global lists to high places I seem to recall that was his campaign slogan\nRight nationalism America First can you explain to me how Goldman Sachs and a woman who works for Goldman Sachs representing us in the UN is America First name looks plane that to me do you think that threatening war with Syria or Russia\nPuts America First I don't think so and as I said to you and the reason in my opinion that Haley suddenly resigned is because she failed to ignite a war with Russia by bombing Syria about four or five weeks ago when she was beating the war drums I don't know if you remember her speeches one bellicose speech after another\nAnd threatening one day after the other\nSo here we are now they're saying oh well maybe we'll put Goldman Sachs is Dina Powell and they have to replace Haley to me it confirms everything I've been saying now she worked for this government she was working in the administration and she left\nAnd it says Dina has done a great job for the minister action has been a valued member of the Israeli Palestinian peace team well here's your problem\nHere is your problem\nAnd at the risk of igniting the write\nIn directions I Do not want to ignite the right I Will leave out my belief as to who is pulling the switches on this particular situation in the United nations you can't really blame them\nI mean if you were the tail and you continue to wag the dog for so many years and suddenly the dog said look enough is enough we don't want the tail wagging us you'd be an angry tail wouldn't you or am I speaking an allegory is that are too complex for the average Fox News viewer\nWhat do you think about Haley's resignation do you agree with me that she resigned because she failed to ignite war with Russia\nShe was put there specifically to ignite meaning to drag the U.S military and\nTo attack Syria and Russia look it's a very complicated game the middle east\nAnd you have to have a mind as complex as mine to even understand that otherwise you could just sit here and salute and say she was great because she's on our side that's the easy thing to do she was a disaster and the reason she's out as because she didn't she did not\nSucceed at what she was put there to do which was to ignite a war that would have dragged us aircraft if not troops into Syria forever that's what she wanted to do and that was so that there would be a buffer between Iran\nAnd the other forces that are aligned against Israel and I can't blame Israel for that and not at all\nI mean if you're Israel and you're a little nation surrounded by enemies of course you want to do what you can to defend your own people\nBut I Would say that America First means America First not America second for any reason that's my point of view and I'm a devout Zionist that happens is I'm twelve years old\nAnd a great supporter of Israel but you know what Israel has the most powerful military in the middle east it's time they used that instead of using a uncle Joe you know I'm sick and tired of America dying for other other people's wars and I'm not alone in that that's why Trump was elected he was elected to keep us out of foreign wars not bring us into them\nBut I guess you all forgot that\nAnd on a personal note we know that Trump is surrounded by several factions as are all presidents\nOne of the factions are global lists like Nikki Haley like moustache Leo\nAnd then there are other factions who are nationalist and they vie with each other for the president's attention and then he makes the decisions obviously that's why he's the chief executive well he didn't listen to the global is who wanted him to launch Tomahawk strike against Syria\nFour weeks ago Haley was literally drilling drilling she was on the verge of success our greatest success ever of igniting a war and it made no sense to me\nNone whatsoever\nISIS had been beaten back into one city ... whatever it is\nAnd Russia thank God for Russia and\nSyria and our own warplanes ISIS was beaten back into this one city and in order to make sure that the Syrians and Russians didn't go in the clean out the remaining elements of ISIS in that city\nThere were talks that Saddam was going to unleash chemical weapons on his own people which made no sense whatsoever none\nI mean you're winning a war of the whole world is watching everyone as an iPhone you can unleash poison gas on your own women and children who would do that who would believe a story like that other than idiots who went by a story like that and I kept saying this weeks and weeks ago don't do it don't do it don't do it\nI sent message after a message to the White House whether they were receiving them or not I don't know I I Know they received them\nAnd they know one thing about the Savage Nation so long as I'm Still here as long as I still have a loyal audience which I Do you are the base that elected Donald Trump not the Johnny come lightly none of them elected Donald\nSo are the base that elected Donald Trump not the Johnny come lightly none of them elected Donald Trump you did\nAnd now that I've said that I'm going to say something else so it's not lost to history I Will rest knowing and my family knows and they're pretty bright people\nThat it was I who helped push Donald Trump into the public eye and pushed him over the finish line he even said the same thing to me put his arm around me and said without this man I wouldn't be president I Am proud to tell you that I have saved the western world\nFrom the total insanity that they wore and

are farmers in Hawaii and World War two there were very few or treaters as I recall historically but there were some\nI Will still frequent the Chinese restaurant every once in a while it's great food [laughter] let's go to Las Vegas Hey Tom thanks for calling did they have you with us\nAh there's already been three explosions that chemical plants in China I Believe what we're already performing a covert operations\nThe gas line explode or just yesterday morning and took down a landslide a on top of all these industrial type buildings where people are slating\nOur companies are there and making money and they can't trust our bankers so they started their own bank\nAnd that's what Hitler had to do is start his own bank but but actually we still financed Hitler the Bush family the union bank where real good at financing wars and financing rebels with arms were in the Ukraine were all over the place where only the middle east\nAnd what a real good at these stabilizing nations are financially and then we'd like to start wars I think were the culprits [noise] [noise]\nA lot of people think we could be the culprit David a that's a different issue that's not part of your book but it's a problem\nWell I think that's a that would definitely be the way the Chinese would present themselves as the stabilizing force before that operates against the traditional way of life before that or is against the Asian people\nAre at a fourth the uh brings disturbing a current uh like\nFeminism and democracy to traditional societies\nThe same from their point of view these can be very threatening\nAlways wondered when some company country is going to see enough is enough folks I mean you've been in Afghanistan you were in Iraq God Knows where else you're going enough is enough good that'd be a catalyst for war\nWell it certainly was with Iran worsening their rainy and revolution or they were they were reacting against uh against our our repression of their movement toward democracy and are the imposition of a of the shah\n... unfortunately it took a very ugly turn with the Islamic ... a\nResolution but in the beginning it was a democratic revolution\nAll that is true did we did we not\nGetting it was a democratic revolution\nAll that is true did we did we not in somewhat support the ayatollah or when he was in Paris\nMm I'm not privy to that\nLet's go to Rochester New York Keith is with us on coast to coast hey keep go ahead\nYes sir I have two points militant Islam is different from any other end them in the world uh people should know that during World War two one third of our combat troops\nIn Europe had German heritage in them so that was mentioned about the Chinese\nOr whether it's any at ... ... ... different from any other threat they really mean to destroy us and they might even welcome a nuclear Holocaust\nAnd add a stairway to heaven et cetera so that has to be looked at Penn or even if I didn't get the bomb they could still play off the superpowers\nSecondly mad neutral issue construction was meant to even up to score with a country like China does have superiority and manpower and the Chinese would happen no we would never let go of our\nSovereign country but we would use nuclear weapons but my final point since World War two is now Seventy years behind if we don't have many of us living memory of the horrors that Japan went through when they were at\nA in your book faint people that it's going to happen to be reminded that ... nuclear war is different from any other war and combining that with Islam if we go nuclear that is pretty much at the end of earth\nWell there's always that possibility Yeah David you know if you've all countries started you know launching new Pakistan\nIndia China U.S Russia each over\nYeah it would be the votes to men disaster we could ever bring on ourselves I totally agree\nAnd you know there is that is has scared us so far from beginning World War three um what what the danger is\nIs if smaller countries with a smaller nuclear weapons are and the last um shall we say less rigorous command and control fifth governments\nBegan getting into little scrap um we may see regional nuclear war now these regional nuclear war of could grow\nA I'm more concerned about the reach of all the theater nuclear wars than I Am about major nuclear wars between thermal nuclear power\nRight yeah I don't have any doubts that the king is young ... would would launch somewhere oh\nNo no doubt whatsoever the guy's mad\nYou sure is ... ... ... what can be done to avoid this in your opinion [noise]\nUm the war with China yes oh okay\nWell let's see I think the first the first thing we need to do is look to our alliances um China plays a very long game you can look at what happened in the pair of fell for Nineteen Seventy four the carousel islands\nIn Nineteen Seventy four we had pretty much left the south Vietnamese on their own or the Chinese saw an opening and moved into the ... and actually fought a battle with the south Vietnamese to take over the pair of cell Iowans and they did\nAnd the north Vietnamese sort of grudgingly acquiesce but they never ran out their claim to the carousel Ireland now the Chinese occupiers\nBut what the Chinese did was they were thinking many decades ahead at what they perceived was a vacuum of power the U.S was withdrawing nobody was backing up the Vietnamese at that point the southern Chinese move there [noise] um okay the next step is the Philippines\nThe Philippines ask us to leave to be back\nThe Philippines ask us who um who leave the area and let them defend themselves okay great but they don't build up their armed forces\nAnd therefore the Chinese feel free to move into this proudly island there's a power vacuum again the Chinese are thinking way ahead in the way we'd be heard of that is to build up our alliance structure again we build up our allies we make them more powerful we go for a mess we engage with our allies\nWe build up our reading math\nI think you are brilliant David I really do I mean you should be part of our foreign policy somewhere some administrative should should gobble you up\nWell now I'm going to say something it probably some of your listeners are not going to like I think we should ratify the UN a convention on the law the seat and\nI think a lot of your listeners are going to say oh it says he went in front of it therefore we shouldn't be a part of it well the problem is that for you and I'm convinced come out in the law to see is what we are relying on the couch China that they have no claim to these island\nAnd it's difficult for us to say you guys are not complying with a lot to see what we haven't signed a law to see\nRight we need to find that because if we are going to enforce the law we need to be party to the law so I can understand their reluctance to sign some un agreements but I think this one would be in our interest\nThat's a good point where do you get the book tipping point\nTipping point is available but any bookstore any online bookseller it's for the book it's a hardcover book\nAnd it sounds like you really took some time putting this together when can we expect the next one\nIt takes me a year to write the so the next one will be called um onslaught and it will be out next December\nAll right stay with us we're going to come back in a moment David\nAnd take final phone calls here for you as we talk about the novel folks tipping point the war with China the first salvo and are those of you who have been on hold just hanging there we'll get to you as soon as we get right back\nOn coast to coast am and don't forget to like us on Facebook and do follow us on Twitter\nDo we get too much or TV shows beyond belief we ...

beginning to signal back to see the thing with um\nThe uh the period where we were sort of trying to get along is over the period where we were we were trying not to pick them off is over the period of alliance building has been gone and the period of ... behavior is beginning who's the aggressor\nUm who's the aggressor I have to say if China are it really has to be China\nUm the way that they are pushing forward into peaceful areas and establishing claim that they really have no claim to is simply a land grab\nA sometimes into the ground but basically it's a land grab they're attempting to

and they had Cam Ranh bay for a base and Russia doesn't really have any allies in that area they have no basis in that area there may be much smaller or they don't have that drew a fair anymore and their economic base is much smaller who\nDo you think China's saying okay the United states can worry about the middle east Russia's worried about trying to get their old Soviet Union nations back

and now they're pushing pushing the envelope\nNear ... they're coming up against Japan and that will be interesting yes\nAs we see Japan is discovering I wouldn't say a new militarism exactly but they're they're discovering a backbone\nWill we go to China's aid if I've to a Japanese Japan's aid if China gets aggressive\nOh I definitely think so we're committed to South Korea and we're committed to Japan of if we left them in the lurch I mean nobody would think a lot of us\nDo some argument David about whether we should be the policemen of the world\nThat's really that's really one

favorite oil and at the moment ah is that he has what's called the length and Dr him\nAnd he didn't call it that his enemies in Congress are calling at that and his belief is that if a if his ship has the capability to shoot down a ballistic missile right a weapon of mass destruction then you have the moral duty to shoot it down\nNo matter who fired at right now that's\nA pretty big chunk of that really does make the U.S the world's policeman and there's some question in Congress and really in my mind to as to what extent we can commit to that we have the power to back it up because we have the will to back it up or do we have the right to do that\nThose are all good questions and those are those are really why I write I I don't write just to entertain I also like to entertain ethical

Georgian David a show um a a you had very few callers I notice last hour and so uh I've had that kind of modify my original comments in the context of the flow\nAnd I'm going to go out there as in our planet for example I'm I'm curious to know how factual is it a if indeed it is factual as I've heard John several speculation belief that\nWe have nuclear silos for example that were shut down and

plus he's he states that uh we will not be in a loud to engage in nuclear slug fest as it were what do you think about that\nLet me let me answer those David because that might be out of your

Tim Walz Tim where these things coming from\nWell it's the hurricane season this is perfectly normal what's what's unusual about this one accord likely moving north\nA pattern that we've talked about earlier programs about north or south flow at it when we see a category they're predicting because they all over and made sure because of the fact that they use but the important thing but they're on a lower pressure than foreign\nWhich means the search will be a bit higher but the other important thing is getting a a coastline is very shallow and what's been happening over the last six out here the Gulf of Mexico code is a is dropping down into the levels right in there\nBecause of the weight of the I can offer so they're they've been putting this including the level right but no it isn't it the whole coastline there the other problem that they got it that uh the the land that\nIt was lying there the other problem that they've got is that uh that the land or that the work is going to go over is already saturated so normally most soils couldn't take about six inches of rain before they come\nSaturated you get flooding but these are already ... to ... so that's a little bit problematic but the other thing and of course is that the cold air pushing out over the center us right now will prevent as hurricane going too far inland\nHurricane season ends the end of November doesn't it

investment banker with UPS in New York His world view has been turned upside down in the late to two thousand sixteen period when he was exposed to world changing science\nWhich suggested that country the mainstream assumptions consciousness has not produced by the brain now after researching extensively he wrote this book in the end the upside down thinking to introduce all of us to these cutting edge ideas and your use on coast to coast I've got this really shocked you initially mark didn't it\nAbsolutely shocked me thank you for having me on\nI'm looking forward to this too I always ask questions of gas scientists and people who are experts on the brain dodge consciousness exist outside of the brain or not now the pure scientists Joe the medical professional folks mark would\nAlways say you have to have the brain in order to have consciousness in the brain dies it all goes with it and I've always thought now there's something else here which consciousness you finally found out did you\nI did and I I was very squarely in what's known as the material is science camp which\nSuggests that the universe is fundamentally native matter there was a big bang about Thirteen point eight billion years ago killing the universe with physical material that we call matter and when you have enough matter in this big universe you're bound to get interaction between those pieces of matter we call that chemistry\nWhen you have enough random chemical reactions you're ... you're bound to end up with\nA self replicating molecule like DNA chance says that would happen and DNA leads to the evolution of living organisms like a human being the human being developed the brain and consciousness awareness comes out of the brain that the perspective\nAnd if you buy into that which I used to you then when the brain dies consciousness dies memories are gone\nThat when you think about meaning in life\nIf you take the material is perspective very strictly there can't be any meaning because once one dead there's no memory there's no consciousness and that the prevailing perspective as you mentioned in in our science and most of science today\nNow looking at your bio I Would lose money in a bet saying that you would write a book about consciousness showing the heck did you do this\nSaying that you would write a book about consciousness showing the heck did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter]\nIt was about two years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally material is that is what I Would call it now in hindsight\nBut I I randomly stumbled across a cast that started talking about these ideas I was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the queue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had and at the end of that her name is Laura Powers\nShe mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers\nAnd I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula and I listen to different episodes and people there were many different people have talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities utility for consciousness to survive bottle he got things I had no familiarity with\nAnd over time just hearing enough different people describing similar perspectives on reality I got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real\nAnd this was a very jarring and disorienting realization for me because I thought life was meaningless and here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer consciousness maybe the brain more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that processes consciousness\nAnd the identity that we have is not tied to the body\nSo that totally freaked me out and uh changed my world view completely led me down the path of intense research because I Need to rethink all have reality spent about a year of basically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in financing consulting\nAnd as I was doing that I told friends overtime at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish but once I I got a hold of the research I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive and these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity with the topics\nUm and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight\nSo after hearing enough of this feedback and also seeing that I had intense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened\nSo it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend and I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco and decide to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days\nAnd ended up writing more than half of the book that's now out\nAnd then finished over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript\nAnd ultimately a cold email bill Gladstone who is now my agent at my publisher multiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents that car totally\nAmong the perfect meal Donald Walsh a and so that's where we are\nSuper now what did you mean by an end to upside down thinking\nI consider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness\nWhat I now see to be the more likely picture of reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing yawn space and time so instead of saying we get we start with Matt or end up with consciousness\nConsciousness comes first\nRight with out to bring those consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests\nNo word science back us up\n[noise] so my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggests that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body so one example is chapter nine\nI talked about near death experiences\nIf you'd asked me a few years ago with a near death experience I Would have said well isn't that just to host nation that happens when someone is about to die in like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described in the near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness it's not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as they've ... out of body experience so the person is out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back into their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that is suggestive of some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website marked blue bird dot com is linked up for you at ... dot com the name of his book we're talking about in into upside down thinking I read the subtitle dispelling them is that the brain produces conscious this\nAnd the implications for every day like we're going to take phone calls next hour with mark and I'm going to come back we'll talk with them about\nSound like a nieces cognition to love to see how that all works outside of the brain and what's causing [noise]\nDuring the ... page with thousands of members ... connecting with other ... to ... dot com slash goes to goes to him and put too much but [noise]\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before ... the pre cognition tell like as a cycle ... you you of course mourned the little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research the new\nYeah absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science and controlled study that haven't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about telepathy what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation my aunt who was a psychiatrist at the time new voted her entire career to investigating telepathy and uh she came she came out with some ... things but what did you find\nIt yeah I thought that he's a very important phenomenon it's it's mine too mine communication and just taking a quick step back\nThe reason that I then each of these phenomenon is that I reason that the material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain\nThat perspective cannot account for things like ... the and the other things will talk about and I read them that if any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture does work\nSo weaponry to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns felt experiment and the basic design is as follows and I should say that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter and when you combined the results\nThe statistics are very compelling mhm doctor dean rating who just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called six sigma\nSix sigma refers to statistical odds against chance when you get a six sigma result the odds of it that the effect is just happening by chance is more than a billion to one and in telepathy we have six sigma results\nThat the gun thought experiment the study has one person in a room we'll call him Bob it very very relaxing state listening to relaxing music there's another person let's call hurricane who's in another room\nJane has given a picture by the experiment yours and the experimenter state game I Know that sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally sent\nA picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room the gate is mentally sending this image to Bob Bob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what picture game was looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all at Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent right\nNow will be the ... the law probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials but instead it's closer to thirty two percent\n\nSo from a statistical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect is twenty five versus thirty two this is massive statistically it's suggested something is getting through and it actually conforms to our common sense our everyday experience because\nIf we were one hundred percent ... then we would know each other's thoughts all the time sure is that it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they execute where they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two versus twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nWhat could increase ... percent mark is at the center or the receiver\n[noise] this is something that that needs to be explored much more ah but what we see with\nPeople who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a have had been involved in the U.S government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and people who are better meditate or ... seem to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI've always wondered though if somebody is really tuned into certain things if they can pick up all kinds of different events without really having the sender having much to do with it\nI I I think that the receiver\nMight have a better effect in changing the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... ethic or communications with the deceased through medium ship these are people that tend to be picking up information and if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's it's helpful metaphor where\nThere's a consciousness that not localized to the body those who are able to better configure their antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular center or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver the person in the room and simply not show them any of the four pictures but they just had to tell you what they think she sent to them\nWhat do you think would happen\nWell well I think\nWe'd have a distribution first of all we had just an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic then we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw at the U.S government uh but if it's an everyday person I think it would be it the more difficult study to examine because the effect is so small\nWell let's talk about the U.S government studies and the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\n\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me on the program is sometimes referred to as Stargate Program and your use psychic spies for national security purposes\nMany of marine I've been on this show by the way\nUp\nThe Cold War and and the people who were involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many reviewers who are involved to say this was a real so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real I'm\nIn my book I I have some documents from the CIA which had been declassified recently and the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically telepathy\nYou can only and the phenomenon that that was being studied with typically the telepathy was won by remote viewing is the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes\nIt sounds completely paranormal consciousness is localized to the brain but if consciousness is non local then it's at least conceivable\nDocument\nUm say explicitly and I am looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon\nThis is from a declassified documents that has been released recently [noise] so I mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that in my business world if I had a consulting case for example that's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me at least made me question things\nUm even further than that there's eight page on a science and all and there are some very credible people including someone from Cal Tech the next page in the document says science panel's report principle findings either direct quotes implications are revolutionary\nEvidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we have looked at these uh tell a path to studies\nAnd I've always wondered\nIf the government really never stopped doing it but continued now I've asked some of the people who've been involved in these studies\nThat just that same question and they said no it stopped because they would have kept us on they would have used us I'm not sure what the government has found other people and they've continued these kinds of mine studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used\nTo find a downed Russian bomber in an African jungle that they couldn't find so there was some utility to the program whether it was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful\nSo you'd have to think that if if it were a useful thing to be doing that a organizations would be trying it\nPre cognition mark the very valuable tool for people in their life because of the ability to sense things make decisions based on those gut feelings and to react to them now a lot of people don't react\nThey don't do it it's something happens when they go oh I should have done that and I I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre cognition\nSo there are some studies which show a very subtle pre cognition known as ... sentiment where the bodies sensing something very subtly and we need to stick to ... to show it before something happens\nAnd there are other examples where it's much more explicit where a person has a dream known as a ... dream the dream something and then the next day it happened exactly as they dreamed it\nThat much less subtle but if we go to the pre sentiment studies this is where I think it becomes very compelling again if we look at the meta analysis of all the statistics\nThat basic design is as follows it it reverses what we look at in psychology typically and in psychology the typical study is you show someone a picture let's say at the neurotic image or a violent picture\nWe know that the body will unconsciously respond to it though the skin response the pupils dilate the brain and the heart respond\n\nListening to talk nine Seventy Seventy\n[noise]\nBefore paying a

Lee dissipate by then there's no chance that by that time\nThere's cross the border and goes in Georgia and gets into places in South Georgia\nAnd maybe within two hundred and fifty three hundred miles of Atlanta this will be down to a category one storm\nAnd probably by the time that it gets to the south Carolina border probably a tropical depression we would expect that to happen about uh twelve hours after landfall\nAnd so about nine eleven o'clock tonight at low tide\nWill probably see this cross over from the Georgia area into the Carolinas and probably be out to sea hard to say it depends how much turns to the right\nYou know one guy his land you will see this thing make a band it makes a very big band in might hit like Savannah Georgia with a lot of rain\nCharlestown against South Carolina Myrtle Beach ... than those areas ... that got hit by Florence very heavily will be hit again but the problem ... of that happening is not likely at this time\nThis is a rainstorm that will probably go right through the middle of Charlotte oh dear\nBad that's all they need yeah they are trying to clean up from a Florence yeah\nOnce again we have seen something interesting in this uh this presidency and that is that somebody can leave seemingly under bad terms and then you still be around and still be a friend\nI wouldn't be interested in knowing Donald Trump doesn't know what that magnetism is that brings people back into the Web\n... and we're talking about the former governor of New Jersey were talking about Steve Bannon we're talking about uh Sean Spicer\nI think what I recommend armored asked for every four Republicans at wonder what difference is that election was going to make or wonder how Trump would govern\nLast night you saw the sixty nine [noise]\nA judicial

shaped the judicial branch strict construction is this is a huge\nHuge win for this president and it is galvanized Republican headed into a key mid term election what the president and Kavanaugh did win galvanized Republicans there was a massive enthusiasm gap favoring Democrats [noise]\nThirty days out this has made sure that every single Republican understand the difference of a Republican Senate and a Republican House versus one controlled by Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi has tightened\nRepublicans are now out they're not as much we've got close races in places like Indiana\nFlorida,

court system as he said Seventy new judges at very high levels including two\nNew Supreme Court justices yes ... appointment mhm oh within a fairly short period of time goes to use\nThe once again here Sean Spicer\nHave picked this guy when he was down\nAnd I didn't say twenty to thirty I said twenty eight the normal is thirty\nOh\nI was now I usually pay fairly close attention to the daily barometric readings about twenty nine points yeah nine something and early average if it ... there's it I've people with arthritis tend to notice things like that it's you know you keep an eye on the barometer of\nWhat would you can sit in the end you see there there's low pressure low\nWhat would you can sit in the end you say there there's low pressure low barometric pressure and yet I ... and what would you consider that what would it be and what would be considered low\nProbably right now where the category for hurricane you're probably talking barometric pressure in the eye of the storm itself at about twenty seven point five three and that's middle of bars\nOf mercury as opposed to the barometer were just inches of mercury so you have to\nDo that a holy training before when he was you know I don't want to get the math for that okay but um so so that would that be considered low pressure very low about literally about Ninety in other words your body weight would change about ten percent\nThat much yeah because that's quite a bit because literally the pressure on you is about ten percent less\nThan it is normally like I said the average barometric pressure in the United states I Believe it was about twenty three point eight ... no I'm Sorry twenty nine point eight three\nI'm twenty nine point eight three inches of mercury that's about the norm barometric pressure okay okay um it goes as low as maybe twenty nine point five may go to thirty points\nTo er thirty points to a very early small window unit so when you're going down to four\nPoints that center drawn literally talking about changing the force of gravity\nNow obviously the wind is blowing a hundred miles an hour or in this case to hundred and Seventy miles an hour so the gravity field is going to change any way but there's less gravity literally\nKind of makes sense okay now in the storm itself yeah is it possible because it's a moving changing the entity\nIs it a ... is a is it possible to measure the air pressure within a storm sell like oh yeah yeah they are even though it's moving and changing and is there a higher or lower pressure the lowest in Russia in the rye\nThat would be the lowest park okay because that's literally this cone ethical shape that everything just milling around oh okay and so it's swirling around once again in ... and it just the lowest\nPortion for for the lowest relative humidity also because of the draw\nA storm is wet renter dry okay so you're talking about the eye of the storm probably being right now I'm looking at the latest radar\nWhich was as a twenty minutes ago looks maybe to be the eye of the storm maybe five miles across\nSo in the dead not the center because it's not actually in the dead center because the storm the forward edge as much bigger than the tail and yes but at the high you're\nTalking about\nA five mile radius but once again the storm is moving at fourteen miles an hour right now mhm so you're talking about even if you were in the complete bred up that high\nYou would only be in it for about ten to twelve minutes and then it would move on\nIf you were traveling at if you were standing still oh oh okay right it would move fast based on the rate at it we didn't have his own now you and about\nTen to Fifteen minutes I most okay and that would be at absolute most and even at that point you would begin to feel when on both ends a man and when it came out yes but this guy is probably about five to eight miles across\nInterest which is pretty concentric circle that's a pretty tight I I Would imagine Florence when she hit land was probably twelve to Fifteen miles cross\nWhich is much bigger but she was a much bigger storms mhm maybe sense of about a thousand miles across every one is allowed three hundred and fifty miles across so everything is smaller certain if you want\nStay out of it and drive carefully or don't drive at all you can leave the area now it's too late were rod and rainy and this is a very usa

I was taken for granted I was just loader I'm\nAnd I'm Sorry I think the Obama administration of wasted almost two years on putting together a terrible health care bill and now we are worse off than before\nObamacare was put in Las Vegas for the most part and there are certain ...\nGo ahead no you know the biggest problem I have with that health care bills simple he never mentioned that before the election that that was going to\nBe his baby they wasted a lot of time we had to not to say that we don't need comprehensive health care in this country we are behind the curve or in any industry of any industrialized nation but uh\nThe ... some of the provisions like be pre existing conditions those kinds of things have to be in place were only as strong as our weakest link\nAnd win the majority of the people begin to become the weak weakest link and only the wealthy survive well it's it it it was our nation becomes intrinsically weaker\nAnd the saddest part about that bill was first of all that bill ended up being two thousand pages long here's K.\nAnd the fact that the fact that the senators and the representatives never read it themselves they gave it to their aid to read because they knew they wouldn't get through the whole two thousand pages supply all the time they had a vote\nThe worst thing or the worst part of Obamacare was that\nBasically the legislation was handed over\nA to the health care industry to make the rules it was the you know the ah a wolf guarding the hen house so of course they were going to make provisions that that suited them that benefitted them the most it's worse now\nWe're in health care than it was prior to the\nTruth is once again it would have said there's a thousand times on the show probably since then that was not a health care bill it was an insurance bill yes yes and those two things are not\nThe same and it's so sad that we have to make some of the most important issues of our time into political footballs I it's it's such a disservice and the American people when we need a\nI don't see something uh as as much of a commodity as health care should be bantered about and just kicked around\n... dying people can't\nCan't get health care and they like to eat and once again\nThe decision was not made by the people that I elected but by the people that they hired read a piece of paper for I'm not happy about

a trust needs to be built with those employees or key employees that would\nUm but you will delegate to otherwise those particular tasks are not going to be done that way you wanted or you're just going to double check and triple check up on them\nAnd kind of micro manage them which leads to a\nSlippery slope [laughter]\nYes yes yes here's I Would think in this day and age though one of the hardest things is has got to be finding people you can trust and is do you have a way of kind of weeding out the ones you can from the ones you can have you been successful with that\nI have but it's it's not as soon as you mentioned uh I think there's a yeah I think the first step in\nIn any owners or or any CEO that leads a company or you have to ah take a personal journey with yourself to understand\nWhat is your purpose in this whole world ah both personal and professional men you have to build a company or work in a company that has a similar purpose\nOr to have that alignment that's very important ah and when you hire\nA as well as motivate existing employees it's all about referring back to that particular purpose this is the the why it's basically why we do\nWhat we do why do we come to work and you know and I think the reason sorry\nNowadays with the age our directors being so prominent in most businesses I think a lot of good boss is don't even get to talk of the best

was all media leaks\nStrategy so that when they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of things have reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was the page and struck we're talking about and it seems we got our answer now\nWell you're right I think not only were they licking an arid of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this you know we're we've got actually a memos that\nHave been subpoenaed testimony that there are a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet\nThey knew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media could not be substantiated I\nI Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead and I'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein read the five application any side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony is chilling\nThe amount of documents that they failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well\nDidn't they mail read them do we know they failed to read them or they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here\nI'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed that out that the bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warrants\nThat that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated they'd never verified they never corroborated any of the steel ... of this is Christopher steals\nYou know dot CA and as a result was used as the bulk of information\nDeals you know dot CA and as a result it was used as the bulk of informational pain the war ends and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell they they that's correct that's not even a steel and Simpson believe all the things that were given to Bruce or but here's the other
