I was like in a magazine so happy and attention but like I heard the lady\nThat get him out of it may have been but a ... you know good smile or what have you found out what your hair yeah kind of changes things no actually kind of gave him some cool points out oh you know maybe a couple points are held out the window now yeah so I'm fairly well and I'm\nSo there was a there was an older lady that was doing the checkout and there was a girl probably like Fifteen or sixteen she was back in the south and everything and I kind of like faint we heard what they were talking about and then I was like surely they're not talking about the whole paper like at you know\nAnd I'm sure enough for the lady goes hey smelled is like why does he put the whole paper in front of ... and you smell this lovely like lavender kind of smell is if you'd like she didn't open it you know it will cover thing you know I mean even like small coffee you know\nAnd I'm so of course the guys like at a man and she said it went into a paper and I went and looked at the guy and as possible and\nYou know that smells quiet ... and I said real men you sense of toilet paper and he got so red of course the girls are laughing and you know I just file set it and\nI you know he looked at me he goes I'm very picky about my toilet paper you know very serious and I thought there punch line and hear coming you know like that's what I've said it's not mine I was like without he's serious he is really serious about it and I think just took us back\nBut I was like this needs to be a commercial right now because the fact that like this ... Georgia southern boy that like is very you know like I Am I just don't have already going to say about it to these three women there like you know there's I couldn't stop laughing but\nSomething like that happened and I thought you know what this is the really good marketing thing going on with the whole thing\nWith a they could be yeah that'd be a it could be um\nAnd I learned something new there I had no idea that ... paper\nI well I think there's a reason for that\nWell it worried me I thought okay a God Knows what their sense of toilet paper and I don't know about this this is there something wrong with\nBeen brought to you by north when pioneer college\nSave big bugs along truck [noise] what are you doing you said bucks hits their season is it money dollars oh those kind of bucks [laughter]\nIs this month the big bucks on drugs at hedge Toyota the White Mountains number one ... is loading up on savings one over one hundred new Toyota Tacoma in ... in stocks seeds six thousand bucks\n[noise] put it down as porch sorry you know Yes sir\nPlease up to six thousand dollars on a new one of the Eighteen hedge Toyota Tundra four by four or five your price only thirty two thousand seven hundred may also qualify for a PR is as low as ... percent for up to six months say big bucks on drugs at hedge Toyota the northern Arizona ...\nToyota dot com keeping do White Mountains rolling\nOver twenty six years and wishing you as the sun and enjoyable do season\nAnd others will catch the last one I don't do much for them to tell your financial overcharged for anyone [noise]\nFifteen sixty four\nSo Rubio users dies tiger on KBA WN ... radio\nDot com or you can send us comments or the news talk radio on my\nWay but\nHave\nThat welcome back to the ... you know if you have any questions a new on us and that's something and you know safely insure on the air you want to bug father [laughter] not me for that and ran a business name and everything else\nUm [noise] you can learn more about that does the worship dot com or you can send over your questions to actually it doesn't seem to show dot com [noise]\nAnd of course we're on Twitter and all that fun stuff to are we with a father would say yes with us up saving airs on um you know speaking of uh we last week we were talking about copyright and trademark and all that stuff and everything we asked you know sending some stories of you know maybe something happened with you because one story\nAnd it's not exactly about trademarks and copyright but this one person apparently hire a lawyer um because they had a pretty bad\nUm shall we say operating agreement between each other it was two men that were working at two members of the [noise]\nAnd um to basically in a nutshell put it this way is they had a small agreements that they found the very beginning which really didn't have anything on it and they really really important in a written agreement shall we say you know it's kind of other things like yeah we got one\nBut nothing on somebody's house\nAn agreement shall we say you know it's kind of things like yeah we got one\nBut not not somebody says we said the right we're talking about the threat ... very generic one everything and apparently was in leather binder which they couldn't find so that probably didn't help either but um so the one that has some what under filing system another ... I I haven't seen it a while and now\nSo basically the one that isn't as than he\nIs the one who um was kind of the main God the company well he's sent and he called a lawyer and he wanted a hired her to help them come up with an agreement you know what I mean like to do a formal granite 'cause I guess he knew that his business partner was little\nGoing the other way shall we say wind a part ways and he could see it in the future when the lawyer had asked him and said you know it was going around saying and so can you bring the stuff to me and everything\nHe asked our she asked him and said you know we'll going through the motions and everything he said well we don't really have it will when he didn't tell the partner about the lawyer for when they brought it in the other guy goes what the heck are you why why don't we who is this thing it probably is another business partner will turns out it was the lawyer he hired to help with the ...\nWell the partner freaked out basically and said we don't need a lawyer and everything else and walked out of the whole thing well a big difference I'd have to basically about two weeks later when he finally realize well his partner but he could first see his partner basically said I'm done I quit were not partners anymore\nAnd when he called the lawyer she was like you know\nTrying to you know go over the whole agreement with them while she goes I'm One question is he on your bank account\nLike as his name on the day he got and everything is like a yeah well sure enough while they're trying to write at the new agreement what turns out and trying to get them off the bank he was down the other guy who is now a partner anywhere without the bank taken out Twenty one thousand dollars in cash\nSo his name was still only account in in the keys right right right basically and so since he was taken out cash there was nothing to it and says his name was still on it they had the bank had to give it to him [laughter] so it was one of the things that like ...\nLike for saw what was going on and he should have done something and so lesson learned I mean he's probably going to have to he said have probably have to see them in court or whatever but he was kind of thing um by the way I'm don't or learn from a mistake [laughter]\nMake sure you have a good operating agreement between you and your part business partner and um so that's coming from somebody that's been there done that kind of thing so and in current right now probably having to sue his business partner because of what\nWell that is\nHere's the say folks if you if you're going to go into small business the first thing to do is going to yourself\nNumber one ... if you do have a business where you need a partner then you have to be very careful I don't care if you have to go down to the grocery store and buy lavender toilet paper\nAnd we're right up to contract on it that would be better than oh my leather bound [laughter]\nYeah I was I Can't find any more but\nYou know and you know something simple basic and you know a contract consist of a description of date and a summary of what all your what all is supposed to be done between two people whether it's you know your your your business in the I'm In the uh\n[noise] you know you're a customer\nAnd signatures mhm and if you want to and you can have someone that you know with the you know like a witness a winter sport exactly it's a very simple process and you will save yourself so much agony in time and money because let's face it lawyers will tell you\nI mean there's how many times how many times and we heard a lawyer to tell someone look all you're going to spend money and you're not going to get anything the best thing to do is probably just walk away mhm any on how big the businesses and everything else and that's what you're putting you're putting yourself up you're making yourself\nFight all you're going to make yourself a or whatever you do things like this because if not if it's with mhm and more times than not and I don't know it's it's really disheartening whenever you hear things like that because you know we go with all the time\nAnd I think that it's you know I think it's I think is a pretty simple thing I mean I I signed a contract with actually I Know you know it is very detailed is very detailed parody of\nI Want more money that was it [laughter]\nYou know I don't get\nPaid anything so I wanted a little bit of money but I don't know why am I going to tell what I wrote a they're a little bit different it was okay but we say it's a simple things curse words that we have a lot of them ...\nWell we say it's a simple thing but I mean how many times like I think about even in business to customer like you can get you probably get excited about a job sometimes when you go ahead and start something when you probably shouldn't start something\nYou know what I mean do you see I'm saying like you go oh this this child's going to be grades kind of this project or whatever and all of a sudden like you're already halfway into it and you never even did that and then something happens and there's a fall out because you have your name and do anything and now so if someone comes to your lawyer whoever goes uh to do anything in the beginning oh now\nAfrica does your son did it change orders digital rise you that there's a lot of things you do you do to take consideration and let's face it folks if you not done a big job yet if your services or anything like that if you've not done a big job yet you need to get you need to talk to some folks\nThat have done some things like that and get some suggestions from them and get some wisdom because right get burned and you can be out of business you most and that's what we talk about all come about coastal monsters and and uh you know these customers that that want to take advantage of you\nAnd they're out there they they look for this it's the same thing is people driving down the street and similar to pull up from a stop sign had run into them I mean you know I felt really is yeah yeah and and and they're sitting there waiting on on this to happen\nBecause they took advantage of of small business people like this that's what they do and it's sad it really is\nWhat when you said change order it just hit me between the eyes I learned my lesson I was twenty four years old working for the family business and how like the people because I didn't add something to it and I never had that piece of paper you know what I mean because they want to change this I just said okay well change it and I it was a verbal over the phone\nThat came back to bite me and I learned from that when I was twenty four going I Will never ever do that again not use this change order\nAnd it is such a simple thing to ... and and if they do want to sign up and you don't do it then you continue on the way that the contractor you agreement your next room to talk to them it's just that simple\nI mean we're talking about even if you want to change the color the icing on your cupcake yeah for the party\nShift change order if you'd rather have a block letters is that of course of the ... right\nBut those things are very civil liberties civil to do and they're so that you have to hit today's world that's what people look for when it's what you have to do business in order to protect yourself and that's what you do as a business owner we have reported to protect yourself I hate to say what you do\nAnd even though it's not a business per se but it is and it's not but\nEven like a lot of people didn't like how maybe they were going to take in a different direction I kind of think about that like a business sometimes like if you take over a new business\nYou know I mean you may have a little bit just like you're talking about the niche where you're trying to have a different way and now you're taking those customers you may have some customers that go I'm not really like and this and go somewhere else you know what I mean and our employees right and well yeah and or so\nAlmost I kinda think that it's like okay if you start from scratch she start yourself and you start you have an idea what's your\nWhat's your kind of where you're going and everything else I mean you start that brand where you may have to take something else in politically rebranded to the point where it's like you know what I mean like you're having to clean house you\nKnow and take all this stuff but um\nAnd I think it'd be careful that because if if you're looking at a business where you have to completely re brand something or or I you know almost start from scratch well season about it\nRight and I have to sit on this is the deal is century because I Believe me was whenever I say this if you have to do all that you might as well start from scratch because right you not only not only going from square one forward you're going back then back to square one this all\nRight well there's a lot of people that will buy it you know they'll buy it even though they have their own thought the by it because they want the customers but again what I'm saying what dislike basically we're we're meeting in the middle is going\nOkay so you might as well start from scratch if you have all these other things you want to do and you already know the path you want to go down you know what I mean you are I have the business plan together shall we say well\nAnd and here's the thing is um you know depends on\nYou know about about a business from someone also depends on you know if they want out of it really bad for retired or if they're you know Phil ... uh you know\nComplications or something like that you may be able to get a a real good price on ... what would you what you're inheriting is you're inheriting a customer base that from day one when you first if you if you purchase it may first may may first you're\nYou're you're you have you have money coming through the door because that customer base and so then you're able to take that you're able to use it and you're able to leverage um\nMany different things to get it to where you want it\nTo that niche type business that you are or what you're looking for we look for friends and everything so there's there's pros and cons both ways just like you said there's no doubt about it so it depends on the business depends on how much you get it for depends on what type businesses to do what you want to do with it it depends on whether you bought for ... for my I'm I'm a a a\nWould stop he ... he he gave me like I bought one from you know one time you know had trouble with everything a lot of things and you know and I didn't realize I Do and I have trouble with one of the business of ball but you know it uh you know shows ugly head sooner or later yeah and it was it was a it was tough for a while it really was\nRight where are you already have all the other side of the deal with that have that down the road on top of it it doesn't make it any better but I was gonna say too is that um sometimes it depends on to like if you're starting at ... ... business let's say and it's something it's it's not even on line it's not much on line\nYou know I mean you're having a really like okay what are you going to the cold calling people are you doing word of mouth or like where mine a little more like a my focus more on the on line audience which gradually went to the local markets and everything else but when you have something to chicken really focus on line I think that's easier\nEspecially now with all the tools that you have so I mean that's something that I consider to so if you buy a business that like may be easier if you already have an established customer base that's like local if you're doing a local like let's say service business or something right versus something that's gonna be can you know I don't think so there's a there's a lot to think\nAbout an absolutely the right type business because let's face it if you're going to online business where you don't shipping let's say ... you know if you're going to if you're going to ship eggs\n[laughter] hard enough to get eggs for sure right right I mean you know loaded on your cart\nCourt but what about put him in your in your car your vehicle and put them in the fridge writer by the time and do all that you have four or five opportunity breaks\nMhm but if you're going to ship over you know on line and you're going to send him to FedEx which you know fed extends the bricks with things and metal you exactly so what uh what I'm getting at is is it depends on what type\nOf business is going to be what what you're going to offer your your customers to write a lot of things a lot of things go into it but the biggest thing is don't make the decision until you think all these things through and if ... if you're going to buy a business from someone else\nThen they go in there and find out top to the employee has talked to some of the customers to see where there was a things it depends on what sound as if it's if it's a service but if it's something like a\nA coffee shop you know when you think about buying it you know going in and sit down and watch the customers\nDon't get weird or anything but there's a lot of things that you can do that will cause that would help help not cause you a lot of heartache in the future\nYeah well there's a lot of things to consider pros and cons of both sides but I mean I think I agree with you as far as starting from scratch I mean that maybe you know and everybody is so different too I mean it may be better for somebody else to do the other thing where they do have\nAlready a personality thing too because a lot of people don't want to have\nThey don't want to build that customer base but you know you're never stop building a customer base while I say that let me back up on that sometimes you you you do stop because if you don't want to you know I'm\nGoing with the customer base which you don't want to expand your business than you need then you start coal in the ... customers in the coastal monsters and you start getting the bottom line open that\nThis than you need then you start coal in the ... customers in the coastal monsters and you start getting their bottom line open it up where you want to be right you'd be you'd be very surprised how much you can how much money you could like we've proven that we really got into a weirdo customers you\nKnow how the creek or sitting in the coffee shop called us [laughter] you\nKnow when we come

a bit similar but they do have their differences the amazing thing for me to watch them on film is that they were literally changed quarterbacks\nBetween place it's not a series but they'll use multiple quarterbacks interchange on a series which I think it's a little unusual\nIt is unusual and it's related to the fact that they both are just they're different players you know barbers is is a pass or easily and pastor and a squad is sixty five percent passer on the year um and then if you look at\nA ... he's the lead in Russia or on the team you know so he's the guy that very explosive and

everybody was taken by surprise\nYou know my response is who gives a damn\nHe made a brilliant move executed\nA brilliant move and we're going to probably shut down a bit of goals you getting table

Thumper rainiest impetuous put that in quotes manner and he made the decision to do it\n[noise]\nYou know people say uh that does that's no good and I can't I Can't for two seconds could be on myself

all for you [noise]\nAnd I'm going to get to that during the show because it's actually a really hard to believe that um\nThere's there's so much ... he's still out there that people can't bring themselves to say wow what a great deal Mika Brzezinski for example a on MORNING\nShow on MORNING Joe was criticizing Trump for this deal and you don't want her rationale was are you ready for this\nTrump made this deal with North Korea to shut down with them so it would take the attention of Stormy Daniels the prostitute with whom he was accused of not signing a nondisclosure agreement with\nYou think Donald Trump is sitting here petrified of Stormy Daniels especially what Trump's social reputation for years back\nI doubt it I don't want to get into the Stormy Daniels prostitute

I didn't like him but he was really [noise]\nBecause we're all shooting ... you're all thinking well what about the expense of this is worth it maybe I don't know I have a friend who ah across the street he moved out he lived here for I don't know twenty Thirty years you know ... somebody said to me she was right because I paid for an alarm system for ah from from from my house\nAnd he says I never had a problem I said well you know you roll the dice she came out of him you know I had peace of mind all these years and there were so many people think well I don't want to spend the money it's expensive it's too expensive\nNow I Am not saying blow the money you know what I'm saying pick the right people would spend the money [noise]\n[noise] right right so in terms of that so even if you have a resourceful person\nSo let's say I'm I'm but the head of my family I Am a go getter I find the time to do the things I Need to do so I decided I'm going to save some money and put the effort into using one of the online wells which I'll tell you those surfaces are very good state actually\nServe a very good purpose and you can find yourself learning a lot and educating yourself at the end of that process you feel very good about what she created however then fast forward to the time that she passed away\nAnd whomever you left in charge lover you've made executor whoever you may trustee if you've got trust involved that person then picks up the ball\nEmpty handed it they've got the documents in their hands but they don't have a contact from they don't have the contact person so now you've added at least two steps to their lives the first step is that they got an interview and find an attorney to help them through the process the second step is\nThat firms that send picks up your paperwork\nMay not have all of the back story that they need to truly\nBe working in your favor all that they've got is what's in black and white and sometimes there are gray issues that arise and those attorneys have no information so while you said yourself some money and done all that yourself you've\nEffectively passed on more work to the people that you leave in charge when you're gone now perhaps you have you know just a a stable bury 'em\nThey're resilient go getters who despite their grief are going to be able to do that but it's not something I recommend I I understand that some people just don't have the fun but if you have the funds it's one of the best places to to hire an expert in really have someone there and play for you so what do you\n... there's a difference between being should we be ignorant people just turn on the other way and they think well this is going to be easy oh ... oh just what you might have said you have to each kid or I Will I'm\nA view so much with Germany and a lot of it was obviously individual individually oriented and they don't even think about well who should be the trust of the year ... basis who should be the ... the the executives and then\nYou've got to be darned careful because it gets very entangled families expand\nAnd all of a sudden you have the repercussions that could happen to have for your your daughter runs on his married merge three or four grandchildren how should the money but yeah I like it at all I'm not sure I trust my son in law are I put my daughter's name or put it into the kid's name ever paid out over X number of years\nTake us through some event because none of those on ... and you do hear the voice of a professional ...\nRight right so ... and first I'll start off with the professional Google which of course isn't\nBut if people who don't have professionals in place if you simply Google was an executive do what as a trustee do you know if you think that that list perfectly matches and I'm just saying is a very\nSexist maybe outdated idea that it's hung around a lot of families choose if they have children the oldest son is going to be the trust and the executor and you look down those lists than you think is the oldest son the one who should be doing this at eight to begin with\nAnother individual may be better\nBe you may find that just because of the way that the family operates it may be better to take family out of that picture altogether\nI'm ... and in terms of\nYour idea of things the expanding and changing over time you know there are we literally just society where there are second marriages\nUm we also live in a society now we're seeing more and more people unfortunately you know falling to addiction\nAnd you have a child who is facing addiction then you face the\nOption of trying to protect them from getting too much money at the wrong time right it's not that ah this person is worth less than she'd get lots of this person really for their health\nNeeds to be protected from having a you know too much liquidity for lack of better work at their ... their ability to get a hold of money so in a state plan here I'm saying don't procrastinate get it done and then you'll feel so good\nYou do continue to look at it over time you look at it three years later and five years later when there's been a change when even when you just moved to a

have a program that we can we can do to any demographic audience that's how wide my\nUm how diverse my my career has been at this particular point you know so uh and being an excellent health and in

have your show I've maybe the folks have your Wednesday to talk with you in a little more detail but you will for now what if they would\nBe amenable to all orange will be a place I Would actually do

you were you aware above the bar [noise]\nTime now to switch gears and show me to a woman who has been a trailblazer in the world of sports if you want to\nBe successful in life follow somebody to successful and boy do we have a great gifts for you she's relatively new to Las Vegas but she been doing some incredible things or why her name is candy ... she's an entrepreneur member of the women's basketball hall of fame that I Want to talk for about an brand consultant\nAnd six time author candy welcome it's so great having you here what brought you to Las Vegas I noticed as you said you were here once in the in the air force for ... sake\nI was stationed here and now this air force base for about two and a half years prior to going overseas for six years\nSo I'm I'm I'm a little bit familiar with Vegas and then I used to come every year to visit for a while and then I kinda like started traveling a lot and I kind of like hadn't been here for a while but my business brought me back five times last year\nAnd for some reason I was looking for a new home because my daughter lives in LA I wanted to be on the west coast I wasn't sold on LA\nSo I really think about Vegas and it just kept popping up I kept ending up here either with a client or with my own business and I started seriously thinking about it and then in February I made the decision that just like\nJump we're glad you're here you know and it's interesting that you came at the same time that the WNBA now came to Las Vegas or the ... which is kind of exciting but you were one of the real pioneers of professional women's basketball kind of tell us how you went through that and and you got into the hall of fame\nSo I Want to correct that I'm not in the women's basketball I'm I'm vetted by the women's basketball hall of fame for their list to hopefully be in that oh okay but so they vetted me at the first African American woman but you have to be invited to be included so I'm invited and vetted by them but I made the African American hall of fame\nAnd I'm On like several other waiting list so you know like for the waiting list it's an interesting process I always say they don't end up to your I'm dead but and that's not true but for some people\nYou're either really all or you know their value posthumously\nWhich is not good but anyhow [laughter]\nDegree more yeah yeah it is frustrating answer any ... woken raider fan for a year I was like yeah they could be finally let them in after he passes just like oh it's awful\nIt's a horrible and I like I said they they did jazz um end up the other lady that was in Nineteen Seventy seven we were in like Nineteen nineties but we were hoping that we're next for the women's basketball hall of fame but yet but I'm also vetted personally and then the league itself hopefully we'll\nCome but so um that was one of the reasons why I came to Vegas back to your other question was um because of all the sports teams that are here because I live out the sports as my company we help the eyed young not only just you we put youth and pro players in the same space\nUm and then I also do consulting and goes writing for professional athletes an ... an entertainer entrepreneur but I came here because of the influx of sports the growing sports here all at one time of pro sports the aces the night the raiders and there's some awful other like will less well known leagues that are coming up here to\nMore with candy condo in just a moment you are listening to Vegas never sleeps with Stephen ... ... talk radio network [noise]\nBefore the draft and now he's having a severe depression and I mean the story and play on and on different for different kids different races what are the same story that I hear on a regular basis and it's because we're not preparing our kids\nWhen they're young so that they have a plan B start your own business ... business going now you can still go on the NFL I mean I look at someone like Tyler ... who is one of a Tyler Perry's main actors but he's you know and they have and have nots he's been on every season but\nHe's also rapper he's also got a clothing line over here you've got a fallback plan and that's what we've got to teach our kids are not just kids that have athlete that as a matter of their entertainer if they're athlete whatever they have they've got to be a fallback plan\nWhat smart I mean it's like the city of Las Vegas says now we diversified we don't put we're not going to get hit by a big recession because we're gonna diverse my freshman year in depression for your life right yeah maybe you will make millions and millions of dollars to never have to do anything else in life\nBut you know I had a friend and I want to ask you about this I had a friend could print and grew up with what's going to be a major league ball player and he was right me actually went back and forth between the triple a team in the big we have good possibilities and then one day got hit in the\nIn the head and they had a helicopter amount and show us with a career was over\nMe and it was tough he went through a deep depression worked out okay 'cause he got back in ah he works in a major league baseball but that's kind of anything a boy I'm thinking to myself it sure would have been good if he that's been dealing with here so when he's getting a helicopter off his life isn't over\nAnd I just I just talked to a friend of mine\nWho was a ... in baseball major league player at one time and he got hurt and he was telling me that he just never been able to it's almost like a some like a sexual trauma or something he says he's never actually it's like a part of his life\nThey not been able to get over that and I hear that a lot to we think that okay now you've got a great job you're you know your your your head of the school district now\nBut but if you talk to them personally over here you know what happened to me a sport although I'll be at a great thing but it also if if they left in less than undesirable and intentions or you know reason they also have something that is almost like traumatizing them for life\nAnd so that's something that I don't think anyone prepare them for one of the things we're doing here in Vegas\nWhen ... when life after sport blows up to the big big big um we're going to be having workshops for athletes in everything from depression to you know head trauma or you know had traumatic brain injury domestic violence plan B how to be an author how to be an entrepreneur finances the whole\nGamut we're gonna have under the life after sports better\nWhile I Would imagine it's one of the gambling too that I Would imagine though\nThat if you're a ballplayer and that happened to this is terrible thing you can kind of remind them hey you know what a lot of people want to still be around you use that to your you know you have a certain celebrity you're never going to lose that can help you and other areas if your plan for that is ultimately you have to make it on your own but you know use that advantage you have\nAnd the one thing that I I hear a lot too and it's kind of Everytime I hear I hear a lot of athletes who like say for instance they got cut after a year\nA lot of them feel like they're not worthy to help the students because they feel like you know my peers have done so much more than I've done so you know who am I to be standing up here and I said you guys are really the ones that they need to hear from because this is the norm\nThe other ones are those are the one you know hundreds of one chances there's a hundred and what is it a thousand and one\nTo get in the in the NBA I mean you are this is the normal life here that people need to know what do I what's the what if you know what that was that backup plan that you know your fallback your option your plan B those are the ones that I Want to hear from\nNow that you hear and we have the NFL and the NHL WMBA and such\nOr have you thought about a offering your services I Would think would be a wonderful thing for these teams again it's something they just don't run across you know and I and I know you know they're all very wealthy but it's like you said there's more to it than just money and I know a lot of athletes suddenly were great big stars and they're out of money\nSo we I have already reached out to the aces\nAnd I thought when they are here this up they'll all come and knock on the door but yes we reached out to the age aces and we've also reached out to uh some individuals that are on the transition team for the raiders so that's kinda like Tom ... like methodical I've been here a few months and now they're starting to\nPick up steam and so absolutely that's exactly what we're trying to do\nThat can be a perfect thing one twenty twenty when they actually arrived here and uh you know having they went to a few training camps in my early days and broadcast and get a feel and there's a lot of field there and you see these people you know you were talking before and I\nCouldn't help but remember what it was like watching these guys are getting cut and walking off and you can see you know nobody cares about him but you know that their whole life\nHas been I had a friend get cut off of a football team just like two days ago someone sent me a method of like oh my God that outside of that my friend got caught cut so I understand ah how that is than it is hard on the family because they put a lot into this a lot into the draft\nAnd uh you know everyone's waiting for this big moment and then for them to get cut like the same year 'cause they just got drafted this year so it's a lot and and that's why I think that\nAs life after sports grows\nI'm On a bigger were only a year and a half even though this was a three to four year vision of mine were only were just in December will be celebrating our two year anniversary so we're still very new also um you know we we've got some growing to do which is great and I'm excited about that and I'm excited about the future of life after sports which we've just trademark the name\nUm yeah so you know we got a lot of growing to do but we're exactly doing that very thing and I just think that the workshop the ones that are very intrinsic unimportant are going to be those ones too that are the the the workshops and no one wants to talk about it the fun ones are going to be easy that for no worship and the author and all that but it's the other ones too that we want to bring to light as well\nMore with sports and branding consultant

thirty two thousand dollars on a new car not a new truck or a new SUV orange camper those are entirely different studies\nOn a new car thirty two grand okay so we bought ours and this was all vector you know this was back there but I helped and I paid attention\nAnd here's what we did it fabulous Lincoln for three grand okay well in our car or a new car only had at the airports only only about

about three hundred thousand dollars about tripled okay\nCar loans it's somewhat similar you're buying a car you know safer thirty thousand dollars and you're doing it on alone by the time you're done

looking for the guilty and she'll talking about ways to get your hands on that\nNew car brand new to your household anyway for a lot less than what other people are paying for their cars these days the average household it paying thirty two thousand dollars for a new car these days not a new truck not an camper not a new rocket ship those are a whole\nDifferent numbers this is just for cars and you know what I Can't do it I even if we had the means to do it still I cannot sit there and things like that might be delighted to spend thirty two thousand dollars on the words can't even come out of my mouth my nose feels like it's going to fall off if I say it's not gonna happen\nMaybe are the same way I'm hoping the same way and here's how we got it done for a lot less\nWe recently purchased are your latest car we've got to the Lincoln we love our Lincoln if it doesn't look like it could fit in a great you know good fellows or a mafia hits job movie you're not going to find it in our household my husband loves the bigger cars now you know once we had the kids\nI really got you know basically sold on the bigger cars they're incredibly safe\nThey have their you know they hold their own on the road they're not like these dinky little cars I'm seeing so many cars out there and no slammed people driving them I'm very impressed with people driving those cars that looked like they fit on the end of the key chain you it look like you can kind of pick it up and throw it across any traffic jam the dinky little cars I cannot get in one of those cars I Know several\nPeople with that kind of a car I'm On the other end of the spectrum where it has to be a larger car one that I feel very safe and so we love our Lincoln's okay there are many other you know make the models out there that can do the trick we do the Lincolns\nDaughter something Lincoln with Willie relatively few miles on it and for only three thousand dollars and we paid cash\nBecause that's the way we roll around here literally and I would hear back from people right and left people who have done this a dozen times or so in their car buying you know history who better to hear from them so I'm just reading no particular order\nOlder rated by listening in your mind and this is another great one that I heard from more than one person keep a business mindset whether you're a guy or gal out there buying it by a car and again I go back to the buying a house analogy\nThey're buying it by a car and again I go back to the buying a house analogy it's very emotional you're going to be in this car this car kind of speaks a bit about your personality so of course it's a personal decision\nBut you have to keep a business might that it's not an emotional decision don't do it and if a sales person or a car cellar if it's a private sales maybe tries to get you to test drive a different card that out of your budget or I don't know maybe has bells and whistles you don't care to pay for don't get snow covered\nDon't get you know something there it's so easy to get sucked in I Know that's going to bring it back to better\nBring it right back to center stay focused like a laser and remember what's financially makes sense to me okay if you get excited about the features you're going to lose your edge big time next up and this is for people who aren't paying cash it simply is not in the cards for this particular car purchase and you have to get a loan\nGo out there and get pre approved for a loan visit your bank or go on line people kind of rates in terms you can give her an auto loan know what you can afford okay get on those calculators and says hey you can afford a ... billion dollar car that's great yeah OK throttle back\nJust listen to the sound of my voice you're not getting a ... billion dollar card say for instance it says hey great news\nYou can afford a thirty thousand dollar car that kind of a car payment you can afford and I don't do it you know what I'm saying is I'm preaching the choir I realized that\nThrottle it back to maybe I don't know a ten thousand dollar car and buy one that fits every one of your knee\nNeed not you're once you're in need to go out there and get it enjoy very low car payment compared to what they say you can afford and every once in a winter here's another big thing\nKind of like buying a house you know your credit score it if they must find must have you cannot look at the you know the car you know owners seller car dealership you can't look them in the eye and say you don't know your credit score you're gonna look small game okay you're gonna look small potatoes you can look small game no your credit score own it be aware of that\nWork on it a pass to come up a little bit it's a must have before you hadn't to any dealership it is a huge they go she aiding tool that you can use in your favor if you've got a good credit score if you don't have a good credit score helpful to know that to knowing your credit worthiness along with the loan terms you can get from your own bank helps to negotiate with the dealers finance often\nWhen you go in there looking knowledgeable that money in your pocket okay you can't judge how good the financing offered they're making you if you don't know what you deserve okay keep that business mindset\nStay focused laser focused don't get sucked in by all the bells and whistles you know you want this you want that yeah I get it I wanted to I Would like you know I'd like a car that gives me a back road every time I get it it's not even though it's not what I Need that's what I Want to get everything you need\nHold off of the stuff you want or need search the Web another big thing out their search the Web in a way that maybe didn't think you could there are sites out there where you will plug in the make the model the diameter the you know how many owners had and it will rank for you just how much that's worth going there knowing it\nThat is that it's a huge bargaining chip its power that you can unleash that a huge number of used car shoppers doesn't leash doesn't put in their favor make it work for you put that knowledge all of that research in your back pocket\nAlong with your money that you're going to save and everybody's aware here's another one who where was this one this is a good one show off your military status another thing that didn't even occur to me if the person out there buying the car has any kind of a military background first of all thank you very much for your service and car dealers\nYou when you drive by they love to weigh the flag was one of the reasons I loved them if you or your spouse\nIs a veteran or active duty military chances are outstanding you will be eligible for cash back or discount of a thousand dollars or more which is a beautiful thing to me so called the dealership you're interested in or just check online research in online ahead of time\nAnd see if they had that kind of thing going on oftentimes that can be the game changer you got a lot of this is the one I wanted to make sure we get to this is important as well because this is advice that goes across all spectrums whether you're buying a car you're buying a house you're getting a a loan for anything you have a credit card\nDon't compare your deal with anyone else's okay this is advice from Rowan he's listening from Charlotte North Carolina he had some great advice and one of the best things he recommended because he had done about a dozen used car deals over the course of his driving life\nAnd he's saying here a good deal is one day you're comfortable with don't waste your time or your energy wondering about the deal to other people get\nAnd he warned of situations with friends or co workers you know anybody where you might get to talking about what you paid and then other people you know stop what they paid for the same car or something very similar someone else's total price might be better than yours or maybe their line\nBut you don't know about their credit you don't know about their down payment or any other factors of the sale okay so go out there listen keep your ear to the ground as to what other people are spending\nTake it all with a grain of salt because people love to see you know there was this big deal with this great stick to what you know stick to what impacts you don't worry about what other people are paying for their car don't worry about the loan don't worry about the rape don't worry about it they pay cash don't pay cash I'm concerned with you I couldn't care less about the co worker All right I Want you\nIn the gorgeous car safe\nDependable minimal bells and whistles 'cause guess what they're going to break into that costs money when they break I Want you drive enough to work or to your friends into your family in a car that you worked hard to earn better yet paid with cash minimal bells and whistles beautiful sleek the color that you're looking for\nSo the ... going to be a hundred and eleven dollars and Fifteen cents a month and your total payment under these conditions is going to be one thousand three hundred and forty five dollars and thirty one cents a month\nOkay which is very doable it's honestly you know less than most people's rents these days\nI Would guess it is probably less than most people's rent yeah now you are going to have to pay taxes on your property short but still even if you add in the tax is my guest is still going to be less than\nWhat a lot of people are paying for rent now let's contrast that with twenty percent down payment and see how much of a whole or in here with this being my private mortgage insurance okay twenty percent down payments to get an opium I that's fifty thousand dollars okay\nNot too many people that fifty thousand biologist laying around now but you would take out a mortgage loan than for two hundred thousand dollars again you get the same thirty year fixed rate\nFour point six percent and your mortgage payment then there's a thousand twenty five dollars and twenty nine okay Phil ... pm I is zero zero so your total monthly mortgage payment for principle and interest in the ... is one thousand twenty five dollars and twenty nine cents so looking five years down the road Chris you what do you think it's going to be better off the\nPerson who puts down to three percent down payment and pays the ... for five years or the person who says no I don't want to pay pay a minority naughty launder not playing nice I'm going to wait until I've got twenty percent down that sounded who is going to be better off in five years the person who takes the plunge for the three percent down or the person who continues to rent\nOh boy definitely the person who takes the plunge spheres the darned it said definitely get in there in line all if my thought\nThat is the correct answer that is the correct answer and here's some math to put behind that the mortgage payments with the ... is uh Thirteen hundred and forty five dollars right the mortgage payment without the ... is one thousand twenty five that's a difference to three hundred and twenty dollars three hundred bucks a month\nThree hundred bucks if I say well my goodness you know I could go out to eat or probably four times a month for that yup\nBlah blah blah so if if you put those payments out for five years\nThree hundred and twenty dollars a month times ... times five years you will of laid out Nineteen thousand two hundred dollars in private mortgage insurance okay not chicken the no but what has happened to the probable value of your house that fun stuff comes and now the core logic in their home prices expectations survey most recent one\nAnd they do this every quarter folks so they keep things up today they're saying that\nA house price to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is probably going to increase in value sales price by about fifty thousand dollars over the next five years okay so you say your houses were fifty thousand dollars more\nAnd you put a Nineteen thousand dollars more in PM Iowa differences thirty one thousand dollars so you can sit there and laugh at the person who continues to rent saying look at mine at work so at that point in time well see you got thirty one thousand dollars in equity from the value of build up yes\nHe probably paid down five ten thousand dollars of your mortgage balance so that was so you probably get forty maybe fifty thousand dollars and equity in the house at which point you could sell and put twenty percent down for another or you could if you get yourself a home equity line of credit\nUse at home equity line of credit to go out and buy a bigger house\nContinue to rent the house you been living in I've known people who have done that every five or six years and over the course of a thirty\nAre owned by a career they wind up with five or six or seven or eight homes Lao in a very very nice retirement nesting you very much retirement nest egg so folks if you're wondering about should I put the three percent down and pay the P. M. I. or should I say even script them\nWork real hard to save the twenty percent so I can get away from paying PM I my strong advice would be paid the PM I take the plunge and I think you'll be much better\nOff for now the person you are talk this over with in addition to texting me and asking me to give you this article a talk it over with their local realtor find yourself a realtor interview released to probably three or four you're not in Delaware Pennsylvania I Can't represent you find yourself\nA realtor who you really feel good about\nTalk to him or her and then work this kind of scenario make sure you get comfortable with yourself and then go out and take the plunge\nI Love that you did and what can we talk about him I I always think about how when victory and I bought our fixer we had to give him I we put enough on the house to get into the house but we still need to do some PM I very briefly because when you buy fixer mental time fixing it fast how much equity had an ... pm I was ... ancient history to couple of months after we moved at ... ...\nYeah it if you do some fix up in your house the law that you can do yourself and if you think you fix it up enough\nTo get to a spot where you got twenty percent equity what you call your friendly bank and say Ira friendly lender and say I think I've got twenty percent equity in the house and they'll say well get an appraiser out there to back that up you get in the parade route to the back that up you're going to cancel the private mortgage insurance out well before the five year time\nVery cool so even though we've got herself a very hot fall season coming up and literally it's hot here to throw it out the area I think we're supposed to get some crazy story but that's a cool office that led to be a fantastic remind her just because we're officially going into fall the real estate market is still red hot buying selling renting flipping whatever it is getting their man cannot be darned correct\nNow along those lines let's talk a little bit about where our mortgage interest rates that are in twenty Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty nine teams I certainly do wow I certainly do know received do you think mortgage interest rates are going to be going up and twenty Nineteen or down and twenty Nineteen okay we're going to be going up and yesterday up or down down\nDown well in my you know fantasy land I Would love to see them going down because it's just that selfish and want to see that however all common sense regular headlines when you read between consumer confidence and you read about you know everything else I hate to say this but I think they're probably going to change the way up just a bit for the best of reasons because we're on a great track as an economy and that's the natural side effect of that\nBeing though if you were on Jeopardy said what is a five point two percent interest rate and the question was\nWhere it's going to be at the end of the third quarter and plenty and I used to be getting money there you go to Orlando jeopardy I never watched it but anyway interest rates going up is another reason that you want to jump into that whole market right now because uh if interest rates are five percent now they're four and a half\nPercent now Roosevelt where they are right and they're going to be five percent of sometime in twenty Nineteen well every one percent rise in interest rates means you've got a ten percent increase in interest that satisfy that example\nWe were just talking about if interest rates go up from four to four and a half percent six hundred dollars a year of his\nShortage in shortage and a lot of novels that gang right after this\nIs talk radio is now available on Amazon Echo just at the ... talk radio skills and ask

out and it what it does is there's a critical mass of the perception of get every penny out of me it doesn't matter if I gamble it doesn't matter if I spend money on another venue I'm going to squeeze

dot com\n[noise]\nGo to Vegas favors leaves we see the magic [noise]\nWhat was a good friend Scott rope and all of a calm spending and expand the session with us discussing the perceptions about Las Vegas and these days thanks in part\nTo new cause I think slots are tighter I think when I go to certain places there are places where I just know that was not a pleasant experience there was no value that's not entertainment and a lot of the discussion is happening around younger people millennials that they're not gambling well\nI mean any age if you're not having fun why are you going to gamble and millennials are so smart they've got a game on their phone for money or not money whatever like why am I going to sit in front of this machine and if I'm not getting value so I I think uh it really speaks to that question about is Vegas at a turning point I think it is\nAnother layer of this that you did not ask about is\nVegas is being confronted by the fact that gambling is everywhere [noise]\nIt used to have a monopoly it used to have a monopoly on sports betting it used to have a monopoly in gambling overall well that is everywhere the term in the business world has come out of this nation as a commodity that is in New Jersey that's in California it's on the Indian reservations is\nGambling is everywhere and people tend to uh it's a nurse or right it's like if I'm near if I got a place to gamble near my house to drive Vegas but I don't have to travel to Vegas and now if you give me that extra reason I'm getting nickel and dime\nI'm going to that a casino on that reservation so that's a huge aspect of this too there's a lot of different aspects international travel has become more difficult um there's a multiple factors but a lot of that is tangibly going to affect\nThe ability to Vegas Vegas casinos to make money and to expand and build new things and that's always that for me like shiny new things\nWell let's talk about and what the possible solutions are I mean we can see while the numbers have been flat here in downtown Los Vegas they manage to keep going up and I think because people do sense of value there and we have all these beautiful arenas sports teams entertainers coming there\nIs that the way they're going to try to approach just up and do you think it's going to make the you know all of a sudden is going to become a a high end Branson, Missouri\nAll friends that I don't know too much about France and uh so I can draw any parallels but I think the uh\nThere is going to be a moment of reckoning and I think it is already happening because uh obviously these big companies are watching their bottom line there watching their earnings reports on their stock prices and they have been hit hard and I think they're going to be hit hard over the next six months as well\nDo you have is stating numbers in terms of uh occupancy and room revenue because room prices are at free for next to free and in a way that's never actually been true in Vegas so they're they're going to have this moment where they really have to think about [noise]\nWhat are we providing what makes Degas special\nYou know do we have to roll back some of these fees that we've rolled out\nOr do we have to find other sources of revenue there they're going to have to ask a lot of serious serious questions and they're gonna have to think about it holistically which is not happening at the moment at every a casino companies saying well you know we have these mitigating factors that we have these other other things that are affecting\nWhat's unfolding but I think the city itself has to think about what it\nWhat is Vegas going to be and what is it going to offer and it and is it that important I Know they're making a lot of money from\nAnd it and is it that important I Know they're making a lot of money from some of these fees but is it is it that important when you're stepping over a dollar to pick up a dime\nBecause that's what's happening any predictions say I'll leave us with some happy happy thoughts that maybe we can look for in the next year or two\nWell I think people that like sports are going to be really happy\nOr the raiders or creating a lot of excitement they don't have the best team at the moment I'm not a sports expert is not looking at how good a Vegas nights obviously has had a huge amount of a support mainly among locals but\nA ... for for people that are into sports I've heard rumors about a baseball team for you know\nThere's a there's new deal with the the Las Vegas fifty ones and the athletics is that a sports team\nOr they're going to be the farm team for that uh so I think is a great time really a sports person\nUh it it there are a lot of concern oh we're supposed to stick to the positive stuff but there's a lot of concerns that some of these venues that are being built\nA this fear or a ... at the Venetian there's a stadium that there's not a lot of acts that can fill these Venus so that's also of concern or the the ah another great bit of news is going to be the Las Vegas convention center right so that's presumably going to draw a new a\nKind of scale for conventions\nVegas is going to start being convention driven because that casual traveler maybe isn't as important to the casinos as that convention here who has a credit card and can spend whatever they want\nA the the other bright side is that uh I ... I think it has to do with the strong survive and uh some so to me that's good news is you weed out a there is too too much room inventory\nThe good places to provide value we're going to survive the others are going to have a struggle it's going to be the same time as well um\nSo beyond sports I I got to say I think there when the casinos do have this kind of vision\nAdjustment they're going to start realizing hey\nPlayers will go to somewhere that has a hundred times odds of craps\nIt's better than the two times three times five times\nSo I think there are some of already done it when as rolled back its parking policy uh they had paid parking they still do but if you spent fifty dollars you get your parking validated so those kind of tests and those kind of adjustments are going to be made and I say I think that's all positive positive\nScott you can hear Scott each week a Vegas never sleeps and you can read his blog daily at by Vegas that\nCop timed out of each one of the giants and the world of wine as\nEvery now and then you're fortunate enough to meet a real superstar in a particular field\nMentioned meeting Babe Ruth in the world a baseball Neal Armstrong if you're going to talk to astronauts we have such a person with us today you get to meet one somebody a any of ... the first one in the United states mine chew\nFascinating guy he also has a great book the we'll talk more about a little later called power entertaining\nAnd it's just a whole philosophy it how you can combine the great taste the wind the the finest wind supplying as foods with selling a particular product or service but we'll get into that first I Want to\nAsk any how did you get into this 'cause you know you always want to find out how did that guy really do that first thanks so what made you get into the world of wines well\nLet me say this way first of all I grew up in New Jersey got a degree in psychology before jumped on the treadmill life to work so nine years old me anybody said hey let's let's go to California so we went down to a travel agency 'cause back then that's how you did it\nAnd we said well I got a one way ticket to California will get a summer job or work our way back and she looked at us and she said boys because back then we were boys she said for another Ninety five dollars you felt you go to Honolulu\nYou know also boomer in Waikiki diamonds and talk to the side so you know I I'm I decided I Need to stay a little longer before I Know this this summer vaporize mom's calling maybe a machine or a message on my answering machine when you're coming home so I fired back when convenient for me at three o'clock in the morning so she wouldn't get hit and miss it ... I forgot to tell you\nShe's got myself into graduate school and working on my master's got a good job of car do need to tap your dad for anymore do and a year but as busy as I Am you gotta you gotta understand my my love you could buy hung up the phone said to myself okay pal now go make it out and\nThe ... it's like to have a sample of this you know I did we ever it took to tell somebody of bottled\nThe belt Rob Cain so we're always walks into this restaurant there's Nineteen tables with with his bottle and his label aimed at him can you imagine when I did he walks and it goes twilight zone what's going on here he said who's responsible for that in a way to go that guy eddy over there\nSo he called me over and he said the young man why why did you do that\nAnd I said it wanted to get your attention to go through you sure you you got it [laughter] and\nYou do that and I said it wanted to get your attention to go through you sure you you got it and he said would you sit down with me after dinner and we'll talk sure to win eleven o'clock and let him sit with him talking and after about a half an hour talk with him he says you know I think your way more interested in wine or then psychology if I were you young man\nI wouldn't go to the University of Bordeaux schools ... and take their da da da da da da and fortunately they would teach it in French so you you have to learn to speak French\nBut there was a school in at the University of ... that I can send you two and a nine month should be speaking that sort of said\nBut me and coach so I went there and went to school learn French went to the University of Bordeaux up to a degree\nAnd I thought great you know and I thought you know while I'm over there I had heard that there was an exam and London called the master suddenly exam a and no American it ever climbed that mountain there is only about sixteen people in the world who would ever pass that I flew dilemma ticket and passed it and I went\nI think this is what I should be doing you know and I love to ah to teach people when I came back the United states they did a lot of little classes and stuff like that\nAnd then one day I uh I I started speaking of corporate law you're you know I did about two to Dale Carnegie public speaking course because I was terrified to speak I took that course and I felt more confident and then I started to try and sell myself to audiences for five hundred bucks\nAnd I have a look back since then uh my my day rate is twenty grand\nYou've taken this whole concept of great winds you know being the the first in the United states is only a hundred and some odd right now in the country where they one sixty four okay so ... you're one of a very very small group and so forth\nAnd get you to send a ticket to a whole nother level food parents which we'll talk about more detailed before and this whole idea of power entertaining it's really about taking this for a corporation and so forth to really make themselves different set themselves apart from everybody else and you do it through food wine\nYeah that is precisely the ... when I tell people you know we're all trying to do business find more clients how you doing that you know I mean it behooves due to find ways to get people to like you and maybe you do that by inviting someone to play golf maybe you take them to a museum\nMaybe you take 'em to a professional ball game\nBut that's what everybody else does so it's not that special how 'bout you use food and wine which I consider are the international currency for connection\nHas America's first master some conduct an event a luxury event\nAnd you call these people up and say we've got ... and he's drinking demand ... ah we're done with caviar bumps and we're sending a car to pick you up are you interested in coming to this event and people come how about this New York city's got twenty five thousand restaurants ... why would anybody go to another\nRestaurant again you

saw it I don't think\nHad lacrosse and forever\nAnd then all of a sudden we look at the news and on CNN and she had the right not what do you expect them to write and I was like wow okay nothing safe anymore though now\nYou ask me just being one of those planes and soda [laughter] would you take if you had a ... would you take it in the car with you um I don't know if it's possible it depends maybe it was a cast yeah how do you get an eight hundred pound town of course\nThose trucks like a big truck with little things that I'm sure he was a truck at it and get a car oh oh was that the guy who was recorded within a track I thought I heard something about it maybe it was a truck but it was in the back seat belt wasn't in the back of the trip because I've read that twice yeah yeah and I was I Know it was actually in the vehicle yeah let's see\nI'd rather ... passenger window mhm let's say\nYou know I saw the other day and as a train or you could probably do you have some light on this I saw somebody driving down the street with their dogs hanging out the window\nHow bad is that listen John I mean I Know personally know somebody who did that with their dog and it was great dog he had he had a leash but he's driving and he hit a bump and he wound up dog flew out of the window and he wound up running over him off\nAnd killing his dog oh\nThat is so horrible huh\nBut that and also like they like trucks they put them in the back and now in the yeah the ... on the bed and they don't um they don't know either him or anything they just don't have\nRun and then all of a sudden they see something to jump out did you know they had a mild yeah they're going wow so listen\nWe traveled up to New York we drove up and Bella and I'm Troy both had harnesses and they both had the seatbelt set you attach little harnesses not to their next you know and then they were clipped and and\nIt worked for a little while but then they would go over one another's I was back there on clipping and re clipping whatever but you know their their dogs there are big our big ... kids you know and we want to protect them so why shouldn't they have a seat belt on as well\nI actually agree with that always has his seatbelts onto it protects you as well though Oh absolutely you don't want to do a Brittany spears\nYeah it protects you as well though Oh absolutely do the you don't want to do\nA Brittany spears and have your dog where as a child for her on your lap while you're driving down the highway and now I'm so no not a good idea now that dog because a torpedo once you hit the brakes yeah so it's it's good to jump on your arm liar trying to steer round your leg\nYour leg right they might be or something like that or throw up and then you're going to get all of that okay I've\nHad some are sickness issues with recess and he's cute but he's on his seat with his cover with his towel need some squeaked in it you know I couldn't I was in the middle of the\nWell that'd be going through a break we have coming on with this we're gonna be talking with Kate and her name is Keith Mac ball excuse the Florida State director and she's going to fill us in on what's going on politics you know\nA historic yes on Thirteen campaign launched in ... thinks it's going to fill us in on that cool so stay tuned she's going to be on with this for a couple of minutes you are listening to talk in pets [noise]\nThat and so since may twenty Seventeen that eighty seven injuries and sixty four broken bones that just one track wow\nAnd it's only in that county that is required to do that\nThat's correct because our state wide bill the industry fought I said we didn't get it across an excellent that they passed an ordinance that one town so you can you know think about with ten other additional attract eleven total in our state right it's it's it's\nDefinitely concerning an occupation is wonderful they make amazing pets and that's wonderful that's just fantastic ... that's\nNot what we're talking about right if ... talking about you know while they're on the track the the ... are really long but this is cool and inhumane does it don't\nGet injured or um you know die ... and and the numbers are the opposite die on the track so if if they're hanging off like that in area nearby to euthanize we don't have those numbers so we don't know a lot of not knowing\nWhat's amazing with this in the legislature um for a decade unsuccessfully so this is why this is just particularly exciting wow\nIt's amazing because I mean I've been hosting the show now for going on twenty nine years and I've done a lot of interviews on greyhound racing and not to promote it of course\nBut I heard the horror stories that if a dog doesn't make it in in the race and lags behind or whatever that some owners of actually taking them out to the fields and pretty much moment pretty much shot them yeah and then just less than there are buried them in the ground um and that I mean it goes to show\nThat um you know it's a ... it's not it's\nThe same about greed right at the end of the game and that's all about the money and so there's like this amendment is going to be on like the Florida ballot so it's not going to be a county to county right\nThat's ... that's correct It's on the statewide ballot the big one not this November So um you know and and there\nAre a number of other amendment but that's not what we're talking about this is this one is just about protecting dog right the very bottom so people have different opinions on on the other one that that\nThat that is what it is but we just really want to encourage people how ... whatever you think about the others or any of the other issues on the ballot just to go all the way to the bottom if you love dogs and I get most people do so what we're asking advocate and people say oh I Know all about that oh yeah but some people say I had no idea what people say we have dug racing in Florida seriously\nSo if I Know how your neighbors and friends to go All right now because I don't have that this so important we have this amazing opportunity to save thousands of dollars to get them out of the cages on couches and loving home and and we don't this does not come around every year this is a really remarkable opportunity and we're making history for adults\nYou know that this might be a stupid question but the thing is curious about what else are you were saying in Florida it's a big state for dog racing but there was a couple of states that have been with this amendment also beyond those other states or no\nNo no just for Florida this is just too bad I write this is illegal and forties date on like the only happening and five other states but again they have one or two tracks and Florida has eleven we we obviously have a good majority\nAbout six thousand or more greyhound in our track as we speak now\nYou know it's amazing 'cause a good friend of mine and I refer to him as my mentor in in in an animal world the because when I started doing my show\nTwenty eight twenty nine years ago or Roger ... and I became really good friends and which is why Jill one on um he was the he was on twenty twenty four years and then he uh would begin to president of the ASPCA you in New York and just a wonderful man I mean that was a man that\nWould take you under his wing and help you out and just just a great man but I remember the stories we would talk on the phone that he had to greyhound's but he rescued I'm from racing yeah and um he said they were like the ideal lap dogs he would they would just lay there on the couch with him\nAnd he loved it they are awesome dog they are they're wonderful wonderful dogs\nMhm there aren't what happened what would have all of these are the couch they're wonderful for the couch and companionship but it's good to keep going to lead if you're out there walking outside [laughter] any though yes it is another thing is though is Kate\nWalking outside of ... any dog though yes it is but the thing is\nThough is Kate if they come to this goes through and yes on Thirteen and the dog racing by you know twenty twenty that means that there is like any like a movie comes out when one Dalmatians everybody's breeding Dalmatians\nBut it's there's going to be a lot of dogs out their greyhound's had people have that won't walk them anymore if there's no racing you know the owners that I mean so I Would imagine there's going to be a number of them up for adoption or whatever uh hopefully they will destroy right\nBut they're good wrong and it sounds like an hour and a great dog they're awesome dogs even though they're big dogs and I know that's from clients that I've had and doing some work with different rescue group said I had no idea when I started training them it was just wonderful to see their nature\nOkay we've got about thirty seconds or so you have anything that you can put out to America and put out to the state of Florida\nWho sort go to protect dog dot org that protect dot dot org campaign that protect dog yes on Thirteen and check out our Facebook page Sherrod that great ads and video I can tell your
