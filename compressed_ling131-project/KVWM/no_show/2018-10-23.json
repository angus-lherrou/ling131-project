they can help people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who dealt that we went to the moon jump were joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station in orbit around the ... which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it's it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is going to be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission I mean ... let me tell you what this they call this the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay\nThe the the\nI call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay [laughter]\nThe the the\nHere's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal I Want to read you an office in Saskatoon now you're gonna have to pay to build the building and you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and\nIf you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a bill by pass on that he had to deal and this thing\nIs that I buy the swamp line you'd probably sell me what\nYou buy the swarm play and you probably want to sell me\nA lot better off with the swamp land than with this ... ...\n... you know with measles doing what he's doing falcon next base acts are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching NASA just cut and not do much anymore with manned space flights and it's it's disappointing Robert really is\nWell it is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and knocked up rebuilt the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon ah and\nAnd now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible\nUh I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we had a a major deterioration quality the political class in terms of its ability to execute great projects on to an act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan\nA chaos and the the the you know so there it is but uh I got to tell you you know\nI was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while\nWould come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what what the incompetence who preceded us uh you know want it to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the moon I was hoping brightest spine would do that but he didn't he just went along\nAnd I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance to witness the flight of one of the falcons a at night to another team back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the guys that night\nUh they didn't know what it was he thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was big tech you learn to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time uh because sure we started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get them to be usable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that mosque is done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and\nAnd he's reduced the cost of space launch by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram before must now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram dramatic\nIt's dramatic it's protect killer and it was done on a shoestring compared to um what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems\nI mean it was done like for one tenth the money in one third of the time that any one of ... was accepting would be normal and this thing um the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space\nAnd a number of other advanced fields that people thought were hopeless uh so okay Bezos has his own money's got large and but we now have three small launch companies a firefly a vector space um\nElectron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars a two to field a small launch systems\nAnd it even goes beyond the the us space industry we now have you shouldn't power startups getting funded\nBecause people you know they were looking at future parents all this is just never going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years and\nBut people can say maybe it's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the ... and um\nI gotta tell ya I actually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and I I can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around a table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be at a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably a start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what he's going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours next on coast to coast they\nAlways on your bones and you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized rule users just once your iPhone or Android ... to ... dot com and enjoy [noise]\nA driven to want to do\nSomething great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money he likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what he's about uh now he he he really wants to do he wants\nTo go down in the history books for doing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that\nHe doesn't just want to do great deeds he wants the terminal gory for doing great deep so he's not Mother Teresa he can be selfish he he um and he certainly um\n\nI'm not above using people ah and you know if you look at some of the things about him that um didn't come off so well like Kim getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand\nUm that that's the other side of it so yeah uh the the you know there is [noise] um\n... you know a self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it's it's selfish for eternal glory for doing great speeches eagle that\nIt's not in fact we go it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology might be well he had\nThis is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth\nYou know a a when you get to that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core to to fight the friends because he he even though the odds of war against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone\nSo you know that's must to AT T and um\nAnd and and so but really um\n[noise] you know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I I think must gives a hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that is a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant to goes out uh looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... that's what he's about but you know\nUm how would you ... just diesels Robert\nWell Jeff measles as much calmer I'm much more laid back\nUm I don't know these cells I met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh and if you look at how the two companies are run a they reflect at a\nMosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast or he wants everything done yesterday and um\nThe company takes chances and thus far um they're winning um bought is certainly a there they pushed very hard bees owes the model of his company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush\nThe cells strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why it is limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise]\nUm well in one sense it's obviously is a but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space sex is racing ahead of him so this is the you know ... the hair\nI'm a blue origin the tortoise\nAnd ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know measles is at least ten times as rich as mosque okay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also won a lot of contracts for watching things for NASA effort the military\n... just doing it all with his own money okay these shows you know is the richest man in the world ah and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon stock each year sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has unlimited time I'm mosque knows that\nI'm you know in aerospace a cost just people times time or the quicker you just do something the cheaper costs people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no it costs much less\nUh because\nUh you know a space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still or whether it's moving\nYeah that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in March what what's going on with some of these latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOh yeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European bought all these experiments or ex discoveries by the way are being made now with uh [noise]\nI'm suddenly it's not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar and his radar that can look through the ground and see what's underground\nAnd um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water\nUh and um but it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment um it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground\nAnd by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars it has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place I think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth\nSome of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth are still living deep underground and the groundwater the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the ground water\nIs is as it was billions of years ago and they've been down there and if there was ever life on the surface of Mars it would have retreated into that ground water and it'd be they're still\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American Mars Reconnaissance orbiter has found\nGlaciers on Mars at mid latitudes that is a a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA a million cubic kilometers\nOf pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust knows it's right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it's as far south is thirty eight or a north in the northern hemisphere of Mars which by the way the same latitude a San Francisco\nSo imagine that there were glaciers in San Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC you know that's the latitude that these things are\nAnd what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get out with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people this is strange some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think there's there's ... there there's two different versions of it one is the scientist\nSaying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay contamination\nYeah well that's like saying if you go to France you won't know if the people there are French or not I mean that that that because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean look if if it\nHow do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did well for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower this all this stuff that they built in the past\nWell if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and there will be fossils of it and\nI mean to to to say that fossils of life on Mars don't prove that the life you find there was there before is like the people who say that\nDinosaur bones don't prove that there were dinosaurs because God could have put the dinosaur bones in the ground and and and the world could have been made in seven days and there never was a geologic past it it's all been a a trick by\nTricky gods and and um I mean it's just absurd

like a a an obligatory kind of thing and I don't like it\nI I'd rather have just celebrate Thanksgiving again okay well anyway I think you said yourself up for go ahead okay a couple of other things

of my chair I\nTheir side of the house and here's ray talking into the remote control she wants to watch mom\nI hear you every so often from the kitchen I hear you in your office now their major

phil while you're in the bedroom and I'm In the office you and I am working and you're calling for Dr phil\nTwo and a Half Men [laughter] first ... oh here's a good thing traffic jams\nAll they're not going anywhere trust me it will soon be a reality thanks to driverless cars I I'm not sure about this now maybe I'm just being naive a\nSupposedly these cars are automatically driven we know that but don't make mistakes uh I beg to differ dust was All right well cars driving safe there should be no traffic jams exist on any road let me just\nGet through this one more time OK okay we had in Phoenix one death a woman who was working in a a ton of his car mhm\nHit somebody who ran out in the middle of the street on a dark street\nAnd the car hit them and died that one person this year there will be an additional thirty six thousand five hundred deaths on the roadway yeah\nOne in a driverless car and the state legislature passed a law banning them that which finally the governor came to his senses because he's up for reelection Mr do say\nAnd vetoed that bill and we will once again be in the town and the car business\nI saw something this morning about autonomous school buses\nMakes all the center of the world I Believe that if all cars were taught them is starting tomorrow the number of death on the freeway would go down from about thirty six thousand a year down to about two thousand a year\nNow I understand I don't disagree with that I I think for those two thousand people are affected it's a terrible thing to do something as dangerous but part of the reason why people get an accidents\nIs because if you're driving for more than an hour it can be tedious yeah you can lose focus ... engine or fall asleep\nSure what the tunnel those car\nI wouldn't mind believe or as much I mean it's nice to drive a fun car and all that but I Would not miss driving I just wouldn't it's not a a especially ... if you're going back and forth to work it's not like you're out for a drive but that's a very big piece of America\nIs driving driving your car but are you willing to give that up for thirty six thousand why I Would be I and I get bored\nAnd um and then finally got the job with the Pittsburgh Pirates\nEnded the pirates radio broadcasts for eight years that's right and then finally got the call what a call that must have been that day off to him and his wife barb and they said you've got the job you are the new voice of the Boston Red Sox\nHe hopes set the no just says that he hopes he'll be able to join us the day that they are on the road between games that would be great we would love that but he sent me a note because\nHe got to go there believe it or not his two sons Kyle and Matt ... are now both twenty\nAnd I'm a I Believe it's Kyle who is already a play by play announcer\nFor one of the Boston Red Sox minor league level a ball and so congratulations to them yeah nice family yeah I swipe great kids and mother and father were\nMore than gracious when we met them back in Nineteen Ninety One yeah\nYeah um so ... I'm it's just nice to see people's dreams come true and you know the things that they they both through to get there and uh it kinda restores your face and things\nYou know of another ... hours just him a ... just wrote back Craig tables that has to be a dream come true for you your family a new at the ballpark I almost tear it up\nYeah yeah and I and I we understand that I mean that's great and we're very happy for him it's great to have a friend in that position obviously because it means free tickets to games oh I see no I don't that's not what I care about it\nFor him to have that was the job of his dreams right to be able to work for the buck for any Boston Major we get to go to the Nineteen Ninety three\nAll star game together and he went to the old timers game and Reggie Jackson and in Grand slam in the bottom of the last inning when it's in the old timers game and he was\nThere was a little trip view and Joe ... valley in Kim that in New Orleans oh I Want to lose a real quick\nDemocratic congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio says everybody's cautiously optimistic that's the key word now cautiously optimistic about other ... terms he appeared on Fox\nStolen goods or working hard and you know campaigning on what we've done the past sixteen years and and turning around cities like Youngstown, Ohio like Akron, Ohio a lot of the positive things trying to diversify our economy but also what we're fighting for and it's his health care it's pensions\nIs making sure the young kids have an opportunity to live in our community then if they moved away to be able to come back by making sure we have a high tech jobs are being developed whether it's around the energy sector additive manufacturing sector\nSo it works either the campaign about that but we're also trying to help other candidates around the country to win a Democratic majority\nWell you know these races if you look you know you can't really take the national statistics you have to look at um race by race by race in a lot of these races across the board that are considered quote unquote tossup races very very close\nThere within a point or two one way or the other and this is gonna be an election about turnout and I think what you're saying and these house races are\nGerrymandered districts where we are extremely competitive look at Danny O'Connor in Columbus ohio he almost won a special election which is a Republican plus ten see Conor Lamb wind up Republican plus twenty see\nIn western we are doing extremely well\nIn some of these communities and some of these congressional districts in that's all going to get out the turnout so if you're if you're worried if you're concerned if you're a Democrat and you need to go start knocking on some doors and we can't send tweets

Arizona for shore North Dakota for sure maybe Montana and if they didn't have a libertarian in Indiana they win that race for sure but they've got a good shot beating Joe Donnelly in Indiana if people don't vote libertarian I'm On the house side it's very hard to get a feel forty retirements doesn't make it an easier\nOne of the show that's right but I think eighty eighty percent way too high\nAnd a little surprised the silver or for the second cycle rose going ... um you know the most recent survey indicates that in fact\nYou have 'em in the very closely contested districts and this was an NBC survey um that they actually are within about two points on the generic ballot well if if the contest districts out\nWe're losing the Democratic districts very badly where else are not so much money and then we're not campaigning in them we're not making our case a but but in the swing seats that matter\nA we actually are basically tied on the generic ballot and and all I can tell you is\nI I look at the issues that are going to matter ... two things happening you see this a little bit with Stacey Abrams\nUh in in Georgia the candidate for governor who explained today that she's opposed to free enterprise and health care because she she hates making a profit and you never do any good if you make a profit um and and she is just\nVery left wing cinema the Democrat in in Arizona for US Senate refuses to apologize for urging Americans to saying it's okay\nFor Americans to join the Taliban um\nWhat's happened in Minnesota now where I think ...\nMay drag down the entire chicken except for any closure they may lose a Senate seat house seats the governorship a because with Keith Ellison is just so totally left wing and unacceptable and so I keep looking around\nAt these patterns and uh I think what you're seeing is a remarkable moment where the ... for example when we were talking about ten days ago you and I were that this was a race between jobs\nAnd marched well if you look at the pictures coming out of Mexico right now you couldn't get a better picture of a mob and if you watch the Democrat I ask you\nCan you can you stay for another five minutes I Want to really get into this more deeply out there because it's the important where fourteen days out of an election two weeks from today you'll be boating and two weeks from tonight you'll be turning on your television sets and you're either going to have great news all the way around maybe it's gonna be a split decision or you're gonna have horrible news\nAnd you get to decide ultimately what that news is going to be this is where your vote actually matters this election counts and you've been shocked the world again and I'm confident that that can happen that can be the outcome I quit break more Newt Gingrich on the other side and later pastor Darrell Scott David Limbaugh much more [noise]\nYou know obviously this is the the mob mentality is coming from the left nor do I see Mr Speaker\nNor can I say or or elaborate on any one issue or program they're offering that will help the lives of the American people not one that's not what they're running on\nNo I look I I well they do run on a government run health care for everybody which they can't defend which which when you examine it collapses\nBecause is totally unsustainable financially and would be a nightmare to try to implement that's the closest thing to come to a big idea and it's a really bad idea\nI agree totally All right um we'll be checking in regularly fourteen days to go or do you believe the admission by this Georgia gubernatorial candidate that she burned the state flag or is that going to change that race now\nWell I don't think that that doesn't change the race for those the totality of her being a radical the fact that the organization she headed up may have filed twenty three thousand falls voting registrations for people who don't exist I mean I think the more we learn about the more trouble she gets to be\nAll right but I appreciate it thank you so much a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich let's get to our phones here uh oh I got to say Hi to big time AJ Houston, Texas he was the star at the

minutes on how much time do I have rich well let's not use that one let's start with Bill Clinton's Nineteen Ninety five state of the union cuts Seventeen go\nAll Americans not only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country oh did you stay home I'd otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrant\nThe public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers' no that's why our administration if moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards oh hoarding twice as many criminal aliens is ever before\nAbout cracking down on illegal hiring five\nOh it sounds like Donald Trump doesn't it oh my goodness racist neo Nazi obviously go ahead\nJulie lately in the budget will present you we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes to better identify illegal aliens in the work\nTo hear this Latinos Democrat\nParty goes either way they'll use you like they've used African Americans like they've used\nPoor white people in the rural areas of the country or this is a Democratic Party that uses race Democrat Party that was the party of slavery in segregation\nThe Democratic party that was the party of Jim Crow and poll taxes and literacy tests now it's the Democrat Party that attacks old white people and wants to use Latinos and African Americans to hold on to power\nIt's the same party it's a party a power centralized government anti constitution list go ahead\nAnd headed by former congresswoman Barbara Jordan we are a nation of immigrants but we are also a nation of laws it is wrong and ultimately ... for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years and we must do more to stop\n[noise] I don't remember the media\nCalling him racist fear mongering scary I don't remember that do you here's Obama on a legal immigration little over ten years ago cut Eighteen go\nWe all agree on the need to better secure the border and punish reporters who choose to hire illegal immigrants or you know we are a generous\nAnd wait a minute excuse me undocumented immigrants isn't that the line now undocumented that Obama racist neo Nazi language like that is very off putting go ahead\nBy the states but those who enter the country illegally and those were for them just respect the rule of law and they are the rule of law\nWell I just heard Gloria Borgia whatever the hell her name is and I heard them at work today show and good morning America\nAnd all the rest of them telling us no no no no no this is fear mongering this is race baiting Rockville house Benita Obama go head\nTo regard for those or bowling the law we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or become immigrants in this country\nAnybody remember the media trashing him for those comments when he was the United states senator anybody of course not how about Bill Clinton anybody remember the media trashing him in Nineteen Ninety five of course not\n[noise] for when I return [noise]\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nI spent years studying how to make this the best I didn't make this because I wanted to make a company other companies are starting to catch on to this and I buy every single other product that comes out so I can look at it and see it and test it and I fear that people will buy\nSome some counterfeit and take it for a couple of months and go to a bunch of crap doesn't work don't be fooled this is the real stuff we have absolutely the best process and I can say that because we purchase every single one and check them out\nI took everything that was on the market nothing ever worked for you have a war that is the first thing that's really worth

it's just not true\nIn my view from decision and the DACA program or some eight hundred thousand\nYoung people in the ... and most ugly presidential or in the modern just three of this country I cannot think of one thing though which is ugly and more cruel\nWe've all been educated but economics is about supply and demand if you don't get to work if you want your raise wages and you raised benefits you don't simply\nOpen the door and bring it all the work as a lawyer with I Believe I absolutely but we have the move aggressively toward comprehensive immigration reform I Will and the deportations\nIsn't quite\nI don't know why we need a million people coming into this country and guess working homework on lower wages than American workers and wages down even lower than like on right now\n[noise] but we have to send a clear message just because your child gets across the border that doesn't mean that child gets things so we don't want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journeys though I Will\nFight for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship\nI Will fight to stop partisan attacks on the executive action that would put dreamers including those with us today at risk of deportation and if Congress can refuse to act as president I Would do everything possible under the law to go even further [noise]\nWe've got to do several things than I Am you know adamantly against illegal immigration people half the stuff in for illegal immigrants\nCome up to west Chester showed is that they can Nassau County stand in the street foreigners in Brooklyn or the Bronx you're going to the lows of people waiting to get picked up and go do yard work in construction work and domestic were\nYou know this is not a problem that the people who are coming into the country are solely responsible for counting if we put them to work my proposal\nTo citizenship [noise]\nNumber of immigrants added the labor force every year as a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century if this huge influx of mostly most co workers provide some benefits the economy as a whole it also presents to the press further the wages blue collar Americans and puts a strain on an already overburdened safety net immigrants\nAre the principal reason wages haven't gone up\nThose immigrants' rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those were illegal we wouldn't legal status\nAt least ignore the laws on the books and put 'em in the deportation until\nWe have better loss but I Believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both on wives and unfair it would suggest to those thinking about coming here legally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision and this could lead to a surge in more illegal immigrant\nThese are students teachers they're doctors or lawyers they're Americans in every way but on paper\n[noise] those who enter the country illegally and those were four of them just respect the rule of law or and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nOr we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected for undocumented unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or does become immigrants\nReal reform means establishing a responsible pathway for earn citizenship\n[noise] so you see ladies and gentlemen the media change their position the Democrats change their position they work hand in glove\nThey work hand in glove\nThe media the mouthpiece for the progressive movement and the Democrats the activist base for the progress subhuman\nYou heard Obama Bernie Sanders Chuck Schumer Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton Harry Reid these are not just any Democrats these are leaders\nBill Clinton was President Obama was president Schumer the Democrat leader in the Senate Sanders is the leading progressive Harry Reid of course was the Democrat leader in the Senate\nWhat changed over a period of a few years\nWhile the objectives of the Democratic party and the left changed they used to be protection is trying to protect the AFL CEO and all the the unions under that umbrella then the AFL CIO and many of the unions under that umbrella not all decided that in order to increase their members\nThey needed to tap into immigration and particularly illegal immigration and that way they can increase their dues\nDemocrats also figure it out and this day after him to stay after amnesty leads to citizenship after citizenship after citizenship and they're counting on Seventy percent of people who come in here illegally eventually being citizens and voting for them\nIt was a report out the other day that Democrats are concerned that the Latino vote won't turn out as they expect the Democratic party is not a United party the Democrat Party since FDR is a party of disparate groups in disparate special interests\nThat's why it will never give up on el GB and so forth that's why it will never give up on race that's why it will never give up on a income redistribution it can't which she says the habit purpose it cannot
