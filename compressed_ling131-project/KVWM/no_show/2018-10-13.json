talking about the lack of climate credibility at the United nations now\nShared with you really well done a ... piece from the specter that put in context how wall United Nations has been on the climate prediction every single year for years\nYet for some reason they retain credibility for some reason we subsidize this nonsense for some reason and we know what the reasons are all political it's embraced by those on the left now\nI think any honest in decent person you are wrong if your way the heck wrong for your entire professional career somewhere along the way you you have a sense of you know maybe I should do something else\nBut if you are part of the left this climate science crowd\nYou're gonna keep on keep it on and they're going to keep on peddling your your nonsense and that's exactly what we've seen it's fascinating as you take a look at the entire way this thing came full circle you go back to the Nineteen seventies what was that it was the big global cooling and the ice age right\nDo I uh actually pulled earlier this week and the un report came out in the June twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy four times article that was based on this climate science called another ice age\nAnd then on April twenty eight Nineteen Seventy five Newsweek they published a story that cooling world because that's what was going on\nMan made global cooling\nAnd then somewhere along the way it's like oh crap that's not working out so then it became one in the eighties and nineties you'll remember what it was remembered how every aerosol can every little buffer that hairspray for that big eighties here that was another chunk out ... oh yeah\nThe elimination of the ozone layer\nAnd then somewhere along the way are like oh you know what the sun actually has something to do with the ozone layer and guess what if we actually dedicated the entire effort in this world towards eliminating it would probably couldn't because we're probably not going to be highly effective at taking out the sun oh and by the way some of those are holes [laughter]\nFunny thing how sunspots you know huh [noise] so that one way and then what did it become well is global warming and we got global warming for many years Frank and then ... oh\nNot buying it to go from global cooling we go from the ozone layer to global warming to something that actually Israel does something that's actually real to climate change\nAnd that is how they completed the corrupt circle because climate change Israel always has been always will be funny things happen we'd had ice ages we've had periods of extreme heat\nWe've had a minimum of three mass\nExtinction events all remarkably enough before we were even on this planet\nIt must have been on like the the dinosaur flatulence you know like a cow farts they actually are more polluting than than like a you know cars so if you just had if you think about it is it the pita crowds are really thinking about this for a moment if we don't eat meat\nI I mean what happens you care more about the the cow or do you care about uh you know your your climate change there because he got you know we have more cows what's going to happen\nThis is a real moral dilemma you should consider this\nAnyway apparently or what happened was a bunch of dinosaur flatulence and ... flatulence ended up leading to a master extinction events

secondly bicycle stadium provides the youth were they the state you won't be able to vantage Utah games are sold out over forty five thousand on here it's an intimate setting limited space between the

games that includes the last of Washington earlier this season Wildcats at one or two of their last three years right circles mid October of course the weather\nCan be a factor it won't be tonight it was a beautiful sunny day today no when it is going to be risk and I do mean brisk by Arizona standards\nForecast forty seven degrees a kickoff tonight alright love I Love it whenever we go on the road subjective turnovers comes up because limited mistakes is always important to get on the road or at home last week's games for example\nWildcats force for California turnovers turn that into fourteen points Utah force for Stanford turnovers turn that into Seventeen and I go back to last year's Arizona Utah gave juice on the Wildcats out please use really in every phase of the game\nTurned the ball over five times and lost thirty to twenty four so I'm not going to sit here and say turnovers will determine the game tonight but guess what could turnovers determine the game tonight it almost always does in\nParticularly in this type of the game Utah the defensive minded team and they like to keep away like great special teams so when you're playing a team that beat themselves one way that you can lose games by turning them all over in in so Arizona has to not make any mistakes and that in that vein and they just have to get to play a clean game\nAll right you touch the fence

five\nCats have for first down to the age of fourteen\nYeah I'm not much too much into what we say about this one it\nTotally they're being totally dominated every aspect of rushing the ball to being

Rhett Rodriguez\nRodriguez here this year\nOut a shock on second down to\nAbout\nThirty five that's maybe an up or down right at the end of ten\nReps very efficient in the past and game very Haiti quarterback and he does a great\nJob of reading a defense so we often throwing down Rodriguez\nWays of lay\nDown a ten minute thirty three left or that\nYou talk\nThe decision by Rodriguez it throw it away no one was open that time no need to take a shot here throw it away a lot of other play\nNow some of the year on the season\nThe nine yards you'll line up out of the shock yeah I'll check it down into\nFires brown\nThe side of yard line about forty hours on the boy he's a lawyer that she was little I only\nSaw high safety that time covering sound brown ran Rodriguez made a pre freeze not breathing got rid of barley\nHanging in there should brown rivers down\nRodriguez hanging in there too you should brown rivers down\nRodriguez again very fishing in the pocket the in the field very well right now identify John Brown deliver\nPass for the first down more left or the first efforts down there was one of the market or the yard line Rodriguez back\nAnd you're\nReally a black man was uh about could have shot but Rodriguez got rid of\nPlay by red suck it out into the Arizona forty nine fifty nine seconds to wrap\nMy regular phone line up with two men white what to do the right\nChecking with the near side\nThat near sideline did you learn from\nLeft side Rodriguez will take us\nTo the sideline getting all the way I Want to open up you\nRight decision got forced out of the pocket receivers when they see him rolling through the side like that they got to just try to give them some given something they just stopped on air routes and just watch them under the sideline\nThe first yeah as a forty\nHave made the cats and I believe you call a timeout seven seconds one in the house\nYou agree with the attack on the ground\nSo forth down\nSeven the Wildcats will help the ball away and how what do you\nHave to say wait a minute we got forty seven seconds what we've already daughter sixties yard touchdown parents do not have all that I was assuming that's what he's\nThinking there is is not going to do that they're going to try to get a first down which I agree with\nAt this point so they got nothing to lose here and they're down by twenty eight points they need to try to score\nUtah will have one more time out\nTo shut down\nWildcats convert obviously they keep the ball\nIn your heart rate will take the\nA play by red Rodriguez he's still he's scared right down the barrel that time knew he was going to take a shot he got hit low ... and he would uh accurate pass for the first great job I read Rodriguez Cedric\nPeterson the catch was down in Arizona and Utah thirty nine Rodrigues will take that step on first out\nFive\nTime out called were twenty six seconds and a half\n\nIn a city and the sack Rodriguez the forty five\nSeconds sack of the year\n... minutes west Jordan Utah\nArizona just open the gate that's on it was on the left side it looks like a little ... got to the inside and ended up giving up that fat\nSo that was the Wildcats last time out of that out\nUtah is one Romania twenty six seconds here but I don't know what he would call a timeout\nWildcats if they don't get a first down here\nScramble in a hurry Rodriguez out of\nThe shock yeah Utah forty five yard that\nThe middle and\nSure if they were set up a screen there were\nManager and they were to hit Rodriguez\nThe ball and chain\nGuardian good it is a poorly executed for you then they let everybody go that\nWas on the road at Tulsa in the American athletic conference and it was a great ball game with what for Tulsa surprisingly in control for most of the second half but us have stormed back with sixteen on answered fourth quarter point nailing a game winner with two seconds remaining for eight twenty five twenty or victory\nUs ever made beaten at six you know when the when\nAlso at play tonight out of the mountain west Airforce take the visit to San Diego state for the kids are having a bit of a rough year but took the first of two steps towards the commander in chief trophy by hammering kept me about the Lolo and navy last week thirty five to seven tonight's game got off to us\nForget about the low low and navy last week thirty five to seven tonight's game got off to a slow start San Diego state for to touch on its first possession of the ball game and then there were seven straight points combined between the two deep five of them free and out the game has been flat out\nDominated by the defense\nSings it should\nBe the final flight of the first quarter ... avenue in trouble\nWith the\nSame thing you just put the\nPressure on and do what he took a step back and Jackson from\nThem in the end zone Jim Arthur on the air force ... sports network on the call that made the score seven to two and the difference in the ballgame currently is a San Diego state has its aren't touched down the Aztec leading fourteen an item\nMidway through the third quarter but the game is on hold for a lightning delay yes they are in San Diego\nNot exactly a common occurrence so on that note that's it for games tonight a quick rundown of tomorrow's late for you first impact will play there are two juicy games to pay attention to kicking at twelve thirty is number seven Washington in Eugene to take on seventeenth ranked Oregon a few weeks ago I suggested it Herbert had sneaky good NFL potential\nBut that potential isn't so sneaky anymore Justin Herbert rank seventh of the nation in quarterback rating by the college metric and its fourth of the country and yards per attempt\nThat as a rising I bet if al ... is a potential first round pick\nAnd according to Washington head coach Chris Petersen elevates it already solid often do you want to leave\nOne even an average quarter back back back there and I think they're going to be really good because of how they run the ball and wouldn't you know you're trying to come into our resources to soften the wrong then all of a sudden that pass game opens up in a couple of that when we throw our problems for defense\nOregon holds a foreign one record against Washington when both teams Iraq most recently winning twenty Thirteen behind for total touch downs from Marcus ... also a conference laid off but I think Colorado at USC the bus ticket commanding packed well south lead with ...\nBut they would have to break clay helping the scene it all home record to do so and there's another restricted after break us see has never lost to Colorado twelve it all the time\nIncluding a Ford Omar between the current head coach's player over\nMike McIntyre that's it

seventh against Houston Baptist but prior to that wild cats have to exhibition games and of course the red blue game which comes up this Sunday\nGone the entire storyline up from last year which means for coach Miller up a new law but maybe not a different look more traditional this year\nAnd a you know and I hope that we can get some benefits because of that certainly uh we don't have the height besides the rebounding but maybe we can make up for it with a able to match up better on the perimeter\nSo without the twin towers the Wildcats will have a different look this year\nI think there's going to be more space on the court you know we've been playing to Biggs really moving forward I think to have more ball handling more skill on the court and maybe one true big is is maybe the route that we're moving if that makes this play a little faster than then so be it\nAnd as always John Miller says practice will determine who plays the most\nWe try to make our practices into a highly competitive environment you know we talk a lot about it\nAnd uh we challenge our guys to compete in and get ready for for games you know you just you don't have that magic wand and on game day all of a sudden you're different\nYou know you try to prepare as best you can for everything but mostly the intensity of of what a game requires and how you do that is is you know the environment you create everyday\nSix new faces will be on the Wildcats roster this season but also some returning veterans will be expected to step up including sophomore guard Brandon Randolph out of Yonkers New York we started four games last year and I talk to him about the upcoming season\nI mean just this summer you know I've just been working really hard on my game in my body so um it's not that I really didn't do is just that like I've been working extra hard and you know I Know people are dying of the season so you know that's just my motivation this year you know the\nThird to prove people wrong I guess\nYou know that's the biggest motivation and basically we have high expectations for ourselves so you know I just don't want to get any lower than that you know okay what\nDid you learn last year as a freshman that you say okay I can be a much better player if I Do this as a sophomore\nI just believe about taking smarter shot and by just getting my body right you know uh I definitely think um improving and both of those you know learning from those past players like though in Raleigh seeing how they play the game and I'm just practicing with them all the time you know that just\nAllows me to improve on my mind game like on a you know\nLast season of course he had a couple of seven quarters inside it's going to be different this year how how different do you think this team is going to look a no matter who's on the court\nI mean we have a lot of garden season so uh and we have a lot of big yard so I think just by us being more aggressive and rebounding and just helping out our actual like big you know that's going to you know it's not going to really be that much of a difference you know\nYou don't have much coach of stresses defense or what has he told you so far what do you guys hope to do defensively I mean\nDoes he told you so far what do you guys hope to do defensively I mean\nWe kind of just learned from last year like how important the advantage that were just like continuing on from last year and just getting better and better and you know we're just honoring the process you know so uh yeah that's our biggest thing and\nI think we're definitely going to improve and be a lot better than last year\nOnce again the Wildcats play their red blue game on Sunday afternoon there first exhibition game is on Tuesday October thirtieth against western New

here I just ah maybe I'm just being overly sensitive I just think it was necessary to\nPlay like that when you you got the game in\nThis way\nWe do that soccer player that's one way of looking at it but the other thing is you got down you're\nGoing to continue on a fake fake\nIt just it's just that one but you know you say I don't\nTo see that happen to their team but what it is very bright well go to a really deep man of and kick off your cable line it up with a thirty five\n\nWhy Dr kick it will\nOver the unlikely touch back some studies on twenty four\nAnd a you know I guess the only thing you can look at it this way I guess what you will be at Arizona Stadium next year\nEverybody better look every single player on the scene better look at that like I remember it because that's what they think of you for a quarter\nOr up by playing on a fake gun we're trying to humiliate you is what they're trying to do in some market down\nSo first then we'll get to grow twenty five but Rodriguez tonight Seventeen or thirty two to twenty two and a touchdown GD of his Arizona career\n\nHill high school in Vacaville\nUtah forty five year olds who\nHas not caught up tonight I don't know if he's even been targeted was intended receiver they're real Burgess is a strong safety on the cover\n\nDown to twenty five Rodrigues will take the passenger side caught by very hill and wrestled out

week\nOn the air from Pasadena at six thirty AM tick off at seven thirty against the\nUCLA grew apart by\nA company that's where you tell will take over first outage and thirty seven year old boy\n\nAnd you could conceivably run out the clock here by the way UCLA it's been a tough guys are worst start since Nineteen forty three they play at Cal Berkeley tomorrow if the Bruins lose again they would be only six when the Wildcats arrive\nMentioned Washington Oregon\nAnd that's a huge game and we talked about us see Utah next week how 'bout that one tomorrow at the coliseum that should be a good I think I'll or\nOf the hottest team for the fact that\nSilly hands off\nA little\nNo separate degree\nGo by the\nSecond call it's Saturday Night they called him a T H E G agree to a gym or high school track apple either\n\nOf you to your milk the clock clock sounded really will wind up\nHe's out of the shock and awe\nTo your show the first yeah we were down there to juries\nWallace attack the various tonight career night that just loving tackle\nAnd like I said you'd rather not have a safety review and tackles\nA kind of how this one's gone\nReally to the office that Utah I was on a very similar to what Arizona did last year it's a really\nOff and it just comes down to the whole game thirty to forty years\n\nReally sets them up your work out of the shotgun takes this that and they had a\nGreen cycle I Believe shy to bring down a marker\nSo it'll be worth less than a yard\nUtah early ready to the ball away\nThree minutes going to watch the fake yeah they did it once I don't think they do it again but for the past ... years to do is right\nInside the let's go\n\nAgain the kicker for Utah was now the one the guy I work two years ago is\nThe best part of the nation and then of course back gate was the Lou grows award winner last season is the best place kicker in Asia\nYeah they always have a novel\nA ball just died want to hit the ground John Brown did the right thing when the ball landed inside of the yard line the rules or you're not supposed to feel that he let it go and he just died\nSo the cats\nHe let it go and he just died\nSo the cats from the road to yard wipers down into\nForty to to to talk with two thirty three to go you're on the board\nWell let's get to the insects\nI Love\nReally good inside runner I think he may be our best inside runner on the team downhill really fast friends is pretty hard to eat right away like a downer to add up again this I'd write well nowhere to go back over by thrill purchase\nSo that'll be up there to visit these six pluck your the forward forty Utah\nHas tried to bowl here [noise]\n\nCoverage\nSo Bahrain a catch the ball back red Rodriguez Nineteen thirty six for two twenty six and a touchdown\nI Know what the locker room show on the Arizona I Am Xi's point is that more interviews scores of full game reject the thoughts of head coach Kevin some that are all now back to the broadcast booth here again the voice of a wild jazz Brian Jeffries\nUsed to be wild guess forty to this is yeah you touched one free in a row in the series\nNow after a Arizona had won four straight from Utah cats on the road next week at UCLA they've just posted on the scoreboard that\nOh you have to exit the field I thought they were going to tell us we had to be out of the state of ever big clock on the scoreboard right now on the video board that says please exit the field in Eighteen minutes and twenty seconds of the clock is running\nA I guess yeah we're safe they'll let us hanging around here for a little while All right a lot and I'll ask coach someone that's in a few minutes but\nAh Utah was just too physical tonight on defense and really to physical on offerings and we go back to the number of tackles that they were able to break on runs I go back to that\nThat first half and at first drive by Utah twice on third down\nThey ran it and converted because they broke tackles the Wildcats hit the ball carrier behind the first down marker but couldn't tackled him and\nAnd that helped fuel that opening drive in it happened more than that\nLater on but it kind of set the tone\nIt really did um and you know you never see your team you know\nWith poor fundamentals out there but that's that's what that is tackling his rapping guys up and getting them to the ground and so you know I Know they're going to look at the film and they're gonna know they got to go back in ... I'm sure they're going to go back to practice and they're going to be working but uh that's what happened and I I mean Utah Utah ... every time they got you know a ... a catch you know it seemed like they record\nTackle every time it looked like Arizona had them stopped in the ... you know the broken tackle in in those types of things just you know the correct about but you know you don't like to see that here we are well how many games and the seventh game seven you know it shouldn't be shouldn't be seeing that type of thing right now\nAnd walk it's been some opportunities deny it must have bill goes into the first African it would not have changed necessarily the outcome of the game but a chance to get just any momentum at all it didn't get that and then\nThree times turned the ball over on down in situations where they had to go on go for it on fourth down and could it could not convert you taught me in well converts on three fourths downs including a fake part after the game was a well\nIn the bag for the use ah alert down the Wildcats six of Eighteen tonight you tell ended up at five Thirteen that's crazy thing is that you know the second half Utah didn't have near as much success on third down as they did in the first step but\nYou know they built that thirty five now the leader early in the third quarter so sometimes those statistics or get a little bit on the meaningless side right there running the clock\nBasically is what they were doing at the end of the game shortening the game\nYou know the Wildcats ended up running nine more plays in Utah and that's deceiving\nUtah got the two big place tonight you warned us about that before the game tonight that as as conservative as you talk and be sometimes just in the sense that they loved it they how do you what the ground game and they're very good at that very physical or\nThe then to come up with those two big pathways the fifty a hundred and sixty eight you order a you know those that that's when they become dangerous when they can pull that off yeah when you run into ball\nAs well as their running it what since that happened is you start seeing those safety start creeping up closer to the line of scrimmage\nIs there running it what since that happened is you start seeing those safety start creeping up closer to the lack of scrimmage and\nAnd everybody starts getting close to the line and that's what they want you to do is they start seeing you know you start bringing extra guys into the box that's when they're going to go over the top on you and they obviously had to speed on to get behind Arizona defense and when they got behind him it was over so yeah they they had a great they had a good game plan and they executed it\nOr to a T this Utah team a lot of people again after those back to back losses to the Washington schools a lot of people would kind of dismissed\nUtah but uh to come back and win at Stanford last week so impressive and ah even more impressive here tonight as they beat the Wildcats forty two to ten more of a post getting coverage coming up after this on the road I N G sports networks\nAre you ready to take your finances to the next level with

Wildcats will be on the road again next week at UCLA for seven thirty kick off at the rose bowl will be on the air at six thirty some of the talk of course\nBetween now and then we'll concern Arizona's quarterback situation cool states are paid started tonight uh got that left the ankle re twisted again on a tackle and a hell hung in there I think what was another player too and then was\nDone or Jabari joined are the two freshman came in rent three series\nOf was three or four through the air for for Seventeen yards but the ... really wasn't moving and so red Rodriguez took over there at the end of the\nSecond quarter let the Wildcats down field they got in the field goal range miss the field goal and then Rodriguez played the entire second half that quarterback he finished twenty thirty eight through the year for two hundred and twenty six yards and his first Arizona touched then obviously all those numbers are career eyes for Rodriguez um\nHe is not a dual threat quarterback like a tape or joiner is\nBut as we talked about I think everybody's aware he's been in the system uh he's he's a very intelligent young men he knows football he's grown up around it all his life and you can see is very comfortable are running the off in ... and was able to keep the Wildcats going in the second half I mean you look at the drives Arizona the second half\nOf that first one they went three un out then they got the field goal then they after the interception they drove down to the five yard line that's when they went forward on Fort down and it didn't convert came back then scored a touchdown and the forty two yard run again got the ball back drove down to the Utah thirty two but could not convert on fourth down and\nThen a a point on the last second to last possession or give it up again or at the end of the ball game there on down so I guess that would actually be four times tonight\nTurned the Bull Run down if that really makes a difference but anyway you know read look very composed out there and uh like I said the talk will be now depending on what Kevin something he may announce it right away or who's going to start a quarter back next week yeah and so if ... is healthy\nMaybe he's back you know or if not what do you do I mean\nI I'm not opposed to the city and um and letting him just get healthy if if if that's what the cases because right now I I think a a a half\nHalf ... half way in the game pillows not it it does doesn't it doesn't benefit the team I'm In a at least ... was able to move move the team up and down the field I'm without really you know having a game plan around his strength so\nYou know now they will actually have a chance to go in in game plan\nFor a week in and it really puts in place and therefore him um you know a lot more place underneath stuff and a lot of you know plays in the last week and get the bottoms and quickly you can develop a game plan around the strengths and maybe that's what they have to do um for this week I don't know but uh\nHe he he he obviously was comfortable in their um looked good he moved to a teen you gotta you gotta you have to pay attention to that you've got to get credit for doing the\nWildcats have three more games before there by week so when you're talking about trying to recover from a high ankle spraying\nAnd a couple of guys with a couple more catches

Jerry's Wallace had excellent game tonight occur high eleven attack holes in the contest\nIs great and he played well then I Know Richard sophomore I'm thirty six tackles on the season in arena at eleven tonight or the bad news is the Wildcats top three taxpayers tonight we're all defensive backs yeah and you don't want to see that\nNo no they're ... they're getting my titles for last but you know you're right you don't want to see those things coming down field and that just that was just the nature of the game tonight you know Utah was running the ball down Arizona's throat and they really\nYou know there wasn't very much I could do about it um except just trying to you know trying to keep it together out there and that's that's pretty much what they were doing but they got dominated up front and uh and that's that's when you start seeing the safety is making tackle getting dominated from\nOnce the coaches go back to the game film I'll be interested to find out\nA a how many tackles were broken by Utah and then who allowed that in other words\nYeah I'm I'm not trying to point fingers I just want to see the stats was there is a one or two guys that they weren't making tackles and others were in position I had a hand or our arms on the ball carrier or but couldn't bring him down and\nAnd that's what we saw in the first happened coach talked about it and a half time you cut talked about it in the ballgame there you know that\nIt didn't necessarily mean that the Wildcats rental when did I did they did make tackles but it just allowed Utah to keep the ball keep the drive going and obviously school yeah it really did\nAnd that that was that was the thing that stood out to me tonight that\nYou're not in a positive way it was just the amount of broken tackles and that's one of those things where you know the only way to fix that is you just go back to the drawing board in in just fundamentals and it just you know go on some for some live practices live tackling drills and you just gotta keep doing it till you get it right\nBut that's what it's going to come down to and and they know that these guys are not you know what to do what they got to do so and I go back to the drawing board and try to get better\nAlright Monday Night we'll talk to someone about that and of course look ahead of the UCLA game a week from tomorrow Monday Night Kevin

recommendations that I might not have heard of yet\nOh definitely give me a a call or email me certainly sage loosen up emotional energy it loses up negative emotional energy soldiers Franken sense\nCoal poll there's many substances that worked very very well loosening up energy is kind of like spring something on the wall to get something off of it\nBut it does in the long get rid of the\nHome see that's the problem is is that the age will release it\nYou know out into the atmosphere but it will not moving from your home will not removed from your living environment it has to be actually pushed down\nInto the earth and away from the property in order for it to be removed because essentially what I think is going on here TJ is you've you've been releasing it by doing these you know really positive things stage\nBreaking sense all of these things you recommend them certainly but we're releasing them into the atmosphere they still have to be released from and pushed out from the home in order for them to be out of your life and I think it was going on is that is just accumulated\nOr to the point where it's all around you and you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home and this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things you know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work\nAnd to some extent but emotional energy in negative spirits and all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kind of like you know picking the booming pushing it all the dust into the center of the room we still have to take a dust pan\nYet the you know a broom and get in the dust pan into the garbage has got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening All right\nThanks for them now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy Jeffrey\nPeople generate both positive and a ... a negative emotional energy from the very first day that were born shortage\nAnd these things can become trapped in our bodies energy feels also known as the or up but the or is not just a bunch of pretty lights it is who we are as part of who we are personality our our emotional systems\nHave an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is our spirit or maybe three or four feet\nOutside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped over a period of time in just about everybody\nHas the issue so emotional energy this negative that we generate can be trapped in our bodies energy field and we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's home or watching television or you know\nA pub Z every place there is emotional energy and our bodies energy fields have you done to protect ourselves and most people don't that it actually permeates into our energy field\nMixes with our own emotional energy\nPositive and negative and causes havoc and this is one of the biggest problems that people would call me have it's not always just demonic spirit the idea is is that we are filled full of emotional energy on the positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let go of\nSee I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let go of what we want to let go of ...\nAnd so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy negative emotional energy is something that people want to really\nI bet they feel a hundred percent better when it's going natural let's go to Terry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show Jerry go ahead\n[noise] ah yeah George or I guess what I'm a ... of the original language that the scripture and I'm actually writing a book called the we really go out and I tell you the Bible in the navy where the guy I've dealt with a lot of the party a thing and I was\nGonna ask you Jeffrey are you a Christian\nI don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in God I also think that ah the argument over creation is a theories and a scientific physical theories is ridiculous people work hand in hand\nFirst print will is creation spirits don't just sit around and clouds and do and do nothing higher spirits angel God you know they create almost like a battery of a cake\nOn a non physical level the design of the universe\nAnd then comes the physical filled the non physical proceeds the physical so the idea that you know creation is does that happen is the universe created absolutely but also the big bang theory why not so\nEspecially like I said like baking a cake you know that spirit guide angels are in the business or in a wonderful business of actually creating and designing these things\nPerpetually right now as we speak not just in the beginning of time but right now and that filters up it's connected with the physical all things physical so each person has to levels\nOf physical body which is very finite\nSixty eight years or Fifteen Years or whatever and our spirit which is completely a turtle in her personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that or not you have but I mean that is being fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with\nI'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially\nSwipe believe in all of this is science to me\nYou know and I think that you know God has a personality\nYou know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time and I respect that religion\nAnd so I you know I think when you're doing this marvelous you know I I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to a jury for the other question go ahead Jerry\nUh yeah what I was gonna say is you're talking about religion religion teaches at ... and the guy go to church give your money do this don't do that that's not from got\nThe problem is is that we have many ministers out there that teach\nUh this type of stuff then basically do they make money off the guy the problem is with the with the whole scenario as it turns people off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know this\nBut you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion it's it it it's the relationship between you and God now why is that\nWell to be an arbitrator you have to be God man Jesus is title is Jesus\nIs Lord Jesus Christ lord needs dia de Jesus means humanity and writes means anointed why\nOkay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on the surface in fact\nIn fact Peter said that I'm a ... that God is no respect or a person but we're all in the same boat no matter how much knowledge we know we're all the same boat with God\nBecause we have is the nature because we're we're born in stand because of Adam's then because we carry out and then uh our entire life we we are and and even all that is that that none of us are the glory of God we were all in the same boat\nBut those demons seemed to be every where we're going to come back and take final calls

California is with us say Thomas\nCharge thank you for taking my call sir and Jeffrey great work that you're doing Jeffrey my question is about war and the battle field in war zones how tell us\nMilitary personnel men and women\nIn a battle situation protect themselves from the Monica salt I'm not talking about\nJust battling insurgents physically but there must be a lot of demonic energies in a wartime battle field situation\nAnd you have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves I\nDo I was in the air force myself many years ago um and especially there are messages through our rules on the other side\nOf motion all energy that we all generate in in his or in the battlefield hatred and anger and fear and there's killing going on and so it certainly is a a a place where negative spirits are attracted to demonic spirits negative spirit says well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up and strengthen our energy field there are methods there are rules on the other side like there are physical rules so there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves to protect us from the effects\nThat negative energy that is generated by other people fear around us were just natural and a battle situation\nOr emotional energy that's just you know so intense on the battlefield there are multiple layers that can be applied that actually work so that negative energy actually bounces off of us\nThis is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know uh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves in the military\nYou just have to learn how to do them they're actually very simple and it can you know take the stuff I designed over the years\nWith the help of my spirit guides can be brought up in five or ten seconds\nYou need it fast you know the old style was doing things tend to minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening I read all that stuff when I got into the service ten minutes in the morning and ten minutes and the evening\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know we didn't we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us\nWe need to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately in order to deflect negative emotional energy ah this being generated by the enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the killing and and also also uh off the fear and here so I think that it's very important that we all learn that this kind of thing and it's a science it's not a religion what ... what I'm involved in is not religion\nI Would not even to say it's really metaphysical is non physical science\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say\nScientist or not call me up and argue with me they are right I deal with non physical science which essentially is the non physical part of our body are emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body\nThat is susceptible to attack and also negative emotional energy by negative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad scariest situations\nHave you seen demons attack businesses and why did they do that\nDo it in order to destroy\nA person's life a hack the fabric of the family in the best way to do it is to pull out the resources money George to get it out\nIf they destroy your business and they have a two fold thing going on they have people that are fired that have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home it can cause people to lose their place\nOr where they live all sorts of problems that could cause them to feel bad and actually react\nSometimes violent Lee and also it has an effect upon the actual business environment where now you have a failed business I think of most restaurants they fail within a year so restaurant after restaurant come sitter business after business comes in\nAnd you have problem is a field dismisses and that has an accumulation of emotional energy as well plus you have all the people working uh who don't necessarily get along it's kind of like our our second family we have a family at home and we have our family at work and everybody doesn't get along\nAnd so essentially have a lot of emotional energy people at work were sitting at their desks and maybe thinking I really hated here when they're doing that they're generating emotional energy\nAnd it can it can be positive or negative emotional energy but sometimes it's negative accumulates in the environment this also attracts negative spirits and demonic spirits\nBecause if they can get somebody fired by you know doing or saying something\nUh you know inappropriate or a you know simply not doing their job or she'll be destroying the business itself by making of a the business atmosphere very uncomfortable emotionally everybody's got a story about walking into a living environment a pub or a business a restaurant and saying you know what\nThe living environment a pub or a business a restaurant and saying you know what this place doesn't feel right what they're picking up on George is emotional energy\nWhether it be good or bad that's emotional energy they're picking up on\nEverybody has the story of that this place doesn't feel right is emotional energy and it needs to be cleared out so they attacked businesses because\nThey can actually make a business failed you might have two hundred or two thousand people out of work and now they're really unhappy they go home and there are arguments with their significant others with their kids and a and then it just snowballs\nNext up let's go to the Monique in sun ...

they hear him and and what are they doing a why are they interfering with humanity and people actually blamed the watchers for humanity's ills\nAnd that's one very definite point of view but then the other point of view is that\nThey were here they came from the heavenly realm from the rump called science and according to the Bible the location of God's throne they're dispatched to earth in order to bring a new teaching to humanity a teaching about\nHow humans can transform into angels and make the journey from the early rounds to the heavenly realm of sigh on\nIt it seems that that what's happened in the intervening centuries and by the way it was the watchers were briefly mentioned in the Old Testament and the book of genesis\nAnd that it's the scenes about a hundred and fifty years before Jesus all of a sudden there's this rise of astounding what's known as apocalyptic material developed by the ... the idea scenes\nApocalyptic simply means that a human man is in contact with an otherworldly being a supernatural being an ... being maybe even an extraterrestrial some people's view\nWho delivers knowledge about another supernatural world and this then became an explosion of of knowledge about the watchers\nAnd the ability of humans to cross over what the church considers a forbidden boundary between flash and light between spirit and flash\nNow these scenes did they not whites did she schools as well\nThat's exactly right the scenes there's no question that that after the destruction of the temple of Solomon and eighty Seventy when the scenes were attacked the Roman army came into into Jerusalem into Galloway the scene bundled up their sacred tax which there were many\nHit them in caves and they were last until Nineteen forty seven when they were were rediscovered and this is when modern consciousness really begins to [noise] to understand the full story of the watchers\nThe watchers are the angelic ... realm are they from\nTwo schools of thought there's some that believe that they're simply and only human beings ancient pagan royalty existed maybe going back to the time even before the flood and the that they were able to survive the flood and then continued with new blood lines after the time of the flood\nThe second point is that they are and this comes from the Bible as well as the dead sea squirrels that they are celestial beings light beings ephemeral beings who had the ability to phase into physical manifestation they could take flesh and blood bodies\nAnd face back and forth by the way between flesh and blood and their their light being status\nAnd then infiltrated human affairs\nThat sounds interesting to me when\nThey are and this is where it gets kind of disturbing because as you can get begin to research the watchers it's you're presented with a crossroads you're either going to take the tack that they are purely evil and their demonic as many people do\nAnd if you take that path it's going to lead you down to the path where you're following their offspring who recalled than to feel them as these giant beings with the Longate its goals in in this whole axis of research which is very interesting\nBut if you're following that path chances are you are not probing deeply behind the tax and into the tax\nLeft by the scenes and you realize that the scenes themselves\nWere utilizing ancient texts and teaching that they are developed and synthesize from ancient Babylon Egypt Iran Iraq the teachings of the factor is\nThat were centered on how do we contact the watchers\nOne and two how do we transform ourselves into angels and in fact this is what the Dead Sea scrolls are all about is this is seen this group of the scenes Jewish mistakes a hundred and fifty years before the time of Jesus who were utilizing these teachings\nTo congregate with the angels the holy ones the angels are the lord\nThe watchers and work transforming their bodies into\nLight in other words into angels\n... which of course in the book of genesis sue me either fallen angel I'm not sure what do you think\nI don't think so because when you look at the morality of the the meaning of the word ... it's far far from established fact the term fallen angel is means that the are evil beings or that they are being who were are somehow demonic\nThey their fallen because they came out of the higher vibration or if you will heavenly realms and took human body that is their great sin they crossed what the church establishment views as a forbidden boundary you're not\nWhat the church establishment views as a forbidden boundary you're not allowed to cross over from flesh into spirit with out God's permission and this is the whole crux of the question did the watchers when they descended from the heavenly realms and took on physicality ...\n\nAgainst the will of God and that that's going to determine your whole viewpoint about the watchers and what happened was that early church fathers based on some of the work of the scenes and others\nSimply decided that they were demonic beans that they were a powers that were beyond human control\nAnd certain humans began teaching that we need to avoid the watchers at all cost do not seek to transform yourself into an angel without God's permission because in order to actually what the church terms is a sand or experienced\nThe rapture you have to be invited by God and that's the great crossing the line that the watchers\nTranscended are crossed over and came to teach humans and how to do how to turn into angels\nWilliam in your book to watch as you do talk about a luminous clouds were gods rude on them to me it sounds like ... we'll it sounds kind of you of ... doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean in in the New Testament the Greek word for clouds is in the field which is the ... where we get the word into feeling from and so these are cloud riders and when you as I did in my book and in the watchers book I collected\nVarious examples of today a Judeo Christian art that shows the watchers including a Jesus riding upon cloud vehicles luminous clouds they're literally levitating on these clouds\nIn what we learn is that this cloud is actually a symbol for their ascension body they're white audience it's not a hardware UFO like a a flying Toyota\nIt's actually an organic light vehicle that is produced by the human body and it enables them to travel entered dimensional ally and throughout the cosmos\nArgue with William Henry whose latest work the watchers and of course we're going to get into many things that he is an investigative miss all it just\nGoes after these gone that a visited us spiritual well who's a\nSpiritual first who had the ability to phase into physicality and their bodies are described actually as fluid they can virtually instantly according to these stories\nTransform from their acquiesce adaptable kind of a fluid shape into physicality they can even turn invisible\nAnd this is what we we discover and in some of the ... tax as well as in the dead sea schools where there were they're describing looking at these luminous beings who were radiating rainbow light who their bodies are described as full of eyes they're covered with feathers and they have serpent teen type faces\nAnd when you add all this description together if precisely matches with the Tibetans describe as the rainbow body of light\nAnd the Tibetan great perfection tradition they believe that humans can morph into a light body that they describe that what they tell us that are that the our body the frequency of our body can be accelerated until it dissolves into five color rainbow light leaving behind only hair toe in fingernails\nAnd have no nerves to be transmitted the watchers could do this and I believe that the the Tibetan great perfection tradition originates with the watchers\nAnd so these watchers could\nCould step down their frequency in a way to enter into the earth plain tuna or tone down their frequency manifest in physical form and then face back into their non physical light being for well\nWhat did they want to you was er an agenda\nIn my view when you follow the ascension path of of the watchers that they were here they came here in on a on a rescue mission they are the ... by the way they were not here for gold that that is Jack Ryan ...\n\nSurvivor on Fox News in the electrical

you with you and what are amazing couple hours we've got to where you hear Jeffrey seal and back with us internationally recognized professional psychic\nExorcist teacher specializes in the clearing of individuals' homes businesses a psychic protection Jeffrey is also an expert on hunting and homes and businesses psychic ability good goals such as spirit guide as well and we're tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks jurors for having me back on your show the fifth time and a big hello to everybody around our whole planet\nSoup or you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring out ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that individual in the media a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about offing supernatural a good and evil\nAre also in tradition um it's harvest time and uh in the tradition of that that\nThere's a veil of energy that seems to be dinner this time of year\nUh I found that to be somewhat true but the thing\nThat I deal with happen all the time and um but the media pay more attention to it this time of year and that's fine anytime we talk about it\nAnd get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever do you think demonic spirits and we'll get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of being ... about certain things do you think demonic spirits ... something to do with that\nDefinitely ah we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nAnd this is a huge target or demonic spirit and also negative spirit and I'll get into the difference between those two ah we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people that have power\nAnd and change the world for good or for ill\nAnd uh I think that there's never been a time in our history\nWhere demons have a greater opportunity to strike at the common person and also people who are very influential and so they're around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get your take Jeffrey ... is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful here it it could be said that there was a counterpart of angels there that how\nIt would be said that there was a counter part of angels\nThere that powerful they are not regular people who have died just have a bad attitude into negative things they've been around for a long time they're very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical realm\nOr not have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect\nPhysical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily and uh we're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a\nFrom Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people it's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that\nAre under the attack of ah demonic spirits negative spirits and ah demonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical realm\nFrom the non physical route and actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a ah demonic spirit in a negative spirit also demonic spirits are are much better\nEquipped to ah influence people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can't see them and tell a path ethically trends for information\nInto our system our emotional systems make us angry at each other for the people at ourselves\nGet us to do things we would not normally do and we can't see them we don't know that there are there\nShe that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many\nDemonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as you go I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirits it's also true that demonic spirits a can change you know once\nThey were no positive spirits and their ego God's for them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack\nAre so many arguments you know between people today\nAnd they take advantage of that and spirits and all spirits\nDo not have voice boxes they communicate George ... ethically and we all communicate color ethically it's kind of like a river that travels underneath our consciousness and they communicate on that level\nAnd they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in that's also very common and uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do\nViolence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people\nAre not all a violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits but they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sort negative spirits people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative things when they were alive and continue to do negative things but demonic spirits are very powerful and it's an exorcist\nWhen I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful than me\nThat's right that's you know they can they can come and get you\n... they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect it when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes I get a feelings negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking for it or that the attacks on near her it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work\nTwenty seven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked a success with a few times for short rations and it's very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form at a moment's notice\nCan you see them I can you ... I was\nBorn with the ability to see spirits I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school and grade school I thought I saw spirits in the classroom some were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them with a school work in the summer looking at me\nLike how can you see me\nWhat are you doing I don't like this and these are the one I had to watch out for me to actually come and start walking towards me in the classroom and I was very uncomfortable\nAll right stay with us Jeffrey

next to our as well before we get into open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a\nNatural human\nHumans they want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so ah they attack\nChildren in their cribs ... attack people at work they attack everybody we all have targets on our back and we need to realize that\nUh we can't see them but they can see us they generate negative emotional energies they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand\nWhat they're trying to do they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that it's a Hollywood or something like that Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but\nThe reality is is that they are around the spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them and they communicated with us tell a path to either end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family\nDestroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy your business\nAnd you destroy a person's ability to make money destroy their family destroy their lives and also to change or the way we think about each other right now they have us at each other's throats right where\nThey want us sales I sure do ... and we have to stop it and there's there are ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story\nEverybody I've talked to has some kind of story of uh being in a whole apartment condo party a part of any ... any place\nWhere they've seen or felt something strange they're picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can\nInfluence this by essentially getting into our energy field or emotional systems and amplifying are feeling\nSo it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would not normally do that\nAnd so when we're angry that's when they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them or they don't know that they're there they may not leaving them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some\nSomething that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not most spirits are good summer not\nAnd so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue to hang around our world and\nIt is to do things he would not normally do demonic spirits are\nJust experts at it they have weapons they have devices that they make a lot of non physical energy is just like spirits do\nSpirits change their forms like our our parents die in old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating\nAnd thinking about generating a form of what they want it to look like and also generating close 'cause most people do not see naked spirit so all these things are generated on a non physical level emotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well\nSo demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred enrage\nWe think it's our own\nBut it's not always completely are on\nAre they under the direction of the double jeopardy\nAlways completely are ...\nAre they under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nI'm not sure if there's one particular spirit\nIn charge of all negative spirits I demonic spirits are kind of like criminals\nThey really don't even get along with each other\nThey don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always rule or they do working groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this\nUh but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time\nWorking on individuals and families getting them to fight uh getting people to fight with each other or getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify what would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage\nAnd very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them\nIs incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally uh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light all come out on attack I pull out my non physical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on\nBut everybody is not so fortunate that they can see them and know that they're coming\nAnd soldier around us and we don't know it around just working at home also negative spirits you know and negative spirits can work for them essentially and in sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not\nAre also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die all the time and lots of them are not good uh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so\nEssentially the entire human race right now is under attack\nBy negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier may not have ever lived in the physical realm\nOr for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred and rage and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura\nAnd to get us to react to they're\nAngry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially kill a child in the cradle have no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought\nHorror who they have they just have humans and so they attack everybody they attack people least\nAble to defend themselves and in our world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and we have to realize\nThat we need to protect ourselves from this we need to stop being so angry with each other because we're being used\nAnd it's not just you know I heard some talk on the commercials about global elitist and all of that and I think oh that's true but also we're being attacked by non physical entities that wish to see the human race fail\n\n\nWas away from the White House so rice I'm camp some channels that I could start looking turkey for nearly two years and you can meet with President Trump at

marketing related for how young were you when this marketing began to show up in your blood\nOoh probably birth what are you talking about in my I'm In it's in my blood I ah had very deep relationships with ah my family and friends and community and\nWork with a marketing was selling something you're defining it is something different I think or true yes I Am what do you define it as\nA defining it as I'm reaching out and letting people know what you have to offer\nSo you were doing that as a kid how young were you when you started making money\nI think maybe my first experience was collecting coke bottles for deposits when I was six or seven a hotel room where were you doing that that just to help my mom out of breath the nose is or what did you do with the money I gave it to my mother who is a single parent and had many many jobs\n... would you give it to your mother is just to make things easier for her\nAnd so you're six or seven years old you make some

land\nThe a mom dad brother twin brother a and a one year older sister has a twin brother identical are fraternal identical\nUh-huh and uh so you came to sell them to the end of her junior area from ah from India theater and I'm trying to figure out when you when you vote India you speak English and they drink water there I mean what what must have been a pretty easy adjustment moving to Vienna, Virginia when you're nine years old\nOr not completely true but uh we do speak English over there I just didn't have a good grasp of it and um we went to English speaking schools but at that age I think I was just play focused in there and have a good grasp of its uh when we came here we had some uh\nWhat ... what were the top couple to two or three challenges when you came to the states\nIs certainly speaking English a building that relationship with people around us are also dress code was different I suppose uh you know our parents dressed us in Indian clothing and also clothing that they thought that was a complementary to us but it was probably not the best suited clothing for our age appropriate people at that time ha ha ha that make you feel\nLike an outsider felt like you know I was not fitting in it took time to get adjusted to it took time to get 'em adjusted to the English uh learn it a little ample\nUh-huh so where was the safety safety for safety when you moved over here\nOn fifty was within the family or you know you have mom dad and you have a brother or sister or you you know you have your whole ... close knit family\nAffecting your business to the building of your business nowadays what we're a close knit business we stay or that you're making that up there like put those words not completely\nA out of the ballpark I stay connected with all my employees a raise slow to hire and a quick to fire that is a policy that we've adopted from the beginning and where'd that come from your childhood ah my parents they were occupant or from day one uh they've been ah in business and so at the time they moved to the country\nBut the but this this close knit stuff was because you knew really could depend on some core people and you're bringing that into your business ... what questions yeah there\nAre just play any sports I did actually I played basketball and I did weightlifting and then my young age ... divisions you planned\nA little basketball I was never too good at making the cutting the team I just play the position of being a sort of a shooter from the point line and\nI always like to go and shoot from the long ball game also have to do with your business cursory do from the long ball well uh I started the business just because I felt like you know I could take on the big boys and when and I didn't really have to have fun and I didn't have to be the guy who came from the industry I didn't have to have the higher education I don't have an MBA\nHis guts encourage came from showing up and basketball\nAnd can't yet they came from just a from family taking a entrepreneurial experiences and then meet and going and I knew then what do you think\nHave you ever wanted to quit anything in your professional career\nKnow I'd probably when I started the business I probably wanted to quit a few years into it and the only reason for that was because they were starting to be some offers coming in from the government side or on our client and that started to say hey we could just in the house you\nAnd you know there was not a lot of traction in the business that takes time for business to get going you know three four years and it was literally about that time and right about that time we got her first time contract and there was no looking back there after Michael\nYou mentioned that your parents are entrepreneurial what mom and dad do a mom and dad are have been in business uh we came to the states to do a import export my dad had a business where the where we imported garments and various other jewelry Adams\nWe sold them at Sam's Club is ultimate Costco Hi no cost\nVarious other jewelry items\nUh we sold them at Sam's Club is ultimate Costco I Know costs go right down the street where I used to live and we used to set up shop and just be selling to people you know I don't think they would do that at Costco anymore are we also did\nA total of ... Jews import export business for yourself for Costco and so you know we we did a lot of\nHard labor and we did a lot of 'em are selling so we used to walk the streets in D.C needs to walk the streets in Arlington we used to be have long big warehouses where we were emptying forty foot containers just the family my brother and myself my dad\nI'm On my sister we were we were working hard long hours lifting boxes that were probably about our weight but we just got used to it it was just you know and the mentality was this is what you do so when you have a night not tightened night\nSorry nice type family uh it's just when you stay engaged within that into a work environment there's no question so what you have to do what you don't have to do you're just you're parent's asking you do it\nI don't ever about the money and what do you attribute your motivation to\nAttribute that to um [noise] just my folks are you know just working hard and seeing them day in day out ah you know just coming to the country to give us the opportunity to succeed you know the way they moved here to give us the opportunity to succeed ... how how high is up\nAt this point you know what I'm starting to look back and say okay you know what we're my reasons for starting the business and why or how how old are you I'm thirty three youth or you're looking back but by the how ... how much is enough\nUm you know I've got a timeline of about another seven more years before I start to switch or my industry and my experience I've got two more years and and where are you telling me that forty where I Would give me that again\nYeah that that's pretty much like cut off forty um were were cut off or what so I've got I've already started a nonprofit where I'm starting to focus and and that's my goal to sort of\nGet away from being engaged in the way that I made a wait a minute I thought that the entrepreneur with selfish and it's a matter of you know by the nicest core by the nicest biggest biggest house what are you talking about giving back\nI don't disagree with you those are selfish reasons to start and I did start for those reasons too but now not having enough money and having enough success I think there's there's a point where you say okay you know what can I Do to make this but you know make make it better because you don't know when you're here till so you just want to be able to give back so\nGive me that you don't know when you're here to well what do you give me that I mean I think we see it every day around the world that you know your time is up your time could be up you know not what I Want to be morbid or anything but a ... essentially there is a limit so there's a limit you know you want to give back while you have the opportunity so just started getting into one of the requiring but you're talking about giving back John\nRoe how as being an immigrant affected you\nKnow it's it's helped me get the understanding that there's a you know us as a very good potential for people coming in you know there is no upper limit anywhere from a country where there's a lot of\nBureaucracy there's a lot of corruption so you know when a person like us from a different country comes to the U.S they see\nA lot of opportunity to grow without any sort of hold back you know one person says no you go to the next there's no reason for failure it's just keep trying you'll you'll see the you'll see the success that he wants to get married or single I Am married and I have a seven month old daughter uh-huh at home who wears the parents and the family\nI Would rather not say but my wife does for parents to work too so uh-huh so um what similar even grow in a business and being a dad [noise]\nOh my God you start nurturing big time um I have or are we talking about nurtured I can understand that your nurturing and home you're doing that a business he has certainly I think uh we have to do that you really thirty three years old what are you talking about a so by\nMy boys have to feel like you know I'm here to protect them and they noticed about me worry about that I stand behind them if a if no you know nobody points fingers that my employees unless I understand what's wrong and I stand behind them and I think given the back of they need to make sure\nThat well you don't read that in the newspapers you really feel like you've got your your team is back huh yeah I have\nTo because they we work in a sometimes that cutthroat environment for the industry that we're in and sometimes we get\nBad counterparts on our government side and not pointing fingers but just it's just what it is you know so you have to sort of back our employees and trying to get to the roots in deep of what the challenges are to make sure that they feel comfortable\nIn doing their job day to day and that somebody has to him and I certainly look at them and say that their family so I go out of the way to make sure that the benefits that we provide protect not just them with their families\nHuh so you really feel like you're like a father at home and you're like a father of work I Hope I'm not a father to them just a mentor or say that if your parents can do your business\nOn my father's parents proud of your parents been to the business of course they are well aware of how did they feel they walk in the door you know my dad has recently mentioned that you know he's proud of me and uh he mentioned that why ...\nI think he's just seen that you know there's a recognition that comes to you know in five thousand recognizes couple of times and things like what's the website address that his organization called ... dot net as the D. S. Y. N. C. dot net and this is her goal will be back in the moment right after this break thank you\nThat's again a nice way of putting it I think I'm a disruptor as well I like to disrupt the status quo and try to make people think you know the outside of what they normally would you have to do you ever sit with your clients and talk about their businesses absolutely so so so you're not really just talking to them about the numbers you're talking to them about their businesses\nSo ... so you're not really just talking to them about the numbers you're talking to them about their businesses you're helping them see other possibilities that they can do with their businesses were wrecked it's mostly aimed towards the digital when I see them doing something I think is really inefficient I'm going to bring it up\nRegardless of it has to do with accounting like you're so you're telling me if if there's something they should be doing all along or some way that they can create more efficient process as you'd like bringing that up so you can help bring efficiency to the business right when I see a cat and it's full of paper I think I start to get itchy\nUh-huh because you see better ways of doing absolutely there's I mean there's so many digital solutions out there seems silly when\nYou when you were a kid what kind of sports did you play\n[laughter] uh played basketball huh you any good at it the uh before the basketball was in the worms or you know I was not very go what what what what we call what were you what was what were you good at it as a\nKid I was good at video games how very very good at video how young were you when you were good at video games [noise] I Would say when I was sneaking down into my parents' basement figuring out a hook up the TV to the Atari twenty six hundred and playing those old games\nWow so ... so you have a natural fuel for hardware and software yes uh-huh about three or four when I was doing that uh-huh how how how's the fact that how's that you're having that fuel for hardware and software had a positive effect on your business career\nI think it's because it's it's something that's not taught in school I always wanted to take that that side of me the software hardware and apply it to something else and I was always good with numbers and just understanding the concepts of math so I brought the technology into the accounting and I ride a way too early\nAs an earlier and earlier of mine that failed well\nWe're a little bit earlier on but it felt to me like you know you're really built for your job this job really fills you were really is meaningful to you my correct about that\nYes everything that I've I think I've done I think the reason I've stayed so long in the positions that I have is because whatever I guess as you something I Want to see it succeed so bad\nThat I Would rather stick around in a difficult environment than actually leave my baby so you're ... you're sending you a vision you completion yes I Want to see it succeed I Can't just do it and leave it uh-huh and what else are you thinking [noise]\nBrat you mentioned earlier that you have an older brother sometimes younger sibling feel and I feel like they're in an older sibling chateau and [noise] and sometimes that can build animosity and the family and your brother is one of your biggest ads they can't tell us more about that and how does that make you feel\nWhen I was a really young kid and my parents and I as I was saying before is stifling um there was the environment and how they grow up to 'em but it's it's very much a you know don't don't talk about your grades you know it'll hurt your brother's feelings\nI was just always things like that like don't talk about that don't talk about that and then my brother would do something and he would quit so I was growing up and that's the exact opposite of what I did even if I didn't enjoy it I Would do it until I was very good at it\nAnd um there are a lot of situations where that came up and I think that really jumped started everything really lower than\nWhat I understand you know he wins the practice you you believe practice makes perfect in your also persistent um but you know it sounds like also you mentioned that your mom and dad told you not to rub some of your successes and your brother's face\nYes ah and then\nAnd then you found out one day something what did you find out one\nDay a actually one of my best they're one of my brothers best friends actually came up to me and ah I made some off comment about you know sort of the same topic and he brought up how my brother wouldn't shut up about me\nHow ... how are you with that happen around Seventeen and you found out from your friend from your brother's friend that your brother was saying what about you positive things and just bragging about me were you surprised or yes how'd that make you feel\nIt made me feel like everything that I've been doing and thinking that was wrong in cycling actually I was doing the right thing the whole time and then I\nHave a bell nuts what do you mean all I mean when you when you push down so hard you wonder if you're nuts or everybody else around you is nuts\nAnd I I I refuse to believe that\nSuccess was nuts so your brother actually appreciated your reality yes uh-huh whereas I was fighting in the entire time uh-huh but he understood what you were really going through yes and he understood what you were able to persist through it correct uh-huh so he really appreciated your persistence absolutely what are your clients appreciate about you\nI think they\nWere you like to lead it on their uh I\nUh I think they I don't like finishing or not finishing things I like to meet deadlines I Will stay until it's\nTo think about it you know you bring an innovation to the forefront you're the kind that garlic and drive innovation so it's not just you know it's not just incremental steps\nThat you're looking to get complete it but you're looking you have a vision you look in the complete division correct and I always seem\nTo have another vision on the horizon every time something happens that Mike okay now what do you ever

judge Edward Gen issued a ruling that stopped the Trump Administration from deporting roughly three hundred thousand people in the United states they're here under TPS temporary protected status from Haiti Sudan Nicaragua and El Salvador\nThe northern California federal judge said there was evidence that President Trump harbors enemies are biased against non white non European immigrants he cited

marketing industry that branding industry and\nWhat she's observed through the years in his changes toward aged toward women all the things that we sometimes get a little angry about on this show she feels is improving and I love to hear it so thank you for being with us so much today pat\nThank you Adrian says fun\nYeah it is fun and let let's some parts of your journey and been remarkably fun and some have been a little tough\nSo let's introduce first the business you call yourself a chief inspiration officer what does that mean to you because you changed it from being president being chief inspiration officer and fury inspires that kind of has a website that ... that you've created so what does it mean to you in this context\n[noise] well I think one of the things that I was a I\nI never expected to having never looked to game was inspiration from anyone else but I'm constantly inspired by everything I Do and everyone I meet whether it's intended or not intended I I feel at this point in my life\nAnd all the years I've been working in my own business and all the people that I work for me in with me and clients that I've had I've always felt that my job was to inspire them to reach for there\nTo learn more to really dig deep into what their best you know opportunities are whether it'd be in the company or as a client for their customer base and I just feel that that's really what I Do best is inspire\nUm have you talked to my ... my employees and my partner's they would say I'm always dropping kind of a an idea on someone and let it sit with them for a while 'til they come back and let me know if it makes sense or doesn't make sense\nBut I kind of jog them a little bit and if you talk to my clients they would say I take no prisoners when it comes to tough questions those are the ones I asked and I do it not to be difficult but to probe and to get them to think and then to aspire to something greater\nBoom brand gold one eight hundred three one six

won't talk radio\n[noise]\n\nAnd I love hello hello once in a tree and burg and this is a generation ago that found that the truth it is currently and I can't think why the only syndicated radio show in this country on the topic of successful aging\nAnd we look at it from every point of view you could take a look at the bottom line which is one of the largest a lot in the country right now a newsletter\nAnd I had their aging for beginners section so take a look at that\nUh and if you have a topic if you have a guess if you have a a thought\nThat you would likely to express on the air simply go to our website generation bold radio dot com\nGeneration volt ready to come and go to Adrian and you can also tell Adrian\nIf there's something of interest to you that right now we have one of our as usual fascinating is never going to run out of time with her but her name is pat Fiore she is the founder and\nPresident I wouldn't say former president you'll hear why emitted a of a company that is thirty five years old that help other companies are realizing that greatest growth potential\nAnd she's changed her type from President chief inspiration officer because she feels that it is our response\nThen the chief inspiration officer because she feels that it is our responsibility at our particular responsibility and strength to inspire people now are we talked about her own journey the first part of our show up at that we talked a little bit also about the fact that\nShe's very mired and and uh in the fashion industry in advertising and messaging and I'm Wondering\nAt uh what are you seeing is thirty five years so you've got a long view perspective\nOn whether the message is the concepts beauty the advertising for people who are older is really changing our we'd do deluding ourselves that because we are baby boomers and we feel feisty that the industry sees us that way\nWhat what's going on and neither fashion advertising or all the above\n[noise] well I think I Do think it's changing and I think it's changing because it had to\nBecause there was a need for it but there was a demand for it as well you know consumers have a lot of power these days ah every new product of a new innovation starts with a consumer begging for a solution\nSo I think there's a there's pressure on the industry marketing advertising PR all of that but I also think that we reached an age of of authenticity\nThere's a need in the products we buy into brands that we support the people we follow the influences word attend attentive to about authenticity that to me that's very important to have you have a world is changing to natural products\nNatural foods natural beauty products things that are better ... better for your life yet ... protest and so and so with that how do you how do you\nTalk about a natural product that comes from New York I have a client that grows um\nIngredients that grows natural products from seed in the earth the earth is I'm from the ashes mount Edna with healing powers how do you talk about that if you don't do it with authenticity\nThere's beautiful wonderful language that we can use that's real and can bring products alive so well how would we do that if we're going to be an authentic about the people were using to promote those products\nWe need I think there's a huge revolution going on and I think it's happening very quickly where we are becoming true to ourselves and products of becoming true to who they are and when you get in when you start to promote and speak to natural organic\nProducts you need to speak to them with realism and authenticity and so you're going to see more and more people with history and really their hands in the in the near earth who are bringing these products to live\nAnd they're not going to be Eighteen year olds they're not going to be stick models is not going to happen they're real people they're farmers and their chemist in their PHD's were near universities that are doing wonderful things\nTo help us all live longer and the better\nAnd you know one of the things that I complain about a lot I ... a right on this topic of this city is a product look younger\nAnd the models or Twenty years old so they're showing you Michael Kramer they show you of about tax and they're showing you on basically on kids and look at the change in that person and that is the authenticity that I actually think makes consumers at least\nBy age consumers angry because it doesn't relate and that's exactly I think that what you're saying and it's a wonderful phrase reuse authenticity that so much about\nWhether we're showing an older person or it was showing a younger person it does the person who is looking at those the consumer related so we'll have a couple of minutes I Want to throw this to you you you said an interesting thing is that consumers have a lot of power now\nUh I always look Seventy eight million people a baby boomers which means that they're born you know are there in the sixties and seventies\nWho has the consumer power now the millennials or the books\nI think the boomers do\nThey one of the wealthiest of the generation unlike unlike the sound generation which didn't have the money the boomers do they have tons of money to spend may have power to influence products that are being developed they\nExpect to live longer and they will and they expect to look good while there while they're aging and so there's a demand and an expectation\nAnd one thing about boomers I Will say is that they don't take no for an answer with all the invasion we have in the world with all the technology we have in the world [noise] my my he what I hear from boomers all the time is what do you mean you can't do it do it get it\nDone ... they're going to happen like that but I think that as being at the end of our show or we have a phrase that every single show for four years get out their kids and make it happen\nAnd that's what we feel we feel empowered to do that\nAnd if we have this empowering messages from companies which is not going to do it by the business of fall and I can't get up it's it's very very old news but usually when we come back we're going to turn our attention to something much more internal\nFolks um that's got to an incredible drive\nAnd incredible philosophy and she's made a lot of impact in the world but a little break that we spoke together she said one thing and it's tough she said nobody's going to do it for you\nWhen we come back we're going to talk about that because\nOne of the biggest issues of aging in this country is dependency were actually taught that come a certain age usually sixty five were allowed to be dependent we deserved to be that we deserve to have handouts and entitlements and if we don't get it\nOf course if we worked for like Social Security is one thing\nBut the idea here is uh nobody's out there\nTo create a great old age for you it has to come internally pet's got a terrific and important philosophy about that in general about all aspects of life and I think you're going to want to hear when we come back we're going to find your support powers\nAnd start you thinking about what your internal superpower is so that you can use it to carry through the extra Thirty years of life that most of us are being handed and we want to embrace it with both hands so we come back we'll be talking about that and you may want to take a little bit flip paper with them\nEven if you're a little bit older\nAnd the latest block of this is going to touch right on to what you said about curiosity I actually bash I'll be honest with you I stash an article that was written several years ago by a very famous on colleges who said that he wants to die when he was Seventy five years old\nAnd he was in his fifties at the time and healthy and is that we should all want to die with Seventy five years old because we become irrelevant now\nWhat would keep me wanting to live forever one answer curiosity just that's your anyway and I know that you're a traveler I just talked about ageless travel why do people travel only curiosity I Want to see what's going on around the corner\nAnd when you stop feeling that yeah maybe you do want to check out and so creating this idea of curiosity and relevant to your life is very very internal\nAnd I want to touch again on something that youth it off there that I uh it's so simple it's very perfect and that is you have to do it yourself and explain how even your your loving family is not enough to tell us about that your thoughts when it comes to that\nI think you have to find you have to find that that inner strength you have to have definitely have a purpose\nAnd you have to be persistent I have a favorite word and actually was um someone wrote an article about me ... years ago and they said what do you think you have that no one else has and I said well stick to would have ...\nI stick I don't let it go until I saw that and then I find other ways to approach it so I adopted builders important purpose is very important I don't know why anyone would ever want to win dissipate or believe that they're irrelevant after a certain age I don't see that at all I had a grandmother\nWho passed at Ninety nine and Ninety eight and ... and her begin you and I never did she was still running up and down three flights of steps and directing the entire family she had she was totally relevant now at that time they didn't have the Internet and I'm sure she would have laughed at it\nBut the point and she had the energy and the purpose to keep going and the curiosity to keep wanting to learn so as the children would come and tell her stories about what they were learning in school she never went to school she never learned to read or write she was so curious about it and so wanted to believe\nAnd get involved and observe and absorb what she was being told even though she wasn't someone who learned formally in school\nSo I don't know that\nI Would say her power honestly was love uh\nThe big subsidies yeah is somebody who really got troops out of being the grandma and being with the family and and be excited about their achievements I wanted to take this minute to talk about this word superpower\nBecause it has nothing to do with money you could have superpowers but also you know be able to use a Walker will be in a wheelchair you're going to have superpowers it doesn't even have that much to do with health but from the description you are hearing from pet Fiore you can see it has to do some soul searching\nAnd coming up with your troops strength and you don't just wake up in the morning and say to yourself allied troops strength is adaptability ... thinking about it uh I had to also do that in itself ... class\nBut I can tell you that my superpower is and I'm very resourceful um my dad died suddenly when I was living my mom had though education and we respond on a pet\nAnd although I wouldn't wish this to happen to anyone a good thing happened from it I became extremely resource I can get anything under any circumstances that I Need that the super power [noise]\nWhat are yours if you are listening now think about it dig deep what are you really do well that ... totally naturally that you don't have to work at that is just part of you for some reason\nAnd you like doing it because it's so effortless and I promised you that you put a Fifteen minutes away today and you just think about what is something that empowers ... effortlessly you get to the drug dealer of your super powers\nOnce you know and you can you the truth that job to choose a friend a\nPet do you agree with that because I Know that your search or to use these\nIdeal I think everyone that I

you have to use that gift in any way that makes you happy and I think makes other people happy if that makes you feel good making other people happy around you\nSo I think that you know one one of the gifts I give everyone and everyone I Know is a more there is no pads has pros and cons on it and I tell everyone when you have a question in your mind about your career about your life about your

to see what wins that helps you have used them all my life\nWill come back and talk about this topic and that is decision they can do that and a very interesting context around this age you have to

southern Texas and Arizona and you know places like that you have that when I called the defining\nThe absolute defining cold front the one that takes the thinking heat that has been with us all summer\nAnd just makes it go away humidity goes away and you just feel the nice refreshing all wonderful air and it hasn't happened\nIt usually happens by now it usually happens and you know either at the end of September or at the very latest that happens on like the fifth of October\nBut usually it happens around the Fifteen to twenty of September\nHasn't happened yet this year and they say there's no such thing as climate change I used to be a climate change deniers by the way I was I said this is who hockey but I Am a believer in ... in climate change I'm seeing too many weird things happening\nYou know and I pay attention to this stuff and I have kept records in the past\n... back when I was hanging out with a doctor ... I was I was keeping records back there and I found those records I started going through them\nI was going to tell you things that we're just this is the middle of October and we had the biggest bad as hurricane that is to hit this part of the country in years in October and it just went in pulverized\nAh Panama City that whole area that all your life and parts of Georgia ... is the ads you know\nClimate change is real kids I don't care what people are telling you the people with a brain in their head no the climate change is real and I'm now I'm going to get like tons of mail and you know\nBut I'm Sorry you're wrong climate change is real science backs it up you know just trust me don't listen to politicians listen to the scientist and\nAh you know so we got to deal with all of that and in the garden we have to deal with all of that and I've got friends who have nurseries commercial nurseries and they're in different parts of the country\nI have former students who are in North Carolina\nAnd they've got a commercial a zillion nursery up there they've done very very well with it but they said that over the course of years they've had to change their propagation schedules are I mean everything has changed they've had to change everything that they are doing\nI spoke not terribly long ago with a ... with a tobacco farm now I Am not a advocate of tobacco\nI think smoking is horrendous but I Am a I Am fascinated with tobacco farmers and how they do what they do because they do what they do very very very well\nAnd by the way tobacco farmers are some of the hardest working\nAnd nice people you will meet anywhere and ah you know I drove up through Virginia one time\nYou many years ago Thirty years ago and I saw these tobacco farms up there and I saw people out working and and I stopped and talked to them because that's what I Do I just stop and you look at me\nAnd um there are some of the nicest people and they explained to me all of their systems like I was talking to a tobacco farmer who is down here on vacation who I ran into a social event\nAnd he said that they have this down to the science like you wouldn't believe have had to make massive changes over the past Thirty years on how they grow tobacco which is like a big commodity\nAnd which you know science had taught them how to do perfectly well but because of climate change they have had to change everything that has cost them more money they've had to realign thanks a lot of people doing things totally different than they ever did I'm going to tell you something about people\nEspecially people who grow stuff okay people who are in the nursery business people who are farmers people who grow stuff are steady people\nI and I'm just I'm just giving you my experience through very steady people they set up a routine they know what works and they're not big fans of change because they know what works\nAnd I don't blame them\nAnd all of the farmers all of the commercial nurseries everybody who grows everything for a living over the past\nTwenty twenty five thirty years has had to change everything that they do because of the changing temperatures to change it rained patterns that changing everything when it comes to climate that the soil temperatures very important things soil temperatures have changed dramatically\nAnd all of this is is just you know impacting all of us and then you have people out there saying climate change doesn't happen the world's just you know going through cycles know\nClimate change is happening now do you want to get into the argument is man made climate change or what it is I don't know I Do not know but I Do know\nWhat farmers are going through I Do know what commercial growers are going through and I do know what one geeks like me lawn and garden geeks like me and you listen to the show you're noticing it too especially if you're into this like I Am\nYou're noticing differences you're noticing things and you were having to make changes\nIn you know we people who plan things are kind of steady people we really are we don't really appreciate change but that's the world that we are living in now and we will\nEmbrace it or we will just not have pool plans\nThey love this type of fertilizer it makes them pop it makes the colors more vibrant it makes everything just sort of stick out there so you know when you add those minor elements to that\nYou know the ... the nitrogen phosphorus in the potassium done in the ratios that I was describing your plants thrive they said they give you they love it and you're going to love it too\nAnd I'm going to tell you something you're doing this in the fall where all of those not you know those those elements will get into the soil and start building from a foundation and trust me when I tell you when spring comes those plants are just going to go home\nYou know they're just gonna go boom goes dynamite and they're all going to look great\nThat is my only recommendation\nI use it on his alias I use it on ... I use it on five Burnham XY use it on look ... you know I'm\n... harbor fight each go nuts with us fertilizer\nOr any type of spruce I use it on all of those I use it on all of my trees I use it on the oaks I use on the maples I use it everywhere one fertilizer keep it simple stupid that's what I say keep it simple\nBut keep a dynamic you're going to spend a little bit more money for this fertilizer not much but trust me it is really worth it it's like when you go buy the generic vitamins compared to the good\nQuality vitamins you you're gonna spend a little more but you you're gonna thing it's like buying a\nGrade a beef you know yeah I I go to Sam's Club and by my ... case so good uh so my grill I'm really good at that so that's what I that's what you do now let us move along if we can do the lawns\nFollows the most important time to fertilize your lawn is vitally important as a matter of fact that you fertilize you on\nThis time of year I used to give you all kinds of weird recommendations I'd go for sixteen for eight or twenty four or five eleven I had all the Scott's a super blue or what does it wouldn't have what ... ... bonus Scott's bonus ask all of those things I don't do that anymore\nI Am now into a hybrid organic fertilization for your lawn is what I Am\nAnd my recommendation to you I have to you can take your ... your your choice out of it if you live up north I recommend ringer laundry store and they've got a fall fertilizer that they sell one hundred percent organic\nAll kinds of beautiful things that it does to the soil then it sets the microorganisms in the soil feed your soil is the best in the world the other choice you can use this up north as well or you could definitely use it in the south middle organized\nMiller tonight is made some changes in last year it is a little bit different than it used to be not much kind of like the original formula better but this one's do good this this formula has I think five percent iron to it\nSo you've got that in a couple of other miners that are just naturally in there\nBut we are talking about yeah they don't call it organic anymore they've changed the labels they don't call it organic but it is organic but because of some technicalities of the way it's a process they can call it organic anymore but trust me when I tell you it is organic\nAnd that is what if I wasn't doing this experimental thing this year that's what would be on my lawn for the fall and that's what I Would recommend to you either middle organized or reading or laundry store put it down\nWater it in and you will be delighted you will be totally delighted with the results that you get by the way ringer laundry store has also changed in the last couple of years they've changed the way they formulate ringer laundry store used when I first became familiar with ringer laundry store\nIt was put it on your lawn for a whole year your lawyers gonna look like ... but the next year you're logged would look really really good well they have made some changes in the formulation to where you get a little bit more instant gratification and I guarantee you if you put it on the lawn\nThis fall you will notice an immediate change not a dramatic change but trust me when I tell you and I'm telling you the truth I'm standing here telling you the truth is with the ring a laundry store down\nIn the fall especially in the fall formulation\nWhen spring pops that lawn is going to be thick lush and green same can be said about the middle organized if you choose to use that\nYou watch your ... now the middle organized the way that is you're getting used to be with new organize it took a long time for it to work it is taking less time for middle organized to work now I don't know why that is but it's working faster and and that is a good thing\nBut it might be a bad thing it might be working faster because of climate change I don't know because of the difference in soil temperature soil temperature now is significantly warmer than it was ten years ago\nIn most parts of the country so maybe that is why the organized is working faster I Do not know I'm not a scientist I Am a geek\nI have a garden gate so that is what I Know but those are the that as my fertilization recommendation I call it a hybrid organic uh because my lawn program is is now pretty much defined as a hybrid organic I'm recommending these two organic fertilizers one of the two\nAnd I'm recommending if need be you might\nWant to add some chemicals as far as we control our concern but that is the topic for enough\nGirl is that the garden [noise]\nIt may have been a messy divorce that suddenly cut your income and a half but not your bills they might have been an injury or illness or your boss just

and she does she does have a tech question but I Do want to inform you or she has no power right now\nAnd she has no water right now because she was in hurricane Mike oh well yeah they've been out of power to run the generator they've been out of power since about Wednesday and now they have a social service\nBut she thinks she thinks there's some trick ratio either turn it off and turn it on and turn it off and turn it on so they're limiting the amount of people\nThat are all I mean you've seen the ... has been an aging status day I'm surprised that more people did not get hurt though during when you start looking at the idea that storm and where it hit how close it had it could have had to like a major metropolitan\nArea and it wasn't just twenty miles or twenty miles per hour from being a category five storm I mean this would be huge hurricane\nYeah my brother lives near Panama City\nAnd how is he uh he's doing great okay or his house survived good ah but we're all\nYou know thinking I kept telling him like you know you you should go evacuate I think you should leave and you tell him to evacuate today's beforehand and he did them morning of the hurricane yeah once you know I mean aren't we yes um\nBut you know he lives right on the water on and he built a house that's like twelve or you know like twelve feet above the ground and he said the water was four feet up okay so so\nAbove the ground and he said the water was four feet up\nOkay so so ... was a smart joyous but you know it's so funny that you know think about this though so if your house is twelve feet off\nThe ground right every time that you pull into your driveway\nYou're getting your steps and you're trying to make sure where under predominant [laughter] because you're going up and up and down a Beth is in Tallahassee as Andrew said hello there\nBeth try him\nSo do you have Internet access is everything good by you\nWe do not have Internet ah we have spotty cell service all\nAll right so without the Internet what do you miss the most\nOh my gosh I'm probably social media\nFacebook it out I heard Facebook in the back row yeah fake I my daughter and my husband are here with me there aren't so um yeah I I I went to make a dinner for the last night and I thought oh I've got the rent yeah get away I Can't look it up [laughter]\nSo our kids are going to have a Mac and cheese again because I can read the Bible [laughter] it's just a minute or right and then were cooking everything on the grill it that that's really interesting to well you know that it's healthy right or you know kind of kind of just kind of died out the window [laughter] oh you're in a hurricane\nAll I did was eat it was like I had the nervous when the\n[laughter] that's okay you know what you guys are doing good and it takes a while you know make sure that everything's all back in action and uh but certainly our our hearts and our first goes to everybody that has been affected by that hurricane especially as it continues just to keep moving on\nUp the coast um so I understand you have a question about the smart a speakers once you get the power and once you get your Internet back\nRight yeah yeah I mean I just heard a lot about you know everybody get them to see the thing that everyone should have and I'm like do I really need one and what would I use it for\nYou know it's a really good question because as one of these gadgets that initially when you get it you go wow that's really cool I mean so you can say you know tell me what the weather is tell me what the traffic's going to look like order\nA more toilet paper paper towels or whatever it may be and then you start moving up the actual long so then you say turn on the light\nAnd you can also say goodnight and when you say goodnight is that the alarm system will set the front door will walk the lights will go into the night mode and then suddenly on the smart speaker next year end table some white noise is playing to sue view to sleep\nIs all that happen automatically\nKnow of course not you know that [laughter] if they like you to think that but you have do you have to buy all the gadgets along the way right ... you got to buy the lights the smart lights and the smart locks and then you have to program those but it's not very difficult to program it\nUh there were thermostats that like the ego be in the nest that work with the Amazon Echo so that this way if you're sitting on the couch and you don't want to get your lazy but up and you can say you know turn the air down to Seventy six or turn the heat up the sixty six or whatever it may be\nAnd so it takes a while for you to get indoctrinated into it so to speak or no pun intended with these smart speakers but once you once you get it I think that you'll understand like\nThis is exactly how it's supposed to work I'm going to put together some links for you over at commando dot com\nAnd so that this where you can lead to the right Amazon Echo and also

on to Google dot com and search\nNeed to make money on line quickly because there's so many scams while there's one scanned in particular that I Want you to be on the lookout for until you more about that and just a moment\nBut first here's the phone number one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four is the way to join us and of course when you're calling in there's Andrew but been skiing that Kim commandos ... hello there Andrew\nKim Eric use in Cincinnati, Ohio and this is the first I mean I've been answering phones here for a long time long if you have to say how many years seven was Seventeen no no sixteen years is gonna be Seventeen then it's almost Seventy a\nLong time we should probably talk about not being and in turn anymore you know what I'm going with it OK yeah less pressure\nUm and like you ... when I said Seventy I Know\nWe can [laughter] sixteen what are you off [laughter] kind of odd Andrew ... co so Eric\nYes or he wants to be able to anonymously put photos\nOn the Internet and when someone normally call for that I usually have a one line like hey that sounds like you want to break the law we're not going to budge on the radio to break the law but he actually has a good ... you know what 'cause it sounds like revenge porn or sure yeah something like something shady yes uh but he has good reason he has to have four adopted foster kids and he wants their grandparents\nTo be able to see what they look like but he's not ready to fully dime in on the whole communication front\nIs an interesting question yeah that is because it's so so Eric he wanted the grandparents to watch the kids grow up\n[laughter] yes that's exactly correct but\nI Know I was gonna say so is this an open adoption is that what happened\n[noise] no we adopted these children earlier this year they had been in foster care for four years prior to us getting them and we had them for a year before we adopted them so they've been out of the biological home\nFor five or wow okay and this year the father the biologic father passed away when I Do um we had some feelers out for people who have\nDistant contact and they asked if we could bring the children to the funeral and we said no we're not ready to do that yet right\nUm but they said well is there any way that we can we do watch them grow up and so I was looking for some way that I could anonymously present them pictures that they can see but I also don't want to just throw them out on the Internet for anyone to say I want to be able to target who can see them\nI I get that I get that or you know first of all what big heart but you and your wife must have to take him for kids how old are the kids\nRight now they're seven eight ten and eleven\nWow okay it's a full household [laughter] it's a full house for their kids have our own so wow we have eight [laughter] that's\nAwesome that's awesome a couple of thoughts come into mind or of course when you post photos you're going to make sure that there's no identifiable characteristics you know\n... and so forth\nYeah I Would take out all the all the medical data and the E. X. I. F. data in\nYou're going to have to use the photo editing program to strip all that out right\nSure uh because a lot of people don't realize and if you're like what the heck are these two people talking about is that if I put in a picture up on the Internet and I put down is that I can open up the hidden data and then pretty much see where that photo was taken what type of camera et cetera or just on Google Map and so we want to make sure want to take all that stuff out\nA couple of thoughts you might want to consider\nWe want to make sure want to take all that stuff out a couple of thoughts you might want to consider I mean you've you have Google you out of school photos number one\nOr you put them up there there's Yahoo Photos but one of the things that that came to mind when I was listening to your call is that if you go to the Persian sample of photo sharing site like shut her fly okay\nShuttered fly will allow you to create not just photo albums but a particular website if you will that contains all the photos\nAnd so if they had and you'd have to figure out the best way to get the grandparents\nThe the Web address but if they had the Web address they could just keep going back there to refresh it uh say once a week or once a month and so they can start seeing and then in addition to that you get a record of them going to see it as well [noise]\nOkay uh so just said or to shutter fly\nIn and sign up for an account and again you're going to be some options when you do this that you're really looking for your own unique website\nAnd then once you do that whoever knows that address that there'll be able to access all those photos and again aside from just the medical data is make sure that there is no identical characteristics with the kids as far as any type of school logos\nOr anything else that might show where they're actually physically located at any of those shots of course you can always use any photo editing program that just kind of racist stuff in the back and\n[noise] All right let's talk about one of our great sponsors there are works relieve their works relieves\nLike many of us do you suffer from muscle cramps and your legs in your feet well to experience relieve do what I Do you want to use their works relieve\nFast acting phone get their or works relieved today at the end of the pain relief file at your local pharmacy or at their works relief once again dot com\nOr before the back of your phone calls I got to tell you about a phone scam that's offering stony Amazon dot com jobs because especially this time of year\nAs a matter of fact we just did a pod cast command on demand about the whole gig economy different ways that you could earn some quick cash just in time for Christmas is that job scams are claiming to be from Amazon or totally on the rise\nAnd here's how the scam works listen up you get a voice mail inviting you to apply for a job and Amazon\nIt sounds like a pretty sweet set up I mean you can earn anywhere from twenty dollars an hour to maybe even as much as six thousand dollars a month get fish you're working from home [noise] usually those are websites with fictitious names like\nA Amazon cash Amazon cash website Web store jobs you name it\nBut here's the catch when you go to fill out the online application you were asked to purchase a two hundred dollar enrollment kid and then once you make the payment poof\nCameras gone all your money your dream of a telecommuting and earning cash and your bunny slippers so any job that issue for some sort of a front payment should should set off warning bells and if you are looking for legitimate ways to earn extra cash maybe you want to be an online tutor\nOf virtual assistant or maybe you want to even watch TV and take surveys yes you can make money doing that\nLook no further than the official homepage I became commando show which is of course Gail M.

all around your home you have cameras in thermostats and routers garage doors the smart light bulbs the smart crock pot for some reason\nWell most of them come with these ridiculously easy to crack passwords for example many routers and Web cams I have a default admin password like admitting or password so the idea that when you set up your new gadget you should always change the default pass for\nMaking something strong that the scammers won't be able to crack\nBut that doesn't always happen so too many people are just leaving the default password in place making themselves targets for criminals and hackers and cameras All right so lawmakers in California you're trying to make that stop they just passed a law that goes into effect the beginning of twenty twenty it makes it illegal for companies\nTo said week default passwords on devices but here's the gab yet made in the state\nThe problem is that looks to those Internet connected devices I just mentioned they're made in China\nSo the new law is going to require manufacturers just said complex unique passwords for all the devices they have to maybe come up with a startup procedure in place but ... forces the user\nTo change the password I mean this is a long time coming when you think about it I mean but how effective is it really going to be ... probably not so much because as I mentioned everything's made in China\nOr a Google was in the news again this past week not just because they announced a whole slew new pixel phones or because they had a major security breach\nWell they said it was a bug well

sense\nFor us to say um I I Do promote for customers to them to go on and put on a positive review for us was to get them to do it as like a should I Try to at a pet or something\nAnd that's a rank

that can be on the printed receive\nThat could be part of the email confirmation or the text that they get confirming appointments and you know so you start you know sit down and just make a list of all the different touch points that you have with that particular customer\nAnd then think of different ways that you can give them an incentive you know maybe they write a negative review that's okay if you learn something from it you know you move on you make it better but historically and you start telling them what you want and that's the thing about people most people want to help you most people are really good natured\nBut they may not know that this is what you need and so if you tell them at least four times to the average person has to hear something four times before they act\nAs

in America who brings ... family you do not want to pass up the unique opportunity to change hearts and minds about abortion\nRight joining us now is the man himself he's got his brand new book out say I love the title and I liked the content even more why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies Dr Sebastian Gorka is with us or how are you my friend this book is a must read for everybody and ah how are you going to say I'm\nVery excited show and thanks for having me or I didn't think uh this title would be as appropriate as it is often low Seventy two hours but man we are in a fight right now for the future of the republic\nIt is a fight for the future of the republic the one thing I Love about you and I've come to know you very well is that you are a patriot\nAnd you understand evil in our time evil abroad the need to defend and keep America strong and you understand the political aspects of it as well because if you elect the wrong people and when you got to have policies of appeasement again in that renders us more vulnerable\nJust look at the last eight years what do we have we had a commander in chief who started his presidency with an apology tool\nAnd then he blamed all the bad things in the world on America what resulted the rise of ISIS Russia invading its neighbor Chinese Chinese re militarization of the end of the Obama administration just one metric take take politics out of it for a second\nWe had sixty five million refugees in the world that's more than we had at the end of World War two when you don't have American leadership the world is the most dangerous place now that ... thanks to Donald Trump now we have a modern chief who believes\nThat even exists read his ... speech listen to what he says about ISIS about what the Chinese are doing what he said at the un is absolutely absolutely so that's why I wrote why we fight but but you're absolutely correct we have domestic issues here\nEven exist not just outside of our borders look what they did to that godly man Brett Kavanaugh in the last fourteen days a man who had\nThe probably the cleanest most spotless record in an American public life goes from being a stand up standing federal judge to amass rapist they will use every tool because they lost the election and that's why the next thirty days also important shown\nIt means ah everything and then look everything's riding on this I don't know if you want to ask me three weeks ago I Would have leaned in on the side that history would would win out because the party that wins the White House\nUsually ends up losing seats in a midterm election they totally not happened three times only probably picked up seats three times in the last hundred years the last was after two thousand and one an attack ... September eleventh\nUm but they're so much at stake here and that is what ... literally jumps off the pages I'm reading through your book that we'd better defeat America's enemies and we'd better do without apologies tactic orca we don't get to do that if we're not in power right\nWe we have to take very seriously this concept of the left so the left has been taken over by the radical\nThinking about the fact that JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today a hardcore anti communist stronger national security he wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have we have the crazies we have the ... we have the magazine was in control who have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply\nThe ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool well guess who use that philosophy in the past that philosophy\nDrives to the labor camps to drive to the ... and Dr death camps whether you are right wing extremist whether you're a fascist or whether you're a communist that's the philosophy and we've got to stop that Sean we have to stay true to the principles of the republic you\nTalk it in a book about the a will to winter and and again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and here's what we can't have any more and you talk about the will to when you're talking about will\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized it is and we pulled out yeah in Iraq and Afghanistan\nWe pull out leaving it dates of all withdraw and we lost nearly six thousand kids in the end so many others comeback without their arms and legs in their in their faces his figured fighting for their country we cannot commit American troops ever again\nUnless we're willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war than we are not get involved ever period unless we have to you have to win these wars or else don't start to be involved in them\nSo so my book is about two things it's about all the threats we face of the country so whether it's ISIS Russia or China but the second part is much more important this is the one who hitting on\nIt do we have the will to defeat our enemies because mom is a great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with wooden sticks and Ross the rifles defeat us\nHow's that possible because we lost two more at home because we allow the left to undermine our will to win\nAnd and what are the most important things is the individual will to win\nThis into the the ... of the threats I have full vignettes of American heroes I go back to the Bobby was two hundred years ago I took about a Korean hero adjusted pulled her I talk about a man who spent six and a

true but what did he do\nHe had the will to fight he stood up for the truth justice justice cabinet that social on his his his his the scary thing the Democrats have done this before they'll be surprised at what they did to Capitol they've done it seven eight years ago\nThey have done it every election in my lifetime they play the race card the general ... you know they divided America old

end of it shown what can we do for you\nKnow and how are you fantastic Chris thanks for calling\nThank you for the great show um this is kind of an odd question maybe back in the sea early nineties I had a Nineteen Ninety Pontiac transport and I would drive back and forth from college or an ethical driving from Florida to northern New Jersey\nAnd at one point my girlfriend at the time her father said oh that's not good for the corps um you know at one point I drove straight through leaving Orlando at about eleven o'clock at night\nEnded up in New Jersey in about three o'clock four o'clock in the afternoon and my girlfriend's fathers that that's really not good for the engine I said what really why he said well the oil that that's not good for the oil at all\nAnd this has been clicking me for probably twenty five years now\nBecause the oil he implied that maybe the oil needed some kind of interesting period that driving for Seventeen hours would degrade the oil so you should stop every once in awhile to regenerate or something and it just bugs me and I'm just wondering I'm In this\nLet it regenerate or something and it just bugs me and I'm just wondering um and this was just regular ten W forty motor oil tend to be thirty something like that\nIs that there is there any merit to that well first did you marry this girl or no I didn't\nLook at it now he's wrong wrong I'm going to say about that because I have a daughter who's Fifteen and whatever your guys answer is I don't care I'm going to use this as a you know what you should probably shouldn't come over so much that it's bad for your car I'm going to use that as you're going to build our knowledge on her yeah\nAnd you know what I'm going to tell her 'cause she respects my advice and not years I'm just going to tell her do what I say when it comes to your car when it comes to guys listen to your dad [laughter] that's a and guys watch out because we we we know who you are [laughter] that is vice was not good advice\nI um I got a Nineteen Ninety nine Honda Civic the key edition and\nAll of a sudden this thing just decided to stop or running one day I'm pulled into a parking spot went back there thirty minutes four years later and it's just one star ... span but it just didn't seem like the spark so I\nGet under the hood I'm I'm pretty I'm Kathleen Clyde so I tested out the coil I thought it was bad every place to place the spark plugs and wires out there that some other things to think still wouldn't start so I took a thrift shop just a kind of helped me out the guys at the shot came back with a\nA estimate that said five now\nThirty dollars and the team\nThey yeah they were basically replacing the entire\n...\nYeah the entire ... and they they told me that it was just reading\nAnd you know\nWhenever I have to disagree and she had a compression values that he gave me and stuff like that well here's the funny part as I'm going out to take the car I'm actually brought a trailer again I'd trade over there and I'm bringing a trailer to pick a bag and I just looked at him with the key and I said\nLet's just get one one good luck shot here I go there starts up like it does every time and it occurred like a kitten his face drop literally I mean he was\nGonna ask you a couple of questions here to kind of get some foundation on this question here I think I Know why would a guy in the shop a Honda Civic\nVP addition is you know I I I Know most of these nomenclature what year is this car\nNineteen Ninety nine\nAll right and how many miles on this fine automobile\nOr about one Seventy and I got\nThis thing from my grandfather after he passed away ... meticulously\nMaintained and I'm really darned good at it\nAnd the only real challenge we hear about these inches there was no one I don't recall the whole ten but I Know they read it for a while ago they had problems with some meetings between the head gas gets in the heads there was a cracked\nBlock that would occur and oil leak in and it was that was something that was pretty well no one on those but it wasn't it wouldn't lead to what you're having happened and yeah you know now\nWhat's funny is it's been about five days and it's rotten every single time I've been using a car you know not taking it on the trip this thing is rather like it did before and\nYou know there's there's always been a little league on this car I Would say maybe five little drops a quarter of a teaspoon a night you know kind of thing but not nothing\nBig and yeah it's been running so you know like I said I replaced the coil and that whole distributor assembly there and it's been run you know like a top I I just don't understand\n[laughter] oh God I've well any\nRestaurant for a second just repair shop was not lately trying to rip them off yeah I just didn't start and when it didn't start like he's been having trouble with maybe it finally got rain you will\nYou get full fuel to where it was just washed out and the compression was off so they said hey you're gotta you gotta compression issue is the engine needs to be replaced it's going to cost five thousand bucks well that sounds real is\nIn that case I would've said there is no way of spending that much money on this older car I'm going to go the hardest part not top pick up a use that to keep the car going that'd be a great thing to do that so when you do it or if you wanted to keep it going but\nNow that it's started I'm going to say\nHey you start center runs perfect there's no way I had a compression\nProblem and then now I don't I think we've got an electrical thing going on where we are not ... obviously were fire new checkers and we've gotten a few when it the flooded out and make it ... you know spin like that would do compression\nAssuming somebody was not completely trying to rip them off well that's a measure that I've actually got a new story that you don't want to hear that'll make you very angry about that for a small for some people are going to do that kind of stuff\nWe don't want to hear that will make you very angry ...\nSmall percentage of people out there that do that kind of stuff and they get so hard\nFor me trying to do it right and I I just I don't know of any personally that I've seen it over a decade federal else that I just want to read the news story wow okay I'll do what I think it's got an electrical thing we're going to find it the next time it doesn't fire we're going to find out do we have spark\nDo we have fuel I'm almost that and we're going to find we don't have sparked and it's going to have to be diagnosed and even if you've replace the whole distributor assembly which is a huge problem on those cars are we\nWent through you remember that one car which and we went through like five three ... three at least at least three distributors before we got a good one new ones brand new that we're supposed to be quality parts so they fail and the repeat failures often you gotta make sure you get a good quality\nI Would for fun district just because I'd be curious person may be on this deal has to run a compression test on it now that it's running right yeah yeah yeah yeah that and just confirmed that the engineers healthy 'cause a hundred and Seventy thousand miles and that's the big engine has not been done and\nYou know what right I'm betting that shop that got that look on their face that uh if you still you know given the benefit of the doubt they might actually do a free compression tests for you just to see as low as they knew it in ... I mean I Would if somebody went like that or the you know I Can't believe I missed that I Want to see why they pick is yeah we're human things happened we've had we've had\nVehicles that are out of recycling facility that will start and they've gotten to Russia's service Centre and we found out just the opposite that they had gotten a flushed with fuel and it doesn't happen a lot but they've gotten so much people ran through and they just they they just had no compression left and so they were able to\nDrain everything out and let it sit with the plugs out for a little bit and turn it over and and she came back to life I can\nRemember when I parked on a on a friday on a Memorial Day weekend and it had no compression the plugs route nice stuck up back in and I said we're going to push it outside because it it's going to be junk it's going back to our recycling center where just check it out it was a ... car and I'm the tech guy that started up because what was wrong with this and I went\nOh well [laughter] and we checked it and I didn't read pretty rough on this thing without which we see it as well a long time ago which acted again with a so key ... that we need to really look at this so\nAnd thanks very much for the call good luck eight six six five nine for for one five oh let's talk to Jeff Jeff you're on the end of the ... what can we do for you\nOr ...\nOr ... or ... or the radio and I\nKnow if they quit a couple of years ago and a few okay I didn't know if there's any other additional beside the radio is that makes them work I mean my parents are complaining I don't ever ready to go\nTo a thousand and eight Ford super duty I Believe the radio circuit only has the ones you okay on some of the GM cars they run an accessory fuse that does one part and then they run another fuses does another part on some of the GM vehicles but\nYou arrest of doing that thinking look too if you can think of any else is there on the Ford is there anything else on the radio circuits well the lightning circuit could come into play\nI'm for my first thought is I'm going with the [noise] the radio piece of it\nI'm going with the GM thing where we've got two circuits and the ... yes but we're seeing more and more vehicles now that you were correction and they have one power circuit just\nLike your home computer has one power plug now if you own slug it it will keep it software in there because it does have a built in power supply backing it up a lot of these radios are going to hard drives and different things but yes you can disconnect them for like two years before they'll lose all their memory\nSo yeah a lot of them just have the one circuit in there but if it's losing memory I have seen some radio is that we have had to replace in the last couple of years now in about seven or eight right in there when they switched to the started putting new are designed radios in some with\nMore features they're not feature radio or whether it's each the radio or my link with the GM and Ford Scott sink and things like that and those radios\nYeah there you turn the key up there like I if I turn the key for two days I lose all my stations but if I just drive it every day it's fine and and that's and then the radio you have ...\n... ... ... ... ... a lot I mean I Know up here it's your friends you care about yeah I Know I think our\nTown to bring their tell them to bring their own radio and just you know headphones and tune in because you wouldn't want free radios going at the same time\nOh sure yeah ... ...\nThanks very much for the call you

sitting in I don't mean when they are I mean I live in a narrow\nWe've got a a customer that I said hey you're radios bad it's just raining your battery in it and you're ... cultures bad as like you you're going to replace these things as it unless you just don't care about the radio and we just won't put it in will just\nWe ... we look Sixers phenomena that works of course he's like oh no no no

again and if it says plus to shut it back off move the distributor just to hear more tightened it up fire it up until the the engine read zero you don't need to disconnect anything you just do that

up twenty four\nReady for this cat's hardly budged small cats Russell two thousand was flat huh\nNew highs and the whole market twenty four new lows\nSix hundred and eighty\nInteresting advance the clients on New York twenty to Fifteen NASDAQ Nineteen twelve that wasn't really a story like\nWhen I did a show about Ninety I think somewhere around there and I just said to you somewhere in here we're going to get bumped four hundred ... what I say to fifty three hundred four hundred today\nNo reason at three o'clock to fifty five the Dow reverse everything\n\nAt two fifty five but that was twenty five or six to flat after being up four hundred\n\nWell is it twenty five for one seven right before the close\nUp about a three sixty five\nIn one hour three hundred and sixty five points but I had a little package in the last five minutes\nBut still finished up to eighty and change\nSo what happened today is my new coal Goldman Sachs and said we can't go into the weekend a week because we don't want to crash on Monday so by the hell out of the market\nOkay that was sarcasm maybe but what else happened today Europe was up early finished down on the day and that\nHelp us what else happened today at the small capsule Russell two thousand was flat\nEarnings came out GPA more reporter was they beat down two dollars and some odd cents before the three o'clock no but we still down a buck and change what else happened today PNC Bank\nSuper regional down seven bucks today on their earnings what's with that\nWells Fargo was flap on their number also I think city group and they report it and then yeah it was up a buck and change but I must tell you\nYeah it was up a buck and change but I must tell you a check in the last hour\nSo quite the interesting that up four hundred down\nFinish up to eighty but now now that one hundred at great relative strength most of the day but when the Dow was flat the stack at three o'clock I should give you that number also\nNASDAQ three o'clock you ready for this for Lebanon eighty five we've got to finish up one sixty seven\n\nSo good move on the NASDAQ and got Seventy five Thirteen on the open and finish the Seventy four Ninety six got a bunch of back and of course in the NASDAQ it's higher paid up they haven't been the hardest hit\nSo they got the heart is balanced today but don't ask me how you played on a day like today when you're up four hundred you're down you're worried about a reversal in the three o'clock somebody presses the button\nOr whatever happens\n\nAnd the usual suspects thing that I Want you to think about a couple things here on Amazon was sixty nine bucks today okay\n\nI'm making a point here but Amazon is still down a two hundred and forty five points from about eight days ago\n\nAs I mentioned apple strongest of the strong got back about the fifty day to day which is rare\nWhich is rare and then you could go through just a bunch of names if if you have time to to trickle was up twenty three today but it's still forty forty nine dollars below the higher seven days ago\nI was fourteen today it's still down fifty bucks for about seven eight days ago they catch them on this stuff now\nVideo was eleven bucks today that's down or sixty Seventy eight to nine or forty four dollars off the high is about eight days ago two hundred and forty six dollar style\n\nKind of do a few more with your mind go up twenty nine today that stock was down a hundred bucks for about seven days ago and we're talking about from today's hot close to that\nI Do a couple of more\nLooking for some oversight into it was eleven today closer to eleven this one's not so bad was to thirty about six days ago down Nineteen bucks that's better than most that's one of the stronger names actually\nSo we're just making a point to you that this is a balance it's normal maybe it could happen Monday it happened to that\nWhat I simply do right now I keep my list of the strongest stuff knowing that if there are other legs down they're going to get but daily I Will keep a list of the strong stop\nBut again we're\nDown fourteen hundred in the last two days up to eighty seven that's basically what happened here nothing more real need to read into like a backup one sixty seven is still around six hundred eleven points in the last seven days\n\nSo we can't predict when something is going to balance we just know when it gets real downside there will bounce eventually so today you got about\n... minutes on the two hundred they moving average at the clubs and these are the moving averaging close it's our next we'll just the one only has that [noise]\n\nSome earnings finish in the ... point of the new new shows the financials and then you can go skiing bank of America\nYou know you can call that a little bit of a reversal today look at Wells Fargo\nAlmost can call that a little bit of a reversal today look at Wells Fargo go look at Morgan Stanley gross go look at some of the small regional fits third banquet new yearly loaves\n\nSo as we scan stuff go look at Mary odds hotel do twenty billion in revenue horror show their market for Marriott\n\nHotels and shrimp airlines\nAmerican Airlines new yearly lows\nDelta looks like Koch a United which was kind of strong and still relatively broke the fifty day and it's still got some trouble here like to do some other ones but not good that's an important transports right in and around new yearly lows\nUPS better but not looking good\nAnd then you get the other transport names C. H. R. W. better than most but the rails strong definitely better than most ... a little bit this week union Pacific same as the FX definitely good relative strength versus everything else but still cracks\nSo a\nRebound of Goldman so I'll do that Goldman Sachs is right around new yearly lows\nSome pretty important names so I'm just keeping your feet on the ground to let you know you bounce today I haven't done my skin's yet but your balance today\nAnd by the way ten percent of the S. and P. five hundred or above the ... the day before today and that's where you get some oversold bounces that that's a little cause and effect things go to a stream you kind of tend to go the other way but as I said the other things\nYou're up and down today that was weird\n\nStocks which which they came in pretty good the last couple of days oil services look like crap go look at the Y. age they they were not looking good anyhow look at the ... the big oil just crap and two days\n\nThe explores the XO peak crap crack than two days that's what happens when markets crack they get everything\n\nYesterday we told you gold and silver well gold was strong yesterday pulled back today we told us they look for a pull back and we think there's going to be a little more to do with that\nNow I was asked today on TV about if the market finished the low what would that mean for Monday and I said well you never know the you know crashes aren't uh doesn't happen very often so let's not go there let's not worry about it they paraded a couple of people on TV this week that crashes a comment\nBut they said a crash was coming in Seventeen and sixteen and Fifteen and fourteen and ... you know that type of stuff ah they brought on harried that on the\nYou know the world is ending and he lied about his record as it usually does a shame on him\nThat's the only person I'll mention right now because the guy is just really robbing me the wrong way or we balanced today and I don't think you need to look further than\nBut we bounce today and the good news is a lot of the gains happened in the last hour\n\nBut I Wonder about that I'm always thinking this cannery by the powers that be\nSo many people from Goldman Sachs run the world and I know they have Dixie cups and strings to their old offices but let's not go there\nSo we balanced today\nI don't think you need to look any further than that this second\nBy the way MasterCard was up almost ten today but it's still down ten percent from six days ago again a lot of that and you need to recognize that\nBalances happen after big drops\nAnd anybody tells you they think the low was in the bottom is and is just guess and\n\nI Would suspect probably got some more tight\n[noise] up for this that and the other thing whatever else this is the
