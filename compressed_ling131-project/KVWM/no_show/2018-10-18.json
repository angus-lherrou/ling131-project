where beheadings and had shopping\nAnd chopping off hands and fingers and you name it goes on on a daily basis so the ... situation George unfortunately superseded by the economic ties to the U.S has it's a ... dependency on Saudi cash\nSo let me ask you about the scams first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm gonna walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman lives right if\nThe school provides a you know at the the car doesn't work than you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans [noise]\nUh but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of uh is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nThat's been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most option of the consumer protections but I just mentioned\nWhat if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in ah his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't\nAvailable they get that discounted off their student loan novel huh\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation or something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless you are making a minimal a annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise]\nUm [noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there\nBut I can tell you that what we have now today is the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen a you know the founding fathers way back in the day or people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington they were being Hillary by British banks and merchants\nOr so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniform bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war has the power to raise an army and many other very important powers\nAh so the founders you know they require bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student loan\n... and we're going to take calls next hour with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition Allen\nSure oh well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to be able to repay the loan in other words to default on alone\nAnd they want the default don't that's\nRight if it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead lots of defining hallmark of a predator\nAlso rather than remains in good stead lots\nOf defining hallmark of a predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies in the service serving the Garrett tours are often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than a loan the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where your credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default\nA but it turns out that ah the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm compelled to borrow or to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans\nThey got a sixteen ... percent commission right off the wall so you know where they can make the three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for service you know healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four or five six years on a defaulted loans that they can build a bar or to put through rehabilitation\nAnd so the financial incentives that ... there's a federal student loans system are just completely perverted and it's been turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nKnow explain the process of the defaulted loan in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let let's use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of\nAnd by any means so a student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nSure that's a that's a good case a good easy numbers to start with so I'm fifty thousand dollar student loan when the student graduates what say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years\nOr they're unable to make payments they lose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise]\nUm the student can expect a lot to be thrown into default so the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably defaulted somewhere around ... let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars what with penalties and fees and capitalize interests that are slapped onto that loan\nVery quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty twenty\nFive ... hitting the ball or is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment and fall for\nRoughly let's say a hundred and twenty five or so a thousand dollars oh my\nGod so what the what the new system will do will say oh you're into fall on your loan big trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment\nWe can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nThat will be taxed too you stuff like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or\nSo ultimately they will wind up its um hopefully the government hopes I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments\nFor about a four ten months typically none of those payments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that ... this rehabilitation\nAt the end of the process they wind up signing for much a new are much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars\nWell these agents again is sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that that compel them to do this loan rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nCheese and the ... these agents or collection companies\nWell yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] ah and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well um these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own guaranteed horse so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would far rather see a loan that goes into default rehabilitate than\nA ... ... that alone that remains is good said and I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there do not rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate they default\nAgain three to four oh and they just keep growing\nOh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan\nDefaults again and that happens something like eighty percent of the time then the whole process starts again\nTo stay with us Allen let's talk about if there's any recourse here and the and then again we'll take calls next hour with Alan calling U.S Coast to coast am\nSign up no go zone or breathe email newsletter today at ... dot com [noise]\n\nThomas Jefferson one said there are two ways to conquer and in slavery nation one is by the sword and the other is by debt and you should have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is they will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't\nIf they don't get the sun's then they become subject to arrest\nSo in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and and forced to ah to come into court that way to deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server the sheriff or private process serving ... company if\nThey're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nRuled that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly a in just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise]\nUh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was like three thousand dollar loan\nAnd they hold this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars which included you know penalties interests in court costs and fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera um\nThat's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know the uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison a that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy writes ahead of the power to declare war has risen army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans they old fifty thousand or they want to pay the fifty let's assume that's what they want to do\nBut you're saying because of these defaults the fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that it grows even more\nCan't they just cut a deal on the fifty\n[noise] well um they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it defaulted what\nKind of settlement is that\nFor most people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place uh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan went into fault that is free unrealistic for most people [noise]\nUh so that you know the government has got you where do they want you on the student loans they're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice dot org so many years ago\nYou know I had worked in government lending in other areas and I had never seen anything like that\nUh you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this was the sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this is happening to realize that you know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you saying that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there is about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to rescind revoke suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses and across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired a from this public employment ... for the case of default to student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nThere's this cross a part party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what has President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\n[noise] it absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats or Republicans\nAre unfortunately the past say three presidents really have only made the problem worse or under Obama Obama especially federal lies the lending programs so that where before\nA bank such as those that I mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae Nell et cetera whether they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans\nAnd by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five billion dollars a year which\nIs more than any corporation on earth on the lending program\nNow Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before\nHe said why is the government property not student loans this is nonsense you know of all the places that the government shouldn't be making a profit you would think student loans would be it a and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five\nYou know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans or the ... system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those are those days I'm so unfortunately you know those ... don't Trump's rhetoric was really good\nBut since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him\nA et cetera so would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy divide us\nTrue so would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy device who herself had stock in going collection companies [noise] ah and you know frankly I don't think President Trump is really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds\nOr so I have I hold out some hope for him a but at this point I have to say he's been a he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Nineteen Ninety eight you could a file bankruptcy wipe out your student debt what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um [noise]\nSome of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they tried it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away\nAnd so um so yeah Congress ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable\nWhat we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening\nFar less than one percent in fact about three tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans in bankruptcy was far less than the average for other loans\nSo there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights are and the fact that we've had to suffer under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing of ... this is a problem that Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against the citizens\nWere with Alan Collins is west side of the student loan justice dot org linked up and goes to goes damn dot com his book is called the student loan scam you're on some kind of a nationwide tour these days tell me what you're doing\nOh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress it's called HR twenty three sixty six [noise]\nUh and this bill would simply delete the one line of federal code that make student loans treated differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings so this really gets to the core of the problem and ah by by getting this bill passed\nA we would immediately see a dramatic decrease in the price of college\nAh we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality of the job that the government does administering the program a so this bill is very important and we're hoping very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nNow in a lot of people would prefer not to have to file bankruptcy they just don't like the stigma\nOr is there anything else that we can try to do or get past legislatively to fix some of these student loan issues\nWell absolutely and I agree nobody wants to file for bankruptcy is a terrible thing to have to do and and even more difficult thing to fight for I should say [noise] ah but it's just the threat of bankruptcy that would really help the lending system but you know there there are a lot of things that we can and should be doing you know as I mentioned earlier President Johnson\nPromise that the loans or she would be free of interests so why can't we get back to that why should why like Donald Trump said why should the government be making a profit on these loans\nFar from it costs twenty four seven news\nAre going to be in jail\nReal news real honest opinion\n\nThe Treasury Department says budget deficits are rising crust of the trunk of his cow but that's a Taco Bell\nPresident Trump watch each cabinet secretary to come up with your own nickel plan trimming their budgets by at least five percent\nAnd I think you can do more than that\nThere are some people

now Hi Andy Glyn\nHi George you're agreeing patron and Mr call it's a real honor I listen to many times and you're very um [noise]\nInformed and entertaining to listen to a two part question if I may uh first of all a based upon all of your knowledge of um [noise]\nThe western powers all of the NATO countries and for that matter let's say the eastern bloc countries ... will approximately how many ... as long as you've been following this how many are aircraft and uh pilots have disappeared in the high while pursuing\nSo called UFOs and are based upon your response I I have a second part\nA final question if I may okay\nNicky with us yeah sorry I thought you were going to hit me with part two straight away while we're waiting for that will ... will be down on the one\nI'm ... now I'm going to sound a little bit skeptical on on this I Would say the answer is less than than a lot of things that I've I've read in in the UFO and alternative belief communities\nI mean I've seen some people talk about pilots going missing and and you have fires and I think you know unfortunately flying is an inherently dangerous\nUm occupational certainly was in in the early days and the load of motivate Croft just this period because they crashed now now of course then you have\nYou have some classic cases like a ... the mentality case he didn't disappear of course but he crashed\nChasing a UFO which skeptics say with the planet Venus we coming off of cost the fortieth anniversary of arguably the most famous disappearance of all time involving a UFO Frederick Valentin\nOh yes and that was strange was I think we're literally die use the way in Australia right\nYes I absolutely over the or is it by trade I think over the past ...\nStraight maybe the best straight is part of the task Muncie excuse me I'm geographically challenged in that particular part of the world but\nUm but I I don't buy into the room as that that I've heard the pilots were\nWere crashing and disappearing or all the time as a result of of that we had a case in the u._k. tragic case in involving a pilot who who just flew ... into the city\nIn in I think Nineteen Seventy it was during a night exercise and some people years later I tried to attribute to us for\nA story on to that but I pulled out the board of inquiry file which was about two inches thick I went through every single paper in that file\nOil which was about two inches thick I went through every single paper in the trial and I couldn't couldn't actually substantiate any of these UFO ... so I think I think the answer the question is is very few\nVery from the okay go ahead and say\nOh okay so the second part question based upon your your spark a with a ... you probably know during the Eisenhower administration there were so many aircraft\nThat we're a suddenly a malfunctioning falling out of the sky and uh yes in some cases just suddenly disappeared that the Eisenhower administration gave the order to stop the pursuit the aggressive pursuit by American aircraft obese UFOs\nOr and secondly I spoke to Dr Heinrich ... before he passed away huh Chicago radio station for about a five to seven minutes\nAnd I asked him what are the chances of um [noise] a life uh not existing on other planets and knocked are coming and visiting us a and\nHe said impossible that that was his response impossible so I I appreciate your perspective I Do personally believe\nThat they dominate this guy any time and every time that they come are within our airspace there are so many thousands tens of thousands and God only knows maybe millions of years ahead of us they could be entered the mention or they could be physical or both\nBut I don't think we're much of a match and they do have air superiority\nAnd [noise]\nI Do appreciate the honor and pleasure but talking to both of you\nThanks near the appreciation and well set by the way and yeah\nAnd he made a really interesting point which goes back to something in the British Intelligence assessment port check on the line and that was a I I don't like to call it amusing but ah I it was kind of\nPoignantly amusing maybe ... that was a line about flight safety safety

just don't give it to Amazon and look up blood brothers make pope or it's on late Nick ... website on the books\nSuper in your opinion assuming we're being visited do you think most of them look like these so called de Leon graze the people described or do they look like costs what do you think\nWell in the tricky question because I think the media kind of like to have this this kind of\nTrump or me or whatever you call it of of the alien gray and then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because I think um you know when people say oh I've seen one of these aliens gray large had\nBig ... shaped it gets reported but when when somebody says they've seen something that doesn't quite fit the mold maybe it doesn't quite make the caught or get the coverage but\nIn my experience when people record entities just as when they report UFOs they come in all shapes and sizes\nAll they sure do but you but you saw almost saying then that people basically they hear this they hear this and then they think they see it\nYes I think perception plays a big part in this but here again who who can say what um what technology if we are being visited by civilization in let's face it the universe is nearly fourteen billion years old\nImagine what a civilization which you say a million years headstone telling us money to be able to do in terms of you know hiding themselves mosque that true appearance\nA deception uh it's it's unimaginable so so again I think we're in this territory where what we watch what we think we see and perceive may be very different from the reality of what's going on and they may ultimately be\nUnknowable to us through a species that are telling level of development what you thought of the propulsion system that\nWell it's it's clearly a community you ought to be some something exotic I guess we're in and sort of Star Trek ... tree and in one sense of some sort of faster than light travel ... again there are some theoretical physicists working on this\nSort of thing trying to figure out whether it would be paying\nSpace time whether it will be using wormholes I suspect gravity is going to be the key to this um gravity I guess of the fundamental ... is the one that we\nKnow at least to bow often and therefore it's the one where we have perhaps more likely to make quantum leap breakthroughs in terms of of science and technology\nThat's going to the phones again let's go to Alex in Rochester New Hampshire and to get things started Hi Alex welcome to the show\nI think you have a question of her new hope um I Hope to

empowered to extraterrestrial visitors 'em might possibly be eager evil or negative awkwardly demonic not all of them but maybe I'm\n\nWell I again I think it takes us into this territory of what are we dealing with it even if we didn't have some something real that\nWe really know what it is ... can we really\nAre a scribe human emotion to it the problem with all of this if we can only come at this from\nAn ... point of view and we tend to to be kind of you know very black and white I think you know our thinking sometimes we see it in politics we see it in religion you know it's glass half empty glass half full good aliens fad aliens\nAnd and you know one has to wonder does this actually come from whatever it is that your interacting with well does it come from your own cultural background belief system mum\nSection may be influenced by by documentaries or science fiction or whatever it it might be I I don't I don't like to take anything off the table I mean I I I tried to be open minded with all of this and\nI think earlier in the show I said that there is unlikely to be one single neat solution to the usa mystery\nSo I think you know when you ask me what might be out there I don't think if there are other civilizations and the cosmos which I firmly believe there are\nI don't think it's going to be a question you know there's just one of the civilization um therefore you know are they good or bad I suspect\nIf we share this cause most\nWe share it with with a whole\nBunch of different civilizations which which may have absolutely different points on the

were beheadings and shopping\nAnd chopping off hands and fingers and you name it goes on on a daily basis so the showcase situation George fortunately superseded by the economic ties to the U.S has its I interviewed tendency on Saudi cash\nSo let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm going to walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman laws right if\nThe school provides a you know at the the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans [noise]\nAh but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of uh is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most apps and of the consumer protections but I just mentioned\nWhat if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in ah his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available they get that discounted off their student loan\nSo you know the ...\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation or something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless you are making a minimal ah annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise]\nUm [noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there\nBut I can tell you that what we have now today is the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen\nA you know the founding fathers way back in the day or people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants\nOr so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise]\nUm they demanded uniform bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war has the power to raise an army and many other very important powers ah so the founders you know they require bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student loan\n... they were going to take calls next hour with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition Allen\nSure oh well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to be able to repay the loan in other words to default on the loan\nThey want the default don't that's\nRight if it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead well that's a defining hallmark of a predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies and the services and the guarantor ours\nAre often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than a loan the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where your credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default\nA but it turns out that ah the lending system can make far more than\nA dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm compelled to borrow or to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans\nThey got a sixteen ... percent commission right off the wall so you know where they can make the three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for service you know healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four or five six years on a defaulted loans that they can build a bar or to put through rehabilitation\nAnd so the financial incentives that ... there's a federal student loan system are just completely perverted and it's been turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nKnowing explained the process of the defaulted loan in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let's let's use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of\nAnd by any means so a student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nSure that's a that's a good case I'm good easy numbers to start with so a fifty thousand lawsuit alone when the student graduates what say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years\nUh they're unable to make payments they lose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise]\nUm the student can expect a lot to be thrown into default so the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably defaulted somewhere around ... let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars what with penalties and fees and capitalize interests that are slapped onto that loan\nVery quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty\nTwenty five ... in the bottle or is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment in fall for roughly let's say a hundred and twenty five\nLetters for payment in fall for\nRoughly let's say a hundred and twenty five or so thousand dollars oh my\nGod what the what the new system will do will say oh you're into fault on your loan big trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment\nWe can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nThat will be taxed too you stuff like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or\n... ultimately they will wind up ... um hopefully the government hopes I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is why they make payments\nFor about for ten months typically none of those payments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that whoa whoa a tape this rehabilitation\nAt the end of the process they wind up signing for much a new are much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars while these agents and get his sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that that compel them to do this alone rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nCheese and the ... these agents are collection companies\nWell yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's no ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] ah and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well on these\nThese companies own service or they own collection companies and they also own guarantor so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandage they would rather see a loan that goes into default rehabilitate than\nA a ... that alone that remains is good said I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there to rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these defaulted loans to rehabilitate they default\nAgain three to four oh and they just keep growing oh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan default again and that happens something like eighty percent of the time that the whole process starts\nAgain to stay with us Allen let's talk about if there's any recourse here and again we'll take calls next hour with Alan calling U.S Coast to coast am\nSign up no go zone or free email newsletter get it today at ... dot com [noise]\n\nThomas Jefferson once said there are two ways the cocker and in slavery nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to Windsor\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is\nThey will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't\nIf they don't get the ... then they become subject to arrest show in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there\nPeople are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams what and and and forced to ah to come into court that way to deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server or the sheriff or private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nRuled that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly [noise] uh in just this one federal district or they had plans on a rush gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise]\nUh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was a three thousand dollar loan and they hold this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know penalties interest in court costs\nThousand dollars which included you know penalties interests in court costs and fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera um\nThat's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know the uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison a that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy rates ahead of the power to declare war has risen army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans\nThey old fifty thousand now they want to pay them fifty let's assume that's what they want to do what you're saying because of these ... fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that and grows even more can't they just cut a deal on the ...\n[noise] well um they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it defaulted\nWhat kind of settlement is that\nFor most people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place\nUh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan went into fault that is free unrealistic for most people [noise] uh so that you know the government has got you where do they want you on the student loans they're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice dot org so many years ago\nYou know I had worked in government lending in other areas and and I had never seen anything like that\nOr you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this was the sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this is happening to will realize that you know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you saying that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there is about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to rescind revoke suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses and across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired a from this public employment ... for the case of default to student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nDoes this cross a park party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what is President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\n[noise] it absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats or Republicans are unfortunately the past say three presidents really have only made the problem worse or under Obama Obama essentially federalized the lending programs so that where before\nA bank such as those that I mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae Nell et cetera whether they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans and by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five billion dollars a year\nWhich is more than any corporation on earth on the lending program\nNow Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before\nHe said why is the government property not student loans this is nonsense you know all the places that the government shouldn't be making a profit you would think student loans would be it a and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five\nYou know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans the lending system uh was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those uh those days I'm so unfortunately you know those ... don't Trump's rhetoric was really good\nBut since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him\nA et cetera so would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy device who herself had stock in do you go on collection companies [noise] ah and you know frankly I don't think President Trump is really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds\nOr so I have I hold out some hope for him a but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Nineteen Ninety eight you could a file bankruptcy and wipe out to students that what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um [noise]\nSome of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they tried it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away\nAnd so um so yeah Congress ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable\nWhat we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening\nFar less than one percent in fact about three tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans in bankruptcy was far less than the average for other loans\nSo there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights are and the fact that we've had to suffer under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing of ... this is a problem that Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against the citizens\nWere with Alan ... student loan justice dot org linked up and goes to goes damn dot com his book is called the student loan scam you're on some kind of a nationwide tour these days tell me what you're doing\n[noise] oh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called HR twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply um

profits kind of like trade schools rain legals yes more than a hundred and six sixty thousand\nPeople have claimed to the government at their school to fraud them and new applications continue to pour in I'm sure they will almost all the complaints come from for profit schools of which there are some seven thousand around the country\nInto thousands sixteen or the Obama administration announced the regulation aimed at canceling the dead of those with degrees from schools that misled or deceived them\nNow with ed to every life a little rain must fall because while this is a fair ruling I think okay if you get money out of this but that you paid for but I'll never back into that\nYou could very well and I don't know if this regulation covers this but historically if you were able to get your loan canceled for whatever reason and there are some uh situations where that is possible\nYou were also at the end of the year charge the income tax on that money going I don't\nKnow that a little bit but but before we get to that point mhm okay once again here's the problem okay the system is set up that when you apply for that bone to go to Joe's cosmetology school okay\nAnd it's going to cause two years or cooking school or whatever it is\nAnd for two years it's going to cost you ten thousand intuition\nThat government gives a loan for the entire two years of you going to that school yes okay so they actually give that school\nThat money yeah and his band up front what they need to do first of all is do it like you would do it with the college\nAnd that is pay for each semester\nIn other words right if it's a two year school the government should first give them a check for a quarter of that\nWhen I went back to school at thirty that's how we have done\nIt Kevin but the problem they got in was they were doing it in one lump sum so I could say\nLet's open the rod stole school of flying okay and if we get a government you have to get a government certification yeah that makes you eligible for student loan Monday okay yes that slight more important to you\nThan having an office and having a staff it's more important to you that having an Arab plane okay because the minute that you get that\nCertification that means you can bring in students who will give you a check from the federal government\nYes they will supply the money for your visit it's almost like a business low in a way\nYou know to the student I had never thought about it that way but I think\nSo what they need to do is not pay for the whole show mazel paid for by semester sure or something like that to make sure that the school lives up to it's part of the contract they didn't do that now once again\nI hadn't even really thought about that angle of it but you're absolutely right\nI don't know how smart you are there are people listening to us today who have PHD's there are people listening to us that didn't finish high school\nThey vary but you know what there are people and we make a lot of them because they take jokes pretty well because they're wealthy\nThey're called lawyers okay they go to school and they study on an average of six years to get a law degree\nAnd then they practice the law and they know a lot of the tricks that I'm Sorry to say no matter what you do unless you are a lawyer you don't know sure OK\nYou may know how to get to the back door of your doctor's office or to the back door that those of us or how to get a good table and just specific grass\nAnd that those of us or how to get a good table and just specific restaurant okay but you don't know nothing about all okay if you owe Fifteen thousand dollars on the student loan do yourself a favor\nTake three hundred dollars and call them that Ernie\nAnd get a legal opinion on it and ask him if he will write you a letter that states his opinion okay do that\nIt's worth the three hundred dollars I tell everybody that go to purchase a home oh invest the money in over a lawyer in our salute we weren't they know what they're doing pokes which only jokes that are made about them it's not the truth\nYes are there are guys that we call politely ambulance chasers or their guys that are better ... than other lawyers\nYes but you're talking about a very big sum of money\nIt's worth the investment I Will always invest one percent more money one dollar for every dollar\nThen to lose the initial some yeah OK so once again just I Would suggest\nThat what you do have you been in one of these jackpots where you are supposed to go to some type of trade school yeah and something happened and you weren't able to finish the course now re alluded to the income tax\nResponsibility remember when they loan the money they gave you a check\nAnd technically you pay the school not the government directly you paid for\nSo they will try to collect taxes on it like in his regular income and that is another good reason to have the opinion of an attorney so that you can put that in with your tax return so you don't get taxed on Sarah who never got to spend\nWell and there's also a Complete Guide to borrow or defense to repayment uh the borrower defense or all the information is there

because I was driving is drunk driving\n... by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council\n\nRight as we continue Newt Gingrich is with us eight hundred nine foot one showing us our number will Palm Beach Florida Today I Want to go to this issue of\nThis this reporter this guy with the Washington Post today or is not an American citizen\nLived for a long time in Saudi Arabia and it looks like he walked into the Saudi ... council a in a council it in in Istanbul and it looked like he was murdered now Mike Pompeo was asking the president to give the Saudis a couple of days they say they're going to get to the bottom of it\nBut I don't really have any doubt that this guy was murdered and murdered by the Saudis and I doubt it happened without the crown prince and other top people in Saudi Arabia knowing if that's the case\nYou know I Know Democrats want to pressure Donald Trump into doing whatever they want to do and making this the biggest litmus test but let me remind people that Hillary Clinton in the Clinton Foundation took millions from the Saudis she never brought up their horrific treatment of women\nKilling gays and lesbians she never brought up one time the persecution of Christians and Jews in Saudi Arabia um and the same would go for a look at how they treated Benghazi but with that said we already know the double standard exist what are you what do you think\nThat's why I think I mean I think first of all that the president is right to be cautious\nOr do you indicate clearly that we don't necessarily know all the things that are going on in that I I think there will be very foolish\nFor us to a break a relationship with Saudi Arabia which is the key to containing Iran or what but I think we have to get to the bottom of it let me also point out to vote\nI'm just now working on a novel for next year called collusion in which the Russians are decide they want to poison the U.S Senate or if I were writing a novel\nAbout a Saudi journalist being killed and\nThe circumstances are just strange is that they're going to kill him in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nKnowing that the Turkish intelligence services monitor them all the time they're going to do it with a team of Fifteen people [noise] um it's almost like if they did do it and I'm not saying they didn't I mean clearly something terrible happened and and clearly\nInvade them on their sloppy and stupid and you know a ... it's unbelievable the position they put any of their allies\nAnd you're right we have this on President alliance against the Iranian had Gemini with the Saudis Israelis Emirates Jordanians and Egyptians and it you know now that creates massive complications\nWell in but if you look at it you know we've said pretty clearly we're not going to tolerate the Russians poisoning people in Great Britain is led to very specific sanctions\nOr I couldn't imagine a circumstance where if we do in fact decide that the evidence is overwhelming under the Saudis have the least promised secretary of state compel that they're going to give him the full report out again or they may well be lying but\nYou know in the end or we discovered that there are key people in Saudi Arabia and all I suspect it will be sanctions but that's different is one thing that sanctions it's another thing you know to go wild and break up the the alliance and the relationship and the Israelis have been very clear that they regard Saudi Arabia\nAs such an important a defense against Iran or do they have urged us to be very careful and this process\nWe've got to go but um that's the speaker uh it does complicate things but people do remember that our arch enemy are aligned with U.S Russia the former Soviet Union to beat Nazi is\nThat's right and I think sometimes you just said\nYou know we have taken steps against Russia in concert with the British over killing ... trying to poison several people but\nWe didn't we didn't go to church I think we may have to take significant steps ear and sanctioned some people and blocks some people from coming to the U.S and I think frankly the crown prince had better clean this up or he will not be allowed back in the U.S for a long time\nI missed the bigger thank you for being with us we got to take a break by David shown and Carter Page will join us as the deep state gate gets a little deeper eh my buddies de do see we're going to get a lot of your calls and we have the other news of the day and what do we do about the caravan Nineteen days out of election day\nWe're in Palm Beach Florida Rush Limbaugh tonight for the full hour on Hannity as we continue\nOn the street because they were in a sanctuary city now the sanctuary state of California\nWith a with a sanctuary state free health care for all legal or illegal candidate Gavin Newsom out there in California you know talk about ... California Good grief you know we now have on record\nNumber of migrant parents entering the U.S with children surging to record lows listen they want their kids here in some cases we've actually found out that\nPeople that claim that the young children with their mother children turn out not to even be their children but they want to beat Donald Trump over the head with a hammer over this he's the one that stopped so family separation he's the one that's been saying build the wall\nHe's the one that's been saying you got to pass laws that I Can't do it by executive the odd\nHappened under Obama nobody cared happened under Bush nobody cared but of course the standard double standard is so transparent and so obvious we have House Republicans now calling for an investigation here we are watching this these videos of\nMembers of the illegal alien caravan\nActually being paid according to congressman ... hate so Florida he wants an investigation into whether the illegal alien caravan now head of the U.S\nIs being bankrolled by wealthy Democrats in America for Larry is to watch you know there was I saw a conspiracy theory tweet out there by some prominent Democrat I don't actually remember the name but\nActually says sources say your so scared of losing the midterms he's tweeting at the real Donald Trump an impeachment hearings that you your team influence the caravan so they're blaming Trump for the ...\nIf the dog bites the beef things you're feeling sad\nUm it's Donald Trump's fault if he cures cancer he wouldn't be liked by some of these people unbelievable right eight hundred nine for one showing us auto free telephone number you want to be a part of the program\nYou know we also have Trump saying the president saying well we may have to use the military at this point to protect our borders ... president today tweeted this morning I must than the strongest the terms asked ... Mexico\nTo stop this onslaught and upon able to do so I won't call up the U.S military and close our southern border\nI'm watching the Democratic party led because they want to open borders that existing week laws of salt in our country by Guatemala Honduras El Salvador\nAnd leaders are doing little to stop the flow of people including many criminals from entering the United states through Mexico in his third Tweedy emphasize the importance that he places on stopping the migrants\nFrom ever entering the country said the assault on our country and our southern border including the criminal elements drugs pouring in as far more important to me as president than trade or the new trade agreement that he has with Mexico and Canada hopefully Mexico\nWill stop this onslaught at their northern border is that all Democrats fault per week laws have been trying to fix it now for a long time right eight hundred nine four one Sean is our toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program Dan is in Michigan Dan Hi how are you\nWelcome to beautiful Palm Beach where here Rush Limbaugh for the full hour on Hannity tonight what's going on Dan how are you\nA ... hey I'm ... I Want to just go back to those documents that that are now with the inspector general you know the final core documents that a couple of weeks ago Trump's order to be declassified right right okay [noise] and then Rosenstein came over the White House immediately\nAnd I didn't go over from what I understand it was a phone call\nOkay but I Want to paraphrase what role does the same basically I'm a I'm going to truthfully poison roses night they called him up and said look this president myself and my buddies are trying to impeach you put you in jail\nIf you release these documents is going to prevent us from impeaching in your your tail and put you in jail and it's probably going to explode in their face and you aren't going to be a free man so which do not released the because we still working to subvert your presidency\nAnd then after Sean after the phone call Trump find out found out all this stuff about Rosenstein and the stuff that was after the phone call why wouldn't Trump realize they're trying to impeach him hold him to jail called the inspector general\nSaid get that to the White House sit around the oval office it meant to things released arrest\nFrom my understanding is there being extra super careful that the president still committed to de classification of releasing\nThe the unwritten pact did Pfizer warrants these are the main thing is we need we need the Pfizer warrant applications want we need the gang of eight material to we need what's known as the thrill twos or the reports Bruce or especially\nWith his contacts with Christopher Steele because we already know\nOr especially with his contacts with Christopher Steele because we already know because there's some of the leaks and communications\nThat Christopher Steele who under oath and under threat of perjury in Great Britain and in in Iraq and tore even he couldn't stand by his own pony fake Russian dot CA that he was paid for\nYou know you've got all these people now that now the or doesn't want to talk or Glenn Simpson pleading the fifth Rod Rosenstein not only not turning over documents is time to talk to the wall Street Journal but no time to talk to a the members of Congress and and hand over the documents so I understand it's on track\nIt's a little more complicated than him just saying release it released it the second lawyers are on it as is the latest that I heard my sources but I think I Hope that they get released before the election because I think the American people deserve to see it\nYeah it well they're trying to put them in jail he needs help himself\nListen I I Will tell you this has been a soft coup attempt\nThere's no doubt about we know what the insurance policy is\nWe know what the league strategy is we know that they knew there was no Russia Trump collusion even in the words of Peter Struck there's no they're they're Lisa Page even saying no we had nothing\nThat's why they started leaking the the phony dot CA information all the left wing or is in the news media they never told them that it was on verified are uncorroborated\nLike they never told the size of courts that it was on verified uncorroborated they tried to lie to us manipulate us with lies from Russia like Hillary paid for before the election\nAnd they tried to take down a duly elected president after the election so you're right um but I promise you I'm On it

Bush nobody said that and I just thought something was a foot there was something about Donald Trump and you look at\nHere we are almost two years later and Donald Trump remade American politics and just look at how many politicians are trying to out Trump\nTrump I mean you got Elizabeth Warren this past week I mean she really stepped in it because she had you know obviously he really got under her nerves and she took debate you know\nShe did the one thing ... I'm sure some genius who now looking for work said hey I've got a great idea you're going to have your big presidential rollout let's do it three weeks before the midterm elections\nWhen all the Democrats are just trying to stay\nOn the offensive because we're ahead and what does she do she makes a big announcement hey I might be one thousand Native American fat is just crazy because people are tried out do Trump\nBecause that's how I noticed the accurate one one thousand\nTwenty four [laughter] Native American ... percent European but the thing is the first minority woman ever\nTenured professor at Harvard I mean she did it for organizations she was a part of she did it at U. Penn when she was a I guess teaching their wrote this this was a disc for her was a calling card\nOr ... ... it remember Shawn you go back to a a month ago before she imploded like this uh you know the the mainstream media regarded her as perhaps the one democratic standard bearer who could\nAt her age with her stance take on a lot of the Bernie Sanders positions are and and she was a senator and she was relatively young\nSo ... and then she does this so now in the past week essentially the mainstream media kind of turned on her it's like they they called her up that was a dumb idea why because they want to find somebody who is a viable alternative to Donald Trump and they can win and with this kind of baggage she's not going in place\nDo you think as you look at and we look at polls\nBaggage she's not going in ...\nWhat do you think as you look at and we look at polls every day and I watch Fox and friends when I watch you guys you do a great show you the number one new show on cable news by far in your hour and you have been for years and then like me you've almost been there from the beginning not quite ... how many years that you've been on the air at Fox\nI actually started two weeks after we went on the air\nSee I have two weeks seniority on you [laughter]\nOh I I don't you know Rick regarding the current congressional races I happen to know a America's favorite political correspondent Peter juicy who uh is at this minute I\nBelieve the way I used to buy ... let me interrupt here you've got to be so proud of that kid he not only is there a great great kid that I've gotten to know and yeah he's been on my show many times in a great reporter I mean he's a you've got to be so proud of that\nShowing you've known him since he was can I Know it's crazy crazy it's crazy but ah they taught it looks like his mother [laughter] he's got his mother's hair I'll just\nSay that I'm Peter told me that he was a you know he's following the elections very carefully and he's got a sources from both sides of the aisle were the guys who is in charge of buying the ads for the Republicans Washington DC so that over the last two weeks they see a essentially a five point well\nAcross the board for Republicans and they're basing that they they attributed to Kavanaugh\nBe attributed to taxes and they attributed to immigration\nAnd so given the fact that uh the enthusiasm level is higher both suddenly the Republicans are spiking\nAt exactly the right time the big question is and I know you can get I think he was on with us like you said in the election comes down to to think Kavanaugh and the care of it in the Caribbean and of course of course of action by the United states hey Mexico do something about this or going to have to put troops on our southern border and shut it down\nWell I think the caravan is it really does highlight the case here and\nI got to tell you something the way the Democrats abandon I mean when you become the party\nOf all we want to raise taxes we want to open borders we want Obamacare we want to impeach from a and I'm telling you if this is not the agendas it's going to work and in hiding who you really are which is another problem but while listening to the book is phenomenal what what was the recipe of Brian ...\n... the the the cookbook is all about foods and make you happy and you you look you're a Hannity's a corn beef and cabbage because it reminds you of when you were a kid\nAnd you have one older one and it's my ... my favorite so it was so full of it but go ahead [laughter]\nUh Brian's takes him back is his bombs meatballs easily is her mom's a chicken demand we've got a Sarah Huckabee Sanders pecan pie remember the famous pie last year people said that\nShe wrote I told her she was nuts but her secret but she she crushes them with a hammer which is appropriate I remind you of my mind is my mom's pot roast month part of the religious\nRight Steve dizzy I started cooking it one morning thank you for being with us said hundred dying for one Sean has a number listen if you're like Linda and let's say you're Twenty years old and you're taking a vacation of a lifetime and you're in Mexico and you kind of a little bit hammered you might be a little bit of ...\nAnd you haven't won big party and then some guy says what do you like to duplicate this vacation every year for the rest of your life and you're thinking that's\nListening to talk of giant nine Seventy Katie WM show Seventy a DJ I over broadcasts service a metric\nItself fine Lisa ...

now I'm not even mad about it just it just becomes so comical it's it's it's the literally I can tell you what they're going to say before they say\nSo in a normal world in a normal world that we shouldn't be living in the headlines should read if you're being intellectually honest rather than the United states America promises to protect America\nBy making sure that people can't break into the country legally it would be like a good thing right I get like a good headline it'd be the equivalent of dad puts doors on our locks on doors to protect family from criminals who are planning to come break into your house you would be treated as a hero\nBut this is how messed up of the world we live and going in this mid term elections were were Donald Trump actually protecting our borders

just Monsanto that will have all these illegal aliens all ready to come walk for months after or low wages\nI I'm not disputing that I'm not out uh let me let me say this real quick let's go back to something you said the beginning and then we'll and then we'll continue on on your your your turn it on your thing I don't act\nLike all legal immigrants are are coming here to break laws I Know they are\nOkay\nEvery moment and we're still with facts not emotion so Kay is it a fact that if you come into the country illegally every moment of every day whether you're sleeping working whatever it may be that you are breaking the laws of the United states of America\nWashing or you were going to do this\nBut I Would only get Michael Michael it's a simple questions on a trick question you called me okay I I didn't call you the idea that you say I knew you were going to say that again\nAnswer my question you act like it is um some how ridiculous\nThat I say that every illegal immigrant is a law breaker that is their intent to break American law that's when they break into this country and they don't solve the paperwork and tried to come in this country is an actual legal migrants which I have no problem with\nYou try to act like the the breaking of the law is not breaking the law so you say well I Know all you all you talk show host you act like these people were all wall breakers\nThey actually are Michael I'm not saying they all have the intent to ... to rape or to murder\nI Do think they all have the intend to steal cars they're stealing from America when they come in this country legally\nThey're stealing from the American worker they're stealing jobs they're not paying taxes the right way many of them under cut jobs and make money in cash and the number one stimulant to Mexico's economy is illegal immigrants who take the money and send it back to Mexico so to act as if\nThe action of breaking into a country is it means that you're not a lawbreaker ... is absolute auditor insanity\nSo I'll start back with a question you as you said that you talk show host act like these people are breakers I'm not I'm not the one that made the wall the law is the law Michael the law says you cannot come into this country illegally by that definition they are\nAll breaking the law when they're here the entire time there he is\nA law that\nSays companies like that though is the legal for them to hire illegal alien\nI'm In favor of e verify I'm In favor also of going after those that hire illegals I've said for a long time if you want to clean up this country and get rid of illegal immigrants you don't have to deport any of them\nAll you have to do is start seizing hotels restaurants cars equipment on job sites when you find people that are working and employing people illegally\nI agree with you we have a problem with hiring the illegal immigrants but you have a bigger problem than that you believe that these legal immigrants are somehow not breaking our wall when they come across the border illegally and you act like it's at propaganda when it's not it's fact it is propaganda to treat people\nLike they are doing nothing wrong when in fact they're breaking our laws that is propagating started\nAnd fortune of all with all these companies that are really oil outcome\nSo let me get this straight Michael why can't we start enforcing the law the way the president wants to do which is it start enforcing the law at the border so these people don't even have the opportunity to come in this country illegally and then get work illegally why why are you so against that\nWhy you're exactly right with that but when it comes to federal the federal level all these other constituents there you know the politicians will lose money how big is Monsanto\nI I look I don't know how much money they make I don't know why you're keep focusing on one single employer there's there's there's Fifteen million illegal immigrants in this country maybe even more than that I'm giving it a low number here\nThere are thousands tens of thousands of companies you know I'm not I'm not saying you're crazy listen to what I'm saying let's not focus on one employer one person let's focus on the factors tens of thousands of employers in America than employee illegal immigrant labor labor\nI agree it's a problem but if you cut off\nThe flow of the illegal immigrant Les ... immigrant labor then that is a great starting point to get this under control why would you ... it's a two part solution I'm In favor of that but when you have four thousand plus people coming here border right now\nThe president's job and the and they're broadcasting it live on social media they're literally walking with the middle finger to this country saying
