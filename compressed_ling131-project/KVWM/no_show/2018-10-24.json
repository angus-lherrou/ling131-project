that is not diplomacy at all\nThat's outright frightening for president to say a thing like that when you're talking about the nuclear treaty with Russia being ripped up and by the way it was a treaty that was signed by Ronald Reagan\nSo [noise]\nWell I guess you could just put your hat on and ... ...\nOr if you're a commentator like me who lives and dies by his word\nWhich is what I Do never make a mistake about it we live and die in this business by our word because there's something you're going to know you remember everything we say somewhere along the line everything everyone in radio says is remembered by someone in the vast audience is that listen to all of us\nAnd are you people remember things I said Twenty years ago so I don't take back anything I just said\nThis is not diplomacy can be screaming from a helicopter where you can't even hear half the words that things slipping and no one's discussing it to me if you want to rip up a treaty that was signed by president what you do is you convene Congress and you talk about the treaty\nAnd you'll give evidence that Russia has violated the agreeing where where's the evidence have you seen any evidence that Russia has violated the agreement that anyone tell me where is the truth I'm I'm open\nI'm open to to to reason show me the proof Russia has violated this agreement\nAnd the justification for increased Ellicott City between the nation's show me where that is\nThis is the opposite of the Trump that I voted for just the opposite the Trump who appeared on the show there's the opposite of the Trump was not interventionist and a man of peace something's going on inside that administration that's very worrisome and I will say this we heard about an argument or a fight between\nThe great General Kelly\nAnd who was the other one I don't even remember who was it over the last time there was a screaming match between him and one of the ... oh the the moustache\nAnd then we hear that there was a fight between Kelly and\nCorey Corey Lewandowski over something something's wrong inside the picture because General Kelly is a four star marine general I'm going to ask you was only a state trooper\nDon't

John ... line three what's on your mind\n[noise] I like\nYes go ahead quickly I'm only about a minute and such\nOkay um I just wanted to kind of trying to clear up some of the issues regarding the nuclear agreement with Russia torn up on the air force veteran and a clue what Trump is doing this because he was aware that\nA stockpile of nuclear weapons that we have particularly with the air force which I'm more familiar with um are are all in dire need a replacement for example the curse of carrot juice I'm quite a few of those were converted to a conventional a warhead or the rest of 'em that\nAre so he wants to rebuild our nuclear arsenal so in order to do so yes the threatened war with Russia [noise]\nNow I Would say less I certainly ... plus Russia was trying to do is try to if they equal with them on that if you have a slight advantage\nOr is there any evidence that we outsiders can see which show that Russia has violated that Reagan Era agreement I don't know where that might\nBe [noise] that I don't hold on the line\nI'm sending you a copy of stop mass hysteria so we might stop mass hysteria joined the Savage Nation coal know eat bugs for Hubbard [noise]\nFor many years I've been wanting to Savage Nation about a secret war on cash by big government and big tech to steal both your money and your privacy well recent reports confirm that this war is expanding like

checks cash being confiscated from innocent citizens and much much more do till I call now eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six and you will get your free\nNow before we we move on got again if I had a park is I go for an hour right now I started something earlier in the show and I talked about the armies of invaders that are sitting on the border all these strapping young men and then I reference\nWhen the barbarians broke the Roman empire in the east and west and I talked about why that happened in the third century and the reason they were able to break the Roman empire and the third century is because the Roman empire at that time\nHad been decaying socially and disintegrating morally and then the barbarians ... appeared on their borders now what's shocking in what I said to you\nIs that no one listening to the show could disagree with me that this nation is not decaying socially and that's not disintegrated Marlene all you gotta do is look is look at the people in the media and you'll understand what I'm Talking about all you got to do is walk in San Francisco or New York where you see a man urinating on a subway track\nOr a bum dropping his pants in deprecating on a street that's what I mean by decaying socially then add to that the drug epidemic in the nation\nAnd then add to that the the model disintegration of the nation and you'll understand why were collapsing as a nation\nAnd so who saved the Roman empire almost saved the Roman empire\nAnd that was Constantine the great he was a monarch of great devotion and great intelligence by the way\nIn in some ways I Know you're not going to like to hear this Trump is like our Constantine the great\nI've made comparisons of Trump to pass to start figures and they've fallen on deaf ears because the ... the literary folk in the media don't want to hear anything good about Trump\nBut I'm sure they're educated people out there understand what I'm saying when I say ... he was constantly in the great ... of great intelligence who did some great things\nAnd what happened was ... Constantine originally beat back a raid of the guts\nThe gods you know about God's will you know I mean the gods with black makeup and San Francisco he beat Baca right of the gods\nWho are trying to come in the Balkans but he didn't have the will or the power of the government behind them to protect the frontier across the down you why he was too busy\nHe was preoccupied with the weaknesses of the empire itself does that sound familiar so Trump is facing a similar situation of a week and empire from within and invasion from without you following this\nIt's a very big story to take me a couple of hours to go into but I'll summarize it for you in a in a thumbnail sketch because what happened was caught some team did the best they could but then he\nDied trying to reorganize Rome and what happened right after he passed was the borders of Rome were ruptured and the visit God's invaded almost the Constantinople\nThey defeated the emperor of el ends at address in our poll they built the settlement in Bulgaria and from a de ... three seven nine to three Ninety five that came the emperor you do see us the great and he was a ... a formidable and ... and ...\nAnd over the armies of Italy and ... presided still like you know he was of angel and he presided over the army's in the Balkan Peninsula lark a God and I could go on and on\nAnd I don't want to go on and on just to give it some more history just to bore your histories to bore me as a kid but the more I study these things I realize that America is repeating the history all over again in some ways\nWhich is a nation collapsing from within from social and moral decay as was ancient Rome and the nation being pressed on its borders by armies from without as we are seeing in ... in black and white\nAnd every color imaginable on our borders were being pressed on our borders again\nAnd then what happened was after our lark marched into Italy and after a short speech took Roman eighty four ten Rome fell apart and what happened after um collapsed did life go on for the average Roman listened carefully\nThe opening half of the fifth century this was remember hundreds of years later\nYou saw the entire Roman Empire and Europe become prey to Robert armies of barbarians does that sound like gangs was doing I guess that there's not an eerie as I read you some history\nAs the Roman emperor empire in Europe collapses in the fifth century robber armies of barbarians were praying on the Romans citizen think about that think about what\nYou're seeing in America today where we as middle class citizens\nWe lock our doors we like our cars we I've alarm systems we carry guns many of us\nThink about this why you know you walk around a suburban neighborhood and look at every house they have an alarm system I'm not going into an ad every house has an alarm system every house is fortified like a little for\nBecause people realized that at night somebody could break in a while they're away at work paying the taxes for the illegal aliens to enjoy their lives someone could break and\nSo they protect themselves because right now we have the equivalent of rubber armies going around the country I Know it sounds\nRather hysterical but it isn't it's out of the ... it's rather accurate if you actually read the crime that was as I Do and looked at the data as opposed to the fake data put out by the fake media by those in the fake news business\nSo I can tell you what went on in the life of the countryside half the room was invaded and what happened to the nation their roads and forests became infested with robbers\nBarbarians went into the forest so stop right there you're in California the barbarians have almost destroyed our entire ecosystem\nThe barbarians who've been raising marijuana in the ... national forest these pristine beautiful ancient fires\nHave almost been destroyed by drug drug cartels or raising marijuana\nNot only drug cartels we haven't DeJesus criminals who have been destroying our ecosystem what's ironic to me is all these green left this who care so much about the environment have said nothing\nAs are sacred and pristine streams and waterways had been destroyed with toxic chemicals by the marijuana growers in our very national forest not one more from Jerry Brown\nThink about it the man of spends all this time conniving to hate Trump\nConniving to bring in more illegal aliens\nSays nothing about the army's that have destroyed our ecosystems it on national forest in their quest to raise more crops\nUsing chemicals that are banned and outlawed everywhere in the world to speed the growth of these plants and the waste is going into the streams and into the earth killing animals and destroying the ecosystem for many decades to come\nSo in many ways as I said to you history has repeated itself\nSo in many ways as I said to you history has repeated itself history is repeating itself\nAnd as I Try to alarm America yes I Would use the word ringing the alarm bell and stop mass hysteria I'm trying to explain to you about America's Saturday from the Salem witch trials to the Trump witch hunt and now the insanity of our time which are right

N. N. K. DJ eyes [noise]\nAnd I want to repeat what I said is it looks like the Mariel boat invasion of Miami in the early eighties and I'm asking\nThat Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador empty their prisons and then not houses it's a rational question that needs to be asked and answered I'm not going to rely upon politicians to answer anything I'm not relying upon the fake news to answer anything\nI'm going to rely upon the Savage Nation 'cause I had a call yesterday\nWho was an undercover ... who told me what's going on on the border by the way if you hear my poor dog coughing in the background that is the mascot the Savage Nation little chatty he just came back he's Fifteen Years old been with us from the beginning if you remember he was on stage with me at the chronicle pavilion when he was a little black\nPoodle and uh he has his issues what he's doing fine just came from the vet and she did an X ray and he has no fluid on his lungs and no sign of anything see just getting older like you\nAnd that's it so that's one of his life goes on so America's getting older and the older people in America are losing their will to live\nAnd they don't know what to do they came out to the polls in the last election with one last hope that one last candidate who was not a politician would save the country\nAnd thus far they're not sure what's going on they love the rallies they loved the speeches they like many of the policies they thank God the truck that Trump is there and she is not there but they don't know why he's not doing anything more visual for them with regard to the border\nThey don't know why it's one thing to give a speech with Ted Cruz and inspire people that's very important but I think the next day you need to follow it up with some action because each day that we lose is it that we can't replace\nIf you'll see an army coming what is general do\nLet us put it in military terms with or without weapons you see an army marching towards your frontier what does the general do what you taught military academy you sit there and give speeches or you'll line up your troops you built fortifications you build barricade what do you do when you see it on me coming to you see a border\nYou can't just when it gets through your way through this the whole world is watching\nAnd the entire nation and our future is on the line I Know you've heard this before but this is so clear to me now I've tried to visualize this for many of you in some of you got it that's why I'm Still successfully after twenty five years in radio while you're still make my books best sellers and thank you for doing that would stop mass hysteria without any promotion whatsoever\nExcept on this program and very very little else do\nYou see of the most prominent conservative writer in America right now me but you don't see me because I don't have a TV shows you got to understand the people do listen to this program and we are very important and the government than in the world and my ideas are not lost they listen to but they're not being acted upon right now\nIs good enough that I helped elect Donald Trump now we need to help Donald Trump protect us\nFrom the invasion of the new Mariel boat invasion weather is or not I don't know what would you do to stop this mass of humanity coming to our borders\n[noise]\nHave you ever taken your car in for an oil

cool eight hundred car sixty one hundred eighty every car sixty one hundred\nIf I were in Donald Trump's kitchen cabinet having a Diet Coke and an ice cream with them\nI Would suggest the same thing ... he's such an intuitively intelligent man and a man of action they say you know this is a good idea let's do it that's how he would work he would work like say if I was with it but I'm not invited I'm not invited because I'm not\nYou would work like see if I was with it but I'm not invited\nI'm not invited because I'm not part of the Fox news gang\nAnd it seems to me right now only Fox News people are being listened to\nParticularly that educated genius of who speaks them twice a day and advisors and everything probably advisors on things we can't even imagine given his lack of education they probably are considered even smarter than people who actually study these things given his lack of international knowledge is probably considered a better diplomats and train diplomats\nGiven his lack of the use of even the English language properly probably considered a better linguist a than linguists so I I wouldn't doubt that um it would be received with\nWith a very vacate very keen interest by the president he actually heard it\nBut ever since they put pockmarked in there I don't know since ... went in there I don't know that anything I say is being heard that was the last straw I mean once they put ... in there it was all over\nHow can you take people from one network and use them in your administrator and exclusively that Obama ever do anything like that\nYou know I'm a ... a very sensitive issue right now in the middle of all of this is not even personal it's worrisome to me what if Obama had hired the former director of I don't know CNN let's say let's take CNN what if we woke up and said oh gee Obama's talking to a Wolf Blitzer every night twice tonight on telephone\nAnd Wolf Blitzer is the only one advise them if this went on for years let's say a whole year no or then the the guy who was fired from CNN ... imaginary uh guys fired from CNN has no job the next thing you know he's communications director for Obama tell me what tongues would be wagging on the conservative side like all\nSo how could you just saying you can't be blind to what the other side is seeing if you are then you're going to lose and this is what's worrisome to me is I think that\nNot only we we the core base of this whole thing\nWe the people the core base of the whole thing I think we've become blind to the other side we may think we know what they think but I don't think we do and then if we're blind to what they're saying about us them were really in trouble\nThat's why I have to be the independence I am and that's why I sometimes a great many of you people who wear the hats forwards and backwards it upside down even on Sundays\nBecause you don't understand what it means to be an independent commentator in this country because so few of us exist there are others here and there but I Am an independent so what does that mean it means I have to be critical of times even of the man that I admire so much and who I back it's that simple\nIf you have a family member who you think is making a mistake socially or economically or in business\nAnd you say wait a minute that's not a good idea Johnny can't do that because here's what's liable to happen that's family isn't it family don't families disagree with each other where is this blind loyalty this idea of blind loyalty coming from\nThat's not the world I grew up and I grew up in a world of free thinking and vigorous debate it's actually\nA very American idea [laughter] free thinking and vigorous debate those all the way back to the founding fathers it goes back to the constitution of the bill of rights free thinking and vigorous debate but seems to have gone out the window right now people have circle the wagons it's like wait a minute don't you dare talk to the Indians\nYou know what I'm saying that's what has come down to stay here stay here in the inner circle\nAnd the kind of struggle wagons I used to call them Calistoga wagons but the ... circle then all of us wearing the hats have to stand in the middle and we have to wait for the flaming arrows to flying over the tops of the wagons\nI don't see the world that way I don't quite see it in those terms\nAnd I still think it's good to have a dialogue with your opponents otherwise you get increasing tension anger and rage hatred hostility leading to a total break down to the society which is the last thing we need bravo Michael thank you very much I just applauded for myself and my own head because that's what we need to hear more about\nWe didn't have more people saying what I just said\nLike give peace a chance you know what I'm saying like let's play a little beetles music together give peace a chance let's\nCertainly listen to the other side not the ones who are pushing and shoving hit them back harder as my position\nShe I say if we go low and they kick us kick them even harder kick them into the gutter it's that simple we go low they kick us in the gutter kick them how to take them into the gutter that's number one but if there are people that want to rationally discussion discuss things that's what I'm saying we should do\nAnd I would hope that the other side still has some rational people on it who are willing to hear our point of view such as let me ask you something missed the liberal from San Francisco are you telling me you really want another twenty thousand or so mainly young men strapping strong young men\nFrom the Central America to come into this country right now do you think they would actually say yes\nYou think that the city of San Francisco so liberal you'd be mistaken if you actually spoke to many of the middle class working people I mean professionals they may have money\nThere may have property new cars families you think they really don't know what's being done in the city you think they like stepping over human trash you think that they like seeing the windows broken and their cars when they go to a restaurant\nYou think they like seeing them as managed to the point the buildings are falling over because of the corruption in the construction industry here or that Venice avenue is so broken up due to contract corruption that stores going out of business you'd think they don't say this\nThey don't see if they do see it\nAnd they say to me with a few times I run into and talk to them is I Can't say anything because most of my customers are liberals and they wouldn't patronize they'd be quite surprised to find out how many people think just the way they do\nAnd no none of them want the illegals here\nNone of them want another army of illegal aliens in this country on screen on vetted\nSome of whom are very dangerous some of whom may be diseased and certainly the social service systems which are already overwhelmed cannot support these people in any way so don't tell me that all these good Democrats in good old San Francisco want more of them that would be a complete and total lie\nBut having said all of that it's now time for me to listen to you so I'm going to open up to one or two calls here on the Savage Nation\nRemember my solution I didn't say force to stop the hordes because ah I have a bit of the Confucius\nI've a bit of Confucius is gene pool let me which is why I eat a lot of Chinese food is the feed the Confucius within and the Confucius within said we can stop this invasion from Central America without firing a shot\nWithout even launching a troop I Want you to think I I Want you to think about this the loud sure alive he would have me as an advisor\nDonald Trump should absolutely understand he needs to reach out from behind his TV circle of advisors he needs to reach beyond that little world of people talking to each other every day with the same stories in the same mindset and the same pack phrases\nHe needs to reach out to the western regions of this great empire of his and he needs to speak to the leading intellectual on the west coast who is a supporter of his eye has always been and will\nLeading intellectual on the west coast who is a supporter of his eye has always been and will be and understand that I just said Trump can stop this invasion without lifting a finger in firing a shot always got to do is lift the phone I'll be right back\nJoined the Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred Savage eight ... for Hubbard seven to eight to salvage\nSavage Nation is

you know I'm always looking at the companies that will become the next ... apple who is the leader in terms of companies public or otherwise that you know is really a head of the game in terms of robotics were were you get the robotic soldier and things like that\nWell there are a number of of companies especially one morning here a lot it's typically in terms of robotic soldiers as Boston Dynamics which is actually owned by Google um so I mean I Would say that it in terms of the overall trend including both robotics and artificial intelligence\nThe biggest players right now are actually the biggest technology companies that companies like Google like Facebook Amazon a Microsoft either to companies that\nAre really driving the core technology that's really making all this possible and in many cases uh especially with Google they've actually gone out and bought a lot of start up companies that are specializing both in artificial intelligence and an actual robotics um\nWe even you know to drive that that frontier even faster so that that's where\nYou know this is all coming from that's where the the advances are coming from\nSteven in Waterbury, Connecticut Hi Steven thanks for calling go ahead\nYeah I have a question than two quick comments okay my my question is if the robot were to replace ... workers were with the money come from to buy things like products and stuff like that because the people at work and they're not going to have money to buy things\nRight I mean that's um that that's a very valid point and it's something that I talk about right by extensively in my book um you've got to have people out there to come by to stop being produced and if we really get into a situation where there aren't enough jobs or where\nUm wages are very low because there's so much competition for jobs that are out there then it's hard to see how a a market economy or how capitalism can continue to thrive so that's one of the arguments for figuring out a way to adapt today to make sure that\nPeople will continue to have access to an income even if all the job do eventually start to disappear\nBut education is that we can look at number one of my first comment after that would be the robotics would they have in uh the surgery and things like that the medical part I think that's fantastic what they're doing right now\nAh my second comment is if you look at movies like either west world or perhaps robocop you also see you know some down things that may happen with a chemical and computers and stuff like that because so far they have perfected um effective thing so it's going to be pretty to see what the future will bring yeah absolutely it's going to be a very\nInteresting next couple of decades I Would say\nThe time to be alive Martin I\nThis on ...\nGood time to be alive Martin I\nWatching this on ... what is fueling the robotics the artificial intelligence I Know what's man but how did you get better every year who's doing this\nWell it's been getting better every year for a long long time and we it's been doubling basically that's what's been happening with computer technology but\nThe thing that I think is really key now instead of that doubling process that acceleration has been going off with a really long time thinking in terms of\nGetting in your car and driving up five miles per hour and then gradually doubling your speech like ten twenty forty miles per hour it kinda starts out gradually but if you just double your speed a handful of times you know what you get beyond eight miles an hour\nYou you need to re tracking probably need a better car but if you could double your speed\nTwenty five or thirty time and that's how many times computing power has doubled I mean you'd be a science fiction space ... you'd be traveling it billions of miles an hour you know factor a thing we've\nActually ever built a and that's what's going on now that's where we are today in terms of of computer technology and that's the reason that we're starting to see all this stuff\nFinally be real you realized I think that's why now we finally have the robots that we've been talking about for decades and why we finally have the virtual reality that that people have been talking about for a long time you know it's because of this ongoing acceleration keep you know finally getting to the point where all this stuff is is beginning to be possible\nWell look at what the smartphone has done more to the world I mean\nUh I got a text today from a buddy of mine who just started using the smartphone I mean ... use a dinosaur and but he loves it he said this is like a mini computer in my hand and I'm going da Silva but it is really revolutionized so many things it's become a portable office\nUh I Know when I'm Out and I get emails from my staff or text messages or whatever I mean you cannot put a value on that in terms of saving time and the fish and sea it's amazing [noise] right\nI mean it's gotten to the point where you can't imagine I mean I spent most of my life\nWithout even you know a mobile phone let alone a smartphone but already it's hard to you know how how do we live without it um you know I mean you you can actually thought that how you survive without it\nAnd you know what we've seen with smart phones we keep in mind that the you know the iPhone was developed in two thousand seven right now it's\nOnly eight years and I hear not\nLong that that this is accelerated um and you can sort of see the progress in mobile phone about for the back or you may remember the movie Wall Street which came\nOut oh yeah love that movie yeah and ... member at and he's walking on the beach any voting that did get a phone and the huge thing you know it is Matt looks like one of those wars smelling like\nHe's holding a little refrigerator almost um that's how it started I had one way to think about all this is to say that when it comes to a robotic and virtual reality and these technologies that are just taking off their like that\nThat phone in that movie that Michael Douglas is yeah that's the stage they're at and you can sort of see where it's going by looking at you know today's smartphones I mean that's the kind of progress that we're likely to see 'em over the next Twenty years or so\nWhy is small in technology better\nWell I mean it it things just get smaller and more\nPrecise than you can pack more and more into the same side I mean that's part of Moore's law basically which has always been\nUm basically the way you can pack more and more yeah onto onto a chip pride and that's one of the things that's really driven a miniature is Asian but I mean it's really\nGotten to the point now where\nUm you know even if that eventually kinda Peters out and many people think it will because we're running up against them the physical limits in terms of uh the traditional approach to work law\nThat other approaches are going to Mars you know people will start cooking all these smaller kids together into massive networks and things like that in order to build entirely new architecture so uh this is something that's going to stop if she's going to keep getting more and more dramatic\nHave you seen that movie um ex ... is that the name of that movie\n[noise] right yeah yeah I've seen it um and you know there are lots and lots of science fiction movies that deal with many\nIssues I don't I don't know any of them really get it right a lot of them are still far in the future in terms of what they portray but\nWe're beginning to see and the real world some of these issues come up and this is this is you know how it's going to play out eventually over the next twenty thirty forty years were eventually going to the technologies like that I think\nI I think so too let's get one more call in before the break a Westland or again Hey Tom go ahead welcome to the show\n[laughter] church I Love your show thank you um

[noise]\nUm on top of that I don't think we're going to need police anymore\nBecause being a law enforcement people can just basically take over a car and drive it to the police station and then ... ... ... [noise]\nAnd ah for people who are ... are now mowing tens or it's possible to take over a car and kidnapped someone that's true or a\nYou know just run them off a cliff or something if they want it to get rid of somebody so I I could see this as being a very powerful tool of either at a very ah to hear him state or a ... you know\nWe'll we'll let me know headlines on the issue you raise is absolutely correct I mean I'm definitely security and\nAnd the potential for hacking or the potential for cyber attack from another country or something like that that there was a huge issues with self driving car more broadly for\nReally the whole trend we're seeing where everything is becoming more and more connected and it didn't name for that where everything is connected together is is what's called the Internet of things\nAnd basically it means that everything not not just cars appliances and maybe robots some day and all kinds of devices and everything will be hooked up together and and one of the main things that people worry about with that is is the security issue you know what if it gets hacked what if it\nComes under attack so they're definitely a lot of people that are working on that and and worrying about it so it it's an important issue\nWell we've just seen over the past several months hacking into cars on freeways people have that ability to do that now it's amazing\nThat's right yeah anytime you know cars or sexually controlled by computers uh you know the computers are ... that that's absolutely reality and and definitely one of our challenges going forward is to figure out\nA solution to that you know to to defend against that kind of thing\nIs is a good field to get into\nAbsolutely if you're skilled in computer security that's one of the absolute the hottest\nAreas right now I mean I think that would be a great career path for anyone who invested in that and has that particular talent and skill set\nDanny in Richmond, California hello Danny it's your turn on coast to coast go ahead\nHi George a grade you know they wanted to ask why I wanted to make a comment and then ask a question sure I think what we're ...

I'm very familiar with that tore blown the country now be ... used to be the jewel of the middle east it isn't anymore Fred isn't\n[noise] no I'm afraid not a George ah we've watched it deteriorate for several years now and of course a Hezbollah has become a very strong and country and a operates as an Iranian proxy\nAnd how long Samuel has this been going on with the Rand backing Hezbollah and who are the are these Lebanese people or the Iranians who are they\nWell Hezbollah the Lebanese party of God is a Shiite religious militia [noise]\nUm [noise] oh\nUnderground Iranian proxy groups that were formulating around the time of the Israeli invasion of living on in Nineteen eighty two\nUm ... you know of ... ... between the Sunni the Christian and Shiite population for domination of the

relative a statement uh before uh Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than [noise]\nCertainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than than any other group I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on the u._s. embassies and the hijackings and the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which\nUh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a kind of parts of history\nOr does it never been done this was an organization that had\nA literally a snatched or the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild\nA all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing uh so uh this was unprecedented its time\nAnd um it it was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred uh but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because uh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley\nUh we we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us\nExactly where he was so um [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are certainly a um I'll never forget and uh but I Know that there was a heck of a heck of a lot of us that that's certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\nWhen we get into that story I Want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty eight as Well Fred heard what what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to even worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise] Georgia and it's a fair question or you can only look back on the events of nine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers and\nThe plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon or as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region or why we need a footprint or in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy\nA and a a take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil\nAnd uh that's the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nAll right we're going to talk about William Buckley you're just a moment we're with Fred Burton Samuel Katz their book is called the babe Ruth rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them on what truly is\nA very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized in hopefully Fred than Samuel would you be rules you get more and more exposure to what's happening over there and if you can see I'm In a couple of minutes we have before the break\nGive us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nWell speaking of Hezbollah um the has the forces have been fighting from the onset along fry rainy and special forces to help keep from President of off of um regime in power um has ... has been transformed from an underground fourth\nI'm In the Nineteen eighties the period we're ... and I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of um the fundamentalists suicide Shiite brand of terrorism and it has emerged and to probably one of the stronger almost conventional armies in the middle east\nUm it is for the United states in Iraq it was um it was absolutely in a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq to\nFill up there um I eat these um strategies and tactics that killed so many American servicemen in two thousand ... launched\nA um horrific war against Israel where I'm laid siege hum we've indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities um it does involve the narco terrorism is one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm I'm traffickers in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with\nThat we cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has if we ... them operatives in this country\nHas for many years and it is an arm and extension of Iran is I'm a desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important to the U.S national interest\nAll countries of course work through straw parties we work with will Selma bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets on they're\nGiving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah but why are we getting talk with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions why don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stopped supplying them we're gonna win ... why don't we do that Sam\nI think that this country has been very apprehensive about engaging Iran militarily\nOr hostages were the is that the U.S embassy in Tehran I'm a many many years ago I think there were numerous um declarations of war by Iran has like in the United states the bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second to enter the the bombing of the marine barracks\nWhich was on the thirty five years ago to this they hold on\nHold on for a second and we'll come back to this point and we'll talk with you and Fred as well about your book be rude rules next on the coast to coast that you\nNever missed a detail of the show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free it goes to ... dot com\nNo I don't think so I think um we haven't gone after Iran militarily because we're not really sure what a direct military conflict with the wrong might bring I think the Iranian you of groups like Hezbollah to export terrorism throughout the middle east\nAnd the rest of the world is going through you know for um policy planners in this country for generations it\nWas um directly responsible for\nA lack of response to suicide truck bombing of the embassies the Marines and the kidnapping of a theory station chief from things that was unheard of in the world of espionage up until that point and ever since uh William Buckley was the only\nStation is she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered in the history of the agency\nFor Britain tell us about William Buckley\n[noise] ah there was a a a true patriot George ah he grew up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening to this is not the journalist we're talking about\nNo it's not there's actually a funny Side Story to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA I and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years I wrote to him and uh our bill thought it was pretty funny in a thought about a cashing them but I'm\nA bill grow up in the Boston area a seminar are lucky enough to uh get the cooperation of bills or family has a elderly companion or that he lived with for many many years and a sister\nWho just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up uh\nI'm In he went off after high school into the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea as a young kid\nAnd um where he was a silver star recipient and are also a Purple Heart um and which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into\nWhen it comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates or gets hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties it was very murky or as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find a anybody that can tell us specifically what he was up to\nA but regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things\nWhen you you know didn't surprise me because of uh the nature of it as a curiosity and his languages and you know ability to\nTo just I'm a study history and specially military history\nUh so uh in Nineteen sixty or he joins or the U.S army again a and goes under special forces a and I'm also a associated with the CIA and that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was in the Boston area who was the CIA spotter and recruiter and I'm Bill goes off or to Vietnam and\nWhere he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire\nSo this was a man George that was always running towards danger and uh he he reminds me of the NYPD or cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers up\nYou know you know show known for years they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um and and off the bill uh was uh uh the only guy to raise his hand to to volunteer to go to the root uh at the CIA or\nAfter this devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station has wiped out so uh that was who Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nNow was his assignments bread in Beirut clandestine war was pretty well known by people\nWell ah the station chief or um is usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the uh the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other intelligence liaison services know that too I have such as the Jordanians the French the Israel and so forth so a bill is not a and a undercover physician during that time period\nSomebody read it on him no doubt\nWell uh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period um\nIt you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meat snitches uh and so forth and so uh you know bill was that kind of person and I'm In essence are leaving his apartment one day a in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a\nMultiple vehicles are and Hezbollah grab them and uh they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't he have security around it\n[noise] it's a good question or I can tell you a first hand from that time period or it was an unusual for station chiefs and not to have security uh salmon I did our last book on bin ... uh where you had a whole Qadri a professional\nUh security personnel to specifically watch or CIA officers backs\nAre in that time period are they really didn't exist you could request security you could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but\nUh you can't really do your job is a is a secret agent to use that phrase it with an entourage so ah the nature of the job in that in that time period was ah you were a single time you were kind of like a a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for what about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\nOut on your own he was held captive for what about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\nHe was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and um I was part of the hostage de briefing team where are we were assigned to at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out to who was a wonderful man I spoke to him an instant and v spot in Germany after he had been held in captivity\nAnd and he told his bill had died and that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because um we had devoted to the entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so\nThen it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWell must have been like looking for a needle in the haystack rental\nOh my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was a time period um you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then\nUm we we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but um it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a a person in a building or in a cherry barracks\nI'm ... and we literally they could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was\nA at one point or the FBI believed that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran a and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut while I'm which I'm\nNot you certainly a smoking gun or\nAs to who was directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam ... let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time jak Anderson wrote an article about William Buckley simply saying\nHe was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but what do you think do jak Anderson's column accurate or not\nI I think if I'm fairly safe to assume that under torture I'm Bill Buckley um revealed information\nI'm a very classified nature I'm a station chief um he was the supervisor he was the um the branch manager of the ... the U.S intelligence apparatus in Lebanon\nSo he knew the names of the other age of he knew the name of their sources and he had all that information I'm In his in his mind because he has to control it on the basis you have to supervise it I'm One of the um [noise]\nYou know one of the things that we reveal in the book is shortly after bill was um confirmed that he was\nAbducted um personnel in the station um retreated out of the ... out of country I'm very very quickly because

and I had been doing sports talk and somebody said you need to move on from sports do straight talk\nAnd so it did and\nI learned some stuff from I didn't learn some stuff and I learned is that by nature a I was a libertarian and B\nI was a nationalist now my definition of being a nationalist was that we should build a ... foot wall around the country all the way around\nThe heck with the Canadians and the heck with the Mexicans\nBuild a wall fifty foot high all the way around the country and then put a plastic don't mind that if you can do it first stadium you can do it for the country\nMay get higher up the jet planes couldn't fly underneath the dome okay and then the finished my concept\nOh okay and then the finished my concept of being a true nationalist\nMy theory was plain and simple if we can't grow it if we can't manufacture it and if we can't invented then we don't need it question that's my concept of being a nationalist yes okay I get\nThat that is your concept and I remember when you went into your yes diatribe about that and I nine I almost got suspended for because we're so our outlandish yes um do you still feel that way\nProbably not as much as I did but never\n... when you're young you tend to be gung ho ho you know you\nAre less myopic as you get older you get more tunnel vision that's why when you're young young people open up your arms your brains\nAnd allow yourself to soak everything in because as you get older your field of vision narrows okay\nAnd if people wonder why horses jump up in the air and jump over jumps in steeplechase races and everything it's their myopic when a human being stands in front of a horse\nThe course thinks the human being is almost fifty feet tall these\nI haven't heard of that I don't know how they figured fifty feet yeah maybe they took a horse to a movie and that's how they relate and I don't know\nYeah and it has something to do with their eyes being on the side of their head\nThey're all they also work individually their eyes do not work as a tandem they work separately\nMaybe that has something to do may be but nonetheless so is it do you you don't feel strongly about that now no because\nI Know that it's stupid we can't build a ball all the way around the country and we can't put a lid on it but I still do believe that anything we need can be grown in America\nIncluding oil and pineapple and ... and everything else I Believe that we can manufacture everything here\nCars buses airplanes rocket ships and the little embroiled was that go into my ties okay we can make mall here okay and we've proven we can vent everything here\nWe were the first men on the moon we have tremendous advances in the medical profession okay so I still believe in the basic premise of that well yesterday out of the clear blue sky a Donald J Trump stopped reading the art of the deal\nAnd started reading the art of the rod oh dear because he came out and said that yes the president said yesterday he too is a nationalist\nWhen I say a nationalist I don't like it when Germany Spain one percent of GDP\nAnd we're paying for point three percent I don't like that that's not fair I don't like it wasn't as an example\nHero and we're paying for almost the entire cost of day that will pay for a very very substantial portion for later than what it should be a we have great respect\nFor those countries but on top of that I don't like it when they put up barriers to our farmers were farmers cannot sell in Europe they have trade barriers that make it you guys do it better than anybody say I'm trade barriers that or as severe\nAs China's trade barriers which we coming down they want to make a deal very badly they'll be coming down\nBut I Am very proud of our country and we cannot continue to allow what's happened to our country to continue that but we can't let it happen so I'm proud proud of our country and I am a national since the war that hasn't been used too much some people use it\nBut I'm very proud I think it should be brought back find somebody that wants to help other countries of the world but I also have to take\nTo take care of our country we cannot continue to allow ourselves to be duped or the military and also dumped on trade with the European Union as an example last year on trade when it was one hundred and fifty one billion dollars on top of that we lost\nHundreds of billions of dollars on protections [noise]\nOnce again or the [noise] I don't know exactly the president's sources on those numbers they're\nOh I'll talk about it after the\nYou would be basically unprotected sure against the perils of the war all ... okay and that's what happened the past five presidents have all taken that\nSuperpower mantra and made it important to the smaller countries so now when we go to discuss\nThe fair share well okay we'll be the superpower will be the world's policeman but you know what you're ...\nThe superpower will be the world's policeman but you know what you're gonna have to pay some of the freight\nFor us being your policeman we are going to be like an armed guard none of police officer we're going to be now an armed guard you need to pay us for that service or we can render it anymore and then they started using it as a trade tool\nWell it's not your oh it's easier for us to grow lettuce in Mexico than it is to grow lettuce in Minnesota\nSo we will so you are lettuce and we will mark up the prices for you I don't think anyone's against profit no but uh read at home rather you know first of all the state New Jersey has a very bold thing\nThe New Jersey's roadway the parkway mhm is owned by will now its own basically by prudential insurance\nUh okay they bought there was it was a stock and it was sold and they bought a majority so I guess technically they own it okay and there would be ... and there would be restaurants in those mediums\nThe most common were arby's yes borrows the Italian as a McDonald's on a couple of others that frequent did along that hundred and sixty five mile of roadway that goes from Cape May on wages Salem county the length of New Jersey mhm okay\nWell the state of New Jersey did something very bold and brain\nThey went to those fast food chains\nAnd said\nWe love settling you this base we love the fact that while you're on the New Jersey part way you can drive and get a Mickey D's you can drive in get we got the beach you drive and get a slap a pizza and be on your way but we're not going to allow you\nTo charge different rates then you sell that piece of pizza for at the eating town hall or the McDonald's on route thirty three and and parameters you're\nGonna have to have the same price set up that you have everywhere else in your ... and I think that's fair and you know how they reacted to it will close and they'll close up\nOf childish yet that's exactly and you know what I guess they don't want to make them learn something because many years ago Howard Johnson's\nWas in all of those low key I remember Howard ... from the Ohio Turnpike and with the orange roof twinge slavery of ice cream and everything else and\nThey tried to offset by charging you a dollar for a plate if you wanted to share your meal with the child do remote brat yeah they said wait a minute\nAnd they said this first New Jersey get outta here\nGet outta here we don't want that kind of business these are families that are taking a trip wire you abusing them\nAnd that was the end of that that's one McDonald's in our bees and borrows and Taco Bell and every other chain imaginable and they said you're going to charge the same price on the parkway as you do in all your other restaurants\nI just and so rather than later there is so unfair about well they\nClaimed that they were being overcharged for the space and that they had to stay open they were obligated to stay open twenty four hours a day to services travelers\nAre and some that are that then and and see that's that's what makes that he had ... exactly what we and then when they in earnest effort to actually be fair and something we don't deal that way anymore and so they just ... and go home\nAt New York and Connecticut tried to do it\nNo right to do the same thing was that they sell the same price and they were successful than Connecticut did something real students that they

I don't know yet but based on and tell that I've read\nBased on the other ... that I've read it's my thinking that MBBS was involved in this that he directed this and that this person was per purposely murder but well I have a chance to say that uh hopefully very soon and my sense is jak even over the next week is kind of become much clear\nBy who we chat cross so Mr Corker Jake Tapper [laughter] you know cause I think a lot of people called Jake jak just 'cause it would be a lazy thing to do you know mhm\nYeah I'm here yeah yeah I could see that I think would be a real good idea if this president had handlers like other presidents had in the past\n... a confidant that they would go to and say how do you think I should have handled this it would be great if the president would put out a statement that said\nTo the world to the world all\nUs members of the press are off limits\nTo any kind of retribution any kind of delays any kind of interference to do their job while they are in your\nCountry period okay it would be great he would stand up on a mountain and look like a good guy because you know I see these foreign correspondents that are in North Korea or in a communist\nCountry in the Ukraine or in Syria and they're risking their life every day and just by being in the areas but you know somewhere in the back of your mind\nThere's that thought that when you\nGo to the border oh yeah and I said you you can't go home\nI Would be terrified right now the junior reporter in North Korea I and I know they stay over on the south Korean side right that there is like\nKilling five four or five there aren't many but from what I understand they travel across that a militarized zone\nDo their reports or gather information they buy into all of you imagine trying to come back over into South Korea I get nervous when I crossed the border in Mexico\nYeah even stopped a lot coming I mean over the years I even before you needed a passport to do that even before all of this border stuff had had happened in the eighties\nI Would get stopped more often than not and have to you know they'd hold me up and then look at my driver's license and whenever you questions and go through my stuff\nUm and because I was always tan in Arizona and I have dark hair and I I don't want to say I'm labeling anyone but I you\nLook like you couldn't be further certainly around the country yeah ... you know I I every time that you go through security in an airport I'm sure sometimes and cross through people's minds\nAre they going to question something about your citizenship or something like that I it's just got to be in the back of your mind and these people yeah\nHeartbreak these people that work the front lines work the wars and work the the devastation of an earthquake or flood\nOr an earthquake or a volcano or something like that are under enough stress as it is oh they had that political stress because really what do you think about and we talked about Mr ... the other day\nWell these people have less protection than a Mr song ...\nYeah and he's a well and not just that but the minute he steps out of that embassy write to us is going to try to extradite him\nThink he ... he that's why he stays in countries that don't have extradition trees when the United states but won't once again to be under that added stress to know that you've got a job to do and yet you know\nKim jung rude and had his brother kills had his uncle killed you know has a wife that's been missing seen one and two years and will be scary to me were rod and re and this is Dave brings us\nCurrent attorney general Jeff Sessions has done his level best to overturn that cold ...\nBut the thing that still stand is what is called a little ... that spin spin memo and that came down from the department of treasury\nIn twenty fourteen February of twenty fourteen and they issued another name out kind of similar to the ... that at least reported that clarify the bank secrecy ac expectations\nFor banks or financial institutions that wanted to provide services to marijuana related businesses and no one is that since then ... then that was issued and because of that there are some\nBrave bankers out there and some brave privately owned credit unions that are starting to bank handed his client and and what kind of Mars thing\nOkay I'm One of them were backwards on this for just a second now the fact that some banks are federally licensed and some are state licensed is a bank that is they licensed able to make a transaction within the state where marijuana is legal\nWell even banks that are state license have FDIC insured fine meant less your credit union and interesting late so they are regulated um\n[noise] I have a new friend I've met through this industry who is president and CEO of a privately held credit union in Denver\nAnd gee has implemented for that product credit union at banking system for people and the candidates industry and it's called the safe harbor program\nAnd her is a is it really is you know she was a banker for over Thirty years her name is Sandy the bride and a Sunday was about to retire and the credit union approached her about taking on this project\nAnd um she meets regularly with regulators uh to keep them apprised of what's going on and she complies with the\nSeven due diligence activities that they spin and memo sets out for banks and it's a perfect example in the banking ram a kind of the hypocrisy and the looking the other way that can occur even with\nThe federal government because it's illegal there and yet they had this been send memo and if you're a able to comply with these requirements in that memo and you\nAre transparent that the buzz word these days isn't it if you have a lot of trans Darren ... and you meet regularly with the regulators then\nChances are very good that you're going to be okay if you are a banker or private credit union which is what they have in Denver and um so I think we're going to see more of this\nBut quite honestly I also believe that we're not going to the especially the larger banks and credit card networks like visa and MasterCard and discover andme American Express they're not going to get on board and tell Congress takes action\nTo do something and remove marijuana as a schedule for the schedule one class of ... and that it currently has\nUm were you when you mentioned about them meeting with the regulators\nNow are these regulators I'm assuming they're sad little girls but okay so they're not state yeah your leaders would definitely be federal regulators so within and could you give us just some high which I'm not familiar with the thin memo\nOh okay well it's really an interesting document and it came through the um the department of the treasury the financial crimes enforcement network and\nThat's abbreviated pin thin so the memo that they hadn't time to be known as the pin Thin Man though and um\nIt didn't really have a formal title but the subject line said that it was about the essay which is banking secrecy act expectations regarding marijuana related businesses and um\nIt was very interesting and it and it didn't receive I don't believe nearly the publicity that that coal\nMemo did opposite mired in marketing we come back from just talking about we're going to have you with our guest surly

Steve ... nearly lost his life\nUm and it was a Bernie Sanders supporters it turned out to be I went out of my way to say I don't blame Bernie Sanders because one not that support him you know decided to become violence\nIs outrageous what they do they do this every time they've been their silence has been deafening in recent months and days\nUh anyways Sean Spicer ... is with us senior advisors spokesmen for American first action and also former White House press secretary and the author of the book the briefing politics the press the president Kris Kobach is back with us\nUh he has penned a piece on them migraine caravan he is the\nElected secretary of state of Kansas and expert\nAnd immigration and uh by the way has been very successful and what he's doing and uh and uh I fully support your your victory there in Kansas who was a big win that you pulled out in the primary and I hope the people of\nKansas are smart enough to put you in that position I Know you be a great governor um look I I don't know if we're going to get to this point this caravans growing Mexico seems incapacitated unwilling to do the job of securing their own borders which they usually do a pretty good job of they either put people in jail or throw them out immediately\nUm but if they in four weeks or whatever and make it to our southern border\nUm and if anybody is to cross that border or if they rush and across that border as in as one\nWe don't have any pro choice we will have to arrest them that will be a crisis precipitated by people not respecting our laws I don't want anybody to get hurt if we had a wall up right now Kris Kobach we wouldn't have a problem\nWe wouldn't have a problem and also if we had more states denying welfare benefits to illegal aliens or we give a hundred and thirty four billion dollars a year most of those are state public benefits to illegal aliens you know meanwhile you got governors\nAh like a Governor Brown out in California giving more fun if if a federal and state response or the focus to build the wall and they have to stop panning out the goodies which gives the illegal aliens assurance that if they can get in that it can come in and start getting welfare benefits so while they're looking for a job\nSean Spicer a U.S quite a lot of incendiary rhetoric thrown in your direction we'll get to that in a minute but let's talk about what the options are here I Would think that is the role of the Mexican government\nThat they should be turning these this caravan back they seem unwilling aren't capable of doing so ah what should America's response be\nWell I think Americans responses exactly what the president has talked about which is making sure that we protect our borders our sovereignty and our citizens and that means ensuring that we know who's coming into our country\nWhy they're coming in a and that they not coming in with either nefarious reasons or to either harm us or that they you know but there's a friday the bottom line is the number one job of any president of any elected elected official is to protect his people in the president's made very clear and the one thing I said the the other day to sell in China I Want to be clear your great with me I Know\nChris will agree as well don't temp Donald Trump\nFelt temp temp because he's warned them African government he's warned Guatemala he's told them that this is unacceptable they need to do their job stop that from happening um and I I guess I I think that if anything people have seen over the last year\nWhen he gives you a warning he means that there will be action afterwards if you don't reverse course let me be very clear I I'm just\nGoing to assume I and I really believe that probably Ninety nine percent of the people in this caravan of good people\nPeople that don't have a lot of opportunity and their own communities countries they want a better life for themselves and their families I Believe a lot of the aid we give to many many countries is abused and it doesn't get to the people as it should\nUm with that said we have a legal process of doing so but on the other hand let's say it's only a small fraction of the many that are coming\nThat have the various intentions for this country we don't know there's not one person that can vouch for anybody in that care of him nobody can vouch for anybody\nAnd it would be unfair and a massive risk to the American people to allow people in on vetted no idea what their their point of view of world view happens to be whether or not they have good or bad intentions for the United states and I say that Kris Kobach assuming Ninety nine percent of of the people coming just want a better life\nAnd that's ... that's a very good point you know it'd be there's abundant evidence uh terrorists using\nThe traffic flow of illegal immigration across our southern border could get him to the United states\nGoing all the way back to before nine eleven ah people from countries where al ... was active now countries where I suspect active have used this this flow this Margaret close to blend in there's no question that that will be the case again\nThe only thing Sean that I I wanted to point out is I think the Democrats have lost their grip on reality here there and the third stage of open borders psychosis just to follow the for a moment in the nineties [noise]\nThe Democrats
