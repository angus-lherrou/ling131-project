ago\nAnd and everyone was there see at at a shark him as their Hilton was there at Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with the hospitality industry\nAnd I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now and and uh you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room there was about twelve people in the room and sitting around a round table\nAnd and they ... their answer was you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how to market on social media and and the American express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation y\nExpressed said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation why a ... you know how they think how they buy and Hilton says it's it's about new products it's about making room small and your lobbies bigger you know what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it's all about demographics isn't it yeah is\nIt because if your market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market but you know it it for about Twenty years they could make their product fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand and all of a sudden sales started trailing off this was Nineteen\nNinety eight and I and I said a\n... so your your sales are ... are are going flat and he said yeah what do we have a demographic issues as the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis and and I said a Hoosier customer and he's got an Eighteen to thirty four year old man or woman Eighteen to thirty four actually what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he said what we can they don't fit in the product anymore\nI say you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes I said the last baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said it was a pause and he said Nineteen\nNinety eight and I said we're in it and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he said what does that mean that what that means is you know you're you're laughing gas just checked out of your hotel\nAnd their their sales went from eight billion get this George eight billion to two and about three years while why because they're not paying attention to demographic you know if you want to count money ... money go ahead knock yourself out\nBut if you want to understand where money came from it came from people help people and you will understand\nWell isn't it simple to Ken to talk to that demographic you need to go after eventually and find out some of the things they enjoy\nAnd look at those trends you find out that you know if their kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people I'll find out from them what did they do what do they like where do they go do they go to movies do they not and then the judge yourself to that\n[laughter] drugs you're too smart [laughter] but but you did that doesn't that sound like like logic yeah common sense it's not so common volunteer said that\nYou know I I Do um I'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down and I said that's the boomers everybody you see that the boomers all sat there and I'll say okay if you are born before Nineteen eighty five sit down\nAnd ... and another large group six out of ... and I say that's Jenn ... about three people standing and I said this that's why the Gen Y or the millennials ... or ... or eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them\nI said you want to know about the new market you you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here\nAnd it makes me crazy\nWell it's it's ... you got to adjust because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed yeah what's happening is that what's happening like companies like McDonald's are they on top of things they used to be marketing genius says something slipping\nI Know you don't you don't want to tell people I'm sure McDonald's same store sales are off you know they're they're all their increases are coming from um their\nOverseas operation I I I tell folks I said listen it generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children\nI said and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years is it I think you ought to three ends up of a food it's called nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is mc Donald's famous for its not nutrition [laughter] no it's\nIt's for French fries\nGarden listen what they tried to say heart\nPeople have the impression that it's not nutritional food\nIt's exactly correct and and so that's that's their problem they they are if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food\nOr in in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell good food you can't tell you you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts\nWhat's going on with population trends are are they shifting down to\n[noise] yeah well you know it's funny you say that\nUh in Nineteen ...\nWe we have a new generation is called Generation Z and Generation Z started in two thousand five and they will they will be a but they will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully born yet [noise]\nBut in Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven we had a record year in the United states we we we have four million a three hundred and sixteen thousand babies were born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier [noise]\nAh what's happened since two thousand seven is is the the population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies a year\nAnd and so this Generation Z will be smaller yeah\nThat's a big trend Ken stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls with you next hour here on coast to coast they get\nDaily Show up these right to your inbox for free with the coast noon newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com [noise]\nYeah absolutely if that does and it it it's mysterious to me why\nDoesn't think about this because it precipitating ... almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\nWell it has to a large degree um\nThe\nYou know and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that [noise] say people are still people when when you have a a large number of people that are consumer or a specific product at a small number of people that consume a specific product the\nLarge number of people would consume more now I Know that sounds ... but the ... the smartphone has a only aged folks in their ability to consume so uh it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint\nBut you have to keep in mind that the thing that drives commerce of the thing that drives you know consumption is the number of people in the market period\nNow that's the that's simple isn't it\nWell it almost sounds ridiculous doesn't it ... I mean who is out there saying well okay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and ... people consume\nSmaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause the the uh let me give you an example of it you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers\nAre Twenty years ago in in vast quantities and then the the um [noise]\nUm the automobile companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of SUVs to a generation X as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing department said it kept on firing their\nTheir chief marketing officers because they couldn't come up with the secret is selling as many SUVs to this other group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation at five and make it easy for small\nGood point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to me a couple of days ago and she said pop on you know kids are age you know she calls herself or Cuba but she's a young woman now ah we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and you know it it's funny 'cause I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today or the babies that are born in it and that's all about you know demographics\nAre born uh outside of wedlock they're they're born outside of a of a marriage um the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture a where Seventy five percent of the kids are born outside of the the uh\nUh marriage ... it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that you know whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you effect change\n[noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing\nI think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do it right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do\nJust like the uh uh you know you go back ... forty years and ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies but the hippie culture they did what they did\nThey just simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the to a sex drugs and rock and roll what happened to the ... the the boomer hippies live became Republicans\nIn all cases [laughter] no not at all cases but you know if if you if you look at [noise]\n[noise] [noise] that this this is ... let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise] [noise] ah [noise]\nBetween the ages right now of thirty four and fifty three we have a diminutive puppy a population of of indigenous people that were born here\nWere there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five in eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million born between forty five or sixty four what does that mean that means that that that particular population could not\nA ... support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum that particular\nGeneration right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population\nAre superimposed over where the heavy lift or should be ... were there with you know our our strength should be in our population\nIt's actually smaller so the net result is a you know ... instead of having a you know ... ... and they should have had and have nots with with the cushion in between\nOf generation X we don't because they were never born we're losing that cushion\nYeah well what we did and as you so you you have people saying that the the United States is is broken because we have have the have nots but middle age and and I'm In\nA middle income uh our occupy exactly the same space so if you're middle ages small and then your middle income as small as well\nBut it's a demographic issue is just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this too I mean let let's use Facebook\nThat particular period can't let me ask you this too I mean let let's use Facebook as an example you know they they've got the billions of people on line\nOr they've got huge amounts of advertising dollars because of what they do socially but I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to there's becoming a change there were I think advertisers you begin to say I'm not sure we're getting the bank for a dollar a year or you're converting these into sales\nBecause the market may not be what we really want to what's happening with that [noise]\nA Facebook is kind of strange [noise] entity if you will and I tell folks listen if you're if you're not paying for it you are not the customer you're the product\nUm as far as I'm concerned and I and I've got a Twenty one years experience in the marketing industry the Internet are um advertising is a bottomless pit\nYou have no idea what your pie none and there's no way to a reference any kind of success except return on investment so you you spend money on the Internet and and you just cross your fingers and hope that your sales go up your sales go up you you don't know if it's if it's\nA relative to how much money you spend on the Internet but uh what what's happening with a a ... a enterprise there is is not good it really isn't\nI mean it's huge but there's a trend here and to me the trend is very negative so that it\nIs it well in ... with negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally disingenuous\nI I don't trust\n'em a Facebook at all I I really don't I don't think I I think you have to understand George that everything that anybody writes on on Facebook can be analyzed and then the the\nEnd and that analysis puts people into categories and those categories uh our sellable and and what the secretary does with that information is sell it to anybody who pay for it so there there's there's there's no security and anything that you put on Facebook nothing\nAnd well what about you know some of these wacky jobs you know the idiot that killed eleven people in the Jewish synagogue the guy who sends out these bombs these pipe bombs they use social media to kind of spelled their hatred um how can we can't catch them a little sooner\nYou tell me I I really don't know that Robert Bowers and in a a Caesar salad and they are they are truly whack jobs and um I don't know that that's that's more um a\nMore understanding of of of a of a psychic graphics that demographics as far as I'm concerned\nKen what's happening in the housing market most younger people aren't buying houses they're renting what's gonna happen\nWhile they're renting because they're [laughter] a trillion dollars of student\nLoan debt yeah\nYeah but don't worry about it now what we're what we're literally facing with a a kids is is you have eighty seven million kids that are between fourteen and thirty three years old the kids are finally moving out of their parents' basements they're throwing loyal as trophies they don't deserve\nAnd and that they're starting households

talking about the letter of the law the intent of the law and here's a case also for the president is going to [noise] not [noise]\nDisobeying the constitution of the constitution expressly says in it that we are not\nAllowed to use troops to defend the borders of the country from people coming across the border okay that's in there but\nIt says in there that there can be exceptions during a time of war\nSo the president has come out and said that he is going to send five thousand troops to Mexico mhm okay and he is using that part of it that we are technically from his standpoint\nIn a war against Mexico for this purpose so that even though he doesn't have to change the constitution\nHe can still bend the rules to make them fit what he wants to do former ice acting director Thomas Homan says we're very lucky to have this man is president right now\nFor things and they're going to handle a justice for the more which all they're going they're going to monitor central traffic intelligence they won't be moving food water supplies for the ... that does is that releases the fourth largest we're currently doing those types of jobs\nTo be on the front line of law enforcement officers defending our nation so I think it's a good move also thinking to see a lot more deal DSS deployed I Would I Would think the president was stand up to five thousand troops down there and uh\nAnd we'll see what happens with the board with having the military on the border is a great idea this this invasion of our sovereignty is a it's we got to stop it because if we get to the point within the last time and and they actually get United States and it makes her father who claims asylum and get released so we're back to catch release\nTheir fish group is is it is putting that same position catcher leash than this is going to be an ongoing situation constantly because other folks will start to Merkel and go and say hey get United States we're not really trained very long\nBanned many more short from court and most of them eighty percent of them will lose your case\nHe will have been ordered by the immigration sweet 'cause you lost your case they won't leave so why would they stopped coming up there is no consequence of interest of this illegal act\nThere you go if they are I just don't know why we cannot enforce the rules we have why does this have to be so difficult\nOnce again we don't have enough border patrol agents to do it second of all it's a three thousand miles piece of land mhm that border okay and once again I Will say this\nWhen the constitution was written we were in a land acquisition mode yes we were okay we wanted to\nTake California and take it from the Spaniards\nAnd making California ... so we wanted acquire that we wanted to the choir Arizona New Mexico and many other states\nFrom the Indians\nAnd make that part of the United states well that's okay we want to take the state of Louisiana ... French\nAnd make it a United States\nThe Porter of New Orleans one of the most it probably one of the ... probably the most uh second most important port on the United states okay at the time\nThe United states every one well world leaders kind of thought or assumed that New Orleans was owned by the French\nWhen in reality the Spaniards on it but the Spaniards never paid the French for ... for the Louisiana ... right so that's how we bought the Americans when amateurs and approaches well no no that was prior to that\nUh the French in fact received the money for New Orleans so that way and then after that Thomas Jefferson worked the Louisiana Territory purchase\nBut my point is we were in the land acquisition building mold we were also in the land taking that went down they would get overly Harris who want to know that I Will join us I understand that my point is the reason that this wasn't in the constitution\nWas because at that time we were trying to acquire land and to this point we have no desire to take over the country of Mexico\nWe don't want their land anymore than we wanted to take a takeover Mario ... ocean right when I even gotten there yet so so that's why this was an included in the constitution well now we have a serious\nProblem here okay we have a flooding of the borders and they put it in there that literally men who are in the military the armed services\nCan't do the defense of that border I think this is something\nThat should be changed constitutionally to that because because I think we have two hundred thousand men in the military in the middle east\nWhen they come home they don't have jobs well why don't we hire them and to tell you the truth the best wall that we could have on our border with Mexico is for two hundred thousand\nTroops soldiers hell link arms and say this is our border you can't go by and guess what we have the laws to enforce that\nI find it fascinating that that is part of the constitution that is our own troops or a or our own troops could not defend our border land that was fine that's so amazing\nYou have another group of people that were delegated to do that everything was delegated members some group to do but once again we were in land acquisition mode\nAnd we're not in that anymore right and so the time should change this is probably another part of the constitution\nThat should be amended and many people wouldn't have a problem\nYeah but you also had the excuse you could say well I did I messed up the gate\nGosh I don't think that worked very well oh I\nI'm not going to read it I I read the first three words of my horoscope and I've done\nIs it oh is that good huh\nIs the first three words are your secretly flabbergasted well I don't want to be flabbergasted I don't know what it is [laughter] that could be a bad thing is flabbergasted I've used the word all my life I don't get me wrong but I owe to\nUh taken aback shocked a flabbergasted shocked Oh yes that that would be it OK gone smack you [laughter]\nOkay according to the new world dictionary mhm it's surprise greatly well there you go okay a balance I guess that could be shock yeah\nMhm but that can be good or can be not so good\nSo I'll pass I'm going to pass some being flabbergasted to me it almost sounds like a electrocution [laughter] I Know they're not synonymous in any way shape or form here but nevertheless mhm ... last night in a whole\n... battle the Buffalo Bills maybe the worst team in football loss to maybe one of the better teams in football the New England patriots but I got to tell you what it did not\nIt really looked to me watching the game and the games have been a lot better this year than last year in the NFL but it really looked last night like the New England patriots were just going through the motions\nThey knew they were going to win and so they just played the least of their capabilities to win and I think ... statement because that's how you get beat because me or not race cars you don't flip the switch and the engine starts\nThey are not have machines they're human beings you have to be trained to be a winner\nOkay and this did not look like a team that was training to be a winner they just looked like another team that's why I think they will be beaten soundly in the playoffs lanes in Kansas City chiefs or the Houston Texans\nAnd then when they get to the Superbowl hopefully the rams will take care of I Can't say I'm rooting for the rams I hate to say that\nWell it ... that uh the New England patriots I guess attitude or way of playing kinda hearkens back to how you play the game and if you don't play well or rest on your laurels then you've got a good chance of getting beat it it's\nHard to play at your most especially they keep changing

happened with some of those nutrients mixed with the red tide and exacerbated the we we got it bad southwest Florida got really really bad\nAt all I'm committed to making sure that we're batting that\nStopping to discharge is that in order to do that you gotta work constructively what the Trump Administration because a lot of that state federal partnerships I'll be able to do that you'll I'm wants to impeach track so I don't know how the hell is going to be able to work with him on any of that I think any of those problems we had an older guy but I understand\nIt's gotten a lot better sense of it so I guess it in the early part of the spring and summer this year a lot of it's gone away right\nIt's just I mean quite frankly Michael wash them a bit um\nYou know out and so it's not as bad as it was for sure but it really yeah there was a too much stretch there in South Florida where people were just getting hammered it was in that sense that we're fish kill it hurt our economy and

California is a\nIs the hot spot right now and it's it's because uh you know two people that are looking to be speaker\nOr in the next session or from California and uh so they're looking at these

nine four one Sean our number you want to be a part of the program All right Andrew is in Albany New York WG why Andrew Hi how are you and by the way Albany is like a sewer onto its own in terms of\nEvery single high powered Albany politician or every friend or there's ends up getting indicted I've never seen anything like it in my life\nSo corrupt Shawn he tried so corrupt\n[laughter] these calls and I'm looking at the times website there live calling I don't think that it ... I think that it's cute based on who's you know answering the phone don't want it all ... Pennsylvania won a record sheet or right now don't aren't trained in a district first or something on there\nWas no one answer is no one else has all skewed towards down close to Philadelphia I put it past the point that writes\nI I'm not sure exactly what you say explain that again you think the holes are inaccurate I agree okay\nAnd I think it's just based on results are 'cause a lot of the district for the first is a most Republican voters in the northern stuck or such right on the border with New York right right I Want to answer the phone up there it's almost ... towards the bottom towards Philadelphia\nOh that's a big mistake I think on the Pennsylvania Republican parties part um we had a congressman on earlier this week from Lehigh Valley and you know look at every ... here's the bottom line it doesn't matter where you live\nWe are putting some importance on some of these New York races Minnesota races California races\nBut the bottom line is all four hundred and thirty five members of Congress are up for reelection well we need a majority but it doesn't have to be a big majority but if you can win the majority and pick up the Senate seats I think we can pick up hold the Senate seats that need to be held\nThen it could be a very good night one week from now\nBut I Am telling everybody if in my opinion right now Republicans plus three for the Senate they add three senators but I also would say that in the house I'd say it's probably on paper looking a poll paper\nAnd I'm hesitant to say this but just analyzing the races analyzing all of the new candidates you know forty five retirements in this time\nUm I Would say it's ... it's it's probably plus five maybe ten Democrat with a toss up because right now the Democrats have two hundred and five locked in\nRaces for the house the Republicans two hundred and now the problem is the toss ups are almost all Republican so you're going to have to run the table on those\nWe put all that information the most important in the top thirty that we picked then identified it's easily you know\nYou can find it easily at ... dot com\nYeah so I don't know I'm looking I made like a toss up right now I'm like I'm a toss up that I I have it with a toss up on three look easy one Ninety two but a lot of ... seats Shawn\nLook let me give you one anecdotal piece of evidence we know one twenty sixteen that the exit polls show and all the polls leading up to the election showed Donald Trump wasn't going to win\nAnd the exit polls came out of five Fifteen and it said he lost everything Florida gun North Carolina gone Ohio Pennsylvania and Michigan or Wisconsin gone and the same thing happened ... two thousand and four five Fifteen the media was ready to declare John Kerry the next president thank God\nThe two thousand and four five Fifteen the media was ready to declare John Kerry the next president thank God that didn't happen or in a midterm if we go back member twenty four team it was for cast as a close Senate race but the GOP one nine Senate seats\nI mean they were wrong so I'm I say this with caution caution you know probably the best thing people can do is realize\nThat if you don't want an see below sea speaker if you don't want Chuck Schumer to be the Senate majority leader then just go vote and do all you can do and your power at the end of the day will deal with whatever mess if we get one that was going to have to deal with\nYou know there are three outcomes on Tuesday night one week from today one of those Republicans gained seats in the Senate hold the house that's the best case scenario one is a split decision they gain seats in the Senate they lose the house Nancy Pelosi speaker\nThe worst case scenario it's Speaker Pelosi Senate majority leader Schumer so you know we have the power to make that not happen\nRight now the ... they it all matters whether or not you're going to motivate your friends\nWhether you're going to get to the polls whether you like the progress do you think you're better off than you or two years ago all the important issues we talk about you know what it matters or we're going to have two years of endless investigation possible impeachment\nWe're going to have the rescinding of our tax cuts by the Democrats or we're gonna have open borders sanctuary cities eliminate ice a and keep Obamacare every everybody as I mentioned earlier is running against running on health care on the Democratic side I'm like\nYou're the same people that ruin the health care system with three big wise keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less [noise]\nSo my advice is you know let's go out there and everybody fight hard if everybody does their part if everybody listening to my voice goes out and vote and if you understand the vote for any House Democrats to vote for polo see any Democratic Senate voters a boat for sure\nThat we should have a pretty good night a week from now\nBut the best part is that we live in a country where you get to decide that where every American now has the power to decide\nAnyway um I Hope that's helpful eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number you want to

turn over every penny because their political futures will be dependent on it which would be a good thing Gavin Newsom wants universal free care for everyone gets X number of dollars good luck with that but in states red states would smart governors or it can be a lot different than a lot better you know we we often go to the case of health care savings accounts\nAnd that would be your only count you manage every year and set of eyes yearly checkup and your younger years you're building up money it's your money\nBut when you get older if you really get sick\nThat money that account is built up a fortune and you couple that with catastrophic care fairly inexpensive\nDepending on what your doctor bowl is you know you could pay as low as a hundred bucks a year and get a great catastrophic plan if you have a heart attack a cancer\nOr have a bad accident but anyway the health care cooperatives of Dr Josh ... has been a pet project on this program of ours now for years and he joined us atlas MD Wichita, Kansas he joined us with Dr Lee as gross and he's the president for doctors for patient care foundation a thank you both for being with us\nDr Robert just to remind people I I Lived in Wichita I could walk into your office pay you fifty bucks a month\nI get unlimited care twenty four seven I get a Ninety five percent reduction in all of my prescription medicine costs and my kids get\nUnlimited care for ten bucks a month is that true\nThat's very uh every American could have considers level direct care just like you and how important people like Sean Hannity um yeah I don't think people under stand just how important this election is um we see how divisive DC as we see how much infighting they raised ... and we don't want those people managing our health care\nEvery American deserves Affordable Care and the direct care model cars\nMedford opinion pill labs for two or three dollars and then that is no co pays grief procedures we can fix is we can um work with employers and redesign insurance plans to decrease saving yea or previews by thirty to sixty percent we can do that but we need Republicans in our fair\nAllowing the free market to function because if we go back\nTowards a an Affordable Care act dial a Medicare for all\nIt would decrease our ability to really you know in a day in a way that is meaningful for patient\nAnd more importantly shot you know we're looking at a vision right now we have two completely different visions on healthcare future one is a completely government controlled socialized medicine or you're going to inserts that government between patients and their doctors or you think of the capital here you know that's how the ... at the same government that's going to get for your health care or\nYou have a another position that his health care freedom and these are the freedom of choice between you and your physician\nAre worth your decisions are not being made by the ...\nBy by the government and so in a while direct primary care is is not a partisan solution it is a solution that has been graced by most Republicans that are running quitting a defense who's running for governor in the state of Florida he's embraced is Newt Gingrich has put this in his you know the\n... primary care and his platform or so this is definitely a platform that Republicans are supporting so if you want freedom this is definitely the vision for him\nI mean the thing is it's almost mind numbing to me and you know what you're right Dr Josh I have friends of mine that are doctors and because it's not because I pay them to be honest but I could pay them I mean I I Do pay them in other ways and thanked them when they do favors for me but\nUm I I Will tell you that I can make a call at three o'clock in the morning any day and get a doctor's care\nAnd get a doctor's recommendation and then and you know what if every American white a white only a few Americans deserve that or they ended up going to the stock in the box places and I'm not downplaying I'm like I'm sure they play a vital role in certain towns and communities\nBut I don't think it's ideal because I think most people pick a doctor because they like and trust that individual and know that that person knows who they are and knows their medical background that's important to you\nAnd everybody should be able to choose that and I think that goes back to what Dr gross is saying about this is a referendum on freedom\nAnd we want freedom in our schools in our homes and all this kind of important decisions we make but then we we've been missing that level of freedom when it comes to the most important decisions in health care so this really is a crucial step in history\nWhere we can say look the free market can do this better than the government's been doing it people aren't happy with health care system now and met our ten dollars a pill we we want freedom and health care we want choice the direct care model allows you know every man woman and child preexisting conditions or not\nTo get incredibly high quality care in an affordable way\nI'm Sean ... are you know it shouldn't be of course I ... you know in our practice we have not raised our prices and eight years we've heard sixty dollars a month for eight years foreign limited primary care services\nAre X rays are twenty five dollars or MRI's or two hundred and twenty dollars these are all affordable so a pre existing no pre existing condition the question is can you actually for it to get the care unique by the doctor you can eat when you need a and he's direct care solutions getting the government out of the middle of this relationship\nCan actually do that so you need to embrace of the people that are running for office that support freedom in health care\nYou know it seems that you know it's so simple and so basic and so fundamental and this is where I got frustrated with Republicans 'cause they had promised repeal replace and they weren't ready for the moment there's no doubt about it now to the president's credit\nHe got rid of the individual mandate but that's only a first step and if every Democrat is going to go out there and say well we're gonna have we're gonna have better health care options for the American people but in many cases that the very same people that gave us the failure of Obamacare\nWhen you're offering a health care cooperative model you've duplicated down how many practices across the country Dr amber\nWe've helped over five hundred and fifty practices get lost because over a thousand growing every day I'm you know we had a twenty ... started last month alone and that's a new practice every business\nThe ... and then you have any direct access every individual twenty four seven direct access to a doctor there are no pre existing condition\nEvery individual twenty four seven direct access to a doctor there are no pre existing condition prejudice at all and these practices exactly if you can afford a cell phone you can afford direct patient care primary care\nThere is no insurance except you probably would want a couple the direct care with like a catastrophic plan which fairly inexpensive\nHere you have car insurance for the big stuff but I think you know point that goes unmentioned is the fact that these insurance premiums are going up twenty thirty percent of review and ... and I never raised her prices is is killing the economy it's killing jobs it's\nTaking good I'm not trying to be noisy but are you making at fifty bucks a patient I'm I I I make a month are you making any money\nBut we're going to get married and has been acquired yeah yeah\nI mean this has not been acquired by the big boxes you know we're able to keep the practices afloat or able to drive interest in primary care were able to treat people in the rural communities these practices are in inner city there are critical access hospital are critical access communities in suburban and urban setting a and it's worked out\nVery quickly saint poor people in America people we defined as poor or lower income they can pay fifty bucks a month and they can get a hold are you twenty four seven and if they need to Z pack they're going to walk out with a Z pack and pay above the Z pack\nWherever you know ... ... yeah they should be able to get I think about it the poor and ... the more you need a mark like this it might treated a study on Oregon's Medicaid system in only twenty cents on the dollar cut to the recipient\nAnd like a leader you either have a a functioning corn car insurance gas money to get to the doctor if you're poor you can text your doctor you can email you can call them you don't have to leave the house necessarily because the doctors are and how many patients you have\nA we have about six or seven hundred or a doctor\nOkay so you don't look all the way and I was just like most practices probably most of your patients like me I really don't want to see you unless I really need you\nUnless I'm saying hello or you know saying let's go fishing together hum this most people dread but there's probably at least ten patients of every practice where they're calling me every day I'm assuming\nWe we have our high utilize there's an and unless you're\nA we had her height we have our high utilize there's a we have a few pains and they asked it never stop 'cause you know we factor that in um on the part of the\nProgram we have doctors coming from a three hundred and fifty doctors from forty one states descending on our land this weekend to attend the conference to learn how to set up their practices after this so now with over a thousand practices nationwide already practicing the director model or looking increased that just by thirty percent with one conference alone\nOr the interest is massive will keep growing it as long as we could policies were placed the state and federal level that continue to allow these practice to\nTo grow and blossom or you'll see this movement leaving all across the country are getting better access better care for their cost\nOf a sudden I got to tell you any Democrat that is telling you anything about healthcare that's out now is they're talking point we're offering health care uh and and Republicans willing to take care of preexisting conditions that line\n... Boulder lie as keep your doctor keep your plan and save money and why would you trust the people that burns you the first time so that they're talking point in the final week of the election\nAnd these alternatives ah assuming Republicans get the Senate and hopefully the house which is a lot tighter um it would be an opportunity for them to adopt this model and every American could I've concierge care at lower rates and we'd all be better off\nListening to the top giant nine Seventy WM show Seventy Katie Jay ... service [noise]\nThe victim signed ...

VW am show of\nIt was tossed Seventy Katie J I [noise]\nTo Congress in Eighteen Seventy begins extending a offers of citizenship\nTo Indian tribes or most of what your degree so you're a citizen of a tribe and they citizen of the United states\nThere's a Supreme Court opinion and Eighteen Ninety eight United States versus wrong Kim art we've talked about this I've written about it and that declared the fourteenth amendment adopted the common law definition of birthright citizenship [noise]\nUm but the decision conferred birthright citizenship when a child of legal residents of the United states\nNow the majority is broad enough to include children born illegally in the United states as well as legal immigrants but that's not what the court decided it wasn't even presented to the court and so of course you have individuals\nWho are trying to read it in to it the court has never decide\nThat illegal alien at is the children of illegal aliens are automatically citizens of the United states think of the absurdity of [noise] those who passed the amendment specifically rejected the idea we know who would apply to the freed slaves\nAnd we know that in the Nineteen sixties at some point the interpretation changed for the executive branch\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with addiction please call this toll free number right now eight hundred three nine o\nNine

future is still a bright place that help you need could be one phone call the weigh\nEight hundred three nine o nine five to eight that eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight this call is completely confidential end if you have private insurance there could be little to no cost to you even\nIf you already been to treatment give them a call there is no need to let a ditch and ruin\nExactly it's like saying proved to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to mandate gay marriage well I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I could see from my research is that\nFor most of our history we didn't have too many illegal aliens in the early part of twenty century it was in the sixties and seventies and eighties it started to grow and there was never an active decision what happened was because most people um are born here who who are born here are obviously legitimate citizens\nAnd we believe in birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants hospitals\nNever asked any questions and H H s and Social Security administration never clamp down on it on the back end how do I know this is true because everyone agrees that children of diplomats are excluded right I mean that's the whole point that they are not subject to American law they everybody agrees\nChildren of diplomats tourists\nWho just come to the United states I mean real tourists not not the the shame that we see taking place in some of these places but just because you're a tourist in the United states you have to give birth doesn't mean that you then she'd a burst birthright citizenship to the United states if you're say from Canada\nExactly exactly I mean that's that's the point so you know there is evidence that there are plenty of children of diplomats that are also being handed a citizenship papers and pass administrations had been extremely lax\nAnd in that case everyone agrees they're not entitled to it so again this is a passive act\nTrump is actually restoring the real law on this dates back to the U.S this as grants attorney general or just a couple of years after the fourteenth amendment ... he said very clearly\nThat this means people subject to complete jurisdiction not aliens with parents born abroad um there were two other cases before then it said the same thing this justice pray overturned that inexplicably and this is just the stuff that nobody is willing to talk about\nMm now let's make something very very clear about this they say it's a dubious\nLegality for the president to do this with an executive order let's walk through this together\nSo in the Nineteen sixties and seventies the bureaucracy\nStarts conferring citizenship on the children of illegal aliens not based on the statute not based on the constitution it takes hold corrupt the federal bureaucracy who's in charge of the federal bureaucracy Daniel what's\nThe president\nThe president you know so it presidents and you know what\nI I I'm going to stop that some of the river then including the leader of the Republicans in the house they say you can't change the constitution by executive order you know that's what Obama was doing we don't do that kind of ...\nYour point earlier he's not changing the constitution by executive order he's not re interpreting the constitution by executive order he's getting the executive branch under control and saying this is what the fourteenth amendment means\nThis is what I wrote my book stolen sovereignty literally we have stolen sovereignty the executive branch made this decision I imagine if the people would have voted or Congress would have conducted a vote\nWe're going to give citizenship to hundreds of thousands of people every year who break into our country against their consent no one would have ever voted for that that was a bureaucratic creation\nAnd again let's zoom back to asylum to many other changes Trump is making he's nearing ... merely restoring\nThe constitution and the statutes he's overturning the other administrative a lawless acts of previous administrations you know very well marketing and you do this as well as conservative review we are not\nIn lockstep with everything that any party does we'll call the president now if we disagree with something but everything he has done an immigration is actually the base statute is what past administrations have done to subvert it that he's changing\nSo I mean is the head of the executive branch he doesn't need a statute or to reverse what the executive branch did without a statute does he\nKnow know and unless Congress the only thing that could happen if Congress with their naturalization power could explicitly say thou shalt give US citizenship to all illegals they could do that but until they were at ...\nIsn't the problem though that the courts might aren't the courts out of control even these so called constitutional is on the court\nUm you know stay my on popular opinion here I mean this was my concern about Gorsuch and I think we've seen that in a very similar sovereignty ... sessions um I I don't know if we have five votes I I doubt Roberts will be with us but\nI don't think I I don't I don't think a cabinet would be with us\nI I think yeah I mean I I Know Tom is would be based on his past writings and his understanding of sovereignty but but here's the broader question\nIssuing citizenship birth certificates that is an executive power who's to say that the judiciary has the final say this is not something you know IBM versus Microsoft case or controversy this is the most foundation on national question\nAnd the notion that we're going to see that to the courts\nBut the problem is the courts sees it for themselves look what look what they did to the president when he was simply trying to have a six month respite so we could vet people coming here from six\nMajority Muslim countries that are spreading terrorism in those countries where there's civil war in those countries it didn't even include a majority of Muslim countries with the vast majority of Muslim population and look what happened in these federal district court in circuit courts you you have to hold your breath\nOh and and by the way since Trump won in Trump ally in the Supreme Court subsequent lower courts have come back and basically repeal that Supreme Court decision\nThey're just totally disregarding it and putting injunction on very similar policies visit what happened and I I don't know the answer for this one as a society as a body politic\nBoth the executive branch and members of Congress both parties say let's see what the courts say well I mean if the courts are not a concurrent power side by side but standing over then we have North Korea and there's no elections\nSo this is the problem yeah I I don't think this will do well in the courts but again they would stay the same thing if Congress were to do it just last week a district judge said that a statute of Congress\nMaking it illegal for local communities to thwart federal immigration law is unconstitutional not the president statute so I don't know what you do with that\nMhm [noise]\nWell here we are but one of the things I'm very pleased about is it sounds like the president is taking this on now I hear some of the race ... on cable TV while actually cable TV filled with race matters and I heard one of them said recently that today the president brought this up the ... division\nInto deep and bring it up he was asked about by by a reporter who was interviewing him who got word that they are quietly looking at this and the counsel's office or maybe the department of justice and even said I don't know how you got that information and they turned it into a race issue\nAnd even said I don't know how you got that information and they turned it into a race issue course they're going to write\nMark you know it's tragic about the race issue\nAnd and it's really ironic and really said the fourteenth amendment was crafted to ensure that the declaration of independence were actually the vision would actually be actual allied men the bare bones minimum writes life liberty and property would be given to black American citizens that shouldn't citizens for many years they were here for centuries\nAnd it said that is being bastard die to subvert the actual meeting and disenfranchise all American citizens black and white and everything else\nAt the hand of of of illegal immigrants it it makes no sense as a regret it let me just\nSay that I have to go some Len let's be abundantly clear about that amendment was for black Americans\nAmendment that amendment was for former slaves that's it\nDone and it was to make sure that they were treated as equals citizens the whole point of the civil or the post civil war amendments was to protect former slaves had nothing to do with illegal aliens same sex marriage this one not one of the nothing whatsoever\nSo the left pours the agenda end of the fourteenth amendment which wants to do Daniel Harlow let's keep up the good work we much appreciate it my friend\nAbout God Bless and God Bless you to\nListen to this the iris hired a small army of private collectors of your heart just skip the beat changes are you oh the IRS because hearing the most powerful collection that and she
