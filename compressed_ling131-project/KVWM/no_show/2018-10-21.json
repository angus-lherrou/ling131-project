cannot breed and eventually will die out in ... a cat registry\n[laughter] register your cat and kept curfews now how do you put a curfew on a cat or should be put in place he said quote I'm calling for the total eradication of cats in Australia and quote\nI told parliament that Wildcats may be playful and affectionate around their owners they are killing machines went out on the trial in suburbia\nEvans blamed cats for the extinction of at least nine native species so he wishes to unleash\nA virus that will kill all cats and I've got\nA big problem with this we're we live in the in the days of the international travel air travel and people are going back and forth in the business and commerce is going on all over the world and I can feature easily this kind of virus getting loose and killing all the cats\nIn the world I suppose\nA lot of people don't like cats wouldn't mind that happening but what do you think of the idea of unleashing a virus that would literally kill all the cats in one country do you think it could be safely I mean I don't live in Australia\nThe country do you think it could be safely I mean I don't live in Australia\nOr I don't like the idea of them killing all their cats but I don't live there and so if it was contained in Australia that would be one thing the question is do you think it can be contained to Australia\nAlright what I Want to do is open lines were going to have an open line kind of night tonight anything you want to talk about anything at all is fair game last night we devoted to the incredible terrifying fires in the south land and I'm sure we'll get more reports tonight\nSo what if you wish to update is a that is fine would love to get an update if you want to talk about or anything else you certainly are welcome

yeah yeah uh-huh which kind of throws that three out of the other right\nOh well I don't know I I don't think they've decided on anything absolutely yet um have you heard they have\nNo I have not uh-huh I'm I'm just saying that the last time I heard\nI listen to the show as often as I can I worked days when it comes down in my area very late at night but I'm the last thing I heard was that it was a mechanical failure which blows doctor over three out of\nThe water correct no no no why not\nWell they did not announce the absolute cause they just announced they are now thinking yeah uh so uh how does it blow anybody's theory out of the water\n\nWell it was the uh\nIn other words until they determine the actual cause when the issue of stories or that says they think\nOr were they were leaning toward that should be a register in your mind as different than this is the cause you see what I'm saying correct okay so uh no theories are blown out the window as far as I Know all theories are still alive\nBut uh the the the friendly missile theory which was Dr Oakland original idea I Believe\nIt's not a doctor just Richard Richard yes\nShe did she referred him as Dr ... no sir oh you did\nOkay I I I'll pay I'll stand corrected\nUh so I'm a dancer your question no it doesn't blow anybody's theory until they determine what the actual causes ones are um everything is still possible\n[noise]\nSo what is your thinking then where do you stand\nI Am not a I'm I'm Andrea I'm not an investigator so I I really don't know\nDo you have a theory ... through my my personal very yes\nWell I'm apparently at one time we thought that there was something in the airplane aircraft to fill that ah that set it off\nWell that could be a bomb that could be a mechanical problem\nOkay oh you must have a three I where do you want why must have a theory well I'm not saying you must have a theory but you must have some idea demand that I have a say or do I demand it no I don't know that it's good to actually hear personally that site\nUm I look I Do a talk show and um I don't investigate aircraft accidents are there are people doing good scientific hard work on all of this and uh I'm sure that eventually we will get some kind of an answer I Hope and\nAnd have had those people on your air\nWell I also have major teams on who said that it was a mechanical problem but you probably didn't hear that show well which way do you lean [laughter]\nBuys or I'm afraid that uh for you or for anybody else I don't lean in any direction at all [noise]\nI also saw the NBC picture of what I was born in purported to be a missile and there were a hundred and fifty two hundred people who thought they saw a missile now they say that could have been a fuel trail that ah that first went down and then burn from the bottom up toward the airplane and made it look like a trail of a missile\nMechanical problems [noise] bomb a missile I don't know\nAny of the above are possible and I don't think I'd go to venture a guess cook that mall\n... somewhere\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nThere on the surface and it's very foreign surface that in a coup or standing on right now because for the first

taste so yeah you gotta ... you read was a little bit which we go in the restaurant you have to ask for African ice bucket and ice and you also have to tell them to put water in the book is they have\nThe they will have the audacity to bring you a bucket of ice trying to put a bottom line is you don't go you've got to put it to [noise]\nWell that's fascinating that everybody is taught you supposed to have red wine at room temperature so this is one of those things that makes a huge difference so what you're saying is is not enough to just go like at the restaurant and they hand you a

San Francisco since we'd heard I just said has it goes out maybe this is my birthday ever going to Vegas [laughter]\nWe get to Vegas and new limo pulled up got pulled out in the middle I won't really go too far in that direction but anyway I Would say though that senator received there and then we go and we go see ... which was pretty outrageous back then it's less now but at the time it was like\nPretty pretty edgy um we walk him was champagne everybody's looking at us like\nWhere did you get the champagne we didn't see it when it's you know where that was offered was not offered but to me is you make it happen you know I had a master somebody taking care of me\nSo forty five minutes we're watching that show and\nOff to post real let's have something good with gangs restaurant I was getting pretty well so um we're ... the main table at the center everybody round going on a smell so everyone would there have been in a way to go on ... and I saw it on the menu is white truffles had flown in last night you know\nOkay let me go to trial the nightclub you know whether the two hour wait for you know three hundred dollar coverage charge we walked right in right up get the best table or is it that was looking at those guys you know and then we wound up a\n... one more place and then uh I guess right is that we we finished experiment rhino\nBack with more from ... gay and author of power entertaining and he also in just a moment we're listening to Vegas never sleeps with Stephen me and she is talk radio network\nUh for sure I mean we have prime rib eye on the menu and\nWe also have a five on the menu some of the best stake in the world so ah we're really proud of our menu and very proud of the state that we put put together um we're also really proud of our service you know are we make sure that you're well taken care of and you feel like you're the only person in the room even though you might be one of four hundred people in the room\nWhen it's really important to notice that it's everything in here right from the from the feel of the place I Know you said you don't want to scare women women always think of the place where a bunch of guys sit around the smoke cigars and eat the Patty steaks and it's not like that here that it's a it's a whole style thing yeah\nUh well we're definitely not scaring the women off I think that uh we get plenty of ladies in here and we we love that or we have plenty of guys and here's what we really get is a lot of people that are ready to have a good time and it's a great kickoff or your night in Las Vegas\nWell and that's exactly what we want to let people know it's a lot of fun and they got some of the food now like for example I noticed is getting a menu site orders you've got more site orders and I've seen it virtually any steak restaurant I've been to well\nWe we like to pride ourselves on variety and make sure that there's something for everybody\nAnd you know you talked about steaks and I know everybody wants to do some more the one of the best chefs in the world is going to ask give us the difference between like you know they thought Kobe beef and different levels to stay well should we be looking at it for coming in for we want that one of a ... steak Neal um well\nI mean if looking at a raw steak I mean it's obviously the marveling and the color that you're looking for um if you're looking on a menu to see some are one of a kind some great great steaks this is a good place to start\nA we do our we do our ribs caps here we do um are do Monica shows um I think that uh it's how you cook it and it's the quality that you start with that that puts together a one of a\nKind of stick now um he always recommend medium rare how does that go\nI actually I Would recommend different different temperatures for different cuts I you know I'd\nLike a fillet I think should be rare or you go to New York maybe mid rare sometimes you might want to take like a flat on steak and take it up to a medium I'm just kind of depends on the on the on the steak that you're talking about\nSo what about the guy to come to the you know you must get them all all my stuff well done is it like it's a shepherd that almost offensive or is it something like no no we're going to make this the best we can well\nI'd like to quote Ronald McDonald in hold the pickles hold the letter special orders don't upset us you know um that's where we stand here will cook it just how you like it if you're going to pay for it we're happy to cook it for you and by the way we just want you to have a great time so if you know well the un steak that's part of your great time and we're happy to oblige that\nWell and there's an entire mia we we chat or whether you're a pastry chef she's great ah is that like it is putting together some as soon as they can if chef is not just a matter of knowing how to prepare some of these things it's like a whole team effort isn't it\nI I think for sure it's a team effort if it's not just one person for sure I mean you know the service staff my uh the cooks behind my line or are incredibly talented\nAnd you know my sous chefs and of course pastry chef a bridge it is very very talented so when you put us all together we really come up with a great product and we're really proud of it and we'd love to have you come in and check it out for yourself\nWell we certainly will uh you know and you tell about putting together the the team like that to personalities come into play I mean you have a certain status everybody knows Gordon Ramsay you actually see him going crazy and yelling at people but I Know she all ships don't work that way you look for a particular personality type well\nPersonalities are important we spend a lot of time together you know we've probably spent ten hours a day five days a week together so that's a big part of your waking weak or you want to have people you can get along with people with like minded a goals and I think we've accomplished that here and it's always a work in progress\nAnd finally let's talk about having a great restaurant and it certainly is a great restaurant in a place like Las Vegas where just in his hotel the cosmopolitan isn't it great restaurants I mean does that get your creative juices going I mean you can just drive within a couple of miles of his poisonings see Perry uh quite a few great restaurants\nThere's there's a lot of accomplish restaurants as well as accomplished chefs\nAt a very close a priest committee to as the K uh this is this does raise the bar and it keeps you challenge to be fresh and to come up with new stuff on a regular basis um you know some of my best friends are the fellow chefs that are\nVery close around 'em so we always get together and and trying to outdo each other as as much as possible it's just kind of the nature of being a chef you know the the ego thing I guess\nWhen I was kinda cool so you guys still you you are friends who doesn't like you know buying give dirty looks to some of the other restaurants in town\nNow no I mean the the color of their community and in Las Vegas is very tight and uh we all have a great respect for each other and um we're always a happy for each other's successes and and more happy to be the one successful\nAnd like every other great restaurant you've got a great cocktail lounge and so forth here and winds were important that plays a big part of what you do you have to have the right vintages and so forth to really matched the food\nOh yeah I think that uh the the advantages for the wine and the types of wine and you know uh what's in style with the wind and what people are going for with the wind is is very important um we have a great ... a wind program here so we're proud of that as well\nYou are

the subject matter a lot it is something that is touching\nEvery single demographic in America and that is opioid used and it's something I touch on we kinda skate across the edge of it I wanted to get more in depth interview regarding nest and perfect perfect timing\nDr Paul ... and Fred much joining us the our news maker line about surgery surgery is often a gateway we notice to persistent opioid use\nAnd here's what shocked me millennial women are at the greatest risk of becoming persistent opioid users that completely threw me further so despite the availability of non opioid pain management options are there out there there's tons we had tons of stuff before opioids new research is now showing us that opioids continue\nTo be wildly overprescribed following some surgeries off and leading to misuse and abused again we all know a family or a household that's been touched by this so here to break it all down for some doctors happy and Mr Munch I'm going to start with doctors that the if you don't mind talking to me why surgery specifically\nIs a gateway to persistent opioid use what is leading that\nSo Christmas actually question\nAnd part of my responsibility to take a broken bone or torn ligament to repair that so that you have a fully functional joystick and go back and play sports in order to do that sort of resolved required and the traditional training from medical school is that\nTreating post operative paid and really treating all of the post office or they would open medications was the right thing to do\nWe believed incorrectly for many years that you could not get addicted or get in trouble with pain medication taking them after surgery unfortunately at high so we realize it's not the case and the duration of medication that Iran and the types of medication can play a major role so we now say\nThey're close to ten percent of patients nine percent to be more granular what nine percent of patients who are going to be on pain medication for persistent period of time for granted in three months after the surgery was really an unacceptable complication rates we have to look at other waged repaid afterwards setting\nIn an unacceptable complication rates we had to look at other ways to treat paid afterwards setting expectations differently using any inflammatory medications and using what we call a multi Motorola approach afterwards early physical therapy in ice ways that we can use\nOpiates as a third or fourth lie to pain medication and for a very short duration rather than the first first line of defense\nAbsolutely and you nailed it you really did because again you know I'm I've got two beautiful kids two C sections where I was the first one leaving for the pain killers so I'm all for it but you touched on something so

doesn't take a lot of time it doesn't take a lot of money but you still have a fabulous end result the church and the stories that I'm getting from people are cracking\nMe up that this story for another day but what really grabbed me a couple of weeks ago as I get mine now fourteen year old and my eleven year old ready for the you know the upcoming Halloween it's always fun we have such a blast with it but I Am kind of freaking out and how many adults parents fell parents out there even grandparents getting it on the action\nReally shelling out way too much blockage for any kind of a Halloween costume I'm Sorry they generally wait maybe two ounces the CDs you know the costumes and the various little bag you pick it up and it's like when\nIt was like an outfit you know it just it's not that much material it's not that much complicated sewing or stick to re or whatever\nAnd they're shelling out hundreds of dollars and then they're customized again there's people out there that we're spending a month in front of the sewing machine trying to get this stuff done you know taking it to Taylor's and dry cleaners who do special things on costumes I just could not believe Myers so I'm loving\nThis you know very mild backlash on the overspending for Halloween last week we talked about all these various costumes you can put together for easily less than ten bucks and best of all

all the time or another for how we have half of them are a lot to talk real estate right after this [noise]\nThat it would make sense other factors being equal to not buy that house because prices are going to be going down over the next couple of years yes if you could count on interest rates are not going up would be a good decision to not buy so folks the people who really should know the economists\nAt places like coral objects were asked this question when do you see the national housing market turning from a seller's market like we've had basically since two thousand twelve two thousand Thirteen so we're all going on to you know five and six years of that when do you see that\nTurning into a buyer's market okay where we've got\nMore sellers and buyers and prices going down\nWell of the economist that were surveyed there were a five percent said we've already turned into a buyer's market other probably are and parts of the country that are turned into a buyer's market\nA seven percent said well at the end of twenty Eighteen I think we're going to see herself turning into a buyer's market okay Thirteen percent said by twenty Nineteen okay and forty three percent the biggest bump in this Kerr said by twenty twenty but the consensus is that yes we're going to head into a buyer's market and folks\nThat's not news shouldn't be news anybody because markets don't go up in a straight line forever and ever and ever that's not the stock market\nThat's not true of the housing market I think given the president leadership on the part of our president with the deregulatory urging the laws being made more and more favorable tax laws being made more and more favorable to investment\nI think we're going to see how much much more solid unsustainable rate of increase in earnings for companies and much more solid unsustainable rate of increase in home prices sooner or later there was going to be a correction because we haven't we haven't reverse the market trends\nForever and ever and ever now so by twenty twenty two years away\nA and even then it's probably going to be mild and if there is a ten to twenty percent correction and home prices\nThat still bodes very very well for the long term and I'm going to repeat ... I'm going to repeat the advice that I've been giving for the last oh golly five years at least that you do now is the best time you're going to have for the rest of your home buying lifetime\nTo either buy that first home\nMake that move up by so I don't think the chances of us getting a bubble again Chrissy are anywhere near what they were what the lead to back in two thousand eight\nI agree I agree it's reassuring to I Love how the map just doesn't live when you're talking about the trends how things go up to go down the steady and happy upward trend is always just constant there and as well as the fact that you that all those economists who are thinking that we're still really into the thick of things get in there you may be an excellent point before when we were talking about\nAll my only for excellent\nBut when you talked about how things could be slowing down because the inventory\nIs really starting to wonder if leaving and best of reasons get lighter than it used to be used to be the market was flooded flooded get flooded with homes that with these viruses desperate to sell\nAnd now you've got this turnaround for people or you know and and they weren't selling because people just weren't confident enough in their finances now you've got a reversal of that people are far more common than their finances are buying these houses and now the for that reason the mentors lower but stick with it if you're in there to get yourself a new house you've got your dream house in my\nStick it out really power through you know keep researching and don't settle you're going to find a perfect for you out there but yeah the toys that that's the reason is getting a little lighter than it used to be\nAbsolutely absolutely and that we're going to talk just a little bit about the true cost of not owning your own home a total what proof exist at owning as financially better than renting\n... and people listen to this program of heard me talk before you know the top five financial benefits of homeownership and home ownership is a form of for saving people put a pretty high priority I'm paying the mortgage every month because if you don't pay your mortgage like they'd probably told you a settlement\nYou pay your mortgage just stay if you don't you won't\nThere's a lot of personal finance books out there that talks about ways just Proven Ways to get yourself to a millionaire status by the time to retire and one of the biggest things they talk about is having multiple forms of income\nPeople often interpret that as saying oh what I Need to have a side job and he had an additional career now when you own your own home that it's forced savings and believe it or not forced air quotes income soon the money that you're generating off of that but you're a homeowner chances are really very excellent they going to get where you want to go faster than if you were not a homeowner\nApp so terribly so homeownership is a form of forest savings provides tax savings homeownership also allows you to lock in your mostly housing costs where else could you say that hey my rent is going to be the same\nIn Thirty years or is it is now now where are you can't really say that for sure about your housing cost if you own your own home true because your taxes are going to go well that's\nTrue but if you're writing your taxes are going to go anyway you're landlords are and you're\nThat is true that is true okay so you're going to lock in your principal and interest costs and it's going to be the same for the next Thirty years also buying a home is money wise month to month year to year cheaper than running another big big reason I'm a big believer in the financial reasons for buying a home no heck yeah but ah another survey was done\nOf homeowner net worth versus renters network mhm\nThe average homeowner network let me put it that way it sure is forty four times greater than that of a renter they know something like five thousand dollars for a renter oh my gosh\nTwo hundred and twenty two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a ... that it is a no brainer so folks as we said now is the best time you're going to have for the rest of your home buying lifetime\nTo buy that house the combination of prices haven't gone up as much as they are going to Riyadh interest richer and hitting one way up and he is now is the best time still going to be a good deal and\nFive years ten years Twenty years this field is right now and hit a life\nRaft\n[laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] there's more than one way to invest in your

P. E. and show them everything and then they have to do this three or four times a year and I every time I have to dedicate these resources I say hey I get it\nYou know people talk about some skills training allowing people to enter these virtual classrooms and sort of have this opportunity to engage in speak with people and interact with them and\nIn different types of environments that might make them more comfortable with communication on sexual harassment training I heard all the time and\nI think that you know there's all sorts of interesting ways to leverage technology for the good of the people but my personal goal something I'd like to see is that we've seen\nPeople utilize VR for pain management and that is something that really blew my mind tell\nYeah paint pain management I'm really I didn't want to take the somewhere so it it can even do something you see it as a kind of a sudden it to the medical field because I Know\nIt just from some of the interviews I've done in the past with some of these futuristic been in the world of medical they're constantly looking for ways to not only get ahead of the technology but also make this more cost effective and it seemed like boy if you could do something like that that she'll going to be a eventual eat more cost effective than the medication or what have you\nFired costs in fact the virtual reality as it becomes more mainstream it's like anything the more that equipment they kind of make good as the cops just gets driven down and turning down ... down and we've seen it probably go down hundreds a percentage point\nAnd turning down and driven down and we've seen it probably go down hundreds of percentage points in the last\nFive years it's absolutely unbelievable from the ... you saw today costing twenty thousand dollars five years ago to today cost and somewhere between thirty five hundred and twenty five hundred and and as far as pain management is concerned\nUm I Know somebody who recently worked on a project to bring virtual reality to a gentleman who was dying of cancer\nAnd this gentleman had had certain travel experiences with his wife that were very meaningful to him\nSo they developed a scenario with inside of Google Earth where he could travel to these situations and experience them and you spend several hours on there and of course beyond being just very touching for him it was very much in a scape from his reality of the reality for him was harsh one uh one where he's dying\nAnd he's faced with pain and the pain of the sadness of people around him so during this time and and he was a mobile as well so during this time in virtual reality he gets to escape that my goal would be to see a virtual reality\nHeadset and every single veteran hospital and every single hospital across America so that people could take a break from their pain\nSo I Love that here's something a little less important but yet\nPeople to listen to the show is want to go to Las Vegas [laughter] maybe we bring Vegas to them some way in other words could you she not just Las Vegas but really anywhere in the world where you could take people like to the Golden Knights singing field the experience of playing hockey a more you know that kind of thing with is\nAbsolutely and I mean entertainment's great because entertainment's dumping money into virtual reality which means there's so many technological advances that we get to all benefit from\nI'm absolutely I think that stuff's really cool or we're gonna see stuff with movies and entertainment or you can already accept who from your Oculus device which is pretty interesting um I was wearing my mask on my on the airplane and the other day I had my Oculus on and\nI you know I I Know that I was kind of a sight to see but I Know that in five years that won't be uncommon at all\nReally so I mean are we going to be like right now we see everybody's head down looking at their phones maybe we'll sit there with a bunch of visa VR helmets on with people looking at it\nAbsolutely and actually a joke all out what the my colleagues about how somebody needs to create a safety course for how to safely use the R because that's going to cause quite ... as far as people on the streets and walking around and just all the cords and things like that\nNow that brings up something that I did want to ask you 'cause there was some fears some people have mentioned that was going to do this interview when they said you know what they worry about is like whatever they're doing and when they were in this moment that somebody could come in and robbed their house or something like a swimming pool where you're going to have to have somebody else ... or I was at work\nSo that's a great question first of all I think you always have to be

I'm looking at the page from the road society and it says that the silent Porsche will be from eight thirty to twelve PM and allied portion will be from one thirty three thirty so\nOh so they think I'm going to be up there for two hours auctioning off or roses Lance is that that that's my time frame\nLike Brian one Lance because we need to make sure he's there and [laughter]\nJohn pulled that off last year too and I sat around forty five minutes and I think that\nUm uh the\nI think you can even come in as early as eight o'clock everyone and start bidding but um I think the official timing\nOr that we were using was nine o'clock but doesn't make any difference just be there yeah a start bidding and have lots of fun and that's the most important thing\nYeah exactly well I Do I have a couple of roses ... are you now\nI Do I you know I have um I have some favorite hybrid eyes or ears and uh one of them kind of a court guy but I like him and I like his roses so I'm definitely going to be looking to um increase my bag Nashville garden\nYeah there you go [laughter] I Am looking\nAt um I Love Paul answers that I was single roses so I'm looking at is that to ferry and that's looking pretty good to me\nYou know the the roads that send the option to is a nice one gallon special ... specimens today it's it's fallen in full bloom so I Hope that lasted for the auction but it's called to ferry because each individual pedal looks like a two\nYeah it's really interesting the pedals are kind of separated that big a stain into the center\nOr it isn't nice rose I have to admit it met and um I sent one to someone in Michigan\nAnd they sent me back a note and they said you know we've had several phrases here in Michigan and I want you to know the tooth fairy still is blooming where all the other roses or you know and it was already in in their debt now is\nThat something that you knew about before\nHim know how would I Know that what gives you knew everything yeah [laughter] I Know everything eventually and that is the moment is [laughter] hey\nLance my question to you besides the fact that we're all anxious to see you on Sunday what were you were a lot will your part B or during the auction or this weekend in during the live auction or your purpose to be there this year as for what\nWell I'm going to be the keynote speaker at the awards dinner I think I Hope that\nYes when he has all the whatever they do exactly at the auction Sunday night be there\nYou should prepare a speech\nI Am an eye out as a ... well if you don't insult\nTell you why I'm I'm really honored um you know if you're lucky enough to be in the horticultural or gardening um as a career usually you get a couple of plants that defined your career for me it's certainly been roses and the court system citrus um\nYou know I've written four or five books on roses and in countless stories and various magazines from sunset to\nWherever and I'll tell you every one of those books and every one of those stories relied on people from the American rose society\nTo get all the information I Need to get a ... all the information correct\nAs a matter of fact I'm roses for dummies Bob Martin was a big part of that and so I'm Iowa the first thing I'm going to say is that the bank everybody that's healthy over the years because they'd been an important part of my career if it wasn't for roses for dummies I probably wouldn't be the spokesperson for bio advance so I'm really looking\nForward to this that's yeah I didn't know that\nWell I think if you weren't than you'd just be a dummy then right [laughter] that's\nRight well I think he said and done all this donated buck\n[laughter] I think I've got you there you know and then you know I'm excited about\nThis option because uh\nIf there we should we should have a Banksy rose did you hear about this uh these auction that where the banks you paint gene where it's self destruct distracted so well Brian's up there and when that gab all banks one of the roses is just going to shred itself\nWe had a member passed member of the uh California coastal road society who was quoted as saying I have never kill the rose however a fair number has committed suicide\nWell in my ... year whether that Jerry Seinfeld [laughter] ... light filled\nIn my talk I'm going to give a little tell the story about a road that our loaded on\nMe so oh yeah you get your tickets now and be there\nOr if we should mention that if you want to hear Lance speak you have to register register for the um\nConvention mhm and you can go on line to uh I think it's fiesta roses dot net\nAnd find all the information or you can go to guard in America there's links to all the information you can come to the auction for free or but we're not giving Lance away that's for sure [laughter] heck no\nFiesta roses dot ... dot org okay\nOkay yeah I'm so glad still is what's going on in in your neck of the woods right now it's turning fall for you right you got your that's right and we're ... already going\nYep we've started to pick out the truth we than picking um\nLet's see we started with the use do we moved on to the ... um and we just finished our finger lines so and will be starting Meyer lemons and the rest of his stuff pretty soon so it's getting exciting up here that's for sure\nI think you just mentioned citrus that a lot of our listeners might not even be familiar with right I used to ensue dodging and I wanted to ask you two things first of all what are those briefly but second of all um are you growing those because they're more of a specialty crop\n... let me stop you right there only because we're going to go to a break while it'll give them something to think about their ... so a ... is are those the questions are\nThose that are okay so Lance marinate on that as we take a quick break and\nWe're going to come back land so we'll have more gas\nAnd we got a big rose auction coming up next Sunday\nIt is a twenty minutes after the hour a five five four to four Ninety two five John and gotten America dot com also based on live questions comments I'm Brian main John back NASCAR who have stepped away from the Mike ... coming back with starting America on your Saturday morning stay with us\nAnd the two diabetes which I have a very small and contacts so they're not but they do produce heavy but again it's a small fruit line shape I'm you know so it's not going to be it's going to be fairly productive but the size of the trees are really going to restrict it\nOkay and then you do you keep yours Tom factories um for easier picking or any kind of grow to full size\nNo I we do a prudent to keep them for easier picking we keep the centers open because they use it too is also very thorny so we want to be able to get in there and pick the fruit but\nYou know keeping the tree smaller and keeping the center opened um that allows for easier picking but it also allows for um you know easier spraying the upscale problem you want to get an oil spray and they're really good it's easier to do it the trees wide open\nA Lance was just wondering this is just popped into my head I do think that these aren't you're learning you're a centrist is the hardier it is\nUm I don't think so because one is a thorny or trees or courses of the regular lemons and those are some of the more tender one\nUm you know the ... the heritage or the genetics of the use you and it's a dodge here kind of complicated and um you know some of the native type if you've ever seen some of the citrus root stocks\nThey are some of the thorny as things you've ever seen in your life um so yeah I don't think so although you know you can also say try bullied orange which is one of the party is that yours there is is also a monster or anything but\nI'd say it probably doesn't relate Cardenas\nYeah I was thinking of a I think flying dragging route stuck right or to try\nTo lead orange yeah which was hearty in Lansing, Michigan\n[laughter] well All right well I mean it makes it makes such a job because when people have those suckers come out of the root stocks usually it it looks like something that is out of a horror movie because it's got\nGiant dorms on it and it's much different than you know the eureka lemon that you have growing which looks nice and\nOne of the stocks are definitely chart chosen for their heart failure yeah but for hurting us I was thinking more of temperature but yeah there definitely vigorous yeah\nYeah and you know it has to do is soil adaptations and things like that and I mean some of these that Dr Foley at orange and applying dragging their deciduous so when you get a sucker for one of those it's also been uttered start turning yellow around now so you'll be able to see it very clearly\n\nUp there in the ... in in the valley where you're at land um are you guys starting to cool off now because I had some friends I was up in ... as we can he said it was still really hot\nThe days are ... are still stay in pretty warm were expected to get maybe up to eighty five Ninety I'm maybe tomorrow\nNight's though I can tell you are so much cooler and when you get up at six thirty it's still dark um that makes a big difference and it's we really we could really use some cooler night's though in some cooler days 'cause that's what really\nYou know hardens off the fruit um and really brings the color out and get so sugars and so we could use some\nCooler night but I don't want to say to cool because whenever I Do that [laughter]\nYou out they're blowing the usually when I just wanted to ask you what do you what do you use anything as you just kinda runny nose and\nWe use when machines are and because we get easily when there\nIs a cold front that comes in if we get depends on what it what type of cold front it is whether it's a honest to God cold front door and it you know we're getting in version layer and a good radiation process but the temperature twenty feet above the growth can be ten degrees higher than it is and the bottom of the growth so by running those when machines we can circulate the warm\nAir into the growth and the other things with your more adaptable to\nWhat a home gardener might do is that they can run water when we run water out of our pumps and out of our wealth that may come out at fifty to fifty five degrees so as we pump that out into the growth and it's really cold as that water cools it gives off\nHeat and we can easily raise the temperature agreed to work three um by just running water so um that's a very effective way this much kind of they're just you know they they're they're so polluting that nobody\nUses [laughter] yeah we have an email question from Lance beautiful here that would be John Garton America dot com yeah in this question is from a bill\nAnd he says a question for Lance when applying systemic pesticides the instructions usually say applied to the soil near the trunk why is this different from fertilizer that usually applied out near the drip line\nRight that's a question we get a ... a lot and what the from the studies that we've done we found that when this systemic insecticides are applied near the trunk of the tree they're absorbed equally as well as if they are applied over the entire drip line of the tree um the other thing and the reason why that\nAdvantageous is if you had to evenly sprinkle that material over the entire drip line say of a large tree it would be very difficult but by just putting it right around the talk of the tree on as the label instructs you can get the material up into the tree just as effectively\nYeah and I agree that question a lot and we yeah studies\nAbout it um 'cause it would be a lot harder to spread that material eat only throughout the drip line\nYou done that tiger yeah with bailout World Series you know they get a lot of scale and\nYeah with bay Laurel tree you know they get a lot of scale and I'm sure the mold issues and things like that and when I had a customer and we treated to different trees we treat one with the drip line and then one at the base of the tree the basically the tree responded much quicker than the drip line one we're going to\nTake a break one more segment coming up we'll wrap up a glance it made me take a question or two and of course ah receive some more great information from lands while I'm All right that rose option next Sunday Lance is going to be there to speak it weren't going to be their main target Bella Fox Jon Stewart is break time here\nI Want to

Eastern Europe cause trouble in Ukraine terrified Western Europe return to the middle East that for a forty year high at us and hacked into us elect oriole and political institutions\nAnd there's no doubt about any of this under Obama American leadership rationalize that China which do not only just be an Asian and Pacific superpower but eventually will eclipse our nation\nIt appears that they thought that China's rise to eventual supremacy was destiny rather than being due to incompetent U.S foreign policy\nWhat followed was systematic and unchecked Chinese commercial and intellectual property cheating\nBeijing stole us technology ran up huge trade surpluses in work the entire world trading system\nThis one side of the Chinese trade war was excused as free trade China's military aggression in the south China Sea with also blown off by Washington so the Chinese built artificial bases on this Bradley islands bully their neighbors and to manipulate Pacific trade routes China's there now abusing all of this\nTheir neighbors and to manipulate Pacific trade routes China's there now abusing all of their geographic neighbors and prepared to go after regional oil reserves\nThe Obama administration again offered darned little pushback\nAs a result Chinese President zine gym thing openly bragged about twenty twenty five and it would dominate the global high tech industry ten years later with dominance in Pacific\nIn my mid century would run the world and he wasn't getting that is they're clearly stated goal and he saw the U. S. incompetence was making it very achievable for years ... shared\nA contempt for our national leadership in refuge policies they work to use Uri Iran and North Korea to check our influence while waging cyber war against our companies and institutions\nAmerica is still the most drunks economic and military power in the world but we traded a pragmatic and practical foreign policy for a foolish from Russia and China both agreed that American willpower was weak and despite their own major differences they found it mutually profitable door calling cutting America down and boy did that\nIt's no surprise that our allies noticed from Scandinavia to the Mid East Asia they saw that America was losing his global prestige and we didn't seem to care\nDespite the wild charges of Russian collusion Trump is boxing boot and with economic sanctions and military aid to Ukraine he's beefed up defense spending demanded greater NATO readiness accelerated us oil production but doing so well reaching out in a friendly way to boot and\nBeing friendly while holding the big stick is far wiser there'd be an obnoxious with a twig now we're slapping with China was Harris to force it to reduce its nearly four hundred billion dollar trade surplus with this\nWhile also sending our warships deeper into the south China Sea let our allies know that China will no longer safely bully them\nFurther Trump is negotiating directly with North Korea denuclearization and forging new defense partnerships with Australia and Japan he's also cutting trade deals with South Korea Mexico and Canada that will exclude China\nChina's worried Trump's domestic opponents may write him off as a crude buffoon but Beijing fears that he's a crafty Machiavelli already downsizing Chinese power China stock market is down as the economy is slowing down its currency declining\nAverage Chinese citizens wondering why these tough times their leaders are allowed to gene foreign aid on African countries and other Asian nations all China's mired in a trade war with the United states\nBecause Russia is far weaker than China our government should be reaching out to Moscow to find common interest in checking Chinese power Russia could be useful and occasionally siding with an emerging common resistance to China that includes Australia India Japan the Philippines South Korea and Taiwan\nRight Mr Kissinger\nRussia certainly has no interest in seeing in his neighborhood a nuclear Iran or unhinged nuclear North Korea were having just moved to the Chinese colossus alliance twenty six hundred miles shared border\nAmerican appeasement great concessions and extraordinary Chinese wealth did not make China better global citizen perhaps more and stronger us pushback supported by a ray of Asian allies and it

pleasure to welcome to the show fellow West Point grad an army that day ... days was northwestern mutual and he was recently honored as an employee benefits advisor of the year so I'm sort of like that well I'm different ones that freedom day\nThanks any appreciate the call\nTalk to us about your timing whether army what'd you go to West Point and what'd you do when you got up\nI grew up in Sterling Heights Michigan and really nobody in my family ever been in the military for my parents or grandparents or my parents were teachers or Detroit my grandfathers were union workers and uh the factories for Chrysler Ford and\nI had a chance I was in high school was pretty good athlete and do all all I could honestly and an uncle of mine who lived in New York was friends with a couple of West point graduate whatever shooting range I think he went to initially suggested West Point and that's how I started to learn about it applied in junior high school\nAnd then I ended up getting recruited for football to both Army Navy air force and um by the time I was a senior had a chance to go visit all three places and so on West Point just kind of fell in love with it and that was supposed to go\nWhat'd you do when you graduated\nSo I got out grudging eighty nine and I was in our chili officer I had my first assignment or post was ah Fort Campbell Kentucky so went through our children basic school charter schools and and landed at Fort Campbell and um after my first summer there said I'm a bit equate we ended up getting deployed to Iraq and Saudi Arabia Nineteen Ninety\nOkay and when did you get out and what'd you do when you got out\nOf your life so I went through Desert Shield Desert Storm wasn't sure if I Want to you know do a career or not but it you know back and it was just funny because after nine or ten months in theater wearing live rounds in grades and doing the deal and then I remember very specifically coming back to Fort Campbell\nAnd putting out of uniform again with my chance rep facet of my goats talked in our blank adapters on and and I just you know the thought of the time was gonna just practice the next Twenty years and we're never going to see any action I just\nChose to get out and get into the business world looking back I looked at you know the just challenges and the hard times and deployments all the things that have happened since then for my classmates that are still in and I I just admire everything they've they've done to their service but for me I got out and I took on a road job originally through um\nA recruiting for that kind of chased people getting out of the military and ended up in Dover, Delaware for a while for about three or four years in the commercial credit business\nLearn all about finance on that kind of thing\nAnd then had a kid moved back home to Michigan and so that began my career in HR and benefits insurance field\nOkay we've got a lot in common I spent some time in Fort Campbell to back when it was airborne that's how long ago was\nAll right I Know the game I also deployed with a hundred and first we went to Vietnam little different trips oh yeah when you came back to Michigan you settle down and you obviously a sound northwestern mutual where they found you and obviously you like it because you got one heck of a good award talk about what you do there\nI began my career and the Employee Benefit and insurance business originally with AGP which is a large payroll company and they had a division called total source which was like an HR benefit outsourcing arena so I did that for about eight or nine years\nCalled total source which was like an HR benefit outsourcing arena so I did that for about eight or nine years\nLeft there to run a large group sales and service for humanity and Michigan which is a large national insurance company that many in the military now because of their involvement with military healthcare delivery and retire healthcare\nAnd I got recruited come in northwestern mutual and she doesn't tend to run a small kind of flailing Employee Benefit agency that was part of a northwestern mutual system\nAnd it was really a great opportunity I didn't know a lot about north Russia which I'll tell you that in the insurance world growing up you know we were born and raised to learn the u._s._a. is wonderful and it is a tremendous company that I've always had a lot of admiration for about a client of USA so I was a kid at West point still am to this day\nYup slide northwestern mutual I Would say parallel and rivals usa in terms of quality integrity financial strikes\nAnd I didn't really know a lot about that one I got here but very quickly an ear to after us here it became that so my specialty is employee benefits and working with companies to help put together a group benefit plans for medical dental vision life disability all those things retirement plans\nLove that work aton and uh and we had a great run for the last seven or eight years here\nThough it sounds it sounds like it and you were their employee benefits advisor of the year right\nYeah so Employee Benefit advisor magazine is probably the largest industry publication we have it's connected to the national association of health underwriters which is our National Association and each year they select four or five different categories of benefit specialist to recognizing that an overall advisor there so I was fortunate to be selected for that this year ...\nCongratulations and it was great this is going to be going from my freedom and I'm shooting the bull with West Point mandates vocal since we are west pointers and since armies about to play air force and football and in another month played navy Downey prognosis on how those are going to come up\nSo that's a loaded question 'cause I uh actually played football from my first two years there and they had a couple of minor surgeries and didn't play but that was back in the gym young era of army football and then he was amazing and you know I think three out of the four years as their army went to ball games we beat navy at least three to four years when I was there\nAnd really had a tremendous program and that's we struggled for a long time but I'm so proud to see what coach Montana's doing now\nI firmly believe where you will take both games no questions asked\n'cause aren't we just got that momentum going and they've got a really solid team and program today had a chance to take my youngest son out of recruiting visit to army couple of years ago and saw their new facilities incredible I mean just everything about west points are athletic program so our first class division one quality\nSo I think army's got a good thing going\nWell I agree with you and they certainly have been doing well so far so therefore ah looks like we're going to keep the commander in chief trophy absolutely so what do you do when you're not taking care of your kids and a and handling employee benefits what do you do for fun\nYou know I hunt and fish a lot that's kinda my therapy actually at West point I was very proud to serve the president hunting and fishing club which is one thing about the academy is there's all these obscure different things you can do in terms of sports activities and very much enjoy getting outdoors and Michigan's a great place to do that a small family farm up in the area where the hunt down and\nJust trying to get out do as much as I can\nAnd a lot of my weekends are tied up chasing my kids around the country because they both are two of the free play football and it's a lot of fun to watch out of the college level\nYou know watching your kids do well in anything is fun but you really have the hunting and fishing club that was when I was captain of the west point chess club I couldn't play chess very well but it was really going to send these trips so that has happened or what but\nThe toll taker right I think I Belong to the drama club the Spanish club whatever club to get me a free weekend out of there that was definitely a fun part of my time there\nIt was they were about out of time going back to your profession ... any kind of advice you would like our listeners to know that some insights you might share it might\nHave been in the Employee Benefit in human resource arena for about Twenty years\nIt's a tremendous field I I think a lot of people in the Employee Benefit arena had been kind of a lot of the people that are for long kind of been chased away because of all the fears round healthcare reform and you know this projection that the government's going to take over health care\nUnder any scenario and I don't think our companies are countries that are going to go to like a single payer or government run system but even if we did go to something like that there's plenty of opportunity in this industry for professionals like us to get into an add value to companies because companies are always going to compete for talent in this country\nSo from a career perspective and I think everybody in the military is discipline they're smart they work harder ambitious this industry I think it's got just tremendous potential or in the future so happy to talk to anybody about you know what that looks like for them\nWho how could people contacting\nThrough my a Web site

better story up on the corporate gun control debate I'm sure you love your readers remember after Parkland a number of companies cut ties with the the NRA or some big bank\nWith a little help from governor soprano in a New York I'm\n... and so insurance companies was well cut ties with the n._r._a. and some decided they would not listen to any companies at all that made a semi automatic rifles they are at it right all so called military assault rifles that kind of like um\nThe two most prominent or a couple of days money that her bag Citibank and bank of America\nOr as one of the\n... piece of the blowback from that was that the state of Louisiana cut those two banks out of underwriting bonds the Irish wake writes the roads well senator senator from Louisiana Senator John Kennedy is just introduced a bill in the U.S but it\nIs calling that no red blue bank banks act\nHe's saying that are targeting gun owners and companies is there a frontier responsible gun owners are at a threat to the ... to it and basically what they're doing is they're trying to uh make it a red versus Bloomsday um\nAnd uh if this kind of thing continues he said it's gonna make it hard for business or the editor or businesses anywhere in the U.S for that matter to find banking services um you know these are legitimate local gun stores\nUm gun makers or that type of thing and so what his bill would do would cut those banks out of any federal business not telling who they who they can lead to a new they can or who they can do\nNot telling who they who they can lead to a new they can or who they can do business with he's just saying that if they choose to pick and choose their\nCustomers based on political or believes ... activities or social justice reasons I'm the U.S taxpayer is not going to subsidize that activity\nI Would like to you know um\nHe's he's you know I I don't know if it was in fact you know but I mean all of the most of these big banks took money\nDuring the bailout I took my money during the bailout and all of them did yeah but yeah right so does this mean that we have a back door and who are being able to tell them how they conduct business or I mean I Know there are regulated\nAnd I know that they're regulated by various organizations but I mean is this can we make this price of doing business here in the United states where listen why don't you guys just figure out your best practices as far as business is going to turn to leave the legislation to us\nWell that's that's always the dream but there's always been a cozy relationship between the regulators\nAnd the regulate eat right from what I read where during the after the two thousand a crisis there were a couple of banks who didn't didn't even want to take federal money but we're told that they would um that and I'm not sure what the motivation was there\nUm\nThe anytime\nAnytime you take a Uncle Sam money Uncle Sam can tell you what you can and can't do ... and in this case I'm\nA Senator Kennedy for Louisiana's already said that he is a requested the ... general services administration cuts Citibank out of a seven hundred billion dollar contract they supposedly have a piece for I'm not sure exactly what those services are but that would be a significant piece of us even my bag as big as a city back\nSo yeah I Would think that would get their attention but we'll see where that go see\nWhat happens in three weeks with the election is aware of bill like this by how far it might get\nBut ah it certainly\nPlays well with the with the folks back home um that are centered letting people know that he's not going to sit still for those kind of thing and he uh gonna make life as difficult as he can for banks that choose to\nDiscriminate against to their customers based on their position on the second amendment\nIsn't it surprising that there isn't a law that already\nYes although how you would\nHow you would uh it for something like that is always problematic you know the way it turned down for a for a loan there's all kinds of reasons and are justifications that can go into that senator um however these banks both study NBA have\nOutwardly said look we will not lead to companies that make\nQuote military military style weapons available to the general public or they may no bones about that so that is clearly what these bags are doing right other banks may\nUm make those tissues surgeons on a much a bore down low base um we had an article on that race is not too long ago that fits third bank apparently cutting off I'm\nNot a state armory yeah spike spike tactical exactly but they're not too long ago a last week in fact I got a call from a large Midwestern gun store who had just closed a half a million dollar line of credit with third bag and

the left as game get what you can and come back for more later\n\nWe get this house minority leader Nancy Pelosi promised South Florida gun control activists at universal background checks would be among the Democrats top priorities if the party wins control the house in the mid term elections below sea and us representative Ted Deutch Democrat from west broke up met with students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school local members of the national gun control\nAdvertising and the genesis communications network Google smart waivers bridge to reach us potential customers would be most

and do you live\nFive hundred on a radio studio\nThis portion of the show is brought to you by Boyd guns stocks and\nWho needs a boy's hardwood gun ...\nBoys hardwood gun stuff will make your firearms safety function and looks\nJust a few of\nThe the the shot gun a I have to admit surprise me because I had the the original stock beside me\nWhen uh the gay may be rebuilt shotgun and the difference is alarming\nIt's just so good check it out Boyd gun stuck stuck\n\nWith regards to a whole lot of the a lot of portions of the United states primarily the coastal areas the n._r._a. they may as well just change their name to the Boogie Man\n\nThat's what the and you know part of it is really unfounded because not all gun Second Amendment advocacy is an already but it's become sort of a generic term as I keep saying over and over again sort of what the Iraq says so that's what the Boogie Man is what the organization is to the anti gun as we will stop at nothing\nTo destroy them Mac might be an array of the monster under your bed this\nLatest example of their very unreasonable fear comes from the city of LA Los Angeles city of angels it seems like you want to know if any contractors betting on jobs with the city\nHave ties to the n._r._a. which I shouldn't 'cause I Would not think they did\nThe Los Angeles city council though passed a motion for a new ordinance that we're we're require all city contractors to disclose any connection than you might have the n._r._a.\nWhile the ordinance would not directly prohibit contractors from working for the city if they have a connection and the and All right it does mandate the disclosure of such connections according to CBS Los Angeles the disclosure will likely be used to avoid conducting business with these contractors\nThe council passed emotion ... tend to zero [laughter]\nIt orders the city attorney do create an ordinance that will detail the new rules requiring the disclosure once the ordinances drafted the city council vote on bat\nThey're saying because they are leftist and this is what they do for the sake of transparency the city's residents in stakeholders deserve to know how the city's public funds are being spent and where the taxpayer funds are being spent on contractors that have contracts roar sponsorship ties with the n._r._a.\n\nExecutive director of gun owners of California's imperative said the ordinance is a politically driven legal method of discrimination is no justification for anything like this who or what a contract to sports has no bearing on the quality of work they do to provide a particular service\n\nAnd you can find the same kind of stuff\nOr you know\nIn the past year when you see these claims of transparent we all know what\n\nIf it were about actual transparency they wouldn't be singling out the n._r._a. because there are tons of controversy organizations out there that some would prefer their tax dollars not go toward even indirectly\nYet ... groups like black lives matter and Planned Parenthood groups were or equally um as controversy over the n._r._a. aren't of concern to the city of LA\n\nAnd this is just an attempt to cut off support for the n._r._a. and the ideas that I was real follow LA lead and also introduced such measures in their community that's leading to companies being fearful sport in the in our area of concerns they won't get contracts with various cities some think that might work\n[laughter]\nI of course I'm not one of them I Do not necessarily think that is going to work and I'll tell you why\nLet me tell you why\nAnd I'll tell you why let me tell you why\nFirst of all ... ... when I was in when I was in high school and my ... but I Would say you know California everything that California does the rest of the country adopts\nAnd even when I was on the tenth grade I thought that was the stupidest\nThing I've ever heard in my life\nAnd I would ask them do they have the same kind of weather know\nDo we have the same kind of a you know what what is it about as that makes us to where we just adopt anything they do because they're California where you know what California also has San Francisco\nYou know what happens when you get off the subway in San Francisco you hit by a wall of the fumes of all of the humane excrement that is outside on the ground in ... San Francisco California\n\nYou're likely to be panhandle between your hotel and the car you're going to buy four or five or six different people\nSome of these people are going to be out of their mind on drugs because they pass up the syringes so they you know they can have their heroin fixed and not worry about catching aids\n\nSo there's a big reason why the rest of the country does not go the way of California now California also ah you know California will get out there and there'll be a fish which listen nature is a great thing nature is a great thing I'm right prior prioritized humans\nThey've been so busy trying to be the good global citizens would their high speed rail that goes nowhere that they've you know they they could have been fighting their own drought because the drought\nChanged I mean ah the the drought went away and they got a lot of rain and they were unable to capture that reigned that rain is in the ocean\n\nBut another thing that can happen is a\nTwo can play this game and that's where things can start it but I don't want my community I prefer them not fund the ACLU even if they're only doing it indirectly does this mean I can push them to an act the rule\n... and again there's like there's never considers that two of us can do this while large cities are generally liberal left is how politically large chunk of the nation's population lives in a more conservative rural community community\nWe lack the individual punch of LA but collectively we can do a whole lot more\nAnd it might be time just to do that because that's why the commerce clause exist believe it or not so the big states don't get to push that little states around\nAnd um I'll go with that one I'll go with that one but ah yeah\nCalifornia's in Iraq and Iran you guys need to come out swinging please please get rid of this this code of silence you have and that let's get out there and the have the fight\nPlease I'm getting tired of asking the questions are being
