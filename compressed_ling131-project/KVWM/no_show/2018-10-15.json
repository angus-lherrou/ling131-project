even by someone selling oranges or paper or a an apple\nOne selling oranges or paper or a an apple core none of those things can break down completely in nature rely heavily unpredictably everywhere\nWithin five years after disposal like like a all biodegradable substances it depends on where it's\nDisposed of now what is the it had been brought to let's say ten years would that have been possible\nIt'd be more likely [noise] ever were brought into Twenty years it would be extremely likely for a lot of things but the point the point here is that they arbitrarily selected five years knowing based on the testimony in the case\nThat nothing can break down into elements in nature within five years no substance can predictably breakdown and elements one disposed of in a landfill or you know if someone throw something away and it's\nIt lands up in a place is heavily late with concrete or something may be there for hundreds of years not broken into elements furthermore\nThings don't it's it's on scientific because things don't break down into elements they break down into compounds [noise]\nAnd so the whole thing is a disaster and ah it shows just how out of touch with reality or this Federal Trade commission is there was a dissent by one commissioner\nIt's pretty severe dissent they took the the majority in this case in the commission a also created this standard based on what they perceived to be a minority of some Fifteen Percent of the public\nPublic perception in other words even though they had no strong evidence to contradict the science proving that this may plastics biodegradable they said that\nUh some Fifteen Percent based on survey evidence of the public thought that if something's called biodegradable it should completely disappear within five years and that's not even true but assuming that's true it's\nKind of insane says if you asked uh the the public uh whether or not the earth revolved around the sun or the sun revolved around the earth\nLet's say some twenty percent of the public said the sun revolved around the earth\nWell then would you prohibit people from saying that there's a their model of the solar system a was a model of the solar system because some twenty percent of the people erroneous leave believed that the sun revolved around the earth\nI mean you know it's that kind of ridiculous thinking of course you don't contradict scientific fact based on a minority opinion uh you would rather say people need to be educated but not this FTC it's insane\nWhy don't they seemed to side with the public they always seem to side with big business\n[noise] well I think that it is a combination of two things one thing uh I think at least one of these commissioners commissioner Julie Brill is really so bent against the marketplace\nThat a free market that she will always voted against any company that's brought before them\nThe system is rigged here or George you have the party that brings the charges is also the party that creates the rule and\nThere's also the party that ultimately judges who's guilty so in other words the commission issued the complaint against ISI am alleging that their statement a biodegradable was deceptive and then in the end the commission judges whether\nIt's charge it's charge\nWas correct well of course they're going to say it's correct\nAnd the long history in this thing uh since the Nineteen thirties has been that when the commission accuses somebody of deception they're always right and you know in this case George the administrative law judge at the Federal Trade commission ruled in our favor\nSo they reverse their own administrative law judge to come to the determination that ISI em had violated their rule\nAnd now the matter is on appeal to the sixth circuit and we're hoping for justice there\nJonathan back to a GMOs and we're going to take calls with you just a moment how many products are truly out on the marketplace that are genetically modified\nOh my goodness George three quarters of all vegetable products sold in the United states are hollow we contain GMOs recorders\n[noise] it's it's ... if you go to the grocery store and it doesn't say organic on it the probability is it contains GMOs\nYeah I I think you're probably right in the price difference between organic and ... says are big disparity they're\nReally not that much of a disparity that's the that's the economic reason why the Monsanto's of the world and the grocery Manufacturers Association are so desperately fighting for ah this this deception bill\nThe reason is that there's a small margin of profit\nUh and in order to compete even if they were if they were to reveal GMOs were present people would rather pay just a little more and get organic and not experiment with GMOs in their bodies are their children's bodies\nAnd and that's the that's the rub for this or industry but rather than be honest rather than put\nGMOs on their product in truly compete by arguing to consumers the GMOs are okay they want to Deceive Us so that we don't know GM well\nAnd and they do we're coming back from phone calls on GMOs with Jonathan anymore and that's\nPassed dark act passed and then go to organic consumers dot org and they can learn about the bill more about information how to fight it\nAnd also they can financially contribute to the cars and they can also text nine seven seven seven nine to sign up for rapid response\nGiving up dates on this this fight isn't over we won a very major around but in January it's coming right back at us that the sponsors of this this awful bill are going to put it back into play in the Senate in January and the fights going to happen all over again\nCan we beat them again I think we can George with your help them with the help of all these groups my goodness people really did stand up and and they you know they sent in all of the emails and called their members of Congress and\nThey sent a a you know there were radio interviews and there were articles all over the place in an op ed pieces it was fantastic if we can do that again whenever this thing raises its ugly head or we can keep it down but the sad reality is boy industry is invested in this one\nAnd they really are fighting to get it passed\nTo try to keep people ignorant about what's in their foods\nWell I Love it when something like this one a plan works Jonathan huh it's it's it's wonderful\nIt's a case of David versus Goliath and David again here you know\nA one and it it it really to see that uh the the money the unlimited resources financial resources or something like Monsanto and\nGrocery Manufacturers Association all they're allowing lobby is on the hill to see them work so diligently getting this awful bill passed and the have consumers voices\nOr be the ones that prevented it as it's remarkable particularly in today's day and age a there's a lot of corruption in Washington and to see this happen where democracy work\nIs a very impressive there and\nLet us go to the phones now let's go to South Carolina to get things started to bury the Rockies cello Barry\nHello there George always a pleasure and his or her\nMind gosh do your your gas tonight is so right on I'm On a cruise you remember a little bit about my biochemistry background that's right I I call the cell phone cameras ...\n[laughter] which action is not such a thing anyway\n[laughter] I've got one in five years of experience and the pharmaceutical business and I'll never forget Joe Wertz forty five years ago this past June I graduated from college in Nineteen Seventy year versed in North Carolina Wilmington\nAnd I'm I'm I'll never forget my geneticists a mentor and favor faster and a ... it was a lot too and I'm\n... ... ... ... talk a little bit about this a or a genetically modified foods that are coming in the future\nAnd he said it was not that far away\nAnd he said that's not going to be a good way believe me and so sure enough has been forty five years I'm ... said it but I I Love to just a compliment you didn't show was again and a sailor you ... ... what do you have to comment about what I just say\nAll right thanks very good at Johns\nWell your guest is right this has been a a an effort by industry to basically patent foods what they want to do the reason why Monsanto so invested in this is if they can win there'll be able to take synthetic ingredients\nAre genetically modified plants happening those genetic modifications and then ultimately profit or to the extent they can get it to be back with us from the marketplace they can profit off of the sale of every food source\nAnd be a integrated into the market for every food so it's an attempt to take substances that otherwise or I'm patentable natural foods substances\nAnd transformed them into patentable substances and profit off of it enormously so it's been a long term vision of Monsanto and many other companies that are likewise engaged in this effort\nOr to bring about this transformation and long term it's really not good for consumers will result in a an elevation in the cost of foods\nAnd it will harm people because you won't have the choice of getting something that's organic there right now George pushing the FDA into a room making which it's commenced ah with willingly\nTo define the term natural and the great fear here is that the FDA like it did in protecting Monsanto in the past\nIs going to couch to Monsanto and caused the term natural to be defined in the law in a way that will allow genetically modified foods to be referred to expressly as natural on the label\nAnd I don't drink a lot of people won't\nIt it sure will all of this is a campaign of deception because they fear that they cannot win the argument with the public that there's no difference between something that's genetically modified and something that's organic yet with all new products\nWe look to the party that's introducing them to convince you of their benefit here they want to save themselves that expense have the government this either everybody by law and and the naval themselves to remain in the market through confusion\nIt's a short sided thing when it comes to freedom of speech and and when it comes to ah the rights of consumers but it's a far sided vision as your as your caller mentioned of an industry that wants to profit off of things\nAs your caller mentioned of an industry that wants to profit off of things that would otherwise be available to us without that additional profit going industry\nOff the Sacramento now we'd go Jeff's with us on coast to coast Jess taken away sir\nHey how'd you on yeah it's been a long time uh I was talking to you know I'm I guess it's been about three or drawers and is a long time channel and a half hours a welcome back lots on like all the right\nThing to talk to you about\nUm hours driving down the highway nine and a and then I have these cassette tapes and my term backwards on me at all that stuff\n[laughter] but are you still there yeah\nBut go ahead go ahead that Jonathan's wait for your question\nUm yeah the the old GM out thing is uh basically uh what I found out about it is the\nUh\nThe man shot so a products that protect a\nThat protects their crops there is a one in creating a Senate that doesn't uh it doesn't want to shout or\nWell there's not a ... is in during the problem Jonathan with round up\nYes the ... ... or where the the er\n... spin eight or ... events pronouncing it there's a chemical compound that is is round up and that the industry represented that it would break down in nature\nProblem is that it does not break down in the nature and that causes all sorts of perverse or environmental effects in ... and ... and it increases the risk of cancer and it's just ruin us really and that is\nOne of a a long term consequences of excessive agricultural and domestic home base reliance on things like round up\nIn the old days when they would spray fields I've always wondered if the vegetables tomatoes celery whatever sucked up those pesticides in we eat them as well did we\nAbsolutely uh we we are a victim of a you know on the one hand you have methods that were incorporated that to some extent reduced the a deleterious effects of weeds and have a insects\nOn crops and then the downside of that was that elements of the insecticide that were responsible for the destruction of these\nUh paths are also a deleterious to people\nAnd uh when it's absorbed into the crops and we continuously eat those food sources well or some of these things accumulate in our bodies they don't do pay\nSome dissipate some are not harmful to us per se unless we ingest it directly others though and this may involve the majority of such a insecticides and pesticides\nUm actually are quite harmful to us and may well be a contributing to um muted ... city and carcinogen a city and and people\n\n\nTensions

and we're talking about the bench that affect all of us were your though when when you look to him and would you called ultimately war did you mean war with like ISIS who is this something bigger coming on the rise\nOr there's something bigger coming we're going to see a global war\nI was afraid you were going to say that\nThere is a World War coming ISIS is merely upon being used by our enemies\nTo destabilize the middle east to drive a massive influx of refugees out of the middle east and of course George how many refugees are pouring into Saudi Arabia\nOr any Arab country for that matter none\nNone there you're coming to Europe they're coming here they're coming to Mexico they're coming to Canada that's where they're all going\nAnd why don't they ... none of them want to resettle or they're not being allowed to resettle not any of the Islamic country yeah isn't that rather odd\nIt sure is it sure why does\nThis question has never been raised and you know this refugee flow\nIs really the death of the culture of the west because the evidence if you just look at today's Europe these moslem\nNeighborhoods that have grown up moslem in areas within the major European cities these are no go zones for the European nationals even the police are afraid to go into some of these Islamic neighborhoods\nAnd the crimes that are being committed and there's no simulation this is an invasion and imbedded within this refugee flow George\nIs an element of fifth wave if you will that as a terrorist army some of the statistics I've seen up to Seventy five percent of the refugees\nAre adult age males\nWho would appear to just come out of either\nThe Olympics program or infantry training they are bought and in shape\nYeah it is very strange merged Beijing\nIt's a covert invasion of a cultural\nGroup\nThat is antagonistic to the west\nAnd it's and Benjamin because within that there are probably some decent people who are homeless and need to get on board they are that's the sad part of all\nWell there's no doubt that there is innocent children that there's families\nThat there's civilians and I've lived in the Arab world\nI Lived in a Palestinian neighborhood I've got personal friends that are Arabs Jordanians\nEgyptian and these are close friends of mine because I went to graduate school in the middle east mhm and George I got to tell you the I\nMhm and George I got to tell you the idea that there is this a large\nA secular Arab population that is that there's no way radicalized simply false simply for\nEven the young kids I'm Talking teenage girls are very much supportive of radicalized Islamic agenda\nI bailing they took a poll it would be overwhelming with what's going on with it with ISIS primarily\nOh absolutely and you know this has never per grade and the American press the European press you turn on our news and you see pictures of German giving cooking so small Syrian children\nAnd who doesn't want to help small children they don't show you the terrorists element is behind this but this is part of the grand strategy of inserting a terrorist\nWent into Western Europe and into the United states and we've already seen their actions one of the terrorists in the terrorist attack was an immigrating replicate\nYes so we've already got proof that there is a terrorist element at\nWork well I mean in terms of the infiltration it's a really in scheme on their part isn't it\nIt's genius and when you look inside the strategy that the enemy of America have developed and have been implementing and the amazing thing is George this has been going on since the Nineteen thirties\nSmelled the strategy that have been evolving of course over the last eight years\nBut they really fine tune their game plan and we are well down the road to World War and this latest incident with the massive outflow refugees from the middle east is just one more moment of the chess pieces on the chessboard\nHere's my concern to Benjamin that if we enter into this World War where we've always said you know nothing's really happened here on our land\nOther than the tragedy of course that we saw of nine eleven but what happens if all these militants who may be here yet their arms in their assault rifles and so while the war is going on elsewhere they crop up here to\nWell they no doubt are here in in in ... even more serious threat is what if they're equipped to\nWeapons of mass destruction well that's what they have access to bioweapons or suitcase sized nuclear weapons or ... or you only get one or two small nuclear devices to change our world forever yup\nNo question about that no question so when you went through biblical process see you picked up these events I mean most of it is it in code how do you decide for\nWell Bible prophecy is definitely in to some degree symbolic and you have to use the Bible to interpret the Bible\nBut the correct or the proper interpretation of the scriptures is not as difficult as it seems you first have to understand the central\nElements a Bible prophecy which are contained in the ... the writing is with the profit Daniel and they involve the identity of mystery Babylon which are the ... the kingdom of this world in opposition to God\nAnd there were four of them that rose in power before the first coming of Jesus Christ and they were pictured in the dream of king that you can as her wedding witnessed a great statue with a had a goal\nArms of to her than fire of brass and then legs are vying representing that a gold battleground to sell the silver king the media Persia which followed Babylon\nThe bronze kingdom Greece thunder Alexander and then the legs of Rome elected by representing the empire of Rome\nDaniel in chapter seven was given\nA vision of for king them with rising power at the end of the age and they are perfect type in shadow of the force superpowers that ruled the earth before the first coming up the lord and those kingdoms were pictured as first a lion\nOut of which came eagles wing with allied England and the eagle America it's not hard to stretch next was picture to bear it was in the position of media Persia and that the Russian ... revolution communist Russia is the bare\n... hold on Benjamin I Want to talk with you about Russia and the beer when we come back from coast to coast am\nGlucose website is now conveniently optimized for mobile devices if you're a ... you can listen to live in peace choose right on your boom just lose it goes to ... dot com on your iPhone or Android browsers news\nThat the United states of America is just a puppet of Israel demand on the street in the Arab world\nThis propaganda is acceptable to him and so you know it fanned the flames of\nOf the hatred of Israel and and the hatred of the United states and so the Russians were able to\nBasically shape and direct the various Arab terrorist organizations most and most of the leadership of all tied it was trained by KGB I today has military officers in it that are KGB officials\nAnd of course ... was the former KGB guy\nYeah exactly I mean ... who is Vladimir ... who is a creation not a creator and he's a product of the KGB\nAnd he was created is basically the new face of Russia they do this all the time George they they present their their latest new president as a a moderate who loves western movies\nRight ... favorite film as the godfather or something like that and it's all designed to create an image has not real but there are experts in it\nWhen you look at this war this war you have a timetable in mind\nWell if you consider the the production schedules for the manufacture of the the newest fifth generation weapons that the Russians are are building in in arming themselves with an I'm Talking about their new ATM system yes five hundred\nA and also the new are monitored the tea fourteen or moderate tank\nUm these are state of the art weapons this armada tank can defeat anything we can put on the battlefield\nAnd it can be operated by remote control it's the equivalent of a tiger tank in World War two the German tiger up against a Sherman tank and the Germans were just simply out gun so the tea fourteen will out gun the M A one Abrams\nThe as five hundred ... anti ballistic missile system is scheduled to be the production run will be completed by some time in twenty Seventeen so if you were to presume that the Russians want a complete all of their current military preparations\nThan you would say the war is somewhere out past twenty seven teams but events on the ground might accelerate things and in Russia is in a position even today\nA to do incredible damage it in fact could destroy the United states as a superpower in less than one hour and you know the vulnerability of our country Georgia's just it's alarming it's it's\nIt's unbelievable because the Americans have a an image that you know we are the world's lone superpower and\nYou know we demonstrated our shock and awe in Iraq you know as we destroyed a third world army using antiquated I'm old Russian equipment and then of course we fought a useless war in Afghanistan for a decade bombing mountains looking for a couple of guys hiding in a cave with a cell phone\nAnd but we've never faced another world class army and the problem with today's military balance powers the technologies have advanced to such a level when you're talking about hyper sonic weapons\nAnd everybody I'm On a cruise missiles at Russia's got into China's got it everybody's got it now\nYeah the vulnerability for the guy who's\nYou know sleeping and who is hit first is just\nYou you can't really recover from a devastating nuclear strike in what we don't American people don't understand the balance of power because there's nothing that's relevant information that's ever in our news\nI mean we get the Confederate flag crisis we get the latest police shooting we get the latest presidential gaffe by one of our goofball candidates but there's never any real relevant information disseminated through news media just designed to keep people in the dark and so they are in the dark\nUntil a tragedy occurred and then everybody panics\nAnd then we get some political spin designed to push an agenda like disarmed the public before the police\nExactly\nExactly but the truth is the Russians have been building fifth generation weapons for the last Twenty years\nSo you think though was more Russia than China in terms of doing this under the table business\nBy well I think Russia has the more high tech weapons uh China has the manpower they are definitely working together as allies\nI don't think the Russians by themselves would dare try to attack the United states you know continue to try to weaken us through surrogate means\nI'm going to need the Chinese if they want to go to direct war against America but before they actually start a direct\nWar with the United states they're going to continue to pursue their war by style you know the attack of the Arab terrorists against western interests\nThe the use of you know political propaganda to try to discredit as part of the war is a propaganda\nWar sure and to be quite candid who is winning and ... in the way he warehouse you\nYou'll find Americans today who will tell you they have more confidence including than they do Obama\nWill this obsession let me ask you this Benjamin this obsession that we have with trying to get Assad on Syria why what is what's going on\nWell if we could have removed was thought that would isolate Iran and we will be in a position to remove the religious extremists that rule Iran at that point we would be able to insert pro western puppet governments and we would have a lock on the middle east\nWell look what happened though in Iraq and Afghanistan and every place we go eat falls apart when we get in there\nYeah that great plan of bringing democracy to the middle east George Bush is great\nDoesn't we're um yeah it it was a disaster from the get go so I mean we watch\nIn Arabic language they don't have a word for liberty\nNo they don't we take out a son who's not a boys do what he was much better than his father if we teach him how are we going to have another collapse of another country\nAbsolutely and now the steady agenda of the United states was to create these pro western democracies\nI remember I was listening to a expert from one of the think tanks address a bunch of the leak out on the west coast and and explained that the Bush strategy of creating pro western democracies in place of\nStrategy of creating pro western democracies in place of these dictators that we were overthrowing was foolish and sophomore I can it's thinking and I remember everybody went\nAround the dinner table commenting about you know how foolish stupid the Bush administration was I was the last person to speak and and I said I don't think Bush is foolish stupid at all he's just pursuing another agenda and they've been lying to you\nAnd the Bush administration knew this plan would never work George they destabilized Middle East for a reason\nWell and let me ask you this too much I mean when you try to get democracy in these countries Libya Iraq\nSyria yet we leave Jordan alone Saudi Arabia Kuwait was clean the Emirates we don't touch them and there is much dictatorship is the other countries\nThat's correct\nWhether they want you to a game winning right\nThere's only one reason why we support those dictators oil and the fact that they are willing to enforce the Petro dollar\nYup that's right\nThat is it's all about the projection of economic power which allows us to continue to project military power if they wanted to change the least is control of oil you control of oil is control of the world's economy\nThey wanted to change the Petro dollars to something else they wouldn't be there anymore\nOh no they'd be gone in twenty four hours before\nWe would attempt to replace

metals have not performed wild in the last couple of years because the prices being artificially suppressed\nBy naked short selling\nIn the futures market and so precious metals have not they haven't done well but they are a great story value when the economy goes down if the United states suffers a devastating ... attack in World War\nWe'll get to a point where the dollar becomes Confederate

do with your goal when the ... and a chicken or a loaf of bread is worth more than an ounce of gold so yes it's a good story of well it's a transport wealth if you plan and leaving the country and you want to take some real money in your pocket a couple of gold coins will be great but in the time of total economic collapse\nThere won't be anything to exchange and you'd be better off owning food and and other items but those are difficult to store and they're perishable and you know it's a dilemma how to prepare for the coming days the lord and I would stress most important preparation is

hour of the actual second coming of Jesus and that's true and I I don't either but Jesus said you know you can see the weather you fools why can't you see the signs of the times\nThe prophecies were written to instruct just\nAdds to the season which these events would occur\nAnd in this hour they're all being fulfilled you know if you look at the fundamentals the reason we wrote the book the new tactics of global war was to explain in real world terms how close we are to World War and it's a complex analysis it it took an entire book to unveil\nThe bottom line is our enemies perceive a window of opportunity and a window of American vulnerability if we were to elect a conservative president in American were to change course\nThen America would be better protected five or ten years from now so for many many reasons the world is at a financial crossroads where to point of maximum\nEconomic risk the political the colors and the map are already beginning to rod and the nations of the world

outcome in the list that blessing thing her seeing\nFollow either obedience or disobedience clearly out\nThat follow either obedience or disobedience is clearly outlined scripture now the image to the beach\nAnd the world Wide Web and the current political realities that step around that herd of elephants to not mentioned it's dramatic effect and it's powerful effect\nOn whole financial currents the political in in in the global superstructure\nAnd the fact that the American people have literally self incarcerated themselves to their addiction he their worship of the image of it'd be and put themselves literally under house arrest\nAnd are being at this moment monitored by unknown party we don't have a free society you can have it without privacy and how ... how do you get around\nThe

military weapon ... carrying out all the complicated the logistics of an occupying army without any buddy having to put any boots on the ground the people like I said I saw some harsh rated their pain

respect need or the waters below the earth neither shall we bow down to worship them and that's what we've done and that's basically the image of the decent American to be the judgment upon and ...
