around the country\nIt was pioneered by my friend Dr Josh ... joins us now atlas empty and Dr Lee as gross president of doctors were patient care I'm I Am I pretty much explaining it right is there anything I'm missing and I would call this concierge care for every American\nI the only problem is Sean every time you talk about it or phones will stop ringing and we've got regular patient [laughter] failed you have a lot of them to write [noise] we we have a you know a A R O N over there and yeah we're fulltime family physicians but no you nailed it\nWell I mean so and you have all these ... now the bottom line is I think most people like me and I have friends of mine that are doctors or you know and friends of mine that will take care of me friends of mine that will take a call at three AM if I'm not feeling well\nOr which has happened occasionally in my life and these guys you know I ...

care model across the country and\nIt's a flat membership rate based on age it's insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits offices it's free tele medicine so you can call ... ... email your doctor we have no co pay for anything any procedure we can do in the office is free of charge\nStitches biopsies joined Jackson's ultrasounds heart monitors lung monitors um and then wholesale medications and labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out and let the doctors know that\nIs a better way to get health care and they support it and and that's why I think we've seen this gross so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist and say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\nThat it's working everyone you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between you know\nA horrible correct I mean we want to get out there trying to take down the path of socialized total government controlled health care you know at a time where people are able to choose their health care decisions based upon their individual DNA we're going to take a one size fits all approach to health care it doesn't make any sense and\nYou know Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump anymore than Republicans walked or health care chosen by Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so you know why are we inserting the politicians in health care with it but the government control health care system when you can have a better way through a direct primary care relationship where did not\nLeave this is the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more\nAnd you get far in theory or care because it never really was about the patient really was always about redistribution of wealth and you know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth in America you have the top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income\nOne percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners pay Ninety seven percent so\nWhat they've tried to do is ... ... for example they forced the young and generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that\nThey didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan when they would have been better off paying for one check up a year right out of their own pocket and also getting a catastrophic plan if God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer or at a young age which rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr amber\nThis is a one size fits none model um it's too expensive for young healthy people and it doesn't provide the service that older adults need in an affordable timely way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always tried to ensure everything but now we're to the point of ensuring you know\nSo he's trying to

weeks ago came out they dangle this carrot front of us and they've done it every year every two years the thing was carried out in front of us called ...\nBorder security in the bill funding the entire wall\nRight only if they win and two thousand Eighteen we had a fight where we were bloodied whenever we attended a Trump rally we were bloodied up and the reason Donald Trump was elected one of the big reasons was because he was going to build the wall\nThe reason he won the election was because he said he was going to build a wall of the reason we maintain a majority in Congress\nFor the past eight years and especially in two thousand sixteen was because the Republicans were finally going to fund the wall\nAnd with Kevin McCarthy came out who I have a lot of respect for came out a couple of weeks ago in ... in front of the voters faces I was screaming at my TV saying you've had the opportunity to present Donald Trump with no less than three spending bills and neither of those bills get it had any appropriations for\nA border wall ... why you have had the majority in Congress for eight years he won an election or two I was sixteen for building a border wall they act like

being built an wars opened up um we spent three billion three and a half billion on the new law we need the full funding you're right the twenty five million\nA but we're making progress to original is on the Supreme Court great judges on the lower courts and I I just see in America that's transforming before our eyes based on every measure consumer confidence everything in between\nUh yeah I Wish they would have worked faster they would have kept their promises better there's still a lot of work to do but the alternative is nonexistent\nThere is no alternative if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for Nancy Pelosi in the house vote for a Democrat but the Senate voting for Chuck Schumer\nUm that's it if you you know you save the house and Senate we can get a lot done we get these additional seats in Indiana North Dakota Montana if we you know hold in Nevada\nAnd we pick up a Martha mix Sally in Arizona I mean and we Claire McCaskill gets sent packing and Rick Scott wins in Florida it would be amazing holding the house is key\nIf it even if you don't particularly love your Republican congressmen it's not going to be an impeachment investigation vote that the Democrat is offering you\nSo for that reason alone I mean it's important to me will survive but I'm not saying we wouldn't not going to come on here the day after election day whining complain I'm going to just

also known as cannon fodder in the Massachusetts Senate race what happened happened Massachusetts once upon a time not all that long ago there was some simple as the prime into Elizabeth Warren\nAnd at this point here's the question Jeff deal the Republican in this race has been trailing by an average somewhere in the neighborhood about twenty five points or any chance\nThe backfires enough to move the needle even reasonably Jeff I ended up calling today an Elizabeth Warren to drop out on\nReasonably Jeff I ended up calling today an Elizabeth Warren to drop out on the back of her being

now\nBut I take a look at at New Jersey we gotta Sen Menendez he he still leading in the ... what happened what does it take you actually have to be inside of a jail cell before\nYou'll not be voted

many including potentially some folks in Massachusetts might be the first time you've even heard the guy's name but he's trying to give 'em credit\nBy the way I uh I'm Brian muddy inform article that gets me and Brian by the radio and talking about the fund that the president has had on back of Elizabeth Warren's botched rollout of her tests probably that those high cheekbones she talked about really had something to do it\nAt president out to eighty today said Pocahontas the bad version\nSometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren\nIs getting slammed she took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be one and one thousand and twenty four Indian is what he's referring to there far less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies her DNA test as useless even they don't water phoney\nAnd he continued you went down there he had a lot of fun this morning ... now that her claims of being Indian Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam an ally\nElizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetuating this brought against the American public Harvard called her a person of color amazing ... and would not have taken her otherwise and again\nThis is the important point here we're talking about the Elizabeth Warren deal it's not just oh it's another politician line it's not that number one\nIs a why it is a fraud that she has kept up her entire adult life but secondly it's not a victimless situation she committed fraud\nFor personal gain every single step of the way educationally professionally she even went in because and couples steps along her career path\nThese Ivy League institutions and identify her as a Caucasian\nShe made sure that she was always referred to and had it would have changed that she was Native American or a person of color [laughter] seriously seriously\nBut and and the president still isn't done he said thank you to the Cherokee Nation for\nRevealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas you can just see him in and hear him saying that to king is a complete and total fraud and again\nYou don't have to listen to me you don't have to listen to the president United States all you have to do take it straight from the tribe that she claims to be part of\nA tough tough for her to rally back from that one way the the president in terms of choice holy cow you had all kinds of moments today including moments in with a story Daniels now to be ready for it too was I guess horse face\nThat uh that happened today but uh we we have a bunch of other stuff obviously it's been going on in the news including the Saudi Arabian situation will be discussing that a little bit of a leader in the show we have the oh by the white Honduran caravan part whenever this as three point oh\nThat is on its way here and this was a really cool thing president when you know\nUnited States has strongly and formed a president up Honduras but at the large caravan of people heading to the U.

it that we get foreign aid to countries this girl is over and over and over and the kids want north we give them a billion and a half\nBucks per year what the\nA half bucks ... government for so they

their own talent on their own wisdom or their connection with the people and how to solve issues and stuff it\nPretty annoying\nGod Bless you that this is the first time you've gone through a name amen brother [laughter] this is one of my my all time favorite calls quite honestly it Twenty one years of doing radio this is the moment that makes my heart saying your twenty two year in science\nAnd you're in Washington DC and you're making political sense how did that happen in and do you have any friends\nI there are plenty of friends or where the revolution uh but uh uh I have to get a lot of credit and my parents are more invested a lot at me and I just have frustrating even more uh the word pedigree\nIs actually like a technical term that we use in genetics and it's because people don't really see the difference between on a more than ... oh I think so there were you pedigree for people and a more ah\nReminds me of a sad song you and me baby and nothing but anyway uh ... amazing Josh I mean really\nA longer view and spread your wisdom to as many people as possible or knows we could use it they're a great call great gal All right let's go to a Peter and Illinois All right Peter I uh I it's a tough act to follow so you've got a up your game that was a pretty impressive called there\nWell when you were talking about the brain dead voters in Massachusetts you have to remember that the the same people who after kitty Kelley left a woman to drown in the bottom of Chappaquiddick reelected him six times back to the United States Senate [laughter]\nYou raised a very important and interesting point in fact the only thing that he did get caught disqualified problem was a well ultimately his presidential bid at that point to add to your right if you can also going to get away with Chappaquiddick and you still get reelected in Massachusetts\nAh you know what I ... that is uh that that is an excellent point which by the way that that whole thing in the end it's fascinating and by the way every now and then uh because of the last name people will think that\nUh because I'm In broadcasting I Am directly related to the person who helped break that story one Roger Mudd back then and I am not I'm not a somewhere in the very ah outer lying to borrow a genetic several pedigree you might say there would be a some overlap but actually\nI Am a more aligned with them for me a ... there is one\nInfamous member of the the family than I Am directly related to him that would be Dr Samuel but\nWho may be familiar was one of the uh co conspirators in the assassination of Lincoln he was the doctor actually fix boots leg and end up having a whole kind of interesting deal where you went to the door to goes and\n... that's the story for a different day but anyway that is my relation not Roger Mudd who broke Chappaquiddick which by the way it's kind of interesting people thought after that\nOh Roger must be the Republican guy he's ... now\n... best I Know to this day he's still a Democrat it's just that he was doing his job imagined that by thing actually has some people in the news business that did their job\nAnd it got like you know yeah yeah the Kennedy was running against a quarter their captain peanut\nIt'll friendship because that was my nickname for him or in in Georgia by the way from suburban Atlanta so a nickname was always kept in being in fact one of my uh favorite parodies from many years ago was I remember the mountains and ... enjoy commercials you know sometimes you feel like an\nEgg I kind of had some ... like that you know sometimes you feel like and that sometimes you are one you know in the plenty of Jimmy Carter is that you could throw in there so anyway just a as an aside but yeah so that cleared the path for Jimmy Carter\nTo want to win the nomination again for the Democrats and get his butt whipped by one Ronald Reagan so that story at least was happily ever after for the country now too heavily out ever after for Massachusetts or for the United States Senate ah because to your point he continued to win time after time after time\nAll right so a couple of things here\nWhen we are taken to like three weeks away from election day\nThere's a lot to keep in perspective and one of the things that I Will frequently pointed out you um have hurt me anywhere along the way you you probably heard me say things like there are two sides histories there one side to facts tend to be\nPretty a particular about the facts you know you don't get any kind of like you know we're really not having a conversation about you being a Native American Elizabeth Warren because while you're not\nRight so you you can't you would that would embrace of false premise which then takes me to the premise of the premise of anything is false than anything built upon it is as well\nLast friday I introduce the sliding scale of morality which means that and people always wonder how is it you don't have somebody who under best day seems like a pretty good person and then several underway wow they really are awful and they're stabbing you in the back in their line\nAnd and that's because you have some people that have the moral compass that is stronger than others you know let's say that on our best day we're in eight out of a one through ten ten being\nPerfect which none of us are well if you're an eight even on a bad day you're probably not going to be worse than the five therefore when you're ... not going to go out of your way to hurt somebody else for your own personal benefit well then you bring it to somebody like a oh I don't know\nElizabeth Warren clearly clearly under sliding scale morality one of us both warn\nPretty a moral person because she is willing to hurt somebody that's just that she's wanting to commit fraud is that she is willing to hurt somebody for personal gain and once again\nNot a victimless crime because somewhere many times over all throughout her academic career throughout her professional career leading up to the time that she was the United states senator she took the thought\nOf it actual Native American so somebody did get hurt it's pretty moral on the sliding scale of morality that is the willingness to hurt somebody for your own personal benefit\nAh so you put it all together two sides of stories one side effects the premise and the Saudis go morality we ought to get his bat yes Elizabeth Warren\nSometimes referred to was Pocahontas\nIs a bad person who was pretty a moral and again\nSides to stories one set of facts if you want to be the person who defends taking this lot of it\nBut the story was that affects you want to be the person who ... fans taking this lot of the actual Native American and you can justify that are bringing on we'll have that conversation and we'll get to talk to the Cherokee Nation as well\nBecause they have a few things to say about it what would you say the conversation on by mud in for the great one
