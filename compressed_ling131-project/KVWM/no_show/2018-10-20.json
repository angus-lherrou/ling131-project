does all of that other stuff\n... why does that need to be part of the solution this is a very cut and dry standalone problem there are people from another country\nWho are crossing our border illegally and demanding to stay here it has nothing to do with path to citizenship for people who are already here it has nothing to do with visas it has nothing to do with comprehensive anything\nAnd if you and if your solution for these people who are crossing our country illegally and want to stay here in demand to be in our country\nIf your solution is tied to all these other things that you want voted on an approved then it means your part of the problem you're using this to get other things that you want\nI Am so against the idea of comprehensive anything reform in Congress I think

they actually before I even came to Washington and he's been so great on this issue with Spygate and with the FBI and the orders and\nAh all that jazz and I've been doing a quite a bit on that story as well\nUh I recently this week got to interview Carter Page and a quarter page is a central figure\nOf the uh Spygate scandal right\nUh and and the he hasn't done a whole lot of media but I was able to have a quite an extensive conversation he's in the news this week and I don't know if you saw this but Carter Page has filed a defamation lawsuit\nAgainst the Democratic National Committee and against a Perkins ... which is a a high powered D.C law firm that represented the DNC and by extension the Hillary Clinton campaign you know in a presidential campaign when a person gets the nomination for a party they are the de facto head of that party ... and especially I\nImplore you read Donald Brazil's book it's called hacked\nAnd it's a double entendre it's partly about the Russian thing but it's also about what happened\nHer experience taking over the DNC after Debbie Wasserman Schultz who was a mess that was completely mess and she she tells a lot of truth in this book about how awful Debbie Wasserman Schultz was and how terrible the Hillary Clinton campaign was to her personally\nAnd to the DNC\nHow the Hillary Clinton campaign absolutely ran roughshod over them a bill to them for whatever money that was coming in\nAnd they were in charge of all of it All right so so when you hear that the DNC hired a farm through a lawyer to create fusion GPS to to create the Russian dot CA\nThat apparently you know sly and Carter Page that really means that Hillary Clinton campaign\nBecause they call the shots so not Carter Page this week fired adept filed a defamation lawsuit against them against the DNC and against a ... now why did he go after those it will be I think it's because they have deep pockets frankly that's where the money is\nAnd and and had it not been for those two entities that wouldn't have been a Russian dot CA there wouldn't have been stories saying that Carter Page is an agent of the Russian government there wouldn't have been a a FIC to warrant\nA petition for and approved or to the FBI petition for by the FBI unapproved through the vice accords for them to survey all him\nTo look into every little or if is of his electronic footprint via email text messages phone calls and the people who associate with him for over a year they kept getting this are incredibly intrusive\nSpy warrants that that without a fight the war and it is against the law for a federal agency to spy on an American citizen the only way they can do it is real fights are warning and they're supposed to be a very high bar\nTo get a five to warn\nAnd to get this vice weren't they had to use the the Russian dot CA the claims Carter Page was and they in fact if you look at the applications for the warrant for the price of weren't the FBI said we believe Carter Page is an agent of the Russian government it's right there and black and white\nAnd we believe that he was working on behalf of the Russian government to alter American foreign policy through his meddling in the presidential campaign of twenty sixteen on behalf of Donald Trump that's what they said that's what they claim that's what they maintained\nUnder oath to the court so Carter Page filed a defamation lawsuit this week suing the DNC and ... with this law firm for defamation and I think about this from it\nCarter Page is either an agent with the Russian government\nAnd basically participated in a subversive if not outright treasonous acts against our nation\nDuring the twenty sixteen presidential election or he is an innocent American citizen who has been slammed in slandered into famed and used as a tool for political purposes not just by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign but ultimately by the Justice Department and the Obama administration\nHe's got to be one of the other right yet there's no in between here there's no if an or certainly no but I mean if it was a button hero it'd be a car Daschle and proportions Carter Page is\nEither as stool or a a sorry a studio ... of the prudent crumbling\nOr he is completely innocent and indeed I don't know if you know a lot about credit pays like I said it hasn't done a lot of a media he's a Naval Academy graduate he was a navy officer as all Naval Academy graduates are unless they're you know pro athletes\n[noise] he was in intelligence in the navy\nIn an officer in the intelligence division which you know usually you've got some hurdles that you have to cross to get into military intelligence in the United States Navy as an officer\nUm and after serving his time well beyond his obligated time as an officer after he got his a Naval Academy education he then went into private business and did went into\nThe energy sector he got his doctorate by the way he is it that they haven't noticed that you can't say Christine Blasey Ford's name without saying Dr Ford but one of the last time they said Dr Carter Page he's a doctor he got his doctorate\nAnd he didn't do\nHe's a doctor he got his doctorate\nAnd he didn't do dealings with energy sectors out of Russia you can argue with that if you want but understand most of his feelings were in the house in days when Hillary Clinton had to reset button when Bill Clinton was pulling down six figures for giving a speech in Moscow and when a block Obama was promising his counterpart there that\nHe'd have more flexibility after he got rid of this uh this Mitt Romney guy in won reelection so it was a different time it was a different era it was okay to do business with Moscow now he still thinks it's a good idea to do business with Moscow he actually doesn't think that putting government is as bad as everyone says that's what\nThat's not a legal he he can do that in fact it's not illegal for a business to do business with Moscow as white now as we speak\nNo sanctions and in a in a huge way against that government their individual sanctions against individuals but uh businesses can still do but we we still do business with Moscow\nYou may disagree but guess what he has the right to do that that doesn't make him a spy it doesn't make him a Russian agent now he could be don't misunderstand my point here\nCarter Page could very well be\nAn agent of the Russian government as the FBI maintained based on the Russian dot CA paid for by the DNC and this law firm that Carter Page is now suing but ask yourself something as you evaluate the story as you use your cognitive skills\nYour reasoning the brain that the good lord gave you\nAs you evaluate the story that is presented to you that the FBI and the Obama administration said Carter Page was an agent of the Russian government and has been for years and worked on behalf of the Kremlin and let him are prudent to colluded with Donald Trump to meddle in the twenty sixteen presidential election as they say that\n[noise] understand to facts number one to this day no one has charged Carter Page with anything not James Comey not Loretta Lynch not Jeff Sessions not Rod Rosenstein\nNo one at the federal level no one at the local level no one at the state level Carter Page has not been charged with a crime of any kind and they have sort of veiled every inch of his life\nFor almost two years they've got everything on him no charges number one so so think about that for a minute and then think about this if you're Carter Page and you are an agent of the Russian government and you did commit near treason effects\nBy colluding with the Trump campaign and Vladimir Putin's Kremlin to alter our presidential election and twenty sixteen if if that\nWere true why would you file a lawsuit why would\nYou file a defamation lawsuit against the DNC because you see the perfect defense the DNC\nCan defend themselves and get out of this lawsuit\nWith one very simple strategy\nIt's only defamation if it isn't true\nSo all they got to do is to prove that Carter Page is in fact an agent of the Russian government and if your quarter page why would you invite that why would you open yourself up to discovery why would you open yourself up to a full court well funded\nAnd you know there's going to be a lot of money funding their defense a well funded investigation\nInto you if you truly are an agent of the Russian government why would you do that would you do that\nAnd I again I I couldn't be an agent of the Russian government Carter Page and James Comey and Peter Struck an Andrew McCabe Loretta Lynch and and the whole team over there during the Obama administration\nWho ordered this investigation this unprecedented spying on an American

bill that the president signed on December fifteenth one point one trillion dollar spending bill to get that bill to contain the dark act\nAnd that effort to get that right or in their\nFailed because

so that the\nThat's quite an audience to draw from almost every American opposes this thing\nWith attorney Jonathan ... he's also written a couple of books global censorship of felt information and the rise of tyranny is website linked up the coast to coast day I'm dot com you have written a position paper about the FTC in biodegradable claims John tell us a little bit about that\nYes [noise] well there's a there's a case that we had called EC um bio films at the FTC and this is a true tragedy and it shows you are the degree of abuse of power\nBy federal agencies none of us want the public to be deceived but when government reaches beyond deception to determine winners and losers in the marketplace\nThat's an abuse most Americans would agree I think is not to be tolerated and that's what happened in this case here accompany the M bio films invented a product that is a a an organic additive to plastic\nAnd it's like a collar and its heat melted into plastic conventional plastic and its dispersed evenly throughout every part of the plastic and it causes all the plastic to be biodegradable it makes plastic so that when it's disposed of\nIn into the environment as long as they're bio degrading ... out there and the environment they will it here to this and help destroy the plastic so it's truly a remarkable invention and it causes things that would remain in the in ...\nIt's truly a remarkable invention and it causes things that would remain in the environment for thousands of years plastics to be able to disappear well\nRather arbitrarily and an anti a competitive way\nThis Federal Trade commission ruled that the company could not use the term biodegradable on any plastic products unless it could prove in advance of disposing of it\nThat the plastic would completely break down into elements in nature within five years after customary disposal\nAnd that standard as all the scientific testimony in that case revealed\nCould not be met not even by someone selling oranges or paper or a an apple core none of those things can break down completely in nature reliably unpredictably everywhere\nWithin five years after disposal like like a all biodegradable substances it depends on where it's disposed of\nNow what if it had been brought to let's say ten years would that have been possible\nBe more likely to broaden the Twenty years it would be extremely likely for a lot of things but the point the point here is that they arbitrarily selected five years knowing based on the testimony in the case that nothing\nCan break down into elements in nature within five years no substance can predictably breakdown and elements when disposed of in a landfill or you know if someone throw something away and it's it lands up in a place is heavily late one concrete or something may be there for hundreds of years\nNot broken into elements furthermore things don't it's it's an scientific because things don't break down into elements they break down into compounds [noise]\nAnd so the whole thing is a disaster and ah it shows just how out of touch with reality uh this Federal Trade commission is there was a dissent by one commissioner it's pretty severe dissent\nThey took the the majority in this case in the commission\nA also created this standard based on what they perceived to be a minority of some Fifteen Percent of the public public perception in other words even though they had no strong evidence to contradict the\nScience proving that this may plastics biodegradable they said that\nUh some Fifteen Percent based on survey evidence of the public thought that if something's called biodegradable it should completely disappear within five years and that's not even true but assuming that's true it's kind of insane says if you asked uh the the public uh whether or not\nThe earth revolved around the sun or the sun revolved around the earth and\nLet's say some twenty percent of the public said the sun revolved around the earth\nWell then would you prohibit people from saying that there's a their model of the solar system a was a model of the solar system because some twenty percent of the people erroneous beliefs believed that the sun revolved around\nThe earth I mean you know it's that kind of ridiculous thinking of course you don't contradict scientific fact based on a minority opinion uh you would rather say people need to be educated but not this FTC it's insane\nWhy don't they seemed to side with the public they always seem to side with big business\n[noise] well I think that it is a a combination of two things one thing uh I think\nAt least one of these commissioners commissioner Julie Brill is really so bent against the marketplace that a free market that she will always vote against any company that's brought before them all\nThrough the system is rigged here or George\nYou have the party that brings the charges is also the party that creates the rule and there's also the party that ultimately judges who's guilty\nSo in other words the commission issued the complaint against ISI em alleging that their statement a biodegradable was deceptive\nAnd then in the end the commission judges whether it's charge it's charge was correct well of course they're going to say it's correct\nAnd the long history in this thing ah since the Nineteen thirties has been when the commission accuses somebody of deception they're always right and you know in this case George the administrative law judge at the Federal Trade commission ruled in our favor\nSo they reverse their own administrative law judge to come to the determination that ISI em had violated their rule\nAnd now the matter is on appeal to the sixth circuit and we're hoping for justice there\nJonathan back to a GMOs and we're going to take calls with you just a moment how many products are truly out on the marketplace that are genetically modified\nOh my goodness George three quarters of all vegetable products sold in the United states are hollow we contain GMOs recorders\n[noise] it's it's just if you go to the grocery store and it doesn't say organic on it the probability is a contains GMOs\nYeah I I think you're probably right in the price difference between organic and ... says are a big disparity they're\nReally not that much of a disparity that's the that's the economic reason why the Monsanto's of the world and the grocery Manufacturers Association are so desperately fighting for a there's this deception bill\nOr the reason is that there's a small margin of profit uh and in order to compete even if\nThey were if they were to reveal GMOs were present people would rather pay just a little more and get organic and not experiment with GMOs in their bodies are their children's bodies\nAnd and that's the that's the rub for this or industry but rather than be honest rather than put GMOs on their product and truly compete by arguing to consumers the GMOs are okay they want to Deceive Us so that we don't know GM will\nEnd and they do we're coming back from phone calls on GMOs with Jonathan ...\nPassed dark act passed and then go to organic consumers dot org and they can learn about the bill more about information how to fight it and also they can financially contribute to the cause\nAnd they can also text nine seven seven seven nine to sign up for rapid response\nGiving up dates on this this fight isn't over we won a very major round but in January it's coming right back at us that the sponsors of this this awful bill are going to put it back into play in the Senate and January and the fight is going to happen all over again\nCan we beat them again I think we can George with your help them with the help of all these groups my goodness people really did stand up and and they you know they sent in all of the emails and called their members of Congress and\nThey sent a a you know there were radio interviews and there were articles all over the place in op ed pieces it was fantastic if we can do that again whenever this thing raises its ugly head or we can keep it down but the sad reality is boy industry has invested in this one\nAnd they really are fighting to get it passed\nTo try to keep people ignorant about what's in their foods\nWell I Love it when something like this one a plan works Jonathan huh it's it's it's wonderful\nIt's a case of David versus Goliath and David again here you know\nA one and it it it really to see that uh the the money the unlimited resources financial resources or something like Monsanto and\nGrocery Manufacturers Association all they're allowing lobby is on the hill to see them work so diligently getting this awful bill passed and the have consumers voices\nOr be the ones that prevented it is it's remarkable particularly in today's day and age a there's a lot of corruption in Washington and to see this happen word democracy work\nIs a very impressive there and\nLet us

uh uh a genetically modified foods that are permanent in the future\nAnd he said it was not that far away\nAnd he said that's not going to be a good way me and so sure enough has been forty five years I'm sitting here but I Love to just a compliment you show was like that and a sailor you hear what he has to comment about what I just say\nAll right thanks very good at Johns well\nYour guest is right this has been a a an effort by industry to basically pat and foods what they want to do the reason why Monsanto saw invested in this is if they can win there'll be able to take synthetic ingredients\nAre genetically modified plants happened those genetic modifications and then ultimately profit or to the extent they can get it to be back with us from the marketplace they can profit off of the sale of every food source\nAnd be a integrated into the market for every food so it's an attempt to take substances that otherwise or I'm patentable\nNatural food substances and transformed them into patentable substances and profit off of it enormously so it's been a long term vision of Monsanto and many other companies that are likewise engaged in this effort\nOr to bring about this transformation and long term it's really not good for consumers will result in a an elevation in the cost of foods and it will harm people because you won't have the choice\nOf getting something that's organic there right now George pushing the FDA into a rural making which it's commenced ah with willingly\nTo define the term natural and the great fear here is that the FDA like it did in protecting Monsanto and the path\nIs going to couch to Monsanto and caused the term natural to be defined in the law in a way that will allow genetically modified foods to be referred to expressly as natural on the label\nAnd I don't drink a lot of people won't it it sure will all of that\nAfter all on the label and I don't drink a lot of people on it\nIt sure will all of this is a campaign of deception because they fear that they cannot win the argument with the public that there's no difference between something that's genetically modified and something that's organic yet with all new products\nWe look to the party that's introducing them to convince you of their benefit here they want to save themselves that expands have the government deceive every body by law and and the naval themselves to remain in the market through confusion\nIt's a short sided thing when it comes to freedom of speech and and when it comes to\nUh the rights of consumers but it's a far sided vision is your as your caller mentioned of an industry that wants to profit off of things that would otherwise be available to us without that additional profit going industry\nOff the Sacramento now we go

Jonathan with roundup\nYes the ... ... or whether the or\n... or ... events pronouncing it there's a chemical compound that is is round up and that the industry represented that it would break down in nature\nProblem is that it does not break down in the nature and it causes all sorts of perverse or environmental effects in ... and ... and it increases the risk of cancer and it's just ruin us really and that is one of a a long term consequences\nOf excessive agricultural and domestic home base reliance on things like round up\nIn the old days when they would spray fields I've always

when he was down and so she was arguing that\nYou know we have a modern weapons systems\nOr that really a push against emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the often guard a twenty time speed of found a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a defense system\nWeapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back\nThey are concerned about NATO and we did violate a the initial trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves in a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion handcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps\nSmoothing over relations pulling his back from the break if you will because now\nBecause everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House\nOr that he has to be asked to appear almost overly aggressive against the Russians how much has this this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact ... said that once again this week that\nHe believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nIn Helsinki this July uh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was ridiculed reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nAh the United states I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower or not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and like\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit\nBack and see other countries take advantage of it is but at the same time he does want stability he does want to and the tensions are but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nWell let's pivot to China you mentioned the trade wars are ... and how people need to appreciate how this trade war strategy or terrorists uh against China\nThis trade war strategy or terrorists uh against China is is not just economic it's also national security and that if I Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later is this an attempt to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't uh a cheese military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two\nEconomic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest to keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so have seen somewhat of a ...\nYou know there are what six and a half percent growth in the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters are but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property and Trump says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through your company the company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let our wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants to a fair playing field arguably president chief said much the same but from a very different position so\nAre there hopefully going to meet within the month maybe in Argentina will see and if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese media is is trying to figure out Trump and just like the\nAmbassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans did manage you always want to keep your opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that\nIn this uh you call it an alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other uh components to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of ... the Russians and the Chinese becoming\nA bed may is is driven by ... in any way or are there still vestiges of a communist ideology here or is this simply about hedging many\nWell a combination of things uh I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy if it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in where the nation is as opposed to what they would call and a moral west\nAh and the things that they represent they paint the wife says what Hollywood is viewing all over the world and I said you don't want that in fact you know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nYeah and the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he\nYou know even though he ... he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in the in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know that he has adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week\nYou had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russians constitutional court who even started to you know hit\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh yeah this past march\n... they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to ah keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that food is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident in President Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponized seen everything against us you know if you look at political ... a predatory economics strategic extortion\nInformation warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there was a long history and in fact in alliance of evil I go through sixteen\nIndicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests and in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the\nRussian prime ministers have been rushing Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently in the fence ministers just met you know for teams time over the top\nSide for the interruption I gotta jump in here will pick up on the other side of the lines of evil lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis here as Jimmy hendrix taking us into the break was Bhutto child on the coast to coast and\n\nFind out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar search free would sign up this at home kind of luck dot com\nHome title luck dot com that goes\nOn news talk radio Katie WN and Katie Jay\n\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis the author of alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived\nWho do you perceive us the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard it's Russia a given\nTheir provocations but also a their military capability which they're not shy to exercise around the globe um they you know the chief of naval operations animal rich and\nYou know have said recently we were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two\nThe old Cold War with the third one or the Russians have put in place I ... in nuclear submarine and and I ... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the\nAtlantic for the Mediterranean and elsewhere\nAnd of course they're confronting us militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines\nAre they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as we know all about the allegations in justifiably are the sanctions put in place because with their interference in the twenty sixteen election and here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid terms we arrested\nOr someone of course this was a Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are bellicose and they're\nYou know claims against us and to a certain degree uh we're pushing back you know President Trump's not a you know backing down and that are given that there's you know some given some take but maybe a it's not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all\nAh and then of course you joined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China sees China Sea and of course their belt and road strategy a new issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a\nWay of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities literally across the globe you know they'll say Russia is more dangerous now China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] while we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas yeah why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic or weapons that\nAre putting puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours um but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and and the near future and are they willing to use it well put and says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nWhy the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen now wants to fund a new counter to ah that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there\nI I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO or and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with this platforms and his uh weapons\nOr that there that the mere threat the long term threat and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok twenty Eighteen joined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise\nThese sorts of indicators and demonstrate that these two nations are pushing back against the former dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can\nCome up with the conclusion I think that uh perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry\nA and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course\nThough not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that are clearly we don't have and we're trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to war maybe World War three or ...\nThat's a that's why you know Trump has been over there you know\nTrying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more and yeah you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need to all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia go in and and and disturbed that country and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one of the declaration of course that was two thousand and one\nYou have to go to war now there's only been one declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked a you know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and in the light can we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so\nAh no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's\nCapability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need that may not have\nThe wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to ah you know make these tough decision so\nUh that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in crime on next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts and NATO and and he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise]\nUh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nYou know I had better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even Poland which is a\nYou know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did with Ukraine these are all issues of great\nUh you know magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nAnd it's not going to China um we've been\nHearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador\nAnd the president has accused the Chinese of of meddling in the ... midterm elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states\nI'm the\nBig concern is I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about a Chinese made computer chips and components in electronics they may have a back door or even in US military equipment taught me about the series the seriousness of that ...\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly the Pentagon you know the\nA defense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate say look you know even in these Chinese made yeah phones you know ... you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges are ex you know our our stores are we're not going to buy certain items because we're suspect that the Chinese have\nAnd somehow you know put chips in these devices that can turn on and trance Mitt information that we don't want to lose so it's not only impacting individuals' it's impacting the institution\nAnd of course you're right you know we're in bed with the Chinese on all sorts of economic\nUh activities building the equipment that through second and third level ah contributors to a large end item end up\nIn the U.S military and that's why I think that a lot of people were concerned you know the Chinese established this year the strategic support force which she got her attention because\n\n\nIs obviously bats they killed because Yogi jak ally

side you're on coast to coast yeah [noise]\nUh and that is a major a bone of contention\nAnd of course that there are others even though we tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk practice secular rise that nation\nAir to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his his law make a viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nOr so NATO no I I don't think that they should be a member of NATO you know NATO such a complex thing for us today as we mentioned in the last hour or because you know anyone could you know call for an article five say you know the Russians are picking on me please come to my rescue\nOr do we want to be tethered in the future war world to that well\nYou know we have that alliance and to keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians and the Chinese are just\nYou know very tight now out of necessity they don't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them\nBut they want to form their own little alliance and to a certain degree this belt and road strategy of president Xi around the world and collaboration with the Russians and military exercises this is all painting a picture\nWhere you can see a divided world emerging or so to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts of you know warts and problems with it at this point might not be well advised but certainly allowing turkey into our secrets and to our\nSystems with a Russian made air defense system is not a good idea either\nNow far some for me to to um stand up for the house of Saud by\nA given that so much of the narrative of the show gave me a murder has come from the Turks and also cutter or another sort of sworn enemy of Saudi Arabia is it possible do you think there's anything to the the idea that that cutter turkey are trying to\nDrive a wedge between the United states and uh there's there are their allies the Saudis with it\nOf course you know that's a sort of thing that you know\nKind of the poker and the Internet geo political world that takes place all the time behind the scenes\nYou know who were the the people that were in the [noise]\nYou know the Saudi embassy that night so I suppose some details will eventually come out\nBut the clandestine type of operations now from one nation to another or perhaps not nation states but other activities take place unfortunately all the time you know we're in a tight spot what can President Trump to he can sanction entities and individuals\nOr even if she could show the was you know demonstrated to have been murdered as it would appear to be by a Hinch men that were under the leadership of saw him on don't know but that could be clearly we could\nCancel the arms deal but I mean we've been not only a hundred and ten billion it's far in excess of that\nAnd we have a lot of people on the ground working hand in glove with him but we risk a relationship\nWith a with the Saudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons\nAnd the packs of course distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so you you've got to look at second and third order effects of any decision geopolitically in that part of the world\nOr otherwise you end up with no one that you can go to and work with a given your your vested interests and of course the the Yemen situation we've been helping them a great deal the rea Riyadh government\nAnd trying to battle the who teased and others of course the Iranians\nYou know through proxies in that part of the world um\nI Wish it were simple it's not simple uh the world's divided and of course as we see is what I call the alliance of evil Russia and China you using the mechanisms behind the scenes to ...\nEvil Russia and China you using the mechanisms behind the scenes to variety of proxies not just the north Koreans and the Iranians but others\nI think are a air to one is going to be one of those proxies to a certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um I think the Chinese have a better idea for him\nA ... if you were in John Bolton position or you had the president's ear who knows maybe you do or what would you be advising how how is this how do we counteract this how do we step back from the brink of of war\nWell I I Do believe that a boat and we'll talk to his counterpart about renewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one we've got to do that or it's neither country's best interest to not have a I have an agreement that isn't for civil the problem is\nAnd the Russians notice that um Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty with a was violated or with their own cruise missiles and uh you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes\nOr you know we've done a lot in the open a so I think that will will get something I Know that\nYou know they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July but yeah they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas about the fact that he can meet with the world leader ah on the west Trump\nYou know in the eyes of the the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know putting his meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis just solidifies that viewpoint so if I were both and I I'm pretty you know I I talked to John Bolton before and so I I ...\nI kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he's a real pragmatist he is a tough guy yeah but he does have the president's ear and I think that that's it that's going to be the top of the agenda and of course uh he'll probably try to deal with\nThe issues in Syria and with air to want a ... of course uh the Iranian the Iranians are are a problem for Israel\nUh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know those volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs\nOr we don't acknowledge a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the Iranians are up to no good\nOr is there were to be regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that will come about by the Iranian people\nAre just getting fed up with the situation with and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become a secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the you know the military and their diplomacy or you know to\nPromote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic world view of of the the ... then I think that you find that they're not involved with the who teased and not involved with Assad ah they're less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests\nAnd perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's\nThe problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia Riyad in Tehran it's going to continue a buddy ... if you're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as his law in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging Hamas and\nYou know Palestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them or the Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going on but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another followed from that or a positive aspect of that might be a\nLiberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the habits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive affects and in Saudi Arabia is well here's van Morrison taking is into the break with a band low stairway will open up the phone lines questions and comments for lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis when coast to coast continues right after this\nMm Mm\n\nMm Mm\nDefense spending we had seven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year in another seven hundred coming up this year\nA ... is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth\nBut is it enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to salaries and that's why people often say well gosh\nYou know ... you know how can the Russians and the Chinese speech such an adversary and in competitive with us while they hide most of what they're spending on their own national security you know the answer is we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must ... five percent well we went through this sequester ration period which had just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight\nTo replace you know with your new aircraft are these antiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing with ships you know it's an incredibly expensive\nTo have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of of something that a Ronald Reagan said you know and this was you know obviously a few years ago and basically he says if [noise]\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a modern armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested a seriously on all fronts by\nA both China and Russia especially combined as they're forming a new one alliance and so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustain the investment in long term capabilities\nUh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics and artificial intelligence or even in investment in our our blue water navy uh\nUh the last couple of years have been great it's only putting it on our rights glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas good evening good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast am\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the uh Chinese tapping our electronics for information what I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed to an end date into all of these electronic chips\nSo that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future\nYou know it's it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nQuick question Steve is that possible Bob\n[noise] well I'm not an electronics are no expert however I Do understand the question and I share that concern a and that's something that I think that uh Jim Mattis our defense secretary a is concerned about that\nThings like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we get a programmable and reversible inundated electronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nOr ships and it's and so forth and we could find that this could be catastrophic so you know I I think there's plenty of caution today\nA there's a wakeup call across a certainly the U.S military and I think our allies are are joining that understanding that uh this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful\nOf the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of um winter I'm the U.S spy plane that held

point out an alliance of evil and\nGo into great detail is two and not only the threat\nOf taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections and doing all sorts of things that uh we hear about every day and this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the\nPresident's strategy and he says there's a there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's how serious it is today a and yet you know there's so much we don't know\nSo you know could somewhat take on an aircraft could take down a satellite takedown of Los

a a nation that comes from the west will not touch the ground which means it's going to be unable or an air force\nAttack or Iran is you know a huge country and that and uh but it's also states that no one will come to her aid\nAh and I find that kind of interesting since it has you know alliances with that we're actually North Korea China and uh uh Russia ah so you know it's a and this is a dual

been in this country and uh haven't went anywhere around the world and all I have never left the country [noise] and it seems extremely obvious to me\nThat uh something has happened to our government or over the last fifty something years and it seems as though that a lot of people think that uh\nUh you know they preach uh patriotism they preach or a you know go defend our our country's three I'm In a strong military\nOr in a military really is a non military anymore as far as I'm concerned it seems obvious that we're not really in control of heart and government anymore it seems very obvious and uh it seems like a [noise]\nPeople is a you know I that course the younger people don't really you know remember America is it was you know in the fifties and sixties\nAnd uh they've lost touch with me I Would they didn't lose touch it just it was it was never a savvy to them or what came before them in a [noise]\nAh you know I'm the one country his opened up prisons around the world can ...

blame Russia you know it seems to me as an American never been out of the country I was raised in Indiana\nAnd you know in the middle of this country\nWhy should I feel this way Kennedy was shot in the head when I was maybe ten years old I remember that\nI was Catholic and of course I was that was a direct assault on or you know a on me in the program and uh\nThe uh the nine eleven yeah ... you\nKnow a Richard what's his name you know\nYou said you're fading out on me again Tom so I'm I'm I'm Sorry I'm going to have to I'll respond but then I'm gonna have to want to thank you for the call well before Kennedy was McKinley and there was Garfield and there was Lincoln and there were multiple attempts or another presidents\nUm I don't know that that certainly something changed since Kennedy um but has much changed\nI think once the United states are sort of grew up in matured and became a major player certainly after the civil war or after the first World War and began to\nEngage in multilateral trade organizations and ah then all of those things that some of the founding fathers sort of more than ... foreign entanglements I think what they called they called it\nA this these sorts of\nUm games dirty wars and so forth are almost\nUm games dirty wars and so forth are almost inevitable when you become entangled in in uh in other countries' business and and you put yourself out there or\nYou end up fighting wars on foreign lands so that those words don't visit upon your own soil\nAnd yes it's it's nasty and it's dirty but one thing that the United states has I think that most other countries don't have and that is the power of redemption\nAnd I'm I'm a Canadian so I'm a bit of an inch or low over but I have strong emotional ties to the United states and I believe strongly in the idea of the United states and I believe in American exceptionalism\nIt hasn't been fulfilled perhaps the way we'd like it but the United states yes they\nThey have been involved if you talk about to lend day in Chile and the overthrow the government in ... in Iran and in in the in Nineteen fifty three and in Guatemala and so forth\n... ... to the United states most other countries that have the kind of a power and responsibility at the United states has to do the same thing\nBut they don't reflect upon those those dark chapters in their history the way the United states does\nThey don't talk about it on public forums they can't they're not allowed\nAnd there was no redemption at least in the United states that exists we reflect we're right\nWe Sean and we try to make ourselves better and I think we should all be thankful for that Tom thank you for your call or Doug\nIs east of the Rockies in the great state of New Jersey Doug welcome\nThank you very much our ... I'm well thank you\nI'm Glad to hear that I'm going to go a little bit off topic here um I tried to get some time ago a it was a guest host and such so and ah they were talking about climate change in a warming and\nThe ... the ocean now I'm not a uh Iraq can go either way with the pro or con on a global warning or anything like that\nBut ah they're talking about how the season the oceans are rising which uh that is the fact that is a measure of all they can tell that but I was wondering I\nNever heard anybody take into consideration\nWater displacement every year we put\nBillions upon billions upon billions of vessels in the water whether they be military whether it be giant or multiply a million dollar a cruise ships\nSubmarines we're thinking I'm subways out here on the east coast to make artificial reefs we're thinking old military now this is taking up space\nAnd uh I Know that Hawaii has been having a volcano that hasn't stopped for some time and that's also taken a while about taking of water but it's adding land and uh I I think if a if anybody a you know of a an able to get that you've a hat on or hurt speak\nAbout this uh ever brought up the theory of water this place\n[noise] uh\nNot that I'm I'm aware of um I I think the type of\nSea level rise that they're talking about isn't about you know the the the the ice melting that's in the water because\nYou know what happens when when ice cubes melt in a glass of water doesn't overflow I'm Talking about bits of ice shelves breaking off and so forth but\nWater levels sea levels have been ... rising for a very long time [noise] ah we were in that kind of a\nTrans glacial period we're coming out of an ice age we're still technically in an ice age we have ice at the north and south poles we're we we haven't always had ice at the north and south poles so\nIce is melting were coming out of a a glacial period and water levels have been rising and will continue to rise and I think it's normal but water displacement\nAh we'll have someone on to talk about that thank you cat Stevens taking you're going to the break with city you're on coast to coast more open lines when we continue to\nShow to know [noise]\nThe\nOrchard yeah and there there are many days my ailment there are many and I thought something very important\nAll right what did you see I got up for one thing I've been so much and I went through or damage of emotions\nFor one thing that have been in business so much\nAnd I went through or damage of emotions I was listening to old news or eighties even are wrong and they'll say hey look at too quickly the two little girls that have on my wall there that can be from saint Jude too long ago Gracie and ruined\nAnd they looked at them and I just kind of broke down and I've never been there been Christian whole life and I've never been able to handle\nThe pain is it like you came home home today to me and\nEven the live forever I have that's terrible world problems and I said father and there's a picture of Jesus Christ other\nThese little ones cannot suffered more this cannot go on ... I was just all this ... this was going to go on for years and decades and decades hundreds of years and I said it can't go on\nAnd I felt the promise I looked at the pictures I couldn't believe it I haven't smiled and days and I smiled and the father was saying to me it's not going to go on\nWhat's going to end it if people just don't know that is great and very soon they are they're going to be standing in place was that we are going to be standing laying are sitting in the place\nAnd they're they're not going to know that comes upon them if they're not ready for me\nAnd um that that's

line\nWith the ... maniacal money horrors of the world there are going to bring it about because they have said China and Russia too although Iran of course the satellite state and they've said you

and yellow and wild west hero taking us into the break on coast to coast am\nWell I'm I'm only\nYou'll see a giant halo falling over the football stadium that day a giant circle and this guy or people standing in the stands not show up staying in the stands commenting ... a halo for ... for Denver it's the same game that all the three six team showed up from John three\nSixteen in the Bible people have yes we're in young people who\nPainted drunk three sixteen on his eye patch is three years before that game when ... when he wanted to be the a championship game against Oklahoma\nFor three years to the day he he played the Steelers he had the halo showed up he had John three sixteen and passing three sixteen yards thirty one point six average per catch even CBS carry the game the rating for the game was thirty one point six percent was the highest rating again go for the game but I haven't met right now as they were kind of position thirty one minute ... seconds\nThe only interception was third down at sixteen ... burger through the interception ... did a white horse to the top of the stadium and the one in the ... mile high death the bronco de Jesus when you see it as a thing of the stadium you see this guy in the clouds above it with a white horse well Jesus returns in horse with clouds who has a symbol red revelation\nOf Jesus return on the lake or some revelation the opening kick off and the miracle opening kick off because they couldn't happen but I won't tell you that 'cause they'll take the long but anyway go ahead and I I wanted to get those facts out to be for my phone\nCut off [laughter] it's ... it's remarkable and I I remember some of that not all of the details now he is he not in the New York Mets a farm system now do you like football and he's in baseball now like any\nYeah you know what's really interesting in baseball to this really fascinating but I mean the other is kind of like a when you see the halo you know that you know there's a symbol read Jesus is coming back you know there there's no doubt that the oldest coincidences were not coincidence that there are too many even the opening takeoff hit the cross bar in the back of the end zone which is located tenure to sleep in the end zone Ricky shade back thirty yards\nBack toward the kicker and put itself in the twenty to start the game where you put put it for a touch back there is no way that could happen that ever happening again anywhere near you can do that but it happened the beginning of that can nobody knew was going to be a blessed game until I Want to go to one in touch them or one plane over time the marriage Thomas cut the eighty or pass and overtime just one player was over\nIn the overtime he was born on Christmas twelve twenty five Nineteen eighty seven he ended the game the people that are three hundred and sixteen\nYears ago there in the baseball\nAnd yes he is and and he a set of continuing on and that in that realm he was on the pitchers man I Believe one game and he saw someone struggling in the in the stands\nI'm not sure whether they were having grass and he was getting ready to sign on ... any of them had epilepsy feet or something\nOr or where he I thought he may be resuscitated this this individual but he well he he would have\nBeen over in prayed for them and the guy all of a sudden came back he got his breath and he was choking he couldn't get his breath the ... are you going to pass out and maybe die I don't know but then he he bent over touch the guy's leg and then maybe the prayer\nAnd um people were standing around lady couple of ladies standing around one of them are with the kid with winter on tweeter similar ... you know one of those tax that\nShe thought she may be witness the miracle or because the guy was a you know two paramedics or something there and they couldn't\nGet either be able to breathe he's an incredible individual and grab one and I think I'll tell you\nOne more thing really interesting he he he when he played for the Mets have paid for the Mets minor league team when he played the river dogs who are to New York Yankee team back last year round the and the gym he played that team and they mocked him every every play they go up to bat the plague hallelujah chorus music they show him on the scoreboard crying when he cried when he lost the Alabama\nIn the in the playoff game I guess and he also the issue of the river dog just people will remember do with the black patches and guy jumping over him you know mark and John three sixteen the bottle\nBut what happened later in that year people last like two or three of those games I Believe the later in the year when the big team was when they were winning three games to two or whatever all of a sudden they lost the third game and the fourth game and the Astros win and instead of them\nAnd so God remembers you though [laughter] that was more and more and more important than those little ping with people on the minor league team with the river dogs that was the major league team didn't get in and they didn't get it and then she or either so maybe there's a little thing going on there with God and the you know the market three on three sixteen you know in the ass right before God you know I'm just saying that you know it was right\nThe cosmic courts are now in session build great story thank you thank you for that [noise] uh let's say Hi to John in Baltimore east of the Rockies John good morning\nRichard on hold for a while glad to be on the phone with you thank you for your patience\nThat's okay I was I'm listening to

F. R. B. ten ten so there you go\nA coming of an hour's one and two lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis or as we say up here in cannot stand left tenets colonel Robert McGinnis retired he says America is locked in a new kind of Cold War with the Russians and the Chinese the Russian Federation\nThe Cold War with the Russians and the Chinese the Russian Federation under a populist off the authoritarian leader seriously threatens the west through cyberspace and military ... thanks to that country's heavy investment in sophisticated mass killing weapons\nThe People's Republic of China\nIs a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on rapidly growing his nation economically and militarily and together China and Russia collaborate to dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become\nThe catalyst that leads to the prophetic and times lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis author of alliance of evil is here for hours one and two\nHours three and four and let's see what shall we do I thought maybe we could exchange some veal recipes because he was absolutely nothing going on right [laughter]\nI actually remember slow new gate news days back in the nineties when we would sit around and say wow there's nothing going on well that certainly isn't the case these days when was the last time we had a slow news day\nOpen lines in the last half hour of this audio transmission of course there's the murder of Saudi journalist ... there are migrants on the march from Honduras there is the mid term elections in on the horizon we could talk about all that stuff but but\nLet me just throw this log on the fire and I think it's the single most important question out there even more important than who wins the house who wins the Senate\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because they want to rise again they want to be a great power again\nAnd they do have them the main through their nuclear arsenal and of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that\nYou know we have a modern weapons systems or that really a push against the emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the oven guard a twenty time\nSpeed of found a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a\nSystem weapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back\nThey are concerned about NATO and we did violate the initial trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves in a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course ... but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion handcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps\nSmoothing over relations pulling his back from the brink if you will because now\nBecause everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House\nOr that he has to be asked to appear almost overly aggressive against the Russians how much has this this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I think that it has and in fact ... said you know once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nIn Helsinki this July uh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was the ridicule reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nAh the United states I I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower or not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and like\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of it but at the same time he does want stability he does want in the tensions are but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nWell let's pivot to China you mentioned the trade wars are ... and how people need to appreciate how this trade war strategy or ...\nTo appreciate how this trade war strategy or terrorists or against China is is not just economic it's also national security and that if I Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later in this and the camps to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't uh a cheese military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two economic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest\nTo keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so have seen somewhat of a death\nYou know there are what six and a half percent growth in the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters [noise] uh [noise] but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property and Trump says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through your company to company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let our wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different positions so\nAre there hopefully going to be within the month maybe in Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese media is\nIs trying to figure out Trump and just like the ambassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans advantage you always want to keep\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that\nIn this uh you call it an alliance of evil yeah between the Russians in the Chinese and perhaps there are other uh components to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of ... the Russians and the Chinese becoming\nUm the bed me is is driven by ... in any way or are there still vestiges of a communist ideology here or is this simply about hedge many\nWell as a combination of things I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy as it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in where the nation is as opposed to what they would call and a moral west\nAh and the things that they represent they paint the wife says what Hollywood is viewing all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact you know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nYeah and the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he\nYou know even though he ... he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in the in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know the he has adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week\nYou had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russians constitutional court who even started to you know hit\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh yeah this past march\n... they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponized seen everything against us you know if you look at political corps and a predatory economics strategic extortion\nInformation warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there was a long history and in fact in alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators\nIn which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the\nRussian prime ministers had been Russian Chinese prime leaders have been meeting here recently in their defense ministers just met you know for obtain time over the opposite\nSides of the interruption I gotta jump in here will pick up on the other side of the lines of evil lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis here as Jimmy hendrix taking us into the break was due to child on coast to coast am\nShall I put out and I think if I let her get out just down the mail or credit card again you just you know I Need to stay here down them my story and get more than you're free\nTo go\nOn news talk radio Katie WN and Katie Jay\n\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis the author of alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived who do you perceive as the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard is Russia a given\nTheir provocations but also a their military capability which they're not shy to exercise around the globe um they you know the chief of naval operations admiral Richardson\nHas said recently we were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two\nThe old Cold War with third one or the Russians have put in place I ... in nuclear submarine and you know a ... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the\nAtlantic but in the Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course they're confronting us militarily\nOr in the air or they're back off our coastlines\nAre they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as we know all about the allegations and in justifiably are the sanctions put in place because with their interference in the twenty sixteen election and here recently or in the twenty eighth team that terms we arrested\nOr someone of course this was a Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are bellicose and they're\nYou know claims against us and to a certain degree or we're pushing back you know President Trump's not a you know backing down and that\nGiven that there's you know some given some take but maybe\nIt's not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all ah and then of course you joined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China sees China Sea and of course their belt and road strategy a new issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a\nWay of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities literally across the globe\nYou know they'll say Russia is more dangerous or China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] well we've anguished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas so why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic weapons that\nAre putting puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours um but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and and the near future and are they willing to use it well put and says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nYou know why the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen\nUh wants to fund a new counter to ah that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there I I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nOr and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons\nOr that there that the mere threat of the long term threatened and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok ah twenty eight team joined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise\nThese sorts of indicators demonstrate that these two nations are pushing back against the former dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can\nCome up with the conclusion I think that perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry\nA and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course\nThough not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that are clearly we don't have and we're trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five of course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to war maybe World War three over in stone yeah\nThat's a that's why you know Trump has been over there you know trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more and yeah you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need to all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia going and and and disturbed that country and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one declaration\nWe could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked or you know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and in the light can we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so [noise]\nUm no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's\nCapability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need that may not have\nThe wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to ah you know make these tough decision so\nUh that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in crime on next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts and NATO and and he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise]\nUh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nAnd I had better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even Poland which is a\nYou know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did with Ukraine these are all issues of great\nUh you know magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nLet's talk about China um we've been\nHearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president has accused the Chinese of of meddling in the ... midterm elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states\nI'm the\nBig concern is I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about a Chinese made computer chips in components in electronics they may have a back door or even in US military equipment talked me about the series the seriousness of ...\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly the Pentagon you know the\nA defense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate say look you know even in these Chinese made yeah phones you know ... you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges are ... you know our our stores are we're not going to buy certain items because we're suspect or that the Chinese have\nAnd somehow you know put chips in these devices that can turn\nOn and trance Mitt information that we don't want to lose so it's not only impacting individuals' it's impacting institution and of course you're right you know we're in bed with the Chinese on all sorts of economic\nUh activities building equipment that through second and third level a contributors to a a large end item end up\nIn the U.S military and that's why I think there are a lot of people are are concerned you know the Chinese establish this year the strategic support force which she got her attention

and VH cloud is a subsidiary here in the United states\nSo how young were you from originally Middletown New York how many brothers and sisters I have one sister she's four years older than me and how young were you when you were taking things in the next level\nNext level um\nI I Love to a teacher and and I get really an idea what you were tinkering with as a kid so as a latch key kid I could really do whatever I Want to do their watch TV or go outside I was always outside build go carts I Would find\nOld wood and carpet in a wheels and make go carts and and go down big hills where I got a question what what's making go carts as a kid has to do what's that have anything to do with you building this organization known as ... each cloud\nI think it's all about innovation yeah especially in technology as a programmer but if you don't innovate you die and instead of just sitting inside watching TV when really have a video games but it was before Atari I I went outside and I would find things and build things alright Lez\nNow understand that a mom and dad divorced when you were two years old but the impact that have on yeah\nI it uh it it was tough I Love my parents very much and saying goodbye was probably the hardest thing my sister was my time with my pillar during those times in kind of going back and forth between my mother and my father\nYou know and and who fill the role if any one as a male role model for you [noise] so\nMy father was a big part but but every weekend my father he didn't have much money so we'd go to my grandparents his father a colonel red reader who taught leadership at West point Vince Lombardi mentor a while it was just amazing to grow every weekend with red reader\nI can only imagine what impact did he have on your your grandfather a\nReally that no no no no glass ceiling I mean the uh he was one of the fence somebody's mentor a health plan and and lead the invasion and Utah Beach in D Day and and just seeing what was possible if you set your mind to something and and worked hard for the hard on you from one standpoint\nI think he was hard on everyone go Simone uh\nSome of the things you have you had to walk in the snow a about a mile everyday to school\nSo yeah my kids don't know how good they have it right they are we walk to school it was about a mile uphill both ways because there was on the other side of the hill so I can say that in New York at through the woods event and I don't think you're allow you'd rather go to jail if you allow your kids to walk in elementary school\nAbsolutely how did that in fact what you do now essentially is it's like a walk in the snow essentially being a multibillion dollar company\nAs a CEO and being a leader you have to do things that people are unwilling to do and you have to bring everyone along so so it is hard and you have to have the wherewithal to see it through David in agreement you mentioned it to your your mother had a major impression on you give us an example\nMy mother was a nurse and she just graduated from nursing school not a full college and she works sixty hours a week we had a Christmas the day before Christmas Thanksgiving the day before Thanksgiving and and she could have done much more but she works sixty hours to make it happen and there was definitely a role model on hard work Chelsea\nLike you've had really great high ... examples in your life can you tell me when did you actually start making money for yourself\nSo when I was in fifth grade I started bringing my lawnmower a door to door knocking on doors if I saw your grass was long a long I waited a knock on your door and then have you uh use my services\nAnd if you how are you different I ah definitely attention to detail or a very thorough job making sure that I paid attention the next time that it needed\nI had a very thorough job making sure that I paid attention the next time that it needed to be cut and I I always did the best job that I thought anyone could do\nYou think about the ability and being there are those things that you took on the first to what you're doing now\nYeah without a doubt it's actually a detriment or you know when I first became a manager allowing people to fail and not going in and saving them because I always wanted to do the right way so I I've grown a long way because of those learning some\nAre Rob so it seems like the influences from your parents\nAnd your grandfather are um one is based on hard work the other one is based on leadership and puts the things together what does that taught you about glass ceilings and how high is up [noise]\nSure I I think that you have to understand right they always say shoot for the stars you hit the moon but you have to know where you're going you have to have a goal after a goal and uh but it unless you work hard and um and have the right mind said being willing to fail or you'll never get there David\nHow old were you and you uh did you first computer programming so when I was in sixth grade I walked in there was a computer there and I sat down and started doing a basic computer language and wrote my first comes a computer program and loved it ever since\nThat represent was a sense of accomplishment or was it was it freedom what is the value that you took out of that\nI Love creating a and I love working with my hands and it was a great combination of creating something with my hands are in um in innovating at the same time scale or you think um [noise]\nI was wondering what sport to play when you were in high school so I played football and track and I was a ... an all American athlete and play in college as well\nAs standing in a position do you think do you play that actually made it to all the way to the c._e._o. that you are today\nSo I every position team captain working hard I wasn't the quarter back I was in office of guard and outside linebacker and so working with the team to make the team win not being in the limelight and making sure that\nThat if if there's a team member that's lacking off going over and making sure that they they show up on time and and work as hard as you are being a good example for the team to happen a lot of responsibilities similar sponsor though is the CEO today\nYeah definitely and uh it's a little easier being a CEO because they work for us and he kept him they don't work for you you have to coerce them into doing the right thing Rob you have a question there yeah I wanted to explore a little bit more about your relationship with your sister when you were younger\nYes so it was tough it is I think it was harder on her when I was too and it was kind of what I knew a having divorced parents or she was six and I think it hit her very hard but yet she was always the pillar for me are you married or single\nI'm happily married for ... kids uh-huh would you know what what what was the effect of your relationship with your sister on your nowadays when you know these\nAre just having someone that you can trust and believe in uh definitely when I looked for my partner I'm Casey my wife she she is just an amazing a foundation and pillar for me and so it's great to have that in my life so you know you could trust women I can definitely chose women Chelsea\nYou mentioned earlier about glass ceilings empire success plan was you know being willing to sell can you tell me if you've had in have ever came out\nWell how have a definitely a lot of different failures I think I'm\nUh from school I I I never was forced to get the best grades I just did enough and so at a young age I could fail wherever I uh I wanted to I didn't have someone always over top of me\nAnd I'm being able to fail so many times allowed me to figure out what kind of personality and what kind of person I wanted to do when I Will be and when I grew up most of\nWhat was the challenge of growing up with the last name that you have that have so much historical significance\nDefinitely a lot of pressure I think until I had children I really didn't know what I wanted to be I always thought that I wanted everyone to know me and lead me and write books like my grandfather but once I had ... children and held my daughter in my arms looked at her eyes I I my saw life differently what are you talking about what do you mean\nChanged my world I saw my purposes ... someone that could affect my child's life and what a great responsibility and opportunity that his\n... used to remember that I Do many years ago was that that was twelve years ago mhm so you remember your birth your daughter's birth\nYeah my daughter's birth than the first time I held her and looked at her and her eyes and what was your wish for her\nHappy healthy life and um I wanted to do everything I could to make sure she had that so you didn't want to define what you would you want it to find out and supported I wanted to give her the capability to have confidence in herself and uh and it was where she could have wings to do whatever she wanted website address a Bouvier H ... cloud dot com\nTo Julie real quick um and you mentioned that you were an only child and a you've got lifelong friends from fifth grade and now your soul sister so what effect do you think being an only child\nHas a on creating that support network\n[noise]\nReally it's really the loyalty and

into this business taking people's stuff and getting rid of it for them\nWell it actually started about four years ago and I'm actually the CFO of a larger company and we were looking to uh diversify operations and we looked into a lot of different businesses are and we like the model that business model of the junk remove all business\nUm it seemed like a perfect fit for us ah we had a customer base of over twenty five thousand customers\nWe were already in homes doing a HVAC fuel oil delivery uh we did plumbing and water treatment and we did swimming pool services so we have a nice customer base we were already in people's homes\nWere business or that had been around about Seventy five years we're a family business and again it just seemed like a a perfect fit for us it was another service that we could offer our customers\nAnd um it it taking off from their subsequently went from our customer base who are working with realtors and banks and property managers in his state sale

forgive me do not turn off a I've got to Egypt this is true that an Egypt next week so I Am both in denial and on the Nile okay I did it that was my birthday present myself\nAnd today we ... with us Ken Fernando ... is the CFO of Joe junk and I know that\nI was Twenty years ago you wouldn't even have been interested in what I'm Talking about and now you're hanging on every word why because they get into that age we have to get rid of our stuff and some of it is just not working out the door and we can't even get habitat for humanity to get rid of plus it's a very emotional issue\nAnd we don't get to it I Can't tell you have any of my private financial clients just last night she said to me she's a reporter that she's really not because that they uh\nShe said to me she's a quarter now she's really not because that day I an actual diagnosis I Know what she meant she had kept a lot of stuff and her husband was laughing but he was laughing with tears in his eyes and it's very hard for them to get rid of their stuff emotionally\nSo go over the cannot can't send us in these waters all the time I and you talked about sensitivity in uh in hiring people so what what's your take on this why do you think it's so hard you've seen this ... process over and over again\nYeah and it it it's a very emotional situation this visit their life\nI mean in many cases uh they've lived in these homes fifty sixty years and whether they're downsizing are moving to assisted living or moving to Florida or what have you um it's sort of the realization of the final stage um you know they've raised their children here\nUh they've gone to churches and synagogues here uh\nThat it's their life and now you're leaving it and you're moving on so I think that's the most emotional part of it it's it's it's it's changed something is going away from something there used to and er it's there's some uncertainty and it and again we do see\nIt at the Duke it took university actually did a study they sat famous called the attachment study and it was that how we get attached to certain things and so organizers people who who really walk you through or even people who work with the borders you'll see it on the television shows and everything [noise]\nUm [noise] they they say oh keep something you know you have five thousand pez dispensers [laughter] for\nIt and keep it from your experience just on the average day of your professional life you have any advice for people in in getting over this berry of getting rid of stuff\nYeah uh it's pretty much what exactly what you said there's no reason to keep every Mother's Day card that your kids had sent you but keep four or five uh don't keep every report card that they have a keep a couple\nUm pictures are now can obviously be put on thumb drives and CDs where you could get rid of a boxes and boxes of photo albums pick out the good ones and put them on a CD you know use their you still have the memories there just in a in a different form\nAnd um again that's very hard\nFor people yeah I I have a ... M situation and then maybe an hour I'm thinking this up because there are probably people listening with my husband and his sister both have a I called the disposal personality they will get rid of anything at any time\nThey have no need for anything and I've never seen anything like it\nOpen up to us take a bag everything and then while this might be I don't know I don't want it\nNow I have seen couples with those two issues where he usually him but in in our family's case it's gender neutral get rid of anything they don't care and usually the wife wants to keep this or that not always I have a couple of clients the other way around\nDo you see that and does it did is he fights when and what disagreements here they're getting rid of stuff\nEvery day [laughter] it\nJust seems that every couple whether it'd be\nThe husband who wants to keep or the wife who wants to keep a they seem to disagree on what they should keep and what they should throw away and you're right there's someone who\nJust wants to get rid of everything who doesn't see a need for it\nAnd there's usually someone else who has a sentimental attachment to things or perhaps we'll still needed at some point um maybe the kids will needed that type of thing but uh usually there is a situation where you do have\nCompeting opinions as to what should go and what should not go and we do see that every day for sure\nHow he you know one example of how it gets resolved\nWell or is that all you know prepare them and tell them\nHave your conversations before we get there [laughter] okay so again cause you know yes exactly um and usually they have the again they they find some means some mechanisms to compromise\nUm but uh you're you're right it's it's it's usually hardcore one way and hardcore the other way that a lot more than someone wants to throw away but just the fact that they've called us they've made that first step and they know that things have to go so um but\nYou know there are there will be times where someone will schedule at them and say you know what I spoke to my husband and we need to cancel or we need to wait a couple of months or we need\nWe need to put this off for a while so that does happen to\nYeah you know one of the things as being mentioned yesterday and I think he's a great is the worst thing you can do is last minute ah sometimes it does a great Buddhist saying when the student is ready the teacher will come\nAnd sometimes you keep things for years and years and years and then something happens like there's a flood\nOr God Forbid if ... or you will you do move and you must get rid of everything so I I just request everybody do things as as calmly and early as possible so that you don't make mistakes\nThat's what I hear your new mentioned that go ahead\nI say the the last week of the month is always very very busy because people are either leaving their apartments are moving and that tends to be a big a big week and we get so many calls where people say I'm closing tomorrow at ten o'clock and you come over and help me well that's a little tough to do\nSo definitely planning ahead as the\nYou know this is interesting because I it is not a Christian I thought to ask until this minute is your business seasonal should people realize that there are certain times of the year that they they may have to wait and they'll be in trouble if they ... you have also a seasonal business\nWell it's seasonal from the standpoint of we run\nThe same way um I Would say a real\nThe company's realtors or operate you know very busy in the summer of trying to get the kids in before school so a lot of people are moving um and that seems to be a hard time a little slower around the holidays people aren't thinking about moving or about cleaning out their\nHomes and so on but you\nKnow there are situations with older people where it is it a year round business but I Would say that ah between April in October is the busiest time but uh so\nThat folks if here if you need it if you need to remove all during that period book it early or we come back the next segment to the thing that most of you may have on your mind right now which is mom and dad um you know\nThe kids don't want you and then we'll be back me really\nSuch an emotional time for these people and then I think that comes across and like I said I\nI always encourage people to read the reviews because that'll that'll tell them more than I can tell them\nI'm Sorry go on it's it's it's very close\nThey're pointing to them so the next to the issue of sensitivity we may have used that word eight times already because it's true\nAh I tell you a funny story before we delve into this friend of mine was complaining to me she has three sets of China and they're very very valuable to her in her mind and she has eight children and nine grandchildren more\nNobody wants to China so she says to me this is terrible the kids don't want it or what am I going to do and then a few months later she saying to me that she has to take care of her mom's stuff\nAnd I said what are you going to do with it she says I'm throwing it all out she didn't see\nThe thing that she was a child she didn't want to be burdened with anything of her kids but when she was the the mother she wanted to them all to take everything and look at their homes and use it and and fulfill her dream that this was important China\nSo we're all like that this is is that you know a typical uh and I know that you do move or for its sometimes you're asked by people who are not the owners their kids or even grandkids what's the difference say what should should the older adult child\nNo not that sensitive to hear\nWell you're exactly right most of our clients are actually children I'll I'll call them kids but they are now in their fifties and sixties and they are helping their parents or move out\nAnd they have to realize exactly what you said that\nUh what's may not have sentimental value to them does have sentimental value to their parents okay and they have to realize that\nBut again there's a there's a a border line there because you either are downsizing you're moving to a smaller location and apartment assisted living and and this stuff has to be done\nUm you know we had a client just yesterday or a woman in the fifties who was helping her parents and she came out crying and she was she said I have to go she said this is so much more emotional than I thought I Can't believe what it's doing to my parents and\nAt that point or she did understand what it was doing to the parents but\nUm it it's a situation where again there have you have to reach them compromise and say look maybe we could keep a few of these things but there's really no value to them and there's really no use for them and it all goes along with the the whole aspect of\nYour your taking away a piece of their life I mean there's no doubt about it and um it it's it's again it's it's realizing that this is probably the final chapter this was probably the last move this is probably the last time they'll see these items and um it's it's it's a sex or devastating so I'm Sorry\n[noise] yeah I have a couple of suggestions list is is a wonderful book or that or should be read a little bit more often I think it's called how to say to seniors and it's by a male nurse and he's very um a ... it's important to him\nThat people speak to the guys because usually they don't or they just don't think that men have any attachments stuff so that's usually all these studies and everything is for for women and women do outlive their husbands a lot so a lot of the moves are women understood that his name is solely\nAnd uh it's it's on Amazon's called how to say to senior so it does help a lot in talking to people but the second thing is no your parent as a person\nIs is not so easy because even if you're an eighty years old and your parent is a hundred and seven and we actually had that he had a Seventy eight year old inheriting money and we asked him whether or not it was from his brother he said no my dad died and\nHis father was a hundred and seven so mad at you still the child's us this story is still the child\nSo UCR person as ... as your parents so you think they're strong and use the you know and and and everything and uh and you don't want to see them as having weaknesses know who they are trying a little bit to step back and see them as a person\nQuick story when do my husband's a dad went to assisted living he didn't want anything he took his wife's picture and he was out the door\nAnd easy and my mom moved from a a home to an apartment it was an assisted living but it was a tiny farm we got a decorator for her because she was so motion all about it she had thing she loved so much\nThat it had to fit in and so we worked on getting it fit in and two of those things are in my house to this day don't ask me what I'm going to do with them or my friend who's also decorated looked at those things and she said oh I Know that furniture I called one mom and I called the er the pop\nThat surgery she called mom and pop this is the kinds of things that you drag around with you for sentimental reasons when we come back\nYeah we took a little bit more about this and we're talking about one aspect of moving your junk that very few people talk about\nAspect of moving your junk that\nPeople talk about that is when they move it to a new place and it's supposed to be brutal clean boy it's not all you're getting a great deal on a piece of real estate because it's for closure and you walk in there and oh my goodness oh what\nCan you give 'em at bad that I have to have a chance to help you know when they really have the right than not really an appropriate

that and a two and a half gallon jug and it's going to be expensive he said by this instead it's going to be cheaper and he said by a bottle of something called Amway L. O. C. I said and whale overseas yep he says what you do is you take a one gallon watering can\nOr you can take a two gallons of water and can\nAnd you mix three hours you put water in first whatever you do put the water at first\nAnd he says then you add three ounces of Amway L. O. C. for each gallon of water\nI said okay he says and then you just he says you walk out in you water the yard you take your time he says it's probably going to take it a whole bottle to get your front yard done he knew my front yard and he says probably going to take the whole you know bottle to get it done he said but put that down\nAnd he says as soon as you're done with that water the yard as soon as you're done with that\nWater the yard I said okay because I got to tell you when it would rain it was like the water would beat up and just run away I mean some of it would penetrate but it would just beat up it was like I said it was like concrete even after I took that pitch fork out there he was laughing when I told them about that but\nI did that I went out and it actually took two bottles of Amway L. O. C. I guess I was a little heavy handed and ah by the way\nIt at that time buying Amway hello see from an Amway distributor at the time my cousin lives in Alabama so I was going to buy it from him\nBut I found out my uncle was a distributor and my uncle said yeah he said but I'm going to have you buy it from my guy I said OK says my guy lives in done enough time I lived in ...\nI call his guy up and his guy is he he want to have me come over to the house and you know but I Know I just want to buy this stuff\nAnd we distributors are real tricky about that they try and get you to come over to the house and then they show pictures a yacht that's what they do but uh I said no I just want to buy the stuff so I was able to go buy this stuff\nFrom this Amway direct distributor as it turns out he had it all over his garage so I bought I bought it for yourself you become a distributor I Know I just want to buy this stuff\nSo I bought you know the bottle and then I had to go back and buy another bottle\nAnd so I went back I as a matter of fact I realized I was just a little more than halfway done and I ran out and I said I Wonder if I can go over there and it wasn't that far from where I live so hopped on my car drove over their knocked down to dress up you know the bottle you know saw okay\nSouls me another buses you know he says you should buy the Amway all purpose ... comes in a two and a half gallon jerk cause I was I just do my yard man\nI said one more by well see I got I got this you know it was okay you're on\nSo I took it and I finished up the yard and then I water the yard in this miraculous thing happened right before my eyes by the way I Am not an Amway distributor I have no financial connection day I'm way but I I got to tell you this miraculous thing happened right before my eyes\nI notice that the water instead of beating up it was like flooding way than you used to see all these dry spots even after rain or a spots that were just try\nIt just penetrated everything penetrated into the soil beautifully it just penetrated right into the soil and I said I should fertilized but I really I didn't get around uh fertilizing\nYeah I'm going to tell you something the yard just started looking\nTerrific uh now I did not do the back yard and you could go to my front yard to my backyard and it was day and night back yard was still like concrete front yard was fabulous I said whoa I said that is just totally totally fascinating\nSo I said you know I Need to go back and see this guy get so and saw this guy and it's a time you know I worked at the time I worked for a company that sprayed lawns we were a lawn care company ... all one care company and we would run into launch like this all the time\nSo I went back I told my boss you know Jack after I said you know about this stuff and he told me oh I knew about that as well why didn't you tell me about this as okay so you know\nI always said I I happen to know where this direct distributor guy is and I can go buy this stuff and so I when I asked him I said how much is a two and a half gallon jug of the way all purpose spray out today\nAnd it was I don't remember the numbers but it was like really expensive\nUnless you were a distributor I didn't want to be a distributor so we're back to Jack said I'll be a distributor so we saw jak opposite distributor\nAnd uh we started buying this stuff and we were selling this to people who needed it we were that will put this stuff down for you and we're putting it in our spray tanks actually and spray on a small spray day in spraying it

think that is amazing technology have you ever tried it no I've never done okay I have and so you want to look at this especially because you have kids young kids\nIs that you know if the kids get sick and you have to take him to the pediatrician we did last night okay then there's like the clean you know that they're supposed to be like the the wealth side and the ... side yeah there's about four feet of carpet separate or\nNearly so the germs really aren't going to go from there to hear hey where do you think you're doing the acquaintance I'd say over there and then they give you that

to look you know body you have to look hot\n[laughter] yes yes uh this is going to be quite a transition going from a brick and mortar office to my home office where I can either use my Mac laptop or even my eye pad and iPhone right yeah\nSo um I just didn't know if there was a way that I can do a selfie checked to see you know if the lighting is okay for me maybe the background the position that the camera\nI Know you're supposed to look into the eye of the camera and not the actual screen right things like that so I did I wanted to know what I can do to prepare before I actually get out and start thinking\nYou know the big thing is is that we want to make sure there's a good light on ya okay and in Chicago you have sunny days you have ...\nAnd there's a good light on ya okay and in Chicago you have sunny days you have cloudy days right yes and you have a cold winter days I've been there and like get so I'm the best case scenario is that you get what's called a Ringo light I don't know if you've heard of this\nAnd it's a it is a rank\nI can put a link to one for you that I Would recommend free over at Amazon dot com and so what does it has it's for a facial ... like portrait that people use that for it's also when you're on when you're using a webcam\nIs that you have a tendency to be washed out okay and with the ring light is exactly what it is is that it's going to illuminate your face\nAnd so that this way people are better able to see you and you'll actually you will actually look better lit up than dark a lotta people say oh no I Lived veteran or dark restaurant\nNot and not so much K now when you're faces illuminated within the background will appear darker OK okay\nAnd so you being a doctor I Would want to see your credentials on the wall me anyway I Want to see those diplomas you know what I mean even though I Can't I won't be able to read them I Want to see\nAll your awards I Want to know where you went to medical school I mean I I'm not gonna be able to look that closely but I can tell what they are right okay and of course you want to get rid of any junk behind you to you don't strike me as a person but you know we've interviewed people before like this guy you know for jobs here\nAnd you know and you look and they have the like they're the hoarders behind them and you're like ooh what is that pile that too right so we clean all that up\nNow there are ways when you have faced time for example that you can hit a button and was gonna be hard but what I Would do is I Would just\nRecord say a couple of seconds\nAnd then you don't have to worry about just taking pictures of you know record some video of yourself for thirty seconds the big thing too that a lot of people don't realize funny is that you want to smile OK\nOkay and because when you smile you look welcoming and\nI'm sure you've done that you know where it's hard to deliver bad news but you might have a little bit of a smile you\nKnow race or is there's a whole side of I mean I have a lot of friends were doctors my I hear a lot of the bad story but I also hear the good stories you know yeah and um but you know so being letting your personality comes through have you ever done this before\n[noise] uh only and Web in ours but not actually as a patient doctor thing\nThis is so cool I'm so excited for you um the ring lights are

it's I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\n... percent like eight hundred dollars or something in common they had to tip jars\nForget the ten percent like eight hundred dollars or something and they had to tip jars\nOkay and so\nYou know not only can you tip on the receipt but they actually had tip jars right [noise] one was once and for all you Android people and the other ones had for all you iPhone people and the iPhone ... drivers like overflowing [laughter] and the Android One didn't\nHave anything yeah I was at a video game thing and they said if you think the X. box sucks chip here if you think the PlayStation ... it's just a ploy it's\nJust like you said before giving people out of their money\nBut how about this one this is a little different when we order or my sister's kids came over for dinner or something like let's just get a bunch of barbecue so we go on Amazon restaurants right a bunch of barbecue and I get the total and it's like a hundred and twenty five dollars sounds like that's a lot more than I was expecting right they automatically added on a twenty five per cent tip\nAfter also charging me a delivery fee\nOkay that that's really tough because they don't even ask you yeah and\nYou know ... for that and also overreach because they'll say like pricing search okay and so they add another five dollars if you order something that's under ten dollars there'll be a small order delivery charge you know or whatever it may\nBe but maybe it's like being\nA server at one point in my life\nI actually will tip the whole foods\nOr the Amazon Prime driver or whatever it is\nI'll actually add more like he's like okay I got a whole foods delivery yesterday and it was probably the it was like a hundred and fifty dollars\nSo you got two things yeah I had seven in brockley [laughter]\nWhich is probably about it and some sushi okay\nAnd if the tip was a recommended to was twelve dollars\n... and so so I was ten percent okay I ... I gave the guy sixteen I gave them an extra four\nOr five I Wonder what I mean the research has got to be out there that this works otherwise the apps that are doing this the squares and stuff like that they wouldn't include it\nWell and because you know remember they're making a percentage of the total\nEven on a tip yes okay\nBecause they charge square and the other one said two point nine percent two and a half percent of as a transaction fee of the total amount right okay so if they can get that total thinking about this if they can get the total\nAmount up by five dollars I Would think the temporary dollars no no no you you pay the whole transaction than what the ... what is that what is the bottom line transaction\nThen you have to pay a fee\nFor them collecting the money and doing things like that and he goes dream of mine I'm Still not tipping well already but hard it is hard and you know I I don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm just a nicer more generous person than you are maybe about uh the I think that you know but I Am but sometimes it is kind of awkward\nYou know tipping again for just like what is normally\nAnd what we should be considered like just part of the experience like somebody handing you a napkin\nSo things here's ten percent ... instead of having an African images use the cash that you're expecting me to the gym joined by ... something like that [noise]\nAll right let me tell you something over the years of epson printers may have earned my trust which is why I'm uncommitted user and you'll see what I mean you have to experience the economical Epps an ego tank forty seven fifty it's a fantastic wireless all in one corner love this friend is my printer choice\nFor a couple of reasons well first of all it's cartridge free don't you hate\nBuying printer ink cartridges oh my gosh what's in there anyway golden no it's colored IQ but the efforts in ego taint forty seven fifties cartridge free comes with up to two years of AIG riding the bus up enough to print up to eleven thousand color pages that's the equivalent of thirty a cartridge that\nNow if I were to run to the store and buy thirty cartridge that's yeah and do the math it would cost me about Fifteen hundred dollars\nWas ego take you easily refill the printers ain't tank and second\nThe ego tank of the compact space saving printer that's truly cartridge free and it's available everywhere\nYou can learn more right now epson dot com slash eco tank can that's easy O.

calls to show some more interesting items that crossed my debts\nAnd before we get back to all of your phone calls to show some more interesting items that crossed my desk and screen that you just need to know about first which it's one of these ideas that popped up and I'm telling ya I should have thought of this this is a product\nThat if I ever wanted to create a product it satisfy that need it's private it's secure I think it's too pricey right now but let me tell you a little bit about it [noise]\nThe idea of a whole personal email server it kinda got a bad rap with Hillary Clinton and her emails and that whole fiasco\nBut the whole idea is that your email is safe it's not handled in the cloud you actually have a physical drive now setting up an email server used to me and calling and the nerds calling them again when you need to change up some settings and calling them again what had just\nDied because it would happen but there's a new product called helm\nAnd your emails no longer floating in the cloud somewhere and said it's actually physically in your home the server like I mentioned it expensive five hundred bucks by the size of a book\nAnd has a hundred and twenty a gigs and storage or trade can go up to five terabytes there is no fan passively clued cold rather um it has a security care physical key because also the emails encrypted so it's not just five hundred bucks and there was a hundred dollar your subscription Fey\nAnd if you think about it this way there's other downsides and one of them primarily is that you're not going to have all the latest features and Gmail and auto complete and you know taboo auto it's going to fill out all the sensors for you but it's a product that does have an answer does have a need\nAnd when the price come down and I think it's probably worth all taken a look at\nAnd other new products we're talking about smart home technology yeah was specifically ever you ever thought about how your couch its into your

latest iPhone anyway just few laws we talk more about that but I really love to hear from you this show one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once again as a way to join us\nAnd then there's Andrew been skiing the Kim commando show man cave hello there Andrew\nKim we're going to start with Karen and she is in spring grove Pennsylvania ... springs grow that sounds like a nice place to live doesn't it doesn't really horrible place I live in spring grows right next to garbage town Pennsylvania which is not very well populated not at all she uh she lives in rural areas and she's thinking about switching\nCell phone providers currently she has ... and for home wireless 'cause she's in rural\nAnd she has it for ...\nThe company that she was thinking about switching to uses the rising powers and she's like oh well they use all the same stuff is going to be all the same kind of action and then she went what if\nWhat if it's worth it if it's where I Need to call him and it's so frustrating though isn't it\nI mean when you don't have a decent connection in your house I mean you know we just talked about you buy a new house right now if a lot of millennials especially millennials are you a millennial here and I know I think I missed it by yeah you're right on the ad\nIs that a lot of millennials won't be won't buy a new home if it doesn't have say\nA fiber optic next I mean that is now requirements like you know two and a half bathrooms three bedroom [laughter] enough fiber connection so that this way\nYou don't have to worry about what's going on so they don't care and you don't have all bars in all places that's what I'm hearing\nThat is correct [noise]\nSo that's what I'm hearing that is correct [noise] and there's no way that you want to move to the big city or no no we're going to stay right here okay so so when you complained of arise and what did they say\n[noise] um\nThey really can't get many answer I've been I've been with them in twenty twelve okay\nBut the past month it is just so slow here that the Internet's almost useless [noise] so I'm looking at switching to Comcast for my Internet and I can't say well we also have mobile and so I thought well that might be a great film service but\nI'm concerned that maybe it won't be because they do use the same price and towers and would switch between pricing towers and Comcast hot spots so I don't know what I mean\nI I don't I don't find Lincoln switching between the hot spots um [noise]\nYou you know what you okay ... you know what you could possibly get and I don't know ... varieties and you know would give you a deal on or sometimes if you complain loud enough you get it for free\nIs the you may be able to get a little what's called a fence do self or your house and so it's kind of like a repeat or off of the cell tower itself\nAnd but the thing with the ... and this is why I kinda went and I don't know about the Comcast is that\nIs Comcast is using other ... to increase your reception in your bars I don't know if I like that either um so my first recommendation we go back to arise in and say listen I Need to have\nSome type of Microsoft or something that you can I can put inside my house that will repeat the signal from the tower that you have nearest me\nSo I get a stronger signal and then they'll say no we can't do that because you're only talking to a rap but if you get up into a manager a supervisor level and explain to them that you're paying for the service and you're not getting everything that they promised sometimes you can get it for free if not that it's like a hundred maybe two hundred bucks okay\nOkay now let's talk a little bit about the cell phone towers is that even though like for rising and Eighteen T and Comcast or maybe they can share cell towers\nThey often use different frequencies in technology so they're not actually sharing the hardware on the tower makes sense\nOkay um and they're usually own now the towers are owned by a leasing company not even by the provider anymore because the providers figured out that they could sell\nThe ah the towers and they don't have to carry that debt and they can make more money so the thing that you couldn't go back to Comcast with say you know\n... which frequency is Comcast on the tower and how does that compare for rides and so that this is not that you're going to know what all this means but just this way if the numbers are different than you know that that it should be different enough that one service might be better\nPay and Comcast senses the cable companies some of this band with maybe coming off the cable to now there is hope on the horizon\nAnd the hope on the horizon is five gee\nAnd it's supposed to get better for all of us that are having cell phone problems um because basically you're talking on for gee you're talking about one gig in bed a per second speed versus\nOn five gee you're talking about multiple created this and so you know couple of solutions that you might want to try before you just dumped ... do you think you could call ask one of your neighbors if they have Comcast\n[noise] I could try that we don't have real real close neighbor from afraid of 'em [laughter] I knew that we know but um [noise] but I could try that\nBecause sometimes you know and of course you know they may say it's great and then you get it and then you're mileage may very right if I could be you know here's where I'm at you know what you might want to do\nIs explain to Comcast what the problem is have Comcast to turn turn on the line you try it for a couple of days see how it works explain\nTo them I don't want to sign up for a long term contract right now I Want to be able to at least ten and put my tone or she would I'm getting\nAnd you know let me tell you something the cable companies are struggling right now they'll do anything to keep occurring customers to get a customer so again you might have to escalate it's a little bit up higher but it's definitely something that you might want to take a look at doing just having a conversation\nAnd Karen thank you so much for your call Gary in South bend hello there Gary what's going on [noise]\nI I'm doing on looking or an app that I can secure some\nMoney to a private party um [noise] I was in a small car accident and\nRather than go through the ... center it's um it's a friend of mine\nLike a fake or the ... sure I'm I'm just looking gr secure after that I can send her um payments or I'm not not something we all use all the time that something I think three articles under the onus on\nA you know a couple of ways you can do it you know [noise]\nJust just a\nRule of thumb was when you're sending money to friends be you know you have to be really careful make sure that you have everything done correctly 'cause they don't issue refunds okay\nA couple of options you've have Google Wallet you'll have pay pal and one of the most popular ones out there now is something called the ... and all of them charged two point nine percent as far as to make this wire transfer a busy exceptional pay pal they charge two point nine percent plus thirty cents\nBut if you're looking for a safe secure way you don't want to give out your checks or maybe you don't even have a bank account anymore\nAnd that you want to take a look at as I mentioned Google Wallet probably pay pal is the one that's most commonly used then mow it seems to be getting a lot of traction though as time goes on Gary thank you for your call it the right where you are we have our money to coming up and more of your phone calls that you don't want to miss here on the ... commando show [noise]\n\nYour memory gentle around marriages digital camera\n\nOver the years I've tried and tested every way that average people can and should back of the doubt on their computers I'll tell you that I drive it's simply the best cloud of backup service there is for big reasons why\nFirst it's the easiest to use I back up everything all my computers smartphones I've had the tabloids everything to one single I drive a ... second it's the most secure with I drive snapshots I'll never

switch to I drive today get an amazing Ninety percent off the first year\nWhen nobody's there so at least illuminates maybe it's less likely for somebody to break in\nIs that you can program the lights for that if you had certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nIs that there were water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so once you once you get the hub Charlie's what I'm saying is that once you get the hub you start thinking about OK\nWhat more can I add to this right\nIt is so good ...\nYou know so if there are there any other things that we can for a couple of hundred bucks because that's all you're talking about\nRight that they are that's awesome audio\nYeah then it might be worth it okay so when you start looking at different products the smart things though this is where it gets confusing is that you've got the wave in the bay and those are different standards\nAre ... and that works with the smartest things next he uh everything works like um I have a a train air conditioner that I can control remotely you know on the next year or so so so that's what I'm trying to it so I'm trying to expand your horizons but once we had the ... what else can we do if this\nLaw took things yeah it's exciting I mean it's really cool to doctors all states with the holograms turning around and you know\nAndrea don't you think that you and I would ... be excellent at doing like a theatre version of the game commando show absolutely agree making a musical\nWell I don't know I can think commando them he was the one that I don't [laughter]\nI don't think we'd go past one no memory and just say so anyway popular demand women I don't have a say in an grape in Kansas that was we didn't even make into like like Broadway in ... that was it that's off off off off officers runs\nRight or the ... it's more intimate but but yeah absolutely\n[laughter] All right so the next day the system's going to set you back eight dollars and Ninety nine cents a month All right okay that's it not a big deal so I'll take a look at the ... cents and connect\nOK okay the next ... about sixty bucks the lock is going to touch back a hundred and fifty and then you're looking at say just for giggles ten bucks a month\nAnd then it allows you to program all those codes get reports whose common and what's going on with that and then if you could say that for twenty four hours and then if somebody does or do you think something was wrong you can just kill that code and killed it automatically there's no delay\nYou can also un so that\nYeah you can set up a code really ... you know if you're if you're doing anything remotely\nA really makes sense that you start looking at smart stuff an order to be notified and get alerts and good things like that hey Charlie thank you for your call and keep us posted on what's going on in great band and how that locks working out for you\nAll right speaking of homes was talk a little bit about simply save longtime sponsor that came commando show and you know I

wholesale medications and labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out and let their doctors know that this is a better way to get health care and they support it and and that's why I think we've seen this gross so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist than say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\nThat it's working everyone can you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between you know\nA horrible correct I mean we want to get out there trying to take down the path to socialize total government controlled health care you know at a time where people were able to choose their health care decisions based upon their individual DNA we're going to take a one size fits all approach to health care it doesn't make any sense and\nYou know Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump anymore than Republicans walked or health care chosen diagnose Chuck Schumer and\nNancy Pelosi so you know why are we inserting the politicians in health care with it that the government control health care system when you can have a better way through a direct primary care relationship\nWhen we leave this was the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more and you get far in theory your care because it never really was about the patient really was always about\nRedistribution of wealth and you know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth in America you have the top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income one percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners pay Ninety seven percent\nSo what they've tried to do is ... ... for example they forced the young and generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that they didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan when they would have been better off paying for one check up a year right out of their own pocket\nAnd also getting a catastrophic plan if God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer or at a young age which rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr amber\n... this is a one size fits non model um it's too expensive for young healthy people and it doesn't provide the service that older adults need in an affordable timely way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always tried to\nEnsure everything but now we're to the point of ensuring\nYou medicines that cost a penny a pill I can get a thousand ... blood pressure medicine for four dollars and Ninety cents so the big box retailers will show you Ninety pills for ten dollars is highway robbery we can do cancer or for for six dollars a month in some cases\nThe fact is now we just need less insurance that means health insurance is can compete on quality\nAnd and lower their price just like your Fifteen minutes we'll say Fifteen Percent on car insurance we need to get back to a competitive model for the patients are in control and cares affordable and insurance is just for the big stuff but the rare stuff\nAnd where are you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do their the innovators in this up from pricing lower cost no government meddling aren't all that is true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know for example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would that would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nNow health care is local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear the calorie is not coming from Washington to save us now from ... from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other fix this problem themselves\nAnd that's exactly what this movement a movement does is it the eliminate\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our ...\nKnow well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but it's it\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but as it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the health care after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh number Dr ... grows the probably one of the

it\nSome of them are right on the on the dash you can go into the information settings and you can disable the auto start stop a dodge product has that available from the ... through the touch control\nA believe some of the forwards habit as well you could you could look their first look on the shoulders man you'll see if it shows something for that\nHow long have you had it read\nAll four months\nOkay yeah I I'm pretty sure that when you can disable is a lot of people did complain about it they just didn't like the feel of it although\nIt's going to be new you know if you're a new driver and a car you're sixteen and you're driving out and you and you get used to it nobody will think twice about it but for now you know people like me who didn't grow up with that\nIt's weird and they did here I'm okay with the previous starting and stopping electric but boy that\nYeah and the computer guy decides is in the end you need to be running for air conditioning but how are we sitting\nFor heat you know it's making all these decisions before it makes that that shut off it is a good\nPoint because of course I drive a Prius that does that when we drove the new jeep in head start stop I didn't even notice pointed it out oh yeah it does end in rank the engine there was no re strict like your previous just starts moving like a guy named Norman ... and I'm okay with that but that engine cranking thing\nAnd and it does it instantaneous it's great but I Do have a concern about started life we haven't put any on because of that yet but I can see it\nComing it's got to crank every time they are they all running off to start or have they gotten to the point where they're using the summer Olympics in ... in\n... some of them have electric motors some of them have ah they're using the alternate or as a generator and started her but this one's using a starter to crank the vehicle like a dodge Durango and the other Dutch products they just use the starter you hear that started engaging crank another thing I have a concern with this what about the state of tune of engines\nThere's the the the world is monitoring everything we do the can continuously and it's it's surprising from cars that think you can do things if you've got an iPhone\nAfter using it for a couple of months one day I hopped in my car after it was connected to blue to ... and it said twenty three miles to and I went\nTo where you were going and it was it really is that sometimes when it's not work or or home\nIt'll say if the Saturday Night it'll say like it to the arena or whatever yeah that ... yeah I don't need to go to the fireworks and three times and the fourth of July what's funny is my wife and I go oh there when you said the world they're monitoring everything you do we go oh that's scary my kids go well yeah they did well yeah of course of course my phone knows all that they they don't it's no big deal\nBut just make sure you do that report you've you've been visiting the under the show that is the point of all of it because they also control what you see sometimes in ...\nThey might want you to eat something that's been paid for first right and also just go to our page check it out and if you go to brush your dot com use the code ... saved ten percent of every\nEight six six five nine for for one five oh let's talk to Iran and North Dakota ray you're on the end of the ... what can we do for you\nHey my question is enough out of their call what I Would like to have access to his website where you could say the F. goes out before you purchase the frozen car is is that just say\nWell there's actually quite a few of them up you know one of the more trusted ones over the years was Consumer Reports they have got you know they they\nI get suspicious anymore and everything but they claim to be fairly independent ... and you always gotta look to see who's funding what ... what angle they might leave but they have proven over the years to be quite independent on their tests and they've also archived a lot of their test that they've done over the years\nThat you can go back to ah they test about everything car and driver motor trend wrote in track\nThey are they like to test for the specialty vehicles first but at some point they do get into a test of of common cars I and I say kind of just the more normal stuff\nAnd those you have to be a little aware of because they might score something higher or lower based on something that they think it's important that has no but ...\nAnd they will do long term tests where they put the cars into their fleet and they drive him a Consumer Reports there's a similar thing there are but as far as uh what state are you thinking where you'd look and see okay this cars at this many problems reported um that sort of a thing I guess we'll make sure what you're looking for\nYeah that is correct so it'd be kind of a forum were\n[noise] oh boy that that's it I got to think about that for a second I think a lot of it you\nKnow there's Consumer Reports that they used to have a\nA I Believe they had a Consumer Reports reported by actual drivers type thing they did that with a fuel economy sites ... go for a while it said here's what the\nGovernment sticker or you know manufacture sticker set on the window and here's what drivers actually report and they get you know twenty people that said well I got sixteen miles per gallon average\nUh out of all of them and the manufacturers that have got an Eighteen or got fourteen so sometimes it's better sometimes is\nWhen you when you talk about the well this is always a a slippery slope because if you put in\nA guinea company any type of car ... and you say rant and rave about this or whatever they have to be or I mean there's a website dedicated to people crab and about stuff right and guess what people do they're they come and crab about stuff that to me it's not an indication of what really happens with that\nThing or that car or that company or you got to be able to dissect that data and look for some common themes are because I'll tell you that people\nThat have vehicles can have a bad experience with any vehicle based on their used or their care right and it really can so I mean it would be hard to make the results be consistent because none of the problems are happening under the same\nThe same circumstances if you know if you have a certain type of engine if they fail quicker under poor maintenance than if you did good maintenance where it would last much longer\nAnd people rarely go out and how how well something works occasionally you'll see something on a on a former website but it's it's\nRare in this kind of is very dangerous but I got to say it that based on the\nType of car and the demographic of the consumer that it would end up in the type of comic could be different\nI totally agree yeah the experience factor um you know certain demographics might have more experience with automobiles than others and they could give you a completely different reports that a first time car buyer or depends on the you know a but there's there's\nGotta be careful absolutely to answer your question re asked there are thousands of them and that's the tough part [laughter] thanks very much for the call good luck eight six six five nine for for one five oh let's start to TJ TJ you're on the under the

above by the way that the longer term moving average as long as it stays above disaster is averted\n\nAs long as it stays above\nAnd we believe\nThat's what happened this week even though we've had a couple of rough things also\nThat back up a hundred and four but now that could still down twenty two ... for NASDAQ one hundred up a weapon a sock still down twelve Mitt caps and small capsule down
