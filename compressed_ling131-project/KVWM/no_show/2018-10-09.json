ago well what do you think happened folks\nThey got stolen that they get the check got stolen someone signed didn't stole it that simple as that ... we hated those cases why do I tell you anything because once in awhile\nIf the case wasn't worked at a quick enough speed\nIt constituent recall the congressperson in the Congress person would call the secret service all hey this is congressman

lot of people are concerned that the world of robots\nIs going to take over the planet take you take our jobs and do everything else is that something for us to be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people's jobs\nBut um other customers website you take to try to figure out if if your job is at risk and it is a record it's all the answers and very very few jobs actually could have robots\nTake over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or\nAny of the thousands of other things people do when and and that\nAre so no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think we build these tools to increase our own productivity and we we all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence or exactly what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[noise] well that's a great question what is it is is more complex than you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means but what what they what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing in common so they either me either\nDifferent things that may have nothing in common so they either me or what you see in the movies so commander data upstart truckers see three radio or a that would be a machine that can do everything a person could do it's created it can teach itself new things and we don't\nWe don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and that's called a general intelligence or it is a computer program that could do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic\nAnd that we know how to do pretty well the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it make projections about the future\nAnd that doesn't sell all that interesting but that's in a sense of what we do with just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are foster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things that really look\nSmart um by just using the simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just ... if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we used to all have some amount of privacy or just based on the fact that there are so many others can't follow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation unfortunately with artificial intelligence\nThe kinds of tools we are developing to do very good things like the ... cancer or something like that\nCan be used to to trip to follow people voice to the to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded\nAnd it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans that reading lip so every camera even if it doesn't have the audio can read lips as well as a human um\nYour you know you have a a device that trucks where you are and again all of these things ended up themselves aren't that technologies but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world\nUm you know China has implemented a kind of a social score yeah that's right you write run a red light you lose a point if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points if you write a

even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are uh have the capability of of of being misused of course hopefully it in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a Republican but that's governed by laws the price of liberty is a turtle vigilance and so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and forced\nThat don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nByron is every

on one hand or let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about balmy something and the computer you know is is set up to pick up code words like ... or whatever\nAnd so it finds this uh

I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that\nAnd yet when we take surveys on my website asking synch with the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are\nJust machines then no than a machine could ever do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work the way it does just with chips and the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering who really is\nUm the thing is is that when a computer can play chess and when the computer can play go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really isn't quote anybody home there's nothing there\nBut does any thinking at all it's it's one reason zeroes manipulated and memory turned on and off\nA at the speed of light um it's done with what's relative it it's interesting the techniques we use for it official intelligence we'd been writing it out for\nForty years it's just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere's a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem\nAnd it's about it it goes like this there's this\nThere's this room a that's full of these books and there's a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese people outside the route slide questions written in Chinese under the door\nTo this Chinese to this librarian the librarian picks\nThem up looks at the first character on the question goes and finds a book with out on the spine looks up the second character that sentence him to another book to another book to another book to another book\nUntil it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these\nSymbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since perfect and so the question is does\nIt was the librarian understand Chinese\nAs it does the library and understand Chinese due to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense but to a lot of people\nKnow delivery and doesn't know if they're talking about color or coffee beans and the analogy is an apt one because that's all the computer does runs a set of the term in his ...\nProcesses in memory it spits out an answer and it doesn't know it's playing chess it doesn't know any what is talking about it doesn't know anything and so you kinda have to ask is the computer thinking or not that's the computer understand anything or not\nA by my way of looking it doesn't it doesn't understand anything but other people other people say if it can do everything that that's something that does understand can do then you just have to say it does\nIt is just mind boggling and it's getting even been or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers do this thing where it in a very simple short and they double in power\nEvery couple of years but on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's\nFifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can collect data there'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all those ... they had all this data coming in and these faster computers and so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it\nIf you think about it the Internet the mosaic browser cannot twenty five years ago\nA literally in Ninety three\nAnd all that did was like computers talk to each other and that was it and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars and well a million new businesses it up in ...

minutes after the our home reading the official latest warning on hurricane Michael\nComes from the national weather service dated twelve midnight eastern time and so we we will take a listen to what National Weather service meteorologist Nick PA crow had\nOn hurricane Michael at that time\nThe it's been upgraded to a hurricane out of the eleven o'clock advisory\nAnd you'll notice that are now been now is forecasts become a major hurricane before making landfall in the Florida Panhandle they're so\nI'm so certainly um that's that's a a sort of the big change and and what we've seen from the last advisory from the hurricane center but notice how uh you know the remnants ... expected to come up across the Carolinas or later in the week so um we are going to have to deal with that with those remnants\nUm the good news like I said it seems to be at least according to the forecast according to the official forecast it's moving it will be moving very quickly so that should help to limit um the rain\nBut we're looking at the summary of greatest impacts we're a confidence is pretty low on how windy it'll get so I'm not sure at this point if we're gonna have to issue any kind of you know a tropical storm watches warnings um you know a system like this would would leftovers would tend to give us a few wind gusts you know up around thirty maybe thirty five\nA or slightly higher I'm In a certainly you know any trees that are half leaning over already or weaken from foreign you know there could be a few down trees and then subsequent power outages and that's why we have the wind and the power outages limited\nUm but but probably the biggest concern of course will be um how much rain we get out of it you know how hard it comes down initially for the flash flooding risk and then the subsequent river flooding which is I kind of already alluded to wear expecting mainly across the eastern Piedmont and coastal plain\nThey're very smart they are the national weather service losing his grown very very quickly a that was\nA six and a half hours ago that it was actually declare it as a hurricane which would be kept one mhm now it's gotten to the middle of the Gulf of Mexico and it has gone from a cat one storm to a cat three store\nNow when it makes landfall they always sold out there is no question about that that's the way it works the wind speeds go down and the speed that travels goes down but it is now a hurricane a category three if it gets to for\nYou're talking about very very dangerous and you're talking about sixteen to twenty four inches of rain in the strike area I Am seeing about twenty five models and I have never seen such a narrow with a probability\nFor hurricane in many year this thing the\nEuropean model has a tendency always to lean more to the west than the American model stone and why it in something in there\nIn the program itself uh-huh but out of the twenty models that I just looked at\nFrom the national weather service they're all super similar all within about a Fifteen mile radius who that is the type of this striking in Panama City Florida near Tallahassee which of course is think capital if that happens\nThat means that will probably spare\nAreas like New Orleans it'll be fringe in areas like blocks the Mississippi but if it comes on shore ass off for not three it's now predict come onshore as the three if it comes on and as the three this won't happen\nBut if it comes on as a poor it could still be at hurricane strength\nWhen it would reach the outer outer reaches of Atlanta ga jeeze which is about three hundred mile drawn and at that time it would dissipate turn to the right and probably exit North America\nBy the Caroline Caroline this in the uk has actually are a little area where we saw\nFlorence coming onshore it might leave but we're talking about storm surge in that Panama City Tallahassee area of maybe eight to twelve feet which means two or three days after the storm it could be as much\nAs Fifteen feet but for storms this time of year to get all the way to do out of Atlanta you're talking about a lot of territory and a very unusual rendition all the way down to Tampa Bay Orlando um\nPanama City Pensacola Mobile Alabama Albany, Georgia even up into Jacksonville, Florida very unusual and Jacksonville basically a city built on water\nIf the water levels go up there there will be flooding so\nWell and uh also according to the national Hurricane Center or as you were saying when this makes landfall it could be as strong as a cat three that means winds will be between a hundred and eleven up to a hundred and twenty\nNine ... wins that means gusts a board of a hundred and fifty miles [noise]\nLife threatening storm surge is possible lung portions of the Florida Gulf Coast regardless of the storms exact track or intensity this is according to the uh again the national Hurricane Center well built\nFramed homes may incur major damage or remove all of a

been given to of all people Robert Mueller Rosenstein\nIs Mueller's boss if Mueller is going to be investigating Rosenstein for illegal illicit activity he can't how we must still the boss in this case\nAnd the timing of this tells us everything ... his was revenge for the firing of James Comey this is part of the listed scheme to frame Donald Trump\nGood title for a book I guess that's why it's number one John Solomon I Want you to weigh in on this and I'm sure miss some details here but I I'm given the best summary I can it sounds complicated but it's not\nIt's really not complicated incorrect of such a good job of cutting through all the laughter and be asked them if you didn't get right down to the point the FBI and the Justice Department were misused for a political opposition research projects to a stop Donald Trump from becoming president and when that failed\nBasically saying I'm investigation that was designed to half or his early presidency and that's what the overwhelming evidence out chosen and there's another important part the Baker developed as in the middle of my story if I Want to fight the south because many times I've heard you and I've heard Greg say the media has been complicit in this well a a\nA Baker gave us an unbelievable anecdote of complicit in November right after the election right after Trump wins the reporter David Corn of Mother Jones\nGives a new version of the ... the copy it's different from the one the FBI has from steel\nAnd gives it to Baker and Baker turns it on to the uh counterintelligence people why is that important first off it's not a job a reporter getting evidence yep yeah we're we're supposed to report facts not become snitches but more importantly the timing of it is so important the FBI\nJust fired Christopher Steele for leaking um uh the existence of the investigation and all the dirty hat on Trump just before the election he gets fired they televise the court are no longer using them and here it becomes a backdoor a journalist becomes a fact or to continue to receive information for Christopher Steele this is not\nHow the price of process is supposed to work and I think it's another key revelation I mean I I think they ... give us several key revelations or one of the challenges the credibility of ours is the one that shows the media\nUh uh being complicit in in the effort to unseat Trump and three that's a direct involvement of the Democratic National Committee lawyer and turning on evidence pressuring yeah yeah I think of what happened in that time from\nChristopher Steele July fifth twenty sixteen walks into the FBI and you're you get turned down they don't act on 'em right away they if they're not excited about it a few days later he go to Bruce or the number four official in the Justice Department\nBruce or put pressure on the FBI department by reaching out and doing it a month later you've got a the DNC lawyer coming into the FBI again putting pressure on the system there was an enormous amount of political pressure to get the FBI\nFind something uncomfortable for election day and I think when we look back at this we should all be alarmed fake Donald Trump out of this\nAny candidate any American who have been treated this way it really raises civil liberties concerns that really raises abuse of power concerns and we should all be concerned by body of evidence that our firms were rector has written in his book\nIt is so scary that when you put it all together and now the pieces seemed to be ... literally at the end but those the puzzles together usually start on the outside and you get all the square parts on the outside and then you start feeling in the pieces of the puzzle then the next thing you have a tree then you have the grass and you have the sun\nAnd slowly but surely it seems like we now understand a lot more and that is that\nWe had a group of people that literally set up an entire phony Russia investigation the very people that exonerated Hillary long before they investigated her\nThe very people that literally signed off on warrants that are based on information she had provided by committing fraud to Pfizer cords\nAnd the very same people that after they lost had an insurance policy and now we know what the insurance policy is by any means necessary we're going to get Donald Trump in the way we're going to do it is\nA we're going to eat and secretly record them and we're going to surreptitiously get him to say something that we think we could use against them on top of a pony investigation that they've they\nInitiated through a media released strategy again of the ... you\nKnow one of the things that really ticked me off if there was a plot to frame Donald Trump again the title of my book is I went through meticulously neat\nThe title of my book is I went through meticulously the FBI guidelines and the department of justice regulations on winning how you can launch a counterintelligence investigation of an American citizen and what I discovered\nIs that the FBI violated every single solitary provision of their own guidelines they had no\nCredible evidence of crimes no plausible intelligence to justify a counterintelligence probe importantly they had no probable cause\nAnd yet on July thirty first two thousand and sixteen they officially\nA launch this investigation Peter Struck signed the papers he had just finished meeting with Christopher Steele and in fact the same day that James Comey cleared Hillary Clinton\nTwisting the long could towards the facts his FBI was meeting for the first time in Europe\nIn a building with Christopher Steele who had compose this phony ... that the FBI was never able\nTo verify and yet they ran with this Diaa lady an investigation
