I I Am a realist and I try to look at things as I study these numbers more than you know\nIf the election were held today I think we'd lose the house by about five seats\nWhere if the election were held with the Senate today where we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely hold Nevada I think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana\nAnd we'll win North Dakota Florida too close to call Montana too close to call West Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and uh well I'm trying to warn people that this is real that you know here we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results on the morning after the night before\nAnd it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate\nRepublicans while they held on to the house and that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house or it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nVery Frank with you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with a third one the least likely\nSo you know I'd rather go for for the gusto and when it all one of the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirement\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house\nAnd to really try to get in people's minds and make them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses\nBut there's Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Maxine Waters is a\nCommittee chairwoman and Adam Schiff as a committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a chairman it just it's a disaster for us eight hundred dying for one Sean are toll free telephone number [noise]\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change give the crumbs back increase it regularly\nWatch jobs go back overseas see now that's that's the difference my opponent doesn't talk about that they're hiding behind a bunch of

city Mayor Bloomberg is you know putting tens of millions of dollars apparently into a lot of these house races are you seeing the effects of his money and others\nI'm not seeing Bloomberg's money in in this race but I'll tell you one thing closest Pakistan a million dollars on hitting me right here in my home district ... million dollar San Francisco money being spent right here in the value of Pennsylvania attacking me\nBy the way I say this to everybody I said they're foreign or thirty five members running for Congress and if you vote for any Democrat make no mistake about it you're voting for ... they're just not saying that\nThey're not saying it but that's the absolute truth\nWhat are the polls latest numbers show uh in the district\nTwo points back or the latest poll shows that were to back to back well within the margin of error and we're and we're gaining momentum uh we we debated\nSeveral times I made and every debate she will not to agree to any additional debates a recall her actually listen as we caught her in the debates talking about supporting open borders then she correct herself and say no no no I support a strong southern border twice she said that in the last debate which\nCompletely makes sense because during the primary she was running on about\nEyes open borders but now we're getting the general election they're trying to pivot and we're going to and we're going to expose her for what she really is\nAll this is a really important race a now Marty no Stein is running for the seventh district of Pennsylvania this is the Lehigh Valley district\nLehigh Valley county in Pennsylvania\nA it's a dead even race it's all going to come down a turnout Democrats are spending a fortune Republicans sadly of not spend as much and they should be meeting these guys dollar for dollar but I Hope people in the seventh district I Know we have a lot of listeners there are paying attention and and get out and vote early voting goes on in Pennsylvania right so people can vote soon\nYes and then we're seeing and talking to our election boards you know this many presidential election is what they told me what the amount of absentee ballot requests and what is being turned it so people are really really engage the really engaged\nAnd he's getting any feedback as to you know what's coming back Republican versus Democrat\nI haven't been getting any any feedback but I can just tell you that people who have been meeting and the people who aren't going to be here to vote have been asking for absentee ballots and they're making sure they're getting their votes in\nI have a good sense that there's going to be a lot of people showing up at the polls and it'd be alive and there's going to be a lot of people supporting Trump's agenda [noise] you know we're in the middle of the great American comeback last two years have given a lot of people hoping this country\nMore jobs lower taxes safer communities or do they want to uh uh have Nancy Pelosi take charge and have more welfare higher taxes open borders and sanctuary cities the voters are smarter than that Sean they want opposite when freedom they want liberty they went opportunity that's what we want that's what we have and we must continue it\nOnly wish you the best Marty all the best thing I Know you'll bring that great training as an athlete to the hard work you do for the seventh district of Pennsylvania and Lehigh County uh we'll be following the race could look or a week from tomorrow and uh I Hope you're able to sneak this out\nYes sir thank you thank you for having me on the show\nEight hundred nine four one ... listen you gotta understand this is now how close it is it's all coming down to get getting out the vote\nIt's one point here two points there it makes all the difference there are enough people in his audience that if everybody just made a commitment wherever you live on six hundred stations now and you made a decision that you're going to get out and you're going to vote\nAnd you're not going to stay home and you got to put in the effort and you're not going to give a half of ... to ... below zero half a vote to Schumer it could be you know shock the world again kind of night is happy you stay home than it's you know maybe we split split the baby in the sense that you know it's\nOkay we ... we saved the Senate and get extra seats there but we lose the house\nIt'd be a lot easier and better for the country if you want to continue progress to win both houses as of today eight days out I can see any one of those scenarios unfolding any one of them All right let's go to our busy telephones or let's say Hi to Katherine is in palm bay Florida next on the Sean Hannity show\nHey Sean I Can't I'm telling you enough how much my husband and I just\nAbsolutely I think you are the greatest not because of just what you inform us because of your courage and the hearts and prayers\nGo out to the people in Pittsburgh it is devastating I Can't believe Americans have forgotten the history and the genocide that went on during ... during the Holocaust I don't understand it but with that said our hearts and prayers are with them I have a point to make about courage and by the way you are right up there with President Trump\nAnd his entire family and those that stand by and I want the conservatives in this country to take part in some shared risk and stand up not in a violent way not in the vulgar way like maintain your credibility by being several and stand up\nTo all these bullies and oppression and and the violence and the hatred that they're stealing on the lie they're telling about our give president I'm comparing him to Hitler and style and which are just atrocities I Can't stand to listen to but the problem is that a lot of\nA lot of very frightened people I think President Trump as the most famous whistle blower in the nation because he's he's taken the curtain back and all the corruption in Washington and then something\nI'm I'm a whistle blower myself unemployed nurse practitioner who have to call it a surgeon five years ago and still fighting today that's that's fine\nBut I just wanted to say if if the conservative side can shed risk and stick together and consolidated\nYou gotta let me tell you why we are now I mean we're now at a point where there's a there's a group of so called conservatives never Trump or conservatives again that they're just angry they've been so wrong Ben Sasse is one of the bill Kristol is another one of them Jennifer Rubin another one of them\nYou know the if there's if Trump cured cancer they would be mad because oh it was Donald\nIf Trump cured cancer they would be mad because oh it was Donald Trump that did it you know doesn't matter that he transformed the economy all things that they said that they is conservatives would ever want in terms of cap tax cuts deregulation\nOr energy independence a peace through strength trust but verify securing America's borders all of the things that doesn't they hated all because Trump is doing that which they advocated for but they wanted somebody to do it in a way\nThat that that said everything the way they wanted to say it but the problem is the old establishment way of doing things gets nothing done you know I agree he can be incendiary he breaks things he throws dishes and break them in Washington and he exposes the swamp but he fights hard\nBut we're getting the results in the benefit of that hard fight you know they're they're the type of Republicans the basically want to just sit in power in the corner and and act like they can be friends with people that are saying publicly to kick you and that don't want to be civil\nThat are running you out of restaurants and screaming at the top of their lungs that you so I you know it's it is what it is I the only thing I really want at this point I Want results\nI Want the forgotten men and women to be taken care of I Want as much prosperity as we could ever create for every American and I want to take care of Americans first and then we'll work on helping the rest of the world develop the same system in paradigm that we built that\nHas benefited our population and then I Want security or in a world full of radical Islam is and people that that want to wipe America off the map and chant death to America\nI Want to make sure that we have the meanest toughest bad US military and we can handle any threat to the world throws at us and we can do if necessary we can protect the world against evil\nWhen evil you know raises its ugly head but there's it's happened before and it's gonna happen again history has proven in the meanwhile it's you know basically\nYou know temper tantrum politics of never Trump or his they're they're still mad they got it wrong you know we wouldn't have to Supreme Court justices that are conservative had they had their way we wouldn't have had the tax cuts we will not have the regulations to roll back\nWe wouldn't have America on a path towards energy independence\nWe wouldn't have had you know all the record numbers of jobs we currently have or the big GDP Growth we have or consumer confidence that we have that's why and eight days when people go out and vote this all matters a major question people have to ask is or you're better off than you were two years ago\nIn terms of the economy peace\nAnd prosperity Dr elections and if you want this prosperity this growth to continue if you want America to remain the leader on the world stage if you're not afraid to have a president that is willing to be a tough negotiator on your behalf\nBe a trade or NATO or Kim Jong un we didn't get anything that Kim Jong un nothing and look at what we've gotten back\nA shot at peace and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula you know if you want to president that says it's going to respect our constitution the rule of law are our laws on borders and security and respect our sovereignty first\nAnd demand that people respect our sovereignty first then you know where to vote this year All right so in the midst of all this chaos and whining and election season\nUm you know
