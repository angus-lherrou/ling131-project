Schumer\nAll right let me get into this this case that has really been a mystery in terms of a global affair crisis I'm the president now said that he has dispatched his secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia immediately to discuss what's been going on here\nAnd it gets almost more bizarre by the sec and now the allegation has banned that the Saudi ... crown prince ordered the killing\nOf this guy Jamal ... now he's a Saudi national who's been critical of the Saudi royal families Washington Post contributor\nAnd he's a U.S resident but he's not a citizen he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey October the second he hasn't been seen by anybody since that day\nThe Turkish government had suggested that the show he was killed by a Fifteen member Saudi hitting team who then dismembered his body and smuggled out and\nOf the consulate and pieces to an unknown destination but so far the evidence supporting that up to today is been heroes some reports claiming that could show these murder was recorded but to date no audiotape know videotape\nNot even the Turkish government which is no great friend of America is currently feuding with Saudi Arabia over other issues saying an absolute saying it's absolutely short because she'll be was killed by anyone they can't say it let alone the Saudis now there's just began to break moments ago\nAnd a reports of now surface that Saudi Arabia is preparing a report in which in fact they will admit Jamal 'cause show he this is the Washington Post columnist now this is a very dangerous we start seeing journalists killed went missing earlier this month was killed by interrogation gone wrong\nUm when he entered the I guess the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nRight here to talk about it we have Morgan Ortega's is with us national security global affairs animal is former U.S treasury attached shape to Saudi Arabia lived in Saudi Arabia two years\nOr she along with dam bond Gino former Secret Service agent author as well as the now best selling book a Spygate thank you both for being with us um Oregon you lived in Saudi Arabia two years this just breaking there's been a mystery up until like an hour ago what do you think\n[noise] yeah yes and I lived there for ... that\nI needed something like this breaking and the reason I did it because when the president said this morning that he's sending secretary on hand to Saudi Arabia that meet the secretary of state when it does keep people in the world certainly in the government\nHas canceled all plans to try halfway around the world um I I knew was incredibly serious than\nAh we're we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with whatever it is so if there were purchased you believe that we're still going to have to because if if the records are\nOut there and what what comes out or if that Saudis are cleaning some sort of responsibility for it it looks like they're not going to get there is there any claim ... senior leadership but not all that that people are in charge of it in order to be held accountable there's a lot to\nHow was your ... there's no until now because of\nHow would they not know until now uh when it happened in their consulate in Istanbul\nThat doesn't have to question and I think the big takeaway that I happen to this report we'll see what happened\nSecretary on paying people to read out the county not only need to come clean on their front and satisfy President Trump the secretary I'll tell you the audience and the and the Congress and the Senate that they're all of the council mind you're just not for sale is a memorandum\nOf understanding it has not been find that if president ... bipartisan can stretch sanctions people like Rand Paul have actually the very locally um I'm supportive of the relationship I\nDon't agree with senator call for a number of reasons that I could go and kill why I think the relationship in the Clinton but the Saudis need to understand how serious that says we need to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to master\nA movement away from their big finance or I'm just a few leaks secretary of each and every ... doubts fell off this afternoon at your ... and they were threatening threatening thick here\nWell they were threatening you know maybe even using the power of their oil if in fact any of the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S Dan bungee you know I mean is getting more bizarre by the men and how to somebody\nYou should from the west and bungee no I mean is getting more bizarre by the men and how does somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again\n[noise] [noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely show they're really two aggravating factors year one year already brought up the fact that this happened I'm In a constellation of a diplomatic facility that that I mean that breaks every single a protocol moral ethical rule imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well I mean aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media and I think they ever permissible wheat I'm not saying I'm suggesting that\nThis makes it even worse on the scale of Savage read the fact that this individual aka so he was a member of the media makes it even worse now how could it happen in the diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nIt's highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of the there's the side that said wait back\nLet's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudi\nThere's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white situation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them where honor razors edge with the Iranians and their nuclear program so this has\nTo be viewed that way and I think Trump get one more thing do show I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they seemingly tried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond\nYeah we were they had to be responded to there was not you can't just let it go so that was a bad move yeah\nYeah that's the thing that not\nOnly the threats that were happening that Dan just said it will lead to send me to answer why they like the president you know the president came up to the king and in some on the crown prince that called Jared Kushner is working on the scale that we don't know about it looked like they don't like the president I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to another lady that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and so we didn't know but I mean I I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the\nIn Saudi Arabia and well okay you're going to happen I mean did the men and women I\nChronicled the lot on this program and ... women voting and driving et cetera and and being told how to dress or being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera I'm ... I'm sure you had to cover up if you left\nIf you went out in public anywhere what was life life like for you as a woman living under surreal there\nYou know this is such an excellent point that you're bringing in China and the reason is is that what we actually last\nWasn't modernization Saturday we felt we end up being able to ... we saw other\nLet the rest of that I had to wear up the ... I think you were at\nHigh school graduation or if you will see that on television probably or if you live in a major you see people dress up differently but it's such a great clean shown that people aren't talking about what you just said is that it has been an incredibly repressive regime as it relates to strike for many years\nAnd and then you\nOut there also are ... are relates to Judaism and Christianity and lesbians or either slogged are killed is not true\nAbsolutely him but that's for me what's so unfortunate about this incident in ...
