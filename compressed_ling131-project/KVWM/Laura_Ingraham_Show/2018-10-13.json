Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing it along\nComputer storage data\nAs well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and conspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed\nThey doubled down and they continue to spy on an associate of the Trump campaign and to launch a special counsel Bob Mueller\nTo drive Trump from office why haven't Andrew McCabe memos evidence seen this soft coup attempt by a Rod Rosenstein being given to Congress they've been given to of all people Robert Mueller Rosenstein\nIs Mueller's

miss some details here but I I'm given the best summary I can it sounds complicated but it's not\nIt's really not complicated and Greg does such a good job of cutting through all the blocks for VS ... and get right down to the point the FBI and the Justice Department were misuse for a political opposition research projects to a stop Donald Trump from becoming president and when that failed\nThey sustain investigation that was designed to hamper his early presidency and that's what the overwhelming evidence out chosen and there's another important part ... Baker developed in the middle of my store if I Want to fight the south because many times I've heard you and I've heard Greg say the media has been complicit in this well a a\nA Baker gave us an unbelievable anecdote of complicity in November right after the election right after Trump when the reporter David Corn of Mother Jones\nGives a new version of the ... the copier it's different from the one the FBI has from steel and gives it\nTo Baker than Baker turns it on to the uh counterintelligence people why is that important first off it's not a job a reporter to getting evidence yep yeah we're we're supposed to report back not become snitches but more importantly the timing of it is so important the FBI just fired Christopher Steele\nFor leaking um uh the existence of the investigation and all the dirty hat on Trump just before the election he gets fired they televise the court they're no longer using them and here it becomes a backdoor\nA journalist becomes a backdoor to continue to receive information for Christopher Steele this is not\nHow the price of process is supposed to work and I think it's another key revelation I mean I I think they give us several key revelations are one of the challenges the credibility of ours is the one that shows the media\nUh uh being complicit in in the effort to unseat Trump and three that's a direct involvement of the Democratic National Committee lawyer in turning on evidence pressuring yeah yeah I think what happened in that time front\nChristopher Field July twenty sixteen walks into the FBI and you're you get turned down they don't act on them right away they is that they're not excited about it a few days later he go to Bruce or the number four official in the Justice Department\nBruce or put pressure on the FBI department by reaching out and doing it a month later you've got a the DNC lawyer coming into the FBI again putting pressure on to the system there was an enormous amount of political pressure to get the FBI\nTo find something on Trump before election day and I think when we look back at this we should all be alarmed fake Donald Trump out of this\nAny candidate any American who had been treated this way it really raises civil liberties concerns that really raises abuse of power concerns and who should all be concerned a body of evidence that our firms ... record as written in his book\nIt is so scary that when you put it all together and now the pieces seemed to be ... literally it but the but those the puzzles together usually start on the outside and you get all the square parts on the outside and then you start feeling and the pieces of the puzzle then the next thing you have a tree then you have the grass and you have the sun\nAnd slowly but surely it seems like we now understand a lot more and that is\nThat we had a group of people that literally set up an entire phony Russia investigation the very people that exonerated Hillary long before they investigated her\nThe very people that literally signed off on warrants that are based on information she had provided by committing fraud to Pfizer cords\nAnd the very same people that after they lost had an insurance policy and now we know what the insurance policy is by any means necessary we're going to get Donald Trump and the way we're going to do it is\nA we're going to eat and secretly record them and we're going to surreptitiously get them to say something that we think we could use against them on top of a pony investigation that they've\nThey initiated through a media release strategy again of the\n... you know one of the things that really ticked me off if there was a plot to frame Donald Trump again the title of my book is I went through meticulously\nThe FBI guidelines and the department of justice regulations on winning how you can launch a counterintelligence investigation of an American citizen\nAnd what I discovered is that the FBI violated every single solitary provision of their own\nGuidelines they had no credible evidence of crimes no plausible intelligence to justify a counterintelligence probe importantly they had no probable cause and yet on July thirty first two thousand and sixteen\nThey officially\nA launch this investigation Peter Struck\nSigned the papers he had just finished meeting with Christopher Steele and in fact the same day that James Comey\nWith Christopher Steele and in fact the same day that James Comey cleared Hillary Clinton twisting the longest touring the facts his FBI was meeting for the first time in Europe\nIn a
