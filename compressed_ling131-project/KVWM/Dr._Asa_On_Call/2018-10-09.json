Mueller oh abortion\nMale a male supremacy a\nYou know you know watch words or the radical left they have they have all of their little characterizations ready to go now Trump has the power to save America and I don't know whether he'll pull a trigger on it but remember Obama did Obama had his IRS poll the tax exempts\nBombing that Obama had his IRS poll the tax exempt status of conservative organizations he didn't like remember that scandal\nDo you know how many of those women in the street with their spontaneously no one does you know how many organizations were funded by George Soros most\nEvery one of the organizations that bust women to ah attack senators in the hallways to disrupt the hearings every one of them was brought in because they're working for these nonprofits remember that's a job for them\nThat's their job is political agitation\nAnd so they're a nonprofit organizations is supposed to be nonpartisan\nThe IRS could pull the status of their organizations literally overnight with a letter\nAnd their funding would dry up\nAnd it has to be done it's as simple as that there are ways that a non violent where you could face these violent people without violence\nAnd I'm afraid that if we don't we're gonna have another catch they probably in this country I sent it to someone over the weekend I don't know if any of your old enough to remember Nineteen Seventy I saved a newspaper from that time because uh\nIt was a significant ... in many ways I'll never forget what happened at Kent State university and the killings accounts they changed the course of American politics you see the radicals were agitated\nIt's an intergenerational group of agitator is incidentally the old hippies of that time are still alive and they've cultivated an entire generation of new hippies if you want to call in that\nAnd the old hippies got the mobs in the streets against the Vietnam War against LBJ and they started rioting on the college campus called Kent State\nWell the governor of the state called out the national guard they fixed bayonets and they faced off against the rabble the long haired rabbit was threatened to take down take down the whole campus\nAll the riders didn't stop no one had ever stop them before unfortunately the rest is historically factual and that is somebody amongst the national guard open fire on them and then others did the little form of mass hysteria by the way and the number of students were shot dead on that campus\nOne of the results of it in addition to the tragedy of the students being shot\nWas that the entire student movement came to a grinding halt\nSuddenly they cut their hair went home to mommy\nAnd took a job in McDonalds they will no longer out there in the streets rioting because they were afraid that they could get shot dead by the national guard\nAnd I'm afraid that this is going to happen if they keep taunting the police if they keep taunting senators if they keep harassing people in restaurants how long is it going to be until a senator who is armed and license to carry\nFeels threatened enough to pull a gun on one of them you think it can happen I told you I was in Washington last April a to visit the president while I was invited by my good friend congressman Columbus in from Texas and he he gave me a personal tour of Congress and he\nShowed me a group of marble stairs aback staircase into into the house of representatives that still has blood on the steps and he told me that there was actually a shootout\nIn Congress between a journalist and a congressman\nBecause the journalist has smeared the congressmen over and over and over again\nTaunted them over and over and over again you think it's new today there's in the Eighteen eighties\nWell it turns out that the journalists came to a Congress with a gun in his hand I don't remember his name and shot the congressman dead on the steps and the blood is still there in the steps now I'll give you another example you may not know this but it's it's history that's all and mass hysteria\nAgain those you know the history those who do not know the history of condemned to repeat it I Hope you learn your history you're not condemned to repeat it\nDo you do that in the early Nineteen fifties\nA group of Puerto Rican nationalist broke into the gallery in the U.S Congress and opened fire on congressman below and killed a number of them did you know that\nAnd so when you see the pain cats or the women screaming and yelling it's not amusing to me\nIt's a form of violence that must be stopped and the only way to stop them is by passing much stricter laws about who can enter Congress stop at the people's house garbage already without living in the in the early days of the founding here where we're now infiltrated\nWere infiltrated they're everywhere they're running the television shows they've infiltrated the university's\nThey've infiltrated the ... the peaceful front groups\nAnd it's only a matter of time until one of these lunatics shoots a senator or congressman and I think that we need to take preemptive action to prevent another massacre in Congress as occurred in the early fifties when a group of Puerto Rican national ... open fire from the galleries on the Congress below now what am I the only person in America remembers that story yes\nAm I the only author in America who knows that story I Can't be am I the only broadcaster who knows that story probably and here I Am would stop mass hysteria having to tell you about it because I'm telling you are right now that unless

Bowman\nGreat thanks Rob and I think the next ten years going into space going to be absolutely amazing as I speak Iraqi government forces are advancing into the center of the city of Ramadi which is controlled by the ... group Islamic state\nAnd I'm sure we've got more plans with just about every major nation don't we\nWell that's kind of kind of ... we didn't have a plan to defend ourselves we wouldn't be doing our job right exactly you\nAre and look for a plan to start with that ... for them or termination so I'm sure that there are people who are more and then now that I Am but uh but if they are much more in a no then they can't talk about it and I'm sure you\nKnow and a half of the captain James and now he spoke out about I'm Sorry I was ready though for war against Japan and uh and um and that kind of sending a message to everybody on active duty I think he was removed resigned after his comments on China\nI keep thinking David that China has its eyes on Taiwan and either has\nHad its high on Taiwan for many many years George\nWould we actually go to war in defense of Taiwan even though we've seen and we're supposed to if China decided they're going to go in and take it\nWell I mean that's a that's kind of the question isn't it and we've always preserve a kind of\nPosition or that we are friends of Taiwan in fact I think of something in our treaty that says something like that that we support the independence and freedom and friendship of Taiwan but we have never actually committed ourselves to its military offense in so many words so that's kind of been left out there\nAnd that's kind of man as a deterrent so what would actually happen is you'd have to have a force authorization and that's one of the things that takes place in the book there's this like the the bait over whether we worked with a defensive Taiwan\nLet's talk about tipping point tell us a little bit about uh the highlights first and the woman usually well\nWe begin with a we begin with this was actually a follow on to the crews are were about ...\nTook a took command of his ship he founded high and dry in Naples harbor the former CEO would take a deceptive and April's and there was a fan bar there that everybody who was there and the ship ends up high and dry on the ... bar I mean it's going if it's\nObviously boy that sounded sharks everybody knows it yet there's a show well feels relieved Dan is\nFamily and the takeover inhalers ship which obviously have a problem not just to see how the problems round throw a crew well I'm after the cruiser I'm here to defend his record because what he did there has to defend it before Congress\n... in the beginning of tipping point you have to go home defend his record\nAnd then return to the ship and then in the Indian Ocean favor where Alan cruises off East Africa Russia to protect shipping lanes for pirates but that is kind of a routine patrol and them and I know the failing starts assaulting with female crew member so we are pulling things directly off what action\nStarts assaulting with female crew members so we start pulling things directly off what actually happened so I'm active duty and the same time a showdown starts between India and Pakistan now say the oil and has kind of a unique capability she's the first job\nThat has the ability to shoot down ballistic missiles in flight and this is a new capability for the surface maybe as you know probably\nUm so as the first theater nuclear war begins in the Indian Ocean fable Ireland is the only ... between the two nations that's how the that's how the thing begins\nNow as you were writing the novel and I'm not going to give away the ending oh I'm I'm I'm writing a way I got it\nBut then as you put this together uh-huh based on a bench in your mind but ... we're looking at the possibilities of real things happening now aren't you\nWell I'm looking at things like the results of war games between India and Pakistan I studied um\nThe or their mobilization exercises and I had to decide what would happen in any event of a war between India and Pakistan\nThat began with or something like a terrorist attack and loom by um it begins with in those llamas was terrorist attack Pakistan and India go to war it begins with a conventional war\nIn Libya I think we're we're in such a conventional war but Pakistan now has nuclear deterrent\nIs Pakistan going to accept losses of a conventional war to India\nI think not so we're looking at the first theater nuclear war which I think George is probably likely within the next twenty to Twenty years I really think we're going to see another a ... a second use of nuclear weapons are being the first of course in Japan\nThis uh this possibility then between Pakistan and India scientists that pull us and China into it\nWell remember how World War one open and write a long time ago\nA long time ago but it opened with um with a coup alliances that\nHad armed against each other for quite a while and\nThere were posturing against each other and then this little incident occurs way off in the periphery in the Balkans and two of the allies began warning each other they began pre immobilize ... maybe ... threats\nAnd the other allies have to move in behind the because her dragon by treaty commitments and commitments of saving face so one by one the allies her dragged into this increasing males scrum or whirlpool of the war\nSo I think that's what could happen or it starts with a regional war between India and Pakistan people get dragged into it by Rand gets dragged in\nJapan gets dragged out in the United states gets dragged out in Taiwan gets dragged them that's how I see it progressing it's kind of like a domino theory in a way but it's widely\nDisease real get pulled in on something like this I\nDidn't really look at Israel in this book how come no I\nI thought that um the u._s. would be involved in the Mid East that's one part of my scenario right in that\nKind of in bold in China or to take more aggressive and expansion of steps in the Pacific because we would be heavily invested elsewhere\nAt this point David do you think China the Chinese government teach our guts\nDo they just tolerate us I mean they're holding trillions of dollars in debt we buy their goods and services why go to war with the United states\nWell I certainly agree I think it would be would be this advantageous to them to go to war but the question is what national interest is worth they're going to war for now what the scenario I've set up does not\nEnvision the current regime being in power\nOkay\nIn other words um and I I almost call this a almost to the month um the Chinese stock market has crowd than my scenario\nIn your area well that could happen\nYeah I I I kind of call that one but but my my stock market crashes much worse it's actually a major depression in China and a continuing character in my book a General James you're wrong it was appeared before\nA is kind of putting like figure who transitions from the intelligence service in China to the first big you're in the state so now he's the leader of China and in order to distract people from their economic misery is\nHe works on an expansionist and imperialist if you will of course\nI'm calling for if a nationalist hymns thinking playing the card that China is going to become what he calls the people's empire is going to exercise a Gemini and the Pacific so we're just moving things a little bit ahead in the future if you will\nSoon as we look at China or in the United states at this point a novel side what could truly be the tipping point a to create this issue or you know we see the encroachment issues over these islands that are out there what do you think could really be the catalyst\nWell you know I think the catalyst to probe you're looking at these are the islands that you're talking about um I assume you're talking about the aerosols him yeah outlays okay [noise]\nUm the pair of cells um the ... cells are pretty firmly and the Chinese capital this point the other ... the only other country that has a claim there is a Vietnamese and frankly we're not I'm In a position to come to the support of the Vietnamese yeah\nI'm the ... that's a very interesting territorial dispute because you've got four to five countries\nClaiming all these little island there and the pilots uh the four or five violets with the Chinese claim are very small just barely above sea level and there's really no oil or gas deposits or anything else there that are in the public record that is worth fighting over\nSo I don't really see a national interest at stake I don't see the Chinese going to war with his friend\nKnocks or that stay with us David gonna hit the break but we'll come right back and talk more about keeping point John coast to coast\nSigning up new recoup sooner free email newsletters today at ... dot com [noise]\n\n\n[laughter]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nThat yeah I Do so much closer to a Japan\nThey're exactly there there between Taiwan and Japan they're the Senkaku Islands there about a hundred miles north east of Taiwan\nAnd the interesting thing about them is they're on their own populated they're larger than a scrappy Iowans they could be air bases that could be amphibious faces\nBut the great thing about them for the Chinese is if they flank Taiwan\nAnyone who occupiers will soon Koch violence can completely blocked off\nSea and air access who most of the industrial centers of Taiwan to the capital Taipei so actually you kind of got if you were on a chessboard and Taiwan where the king you've actually got the king and check if you occupy the Senkaku Islands\nSo yeah yeah as a as China continues to build up its amphibious forces and it's therefore if if if they're able to quickly occupy the same ... and keep the Japanese from kicking them back out they've effectively one Taiwan without a battle on Taiwan itself\nWell that's that's a strong possibility there\nWell the question then is um we would have to come to Japan's was system than we are although we're not bound by treaty specifically to assist Taiwan we are bound by treaty\nTo assist Japan so it would be a negative way dragon Sam unless we said hey no we're not going to fight for them having an island\n[noise] well ... not meant to be broken sometimes and say\nWell we're not supposed to do that right\nRight right we got one with turkey too so where does Russia fit into this scenario if they do it all\nOh yes uh Russia's definitely going to be the winner and any fight between China and the United states or the Chinese block the allied block Russia is going to stand back and just Korean money they are going to send a arms are going to send ammunition\nOr they're going to make money hand over fist selling things to both sides\nBut they're not going to directly get involved against us siding with China I really\nDon't see how it would be to their advantage or in fact it wouldn't be very much to their disadvantage if they decided against China because China has an enormous land army\nChina has the demographic advantage over Russia and Russia has a lot of empty very inviting land in Siberia oh oh I can see the Chinese saying look at all that land look at all our people there's something wrong with this picture\nWe wanted back [laughter] so quickly and they have claimed to and also\nYou know that's true ... in ... in your scenario does anybody pull out a new here\nWell uh yes uh I don't want to give away the ending of the book right back yes I guess ah I guess the answer is affirmative\nAll right well let's not talk about the ... the book but let's talk about the possibilities of things happening for real oh my God it's to our nation's pullout new Steven the obliterate half the planets\nWell the question is how what is war termination between two nuclear arm powers we've never had a war between two nuclear armed powers and the question is how do you come and they started to war\nAnd that is a very sticky question George because either side can escalate and then either side can counter escalate were to sit down\nAnd visit end with mutual obliteration exactly that's why that's why we and the USSR never went to war really we're both who scared\nI mean do you really when if you're the last one standing with us with one city in all your other cities cities are in rubble and your citizens are dead I don't think I don't think you when\nI don't think you know absolutely not some but the question is how do you have the war that if you if you can have victory\nOr you can't really have defeat because China can invade the United states we're ... we're and they have nuclear weapons and we can invade China if they have nuclear weapons than what the war termination possibility here how do you end the war that's uh that's really not a military question that's a political pressure\nShe'll do they weigh in these war games that are both sides your plane uh-huh\nDo they weigh one\nWill this nation really pull out its new ... will they take the for strikes will they make the first strike or will they just go conventionally in in in even if they think they're going to lose the more ah in some geographical area they're going to back down and not use the new do they think that way\nIn every war game that I've participated in or heard about\nIt he has been very very difficult to get either side to get nuclear\nAh the umpires have to really coached them practically hold guns to their head and say now you have to you know a initiate nuclear phase of the conflict nobody wanted to do it now that's not to say that it couldn't happen by accident that you couldn't have some rogue commander pull the trigger\nThat you couldn't have um some naturally them like you were talking about comets or earlier in the program\n... let's say you have a meteor um hit a northern China like the meteor that hit Siberia and not too long ago let's say the Chinese take that for us nuclear strike it could happen by accident\nTo take that for us nuclear strike it could happen by accident\nI Believe most Russians half the time a few years ago were fourteen hundred people were injured thought that maybe somebody ... needed a new over their atmosphere well\nI'm I mean that's a natural natural conclusion there\nWell you know we don't you just even\nSatellite some crimes have difficulty telling what a certainly that is is it a nuclear detonation or is it something else\nWhat about budget by a bus buys ended and the possibility of somebody pushing too far I'm Amazed by the way and landed near pollutants restraint against turkey shooting down their jets a I'm Amazed that he didn't do anything that shows me something\nWell you know or just because he didn't do anything right away doesn't mean he doesn't have some play are laid plans to get his own back he's not a the kind of guy that let something like that like I don't think\nI was always told while I was in the navy that uh the greatest deterrent to war was our nuclear subs that we had them parked off the coast of everybody and that are in a moment's notice we could launch and hit them within ten minutes\nWell absolutely but a Chinese are also have a certain submarines and um and ah that also acts as a deterrent force against us and as time goes on\nTheir deterrent is going to increase in density and capability that's where I say nobody really knows what the war termination scenarios\nWhen two nuclear powers go to war and that's what makes it so dangerous and that is why the U.S the USSR were always so wary of each other and why we send and um\nYou know we sent in cats cause we uh we would recruit third parties to fight for us\nWe're right not to face each other directly\nDavid what about weakness China would look at us and say okay the Americans are in Afghanistan\nAre not as much as we were but we're still there or were in Iraq um we're we're spread out all over the planet there two weeks to have a conventional war against us therefore we're going to do we want to do they're not going to stop this\nWell ah so you're asking what our weaknesses are\nWell I'm asking you what China would think about are we oh\nWell we definitely have some Achilles' heels uh\nCertainly compared to them we have a lack of manpower um and not just not just raw manpower\nBut the army now is having difficulty fulfilling quotas for the all volunteer force and that is just all volunteer force we would need a much expanded army and the case of a major conflict\nUm we have problems with obesity we have problems with physical readiness we have problems with industrial infrastructure oh here's a\nHere's something that I learned that it was really going to make your skin crawl Ninety percent of the gunpowder that the army and the armed forces use in their small arms comes from one plant in Saint marks Florida Ninety percent and it gets even worse\nNot only do they make the gunpowder from the small arms and one plant but also they make them propellant\nFor the actual waiters in missiles and um things like ... feet other actor waiter is that we use and more advanced weapons so you put that one plan out of commission and uh we're basically crippled\nThat you know that plants will be taken out in an instant wouldn't it\nWell a sabotage um one strike from a submarine offshore um and and were crippled\nWe a mask you lead to Japan after World War two we literally took took away their military there's no way they could defend themselves against China\nOh Japanese yeah now yeah\nOh the Japanese have an excellent navy um the Japanese how they call it a self defense worth but it is beautifully modern\nAnd do you think they could battled China\nI think they could do a very very there would be a lot of records floating in Korea straight a lot of records but I think they could uh I think they could it would be fairly even I think and when things like that are fairly even the other side tend not to try it", "city": "Show Low"}
