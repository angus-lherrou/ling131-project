even knowing what they are doing following this pie piper\nWhat can the president do about it he can't do anything about it right now all we can do is try to spread the truth and try to explain the history and the background of what is going on before and it's too late however if we cannot stop this from happening what will happen is the mobs will overreach and overextend themselves\nAnd what will happen unfortunately is what happened to Kent State university once again history will repeat itself in a very ugly matter biggest law and order once it breaks down breaks down across the lines\nAnd if the entire society crumbles that's the end of it for all of us our water supplies will go our food distribution supplies will go or gasoline supplies will go that's what Anna Cambridge

the law since we're living in a relatively low all this time\nThe hands of the police have been tied as I said you it started with eight straight years of an artillery barrage from Morocco bomber and Eric Holder who attacked a police mercilessly eight straight years\nNot only that but they took every ... left wing lawyer they could find at NYU and Colombia and sent them out to every police department that they could get their little dirty hands into and put them in his so called monitors here in Oakland, California there's been a monitor\nWatching every move the very top\nAs a result is totally ... the police are afraid to do anything would you blame them that's exactly what holder and Obama wanted they wanted the gangs to run wild in the streets\nAnd so here we are trying to conduct a lives go about our business be left alone but we can't they won't leave us alone in fact that's part of the dictates of the Communist Party usa they even scream as long as summer uncomfortable you will be uncomfortable\nAnd then they call you a white supremacist if you speak up to them\nThings of that nature so what is your defense again\nI'm telling you right now including all of your pompous little liberals here in the San Francisco area who think that you're going to enjoy your shape and he says forever\nOr you left wing losers in the bay area I think you're above it all especially those of you over there on the Oakland Berkeley complex you think you could sit and smear it everybody and go about your business that somehow even though you're worth a fortune through inheritance or through hard work or through luck\nThat you're going to continue enjoy yourself and that the mobs that you'll have encouraged will only attack your political enemies you I'm mistaken\nUs mistaken because the guillotine is a two edged sword and as I said to you earlier and on and on and on his eye proven mass hysteria which is a book even your liberals must read if you want to educate yourself as to a rational balanced middle road\nBecause it's a history book was the guillotine started to fall\nDuring the French Revolution and killed every revel a counter revolutionary they could find\nThat shocked to head off every counter revolutionary they could find\nDid the guillotine stopped falling no it was a Thursday blade thirsty for more blood and so what happened next is what happened then Castro's Cuba\nIs what happened in Bolshevik Russia it's what happened in communist China soon the guillotine was dropped on the enemies of the revolution with in the revolutionaries who started to fight with each other for power it was a pure power struggle then they started to kill each other\nBut again the blade was still thirsty\nYou understand what happens when a revolution has unleashed on a nation look at Syria how many years has this been going on that was a revolution that was a civil war has not ended yet has it if that's what you want in America over there and the shape and these hills of the East Bay that is what you're going to have\nAnd I call for a middle ground I called for calm\nThat doesn't mean cowardice it doesn't mean run from them it means stand up to them as I Do every day on this radio show do you know what chances I take doing this do you have any idea what chances I take both personally and commercially to speak to you\nWith the education the educated opinions that I gave you based on history based on politics based on fact you any idea what it takes to do this to navigate the waters I Am in the problem for us those of us would disgusted by these liberal degenerates\nIs that we have a booming economy because the Trump and so people as long as they have food on the table they'll look aside at the pornography on television and people will say what can you do the cities are filled with crime and violence and corruption we see it every day in the Senate and the house we know it's corrupt\nAnd ah although people the average person is sick of it\nAnd ... and the crime is out of control in many cities to take a look at San Francisco where just the other day a so called homeless bum beat up a young father with this child in a park and nothing was done to him nothing human feces in the streets needles in the streets nothing\nThat people look the other way because the economy has good\nHowever listened to me carefully\nWhen and if we have a blowout in the economy and I believe there's a woman in the upcoming\nThe parallels I've given you between the wimax Republic of the into war years in Germany and modern America\nModern America will bring about a fascism like you've never seen do I want it absolutely not having trying to argue against that I tried to warn you on the radio finally I put it all together in my book stop mass hysteria will it become a big enough best seller like I said to the other day\nThe stereo will it become a big enough best seller like I said to the other day certain books have changed the course of society and I mentioned one the other day\n... Rachel Carson's book to Silent Spring in the sixties changed the whole world made us aware of the ecosystems that we're all living in that one book that title alone did it that was one of many along the way but um I think that the one that was done by Sinclair Lewis about meat packing the meatpacking industry\nOr he wrote a book about the horrors of the Florida House that changed things in American brought about the pure food and drug laws of Nineteen fourteen I Believe books changed society the jungle the jungle thank you\nA single book and change the course of human history\nI'm hoping stop mass hysteria comes along just at the right time but I Am facing such a headwind of a slew of books by people who have television shows\nThat have a round the clock publicity liberals promote their own conservatives do not because of a outright competition they don't want to promote me but you are the audience that can change America's destiny I'm telling you\nAnd you can do so by talking about history but first you have to learn a little bit about it and that little snippet I gave it today is only part of it the rescue me scene and stop or a mass hysteria I Want to conclude with\nThis if the economy blows down\nAnd there is a real pain in this country that is when you're going to see the real right wing backlash\nYou will see it then you say it can happen now\nWell it is happening right now there's an undercurrent right now a ... on the current that people have had enough of this filth enough of this filth they can't take it anymore and it came to ahead with the Kavanaugh hearings when we saw when we saw the destruction of a very decent man\nYou know anyone that went to college and didn't drink\nBut yet we saw what they did to this man they stopped at nothing to destroy him and his family and that I think could be could be the apex of the of the uh the high watermark of liberalism\nI think it could be but the real flashpoint will happen when there is a major blowout in the stock market\nAnd the economy collapses that could happen suddenly than the American people will back a hundred percent strange and charismatic individuals who will offer it to

really really satisfied and um and then actually after the fact when they lose the weight you can take it away\nIn the in the the the state therapy can you create and we did too dark here but can you breed 'em and cheering candidate skin can you literally make somebody a B a B a monster an assassin whatever\nLittle I I've never tried that\nDon't don't try it [laughter] no dry\nAnd I know I I was calling to try it but um there there's something to that effect in your conscious mind there's something called you're critical factor or you're critical facilities [noise] so if I came up to you and I said\nYou know you have now decided to be an assassin okay and you enjoy killing people you know blah blah blah blah blah\nWell if I said that to a person in regular hypnosis or I could say that you are right now um\nYeah you you you get this critical factor in the conscious mind in the world whoa whoa whoa wait a minute no no no I mean that goes against my belief systems um no there's no way in the world I'm going to do that\nHowever with this other way of doing this or you know the sleep hypnosis they need to stay away there is no critical factor\nIt's sleeping so what you say is fact for the subconscious mind so hypothetically you might be able to do something like that\nSo tell me how did you tie this hypnosis into this ... where a realm how did that happen\nChip doses into this ... where a realm how did that happen\n[noise] we're all in in my regular hypnosis sessions\nFor years I I really considered myself the clinician you know I I didn't really conduct a lot of past life regrets shows and I really I went by the book however I develops this um\nThis other way to do hypnosis and I'll briefly explain it so let's say you're coming to me and let's say you're clinically depressed and I would I'd I'd ask you before the session hey when is this the worst\nIt let's say you said well in the morning it's it's worse in one I'm Alone that's what I feel depressed so in a in a hypnosis session\nThere's something called parts therapy so I I Would have you identify the part with them you that wants to be happy to feel good\nAnd I would have you actually literally imagine it in a chair and give it a shape of feeling and then we would name it\nThen I Would have you identify the part that's causing the depression and we put it in the chair and you give it a shape the feeling and the name\nAnd then what I Do is I talk directly with the closet to park\nI talked to actually with the the part that's caused the depression to figure out what the heck's going up and surprisingly\nAbout maybe twenty percent of the time\nThat part that's causing the problem actually is not a part of the person it's actually a spiritual attachment and\nSpiritual attachment it could be um a deceased person\nOr it could be I guess you could see it like this like like a demon what can I get the energy so after you know doing this for for several years I became very good at it would find out if this part that's causing the problem\nIs really a part of that person or is it a spiritual attachment\nAnd that's when things get pretty interesting [laughter] I'll be honest with you I mean I've asked these attachment team you know why are you doing this to see my client or why why are you giving them migraine headaches and I've heard things like because it's fun\nYou know things like that I'm like whoa so I'm the spiritual well really ... you know it really comes into play and especially when they're thinking conscious mind isn't there\nUm you can tap you know you can have a law or long conversations with people's spirits guides or you can regrets them to pass lies you can actually progress them into the future so the spiritual part of the thing was really it really comes into play quite a bit\nNow ... years in the hypnotic state\nIn the spirit world I mean do they communicate with somebody who's passed on to me what what are you able to do with them\nWell I'm you know like I said if there's a problem it could be a spiritual attachment so you know I can get the person's name if they're related to the person I'm I've I've seen several times where\nThe the attachment actually is is who passed away you know or uncle Joe so um\nYou can do that um when you talk to a person's spirit guide we all have at least one or two spirits assigned to us\nRight uh usually it's more like four or five so what you can do with that is before the session you can you know I can ask my my client say hey you are there any question that you'd like to get the answer\nAnd it could be personal questions it could be like you know what is my purpose in life you know ... or they're trying to make a decision you know should I Do this or should I Do that\nSo you can get all of that person's questions answered which is really pretty cool um also what you can do\nIs you can get healing done on that person's body [noise] so what I like to do is like if they have a specific problem or if they have some kind of specific physical problem I Will call that up to the spirit guide\nI also always have the spirit I Do like a body scan\nNow do you communicate with Tim do you communicate with the spirit guide to the person who's been hypnotized\n[noise] yeah that's the way it works um I I basically have that spirit used the voice of the person that's in\nA while while you're talking to that spirit guide\nYeah that was amazing oh I'm I guess technically that's called channeling your channeling that spirit and they're talking through the voice of the person and hypnosis\nHow do you know that when you're doing this because I'm looking at the hip to entice person almost like a ... G board how do you know that that spirit that's coming through is legit and not some demon for example trying to trick you\nYeah good point well what I what I always do prefer are getting into channeling any spirit in as we used to protect her [noise] so like I actually set of protection\nThe session and then into session before we get to that point um there there's some techniques that you can do to ... Percival with white light and to protect them\nAll right let's talk about that protection when we come back in just a moment Tim Bartley is our special guest we're talking about hypnotism next hour we'll take your calls if you've ever been hypnotized checked in with us we'll be back get\nDaily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the coup soon newsletter sign up to the ... dot com\nThat no that's absolutely right and it could be dangerous for you to him as the hip to test for these things to leak through\nYeah exactly exactly and you know also you you you want to make sure that the spirit\nYou know there's there's no doubt that you can channels spirits and talk to them but if you get a spirit that are not the nicest end to the you know they could give you like Ninety five percent accurate information\nAnd then the last five percent they might be like yanking your chain you know what I mean so are you really want to protect against that kind of thing as well\nAs anybody under hypnosis gone into any kind of got a real sounds or anything like that\n[noise] yeah I've had that happened a couple of times all blame like what I said before I had this one woman I don't know it was like five six years ago she was coming to me for migraine headaches and she walks in and she's all like to do her\nAnd she had these really thick glasses on some some classes in ... you know she was feeling really horrible\nAnd in her session\nYou know the part that was causing the migraines was a spiritual attachment and I asked him you know why why are you doing this to her and that's ... that's what I've heard this a couple of times but\nIt's sad because it's fun and her voice to drop like to opt my\nThat I've heard that a couple of times\nLike it's because it's hiding something like that\nYeah yeah pretty much all so I did a session once with this man and he said that every time he closed his eyes and I'm Talking just blinking\nShe would feel the shimmering word that would say you know kill that all these negative shimmering word that turned out to be an attachment and um I kind of built up the story to get rid of it I said you know\n... you know my client his name was bill I remember this so I'm like Bill has changed she's not negative anymore and\nLike the tracks flight there or you negative energy you have no place here any more so as to count on one you're going you know we're vanishing you were getting rid of you so I did the town ten down to one\nAt the counter one I Can't you know all the lights in my room and went out\nAnd then they turn back um and it was like a bomb exploded in the room like like the shock wave of uh\nAnd uh after the session I asked him I said did you feel that and he's like oh yeah so that was that was pretty tripped out [laughter]\nTen people learn said this needs therapy on their own and put themselves in into a hypnotic state\nYeah yes you can um I I look at this this thing that I've developed more as like a meditative ... though\nAnd for you to learn it you know anybody can learn it\nAnybody can do therapy sessions or conduct spiritual session\nAnd I'm really what it is in the training it's this script that I came up with and you have to use your voice properly but to do it for yourself here's the thing once\nYour conditions to enter this ...\nYou can enter it very very quickly\nAnd so if you if you learn this you could use like self hypnosis [noise] or you can record you know things like on your computer for things that you would like to work on for yourself so once your condition to ensure that stay\nIt's kinda like well what are you on you know do you want endless energy or do you want an overall feeling of well being and happiness\nUm how would you like to really dislike fattening food and how would you like to really love to exercise you know and it goes on and on and on and and you can\nYou can pull out spirit guide all the time talk to them or because they're always trying to talk to you or that that's the number one thing I hear all the time when I'm Talking to them I always ask hey\nHave you been trying to talk to you know my client let's say the clients name is Joe\nOkay you know spirit guide have you been trying to talk to Joe Miller like yes in has even listening to you know [laughter] I fear that all the time\nWhat is Tim what's what is the criteria for the spirit guide to be the spirit guide\nWell the way I understand it and what I've seen 'em they are\nBasically your friends on the other side you know their their friends um a lotta times that there are people that you know a for instance for me unfortunately my sister passed away in two thousand and nine and she's now one of my spirit guide\nAnd I actually communicate with her rather frequently\nI actually communicate with her rather frequently\nSo a lot of times it deceased loved ones or friends on the other side that that step in and each spirit guide they have like their own half\nYou know like one might help you in one part of your life while another on helps you in another part of your life and they and they do rather pay they do change out\nThe ability for you to hypnotize someone and for them to stay in this induce state what is the longest time period gym you had somebody under\nProbably about three hours that's a long time yeah yeah it is um\nDo you have to keep reinforcing the hypnosis to keep them under what once they're under the under\nYeah pretty much once they're under the under um the whole going deeper into hypnosis or being under is I'm\nKind of miss perceived\nLike like I was saying before when you go into a regular hypnosis the thinking conscious mind is still there you know it's just kind of pushed to the high\nUm when you go into the the the state or the sleep hypnosis the conscious mind is gone so either way you can have a very very long session with the person\nAnd I'm the only thing that might pop 'em out is like if you know like their arm fell asleep or ... or something like that you know or they're physically had where they had to go to the bathroom you know in the middle of the session that can happen sometimes\nHave you ever had a session where you couldn't pull somebody out or being hypnotize they were like stuck there\nAre no that that actually cannot happen um you know if you think about it hypnosis is just brainwaves that's all it is we have a beta alpha beta and delta brainwaves so like when you're away\nYou your brain waves are very fat\nKind of tightly knit together then when your brainwaves slowed down a little bit you go into something that they call alpha and that kind of like when you're at work let's say in your daydreaming about being at the beach or something and then somebody comes up and says well hey Tim as like oh oh\nOh yeah Hi you know kind of thing and then under that is data which is hypnosis slash a meditative state and then under that is the delta which is dream less sleep\nSo if you're in any of those rounds\nSomebody can come up in in wake you up or snap the out of it instantly so a hypnosis is really that pay the area so you you can't get stopped in it it's pretty much impossible\nWhen you're driving in some people have no recollection on how they got from point a to point B rather than they just got there and and they kind of forget the drive in between is that self hypnosis what is that\n... yeah it is yeah why that happens is you're staring through the windshield and you know their assignments and trees passing you in your career field vision right\nAnd when you focus on something your brainwaves slow down\nSo like when you drive you know like how did I get here or or if you remember being back in school and the teachers just kind of rambling on and on and on you know and then you kind of combat in your life I have no idea what you just\nHad it [laughter]\nYou know a dance hypnosis so we're or you can simply stare at it at a down on a wall for five minutes and you'll go into hypnosis so it's really just focusing on one thing basically just wanted\nPeople heard you on the radio when you were trying to hypnotize people and not and we're going to do that but who'd you hypnotize people over the radio some somebody driving a car for example who'd they go into a hypnotic state", "city": "Show Low"}
