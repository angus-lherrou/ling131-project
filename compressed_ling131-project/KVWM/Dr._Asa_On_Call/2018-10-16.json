and you you like you said just said it's just cleared the Mississippi it out of the store but they'll lifting very rapidly of toward ... with us in Bay\nAnd it was just a beautiful beautiful story that you know the weather that we just get all excited about because all of those prime which were ingredients are in place\nI Want to do some of these clowns back to California when I get back there I got to tell you I Am just never seen it rains so much Scott and show hard it would break for a little bit and then it would pour again you know ... and it just didn't stop\nIt was so intense and it it is is that ... that has been so insistent on hate off the California coast that allowed that trough to be so aggressive to form so aggressively you know in the swing up a roots that is anchored off the Carolinas\nAnd that rich just is not going to let go forcing this store up into the Hudson Bay area and so there's still this pool of moisture league during over the southeastern us there is another impose Raleigh across California the desert southwest as we speak\nAnd so that wouldn't they be able to tap another round of moisture and then surge I get towards the the eastern great lake states in about Seventy two hours\nBut that's been the problem with this winter it why I've been so disappointed with the El Nino and the central and Southern California's these regions are not letting go as far as one off the coast of Scandinavia that is completely diverting this entire jet stream\nTo GMO containing products and to cause people who want to buy organic have a very hard time doing that because they wouldn't know what products were truly GMO free\nSo for the time being we won\nWe won for the time being the effort was made a very strong effort from GM a Monsanto lobbying the Senate to get the quote unquote must pass\nOmnibus spending bill that the president signed on December fifteenth one point one trillion dollar spending bill to get that bill to contain the dark act\nAnd that effort to get that right or in their\nFailed because of stiff overwhelming and really unrelenting opposition from the public to the bill\nA survey evidence now shows than nine of ten Americans want GM owes to be revealed on the label of foods they buy and so that ah that that's quite an audience to draw from almost every American opposes this thing\nWith attorney Jonathan ... he's also written a couple of books global censorship of self information and the rise of tyranny is website linked up the coast to coast day I'm dot com you have written a position paper about the FTC in biodegradable claims John tell us a little bit about that\nYes [noise] well there's a there's a case that we had called EC um bio films at the FTC and this is a true tragic eating it shows you a the degree of abuse of power\nBy federal agencies none of us want the public to be deceived but when government reaches beyond deception to determine winners and losers in the marketplace\nThat's an abuse most Americans would agree I think is not to be tolerated and that's what happened in this case here a company the M bio films invented a product that is a a an organic additive to plastic\nAnd it's like a collar and if he melted into plastic conventional plastic and its dispersed evenly throughout every part of the plastic and it causes all the plastic to be biodegradable it makes plastic so that when it's disposed of\nIn into the environment\nAs long as they're bio degrading ... out there and the environment they will it here to this and help destroy the plastic so it's truly a remarkable invention and it causes things that would remain in the environment for thousands of years plastic to be able to disappear well\nEnvironment for thousands of years plastics to be able to disappear well\nRather arbitrarily and an anti a competitive way\nThis Federal Trade commission ruled that the company could not use the term biodegradable on any plastic products unless it could prove in advance of disposing of it\nThat the plastic would completely break down into elements in nature within five years after customary disposal\nThat standard as all the scientific testimony in the case revealed\nCould not be met not even by someone selling oranges or paper or a an apple core none of those things can break down completely in nature rely heavily unpredictably everywhere\nWithin five years after disposal like like a all biodegradable substances it depends on where it's disposed\nOf now what is the you'd had been brought to let's say ten years would that have been possible\nIt'd be more likely [noise] ever were brought into Twenty years it would be extremely likely for a lot of things but the point the point here is that they arbitrarily selected five years knowing based on the testimony in the case\nThat nothing can break down into elements in nature within five years no substance can predictably breakdown and elements when disposed of in a landfill or you know if someone throw something away and it's\nIt lands up in a place is heavily late with concrete or something may be there for hundreds of years not broken into elements furthermore things don't it's it's on scientific because things don't break down into elements they break down into compounds [noise]\nAnd so the whole thing is a disaster and uh it it shows just how out of touch with reality or this Federal Trade commission is there was a dissent by one commissioner it's pretty severe dissent\nThey took the the majority in this case in the commission\nA also created this standard based on what they perceived to be a minority of some Fifteen Percent of the public public perception in other words even though they had no strong evidence to contradict\nThe science proving that this made plastics ... they said that uh some Fifteen Percent based on survey evidence of the public thought that if something's called biodegradable it should completely disappear within five years\nAnd that's not even true but assuming that's true it's kind of insane says if\nYou asked uh the the public\nUh whether or not the earth revolved around the sun or the sun revolved around the earth and let's say some twenty percent of the public said the sun revolved around the earth\nWill then would you prohibit people from saying that there's a their model of the solar system a was a model of the solar system because some twenty percent of the people erroneous believe believe that the sun revolved around the earth\nI mean you know it's that kind of ridiculous thinking of course you don't contradict scientific fact based on a minority opinion or you would rather say people need to be educated but not this FTC it's insane\nWhy don't they seemed to side with the public the you always seemed to side with big business\n[noise] well I think that it is a combination of two things one thing uh I think at least one of these commissioners commissioner Julie Brill is really so bent against the marketplace\nThat a free market that she will always voted against any company that's brought before them also the system is rigged here uh George\nYou have the party that brings the charges is also the party that creates the rule and there's also the party that ultimately judges who's guilty\nSo in other words the commission issued the complaint against ISI am alleging that their statement a biodegradable was deceptive\nAnd then in the end the commission judges whether it's charge it's charge was correct well of course they're going to say it's correct and the long history in this thing ah since the Nineteen thirties has been when the commission accuses somebody\nOf deception they're always right and you know in this case George the administrative law judge at the Federal Trade commission ruled in our favor\nSo they reverse their own administrative law judge to come to the determination that ISI em had violated their rule and now the matter is on appeal to the sixth circuit and we're hoping for justice there\nJonathan back to a GMOs and we're going to take calls with you just a moment how many products are truly out on the marketplace that are genetically modified\nOh my goodness George three quarters of all vegetable products sold in the United states are hollow we contain GMO recorders\n[noise] it's it's ... if you go to the grocery store and it doesn't say organic on it the probability is it contains GMOs\nYeah I I think you're probably right in the price difference between organic and GMOs is a big disparity they're\nReally not that much of a disparity that's the that's the economic reason why the\nMonsanto's of the world and the grocery Manufacturers Association are so desperately fighting for ah this this deception bill the reason is that there's a small margin of profit\nUh and in order to compete even if they were if they were to reveal GMOs were present people would rather pay just a little more and get organic and not experiment with GMOs in their bodies are their children's bodies\nAnd and that's the that's the rub for this or industry but rather than be honest rather than put GMOs on their product in truly compete by arguing to consumers the GMOs are okay they want to Deceive Us so that we don't know GM well\nAnd and they do we're coming back from phone calls on GMOs with Jonathan anymore next\nBill passed dark act passed and then go to organic consumers dot org and they can learn about the bill more about information how to fight it\nAnd also they can financially contribute to the cause and they can also text nine seven seven seven nine to sign up for rapid response\nGiving updates on this this fight isn't over we won a very major round but in January it's coming right back out of the the sponsors of this this awful bill are going to put it back into play in the Senate in January and the fights going to happen all over again\nCan we beat them again\nThink we can George with your help them with the help of all these groups my goodness people really did stand up and and they you know they sent in all of the emails and called their members of Congress and they sent a a you know there were radio interviews and their articles all over the place an op ed pieces it was fantastic\nAnd if we can do that again whenever this thing raises its ugly head or we can keep it down but the sad reality is boy industry has invested in this one and they really are fighting to get it passed\nTo try to keep people ignorant about what's in their foods\nWell I Love it when something like this one a plan works Jonathan huh it's it's it's wonderful\nIt's a case of David versus Goliath and David again here you know\nA one and it it it really to see that uh the the money the unlimited resources financial resources or something like Monsanto and\nGrocery Manufacturers Association all they're allowing lobby is on the hill to see them work so diligently getting this awful bill passed and they have consumers voices\nOr be the ones that prevented it is it's remarkable particularly in today's day and age a there's a lot of corruption in Washington and to see this happen word democracy work\nIs a very impressive\nThere and let us go to the phones now let's go to South Carolina to get things started page berries to the Rockies settled Barry\nHow well they're George always a pleasure and ensure\nMy gosh oh you're you're ... you know ... or because you remember a little bit about my biochemistry background that's right ah I I called my cell phone cameras were about ...\n[laughter] which is actually there was no such a thing anyway\n[laughter] I've got four to five years of experience in the pharmaceutical business and I'll never forget Joe Wertz forty five years ago this past June I graduated from college at night seven year versed in North Carolina Wilmington\nAnd I'm I'm I'm never forget my geneticists a mentor and favor faster and a ... it was about two and I'm\n... ... ... ... talk a little bit about this a or a genetically modified foods that are permanent and the future\nAnd he said it was not that far away\nAnd he said that's not going to be a good way to bully me and so sure enough has been forty five years I'm sitting here but I I I Love to just a compliment you show was like that and a sale you and hear what he has to comment about what I just say\nAll right thanks very go ahead John\nWell your guest is right this has been a a an effort by industry to basically patent foods what they want to do the reason why Monsanto so invested in this is if they can win there'll be able to take synthetic ingredients\nAre genetically modified plants happened those genetic modifications and then ultimately profit or to the extent they can get it to be back with us from the marketplace they can profit off of the sale of every food source\nAnd be a integrated into the market for every food so it's an attempt to take substances that otherwise or I'm patentable natural food substances\nAnd transformed them into patentable substances and profit off of it enormously so it's been a long term vision of Monsanto and many other companies that are likewise engaged in this effort\nTo bring about this transformation and long term it's really not good for consumers will result in a an elevation and the cost of food and it will harm people because\nYou won't have the choice of getting something that's organic there right now George pushing the FDA into a rule making which it's commenced ah with willingly\nTo define the term natural and the great fear here is that the FDA like it did in protecting Monsanto in the past\nIs going to couch to Monsanto and caused the term natural to be defined in the law in a way that will allow genetically modified foods to be referred to expressly as natural on the label\nAnd I don't drink a lot of people won't it it sure will all of\nThis is a campaign of deception because they fear\nAll of this is a campaign of deception because they fear that they cannot win the argument with the public that there's no difference between something that's genetically modified and something that's organic yet with all new products\nWe look to the party that's introducing them to convince you of their benefit here they want to save themselves that expands have the government deceive every body by law and and the naval themselves to remain in the market through confusion\nIt's a short sided thing when it comes to freedom of speech and and when it comes to\nUh the rights of consumers but it's a far sided vision as your as your caller management of an industry that wants to profit off of things that would otherwise be available to us without that additional profit going to industry\nOften Sacramento now we'd go Jeff's with us on coast to coast Jess taken away sir\nHey gentle and good luck it's been a long time uh I was talking to you I'm I guess it's been about three or ... that is a long time gentlemen he's out and ours are welcome back lots on like all the right thing I was talking to you about\nA mile or storming down highly nine and a and then I have these cassette tapes and term backwards on me at all that stuff [laughter] number but are you still there yeah\nBut go ahead go ahead now Jonathan's question\nUm yeah the the old GM out thing is uh basically uh what I found out about it\nIs the uh\nThe man shot so a products that protect or the\nProject their crops there is a one ingredient that Senate that doesn't uh it doesn't wash out or\nWelders that isn't during a problem Jonathan with roundup\nYes the ... ... or whatever the the er ... than eight or ... events pronouncing it is a chemical compound that is is round up and that the industry represented that it would break down in nature problem\nIs that it does not break down in the nature and that causes all sorts of perverse or environmental effects in ... and ... and it increases the risk of cancer and it's just ruin is really and that is\nOne of a a long term consequences of excessive agricultural and domestic home base reliance on things like round up\nIn the old days when they would Springfield I've always wondered if the vegetables tomatoes celery whatever sucked up those pesticides in we eat them as well did we\nAbsolutely uh we we are a victim of a you know on the one hand you have methods that were incorporated that to some extent reduced the a deleterious effects of weeds and I have a insects\nOn crops and then the downside of that was that elements of the insecticides that were responsible for the destruction of these\nUh paths are also a deleterious to people and uh when it's absorbed into the crops and we continuously eat those food sources well or some of these things accumulate in our bodies they don't do pay\nSome dissipate some are not harmful to us per se unless we ingest it directly others though and this may involve the majority of such an insecticide and pesticides\nUm actually are quite harmful to us and may well be a contributing to um muted ... city and carcinogen a city and and people", "city": "Show Low"}
