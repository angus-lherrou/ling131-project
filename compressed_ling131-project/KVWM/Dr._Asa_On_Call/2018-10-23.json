nine six four or five\nAM on news talk radio Katie WN and Katie Jay\n\nAnd welcome back to the coast to coast George ... what you want and Ford founder of Silicon Valley based software development firm he has more than twenty five years experience in the fields of computer design software development yields and computer engineering degree from the University of Michigan and the graduate business degree from the University of California\nIs a frequent keynote speaker on the subject of accelerating progress in robotics and artificial intelligence\nAnd here he is on coast to coast author also of rise of the robots technology and the new threat of a jobless future hey Martin good to have you with us\nThanks for having me now what a story I'm Mark Zuckerberg wants a robot is going to take care of his house his kid and help him out what is Facebook how realistic is this well\nI say that they're pretty ambitious goal I think that that that's more of a whole project on his part uh he'll he'll learn something from it but uh the to the technologies are moving out moving along very rapidly um you know we're going to see a big impact over the next ten Twenty years\nYou know Martin I keep thinking of the old twilight zone show sing the body electric that re Bradbury wrote about a family who lost its mother she died a their two kids a little boy little girl in the father was so distraught he went to the robot store and he got a nanny robot and she took care of the kids and\nDid everything a house made and the mother would do and then the kids got older and she went off to another household but\nI I mean robotics when you look at the way things are happening in in you know what the Japanese are doing with ... robots that look human ... it it's really something else isn't it\n[noise] yeah we're seeing amazing progress I mean one one of the things that you have to say too is that\nIt's going to be a long time before we have robot that can really act like human beings and do all the things that people can do but what we are going to the end and we're seeing already are robots and and other forms of automation that can do the same thing\nAnd you know having an increasing impact because the reality is that most people think I mean a lot of people come to work and they do the same kind of routine thing again and again and all of that work is\nYou know going to be increasingly acceptable on me so it's not it's not certainly at this point about science\nRecently that the book on me so it's not it's not certainly at this point about science fiction type robots that are going to act like people but it's really about all kinds of of automation unfolding across the workplace in many cases software\nYou know it was born in Detroit my late father worked for the Ford Motor company so I had an opportunity to see some factories in some plants on how they build cars\nAnd they had automation a robotics long long time ago you know they don't look like people but they're machines that do the job of what people should have been doing a long long time ago and now it's a ball how far Martin\nHas it evolved since let's say thirty forty years ago in a factory\nWell the thing that's happening if there were kind of a coaching what you might think of is the endgame as you say you know Thirty years ago they had robot\nAnd we've had automation in factories and as a result of that\nAre in an advanced country like the United states all of the really ... routine manufacturing jobs you know the jobs that people used to have literally standing on an assembly line those jobs have been gone for a long time they've already been automated\nBut there have always been things for people to do because because there are certain tasks\nThat we live for example a visual perception and dexterity and so forth that the robot just haven't been able to do and yet we were really beginning to the machines began to push into that that final frontier now so that that\nThe group of jobs that really reserved for people is getting smaller and smaller drinking you know the machines are getting capable of doing more and more and that's something that I Would really expect to accelerate over the next decade or two\nI spend my time traveling between Los Angeles in St Louis and I'm In St Louis right now I'm heading back to Los Angeles next week and on Ventura Boulevard they got\nMy time was a human being I was driving down the road and there was a human being out there I thought holding a sign trying to entice people to come into the store and it's moving around and ... holding the sign\nAnd as I got closer to this thing Martin I realize it's a robot it's not a human it's a robot that looks like a human holding the sign and he's moving around these ... in in you know what I'm saying that thing\nAlbeit it's not a high paying job but just took the place of a man or woman who maybe they got paid minimum wage who knows what but that robot took that person's place job\nRight I mean and that's a good example it that's the kind of job that robot can't do it very routine and shit standing there moving around um\nThe jobs right now that robots can't do would be something like being made cleaning a hotel room or\nBeing an auto mechanic Korean electrician either job that really require a lot of mobility and dexterity and\nAnd problem solving and so forth so those kinds of jobs are at the moment at least relatively safe but the frontier is is moving very very rapidly um you know we're already seeing robot that can duty more routine\nUm repetitive things and and the important thing to note that it's not just about low skill jobs not just about the guy standing there holding the sign in many cases we're talking about jobs in offices\nYou know there that are held by people that might have college degrees because ... still relatively routine as people doing the same basic kinds of things again and again and therefore the object of automation\nWell in your key phrase was at the moment do you anticipate in ten years Twenty years more and more of these robotics will get so sophisticated that they will displaced people in jobs that you just mentioned\nI think it's entirely possible I mean handling now and and remember we've got that acceleration going on with information technology most people have heard of Moore's law the idea that computers have been getting faster kind of a doubling rate every two years or so and and you know much of robotics and artificial intelligence is subject to that so\nIt's not the case that things are just going to get more advanced gradually it's going to accelerate it's going to keep moving faster and faster and as a result it it's likely to happen really before ready and it's likely to happen at a a very surprising rate you know it is something that\nIs going to be sort of on top of a long before we expect it because\nI think it'd be like the explosion of social networking just like you just like seemed to birth itself overnight\n[noise] that's right and I think you see for example you see something a bit similar to that happening with self driving cars now I mean it was really just a few years ago five years ago during\nYou know no one even consider that to be possible really I mean I I personally would not I'm someone that obviously think about this a lot I wrote a book about this in two thousand nine\nAnd I never really imagine that we see a self driving car within the next few years and yet Google demonstrated it and now it's just it really just kind of accelerating everything go automotive manufacturer and in companies like uber and Lyft are now getting into it a apple\nA reported the getting into it I mean it it's just becoming a huge phenomenon and clearly it is going to happen at some point I you know I it may not be within the next five years but within ten Fifteen Years or so we're we're very likely going to have cars driving themselves\nWhile you know you're right I'm a little skittish right now to get in a car that's driven by itself\nBut you're right and you know as as technology gets better and better and better or they will do that I'm just concerned Martin if you know something technical goes wrong when you're doing sixty five miles an hour on the freeway and you're in the backseat let's say a man you're out of luck there aren't you\n[noise] yeah I mean they're certainly concern there I think that\nBecause of those kinds of concerns or the technology may move a bit slower I mean it may it may be essentially held back not by the technology itself but by regulation and buy a public insurance but I think you know the other side of that argument is that you know people are certainly not perfect drivers I mean\nYou know cars are extraordinarily dangerous if you look at the number of people killed\nAnd all my auto accidents I mean it's one of the most dangerous things we do in life um and you can make a pretty strong argument that once the technology you know reaches maturity that the machines are going to be better at it and people are and ah you know it will actually result in in a much more safe environment with urine accidents\nOr a Martin we're going to take this quick break we're going to come back and talk more with you about the future of robots rise of the robots as his book next hour will open up the phone lines fascinating subject dumped George ... and we'll be right back on the coast to coast am\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the coast newsletter sign up to the ... dot com\nBoom on no dog in\nJean longer no no\nNo and in a\nDeveloping software was fairly labor intensive you know there there was physical media to be shipped so people had to pack all that up and put it in boxes and then shipped off to the customer and so forth so there were quite a few jobs there\nAre all of that just kind of evaporated very rapidly so I saw what was happening just in my own little business and I came to the realization that that same kind of trend with likely to really unfold across the whole economy as artificial intelligence and robotics really begins to scale out across all industry\nIs a robot that the functions like our duty to does is that a computer is walking computer\nEssentially I mean it's it's you know a robot in terms of a mechanical robot that actually does physical things that the combination of\nThe mechanical and and a and a computer that you know the computer essentially exit the brain or controls the actions of the machine um but as the two things come together it really\nEnable things that that you know previously we we just haven't seen but you know the real driving force behind this artificial intelligence the ability of computers to take on increasingly sophisticated tests\nAnd to really at least begin\nTo think at least a little bit in the way to humans are beginning to think you know to to start doing things like solving problems and making decisions and and most importantly learning you know computers can now\nLook at data and based on that day that they can learn to do things and that might just be a software program running on a normal computer on your desktop or it might be part of a robot\nBut either way it it's about you know machines and computer beginning to learn and think the way that human beings do\nOn one hand the robotics and a ... seems to be fantastic on the other hand displacing workers and you know may be losing jobs\nDoesn't sound good at all the way this for us Martin ... is beneficial to continue the path we're going down\nI ... I Believe it is I think it's our only choice because if you look back at history one thing that really clear is that advancing technology is really the most important thing that has made us better off I mean\nYou know everyone alive today is much better off than people who live say a hundred years ago I mean a typical person today has a has a much nicer life than a very rich person\nA hundred years ago in many many ways because of all the new technology we have the last thing we would want to do is put that progress to you know to summer [noise]\nUm but I Do think we have to recognize that\nWe're entering a new age where they're going to be real implications for this and it's going to basically required adaptation and that's going to be the challenge for us is to adapt our system to this new reality show that we can make sure that everyone in our society benefit from these advances as opposed to a lot of people being left behind\nWill this get scary in the future for for people the fact that these robots will be doing so many things\n[noise] yeah I think a lot of people I I mean I already spent a lot of concern out there you know based on the questions that I get when I talk about this I mean I think that people are already concerned about you know many people have already seen the impact in in their own workplaces or to you know people that\nHave been impacted by technology so people are already worried I mean especially people that have kids that are maybe be going to be going to college soon and so forth and they know that they're a career paths are going to be impacted but if there's already a lot of concern out there and this will grow and and again that's the county trust is to\nAdapt to it so that people don't have to worry so much and so that we can all really benefit from this from this uh program\nYou know I've I've not been in a post office processing factory or plant whatever you want to call it a world the male is shorted but I have to believe that it's done primarily by robotics that the that the hand sorting mail is minimal these days I don't know\nI suspect so I mean I haven't been in the mail processing facility either but one thing that we know is that the postal service is always struggling to to you know deal with the number of employees that has basically has too many people you know\nAn error on the Internet is killed the postage basically you know people use the mail letters to each other they don't do that anymore\nThat's right so there's lots of friends impacting their head back to um automation in terms of Paul thing about this thing in the mail and then you had the the it it they can with you\nI'm actually causing left now so you know and that and then at pretty typical there are lots of trend impacting across the board all of which I'm can have an impact on jobs me the same thing with ... with now I mean books are becoming a book and then of course when that happened there is no job you know ... book anymore so\nThere are there are number of kind of we dated trends that are really unfolding across the whole economy and you know they're all kind of intertwining but the implication is that everything is becoming less labor intensive you know the kids left need for human labor\nProminent people like physicist Stephen Hawking in the ... mosque are are warning us about robotics probably threatening humanity is anybody going to teach keyed to people like that\nWell I mean they're they're raising a warning that it's not ridiculous it's something that we could take seriously\nSomething that we should take seriously um a lotta people kind of dismiss it in particular because it's been you know it's been raised in in science fiction movies and novels and everything so so many times in the Terminator and the matrix and all of that [noise]\nUm but I Do think it's a genuine concern but I also would say that it's not something we need to worry about any time soon I mean I think it's at a minimum of decades away before we can really build an artificial intelligence that you know is it\nAt the level of really thinking like a person and perhaps eventually become smarter than a person but in the near term thinking out five ten years I I think that\nUh the primary impact that we're going to have to worry about it is the job market you know these systems are going to get a lot lot better at doing a lot of the work in the economy gets more routine and repetitive nature\nAnd cheaper to I guess\nThat's right and but it's potentially a huge number of jobs because there are a lot of people that come to work and they basically do the same kinds of things again and again you know the stuff that they do every day is predictable based on what they've done in the past and what that means is that these smart algorithms machine learning algorithms are\nEventually going to get better and better at doing a lot of that work and you know that's a huge number of job has there been some studies that have looked at this and suggested that maybe\nHalf of the jobs in the economy or alternately going to be susceptible to this perhaps within the next couple of\nThat she so far well when you you look at like the Amazon talking about using drones to deliver packages to people's houses and I I find that strange but you know what those are UPS person out there that might be on a job because of the drone\nThat's right it could be drones are there also experimenting with self driving delivery robots which I think a little bit more realistic than having you know drone flying through the air um but I mean there are number of possibilities there right so again there are several friends there's there\nMay be automated delivery there may be more products going digital though that\nYou know they're they're delivered electronically um\nAnd uh you know more of course if you look in in warehouses that Amazon they're becoming\nMore and more robotic ties to I mean are using robots within the warehouses to move the products around so you know this is really develop on many many front and um it it's not necessarily predictable exactly which technologies are really got to take off\nAnd the most important um but what we can say that overall I mean this is you know the early uh pretty relentless trend\nMartin what about the human being that fights back against robotic sabotage or something um you know the person in a factory realizes that this robot is going to displace him or her and they break it or something like that do you see any of that happening\nWell I you know I haven't personally heard stories like that I mean of course that's the first story about all of this is the ice in England where the ... volts where workers did do that with with a new kind of mechanical loom they actually\nYou know rioted and they destroyed the machines could we see something like that again and and the thing of course we could uh\nI don't think that's a solution that anyone would advocate I think it's unfortunate if people end up in that situation but on some level it's easy to understand if people are having an our livelihood destroyed and they don't really see a viable alternative so as a society that something that we all need to address we need to understand that\nThat's coming you know the more and more people may be put in that situation and we need to ensure that that we have for one thing an adequate safety net to help look after those people and for another thing is strategy over the long term to help us adapted\nAs well to to date a machine will increase productivity it'll increase speed it'll do all kinds of things not necessarily better than a human but quicker than a human so if you see\nBeer down here in St Louis an on an anti Bush plant on a conveyor belt being filled by a machine I mean it's like instantaneous since and these these bottles or just in cans or just zipping by if a human had to do it manually we'd never get anything done", "city": "Show Low"}
