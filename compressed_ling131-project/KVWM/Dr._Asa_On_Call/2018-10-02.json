P. weapon than a bomb is is you know it takes a lot of technology and delivery mechanisms whereas a cyber attack is I like to say doesn't require any bombs and bullets or sort fights or just a few keystrokes on the computer and then we're done\nAnd when you when you look at all the possible calamities Bobby whether they are natural or created by people what do you see as the most pressing issue facing us\nWell my opinion as well as the opinion of the folks who frequent freedom ... dot com is that economic collapse is on the minds of of most Americans they they have a feeling that our country is not doing as well as our political leaders might lead on\nAnd you know interestingly today to interest rates went up a quarter point and an economic climate in my opinion it does not warrant and interest rate rise in\nEconomic collapses as something that's a concern but I always believe that there must be some additional precipitating a man to force a country into a deeper um despair economically\nAnd that's why I wrote the fiction series at our wrote a book called the Boston Brahmin series and it takes a an America a nation and declined socially and economically and then\nThrows a cyber attack into the mix which puts it over to get into a a post apocalyptic chaotic world\nAnd and most of the the ... that I deal with that most of the raiders believe that uh right now economic collapses the number one threat we face followed closely by cyber attack or EMT\nAnd what if they hit us all at the same time Bobby oh my God\nThat would be bad news for everybody ... and ... and here's the way I see this happening if we were to go to war for example with Russia\nRussia is notorious for using cyberwarfare as a precursor to war when they invaded uh Georgia stony a Ukraine\nThey always ah initiate cyber attacks that these stabilize the government the communications the media before they you know undertake the traditional military style attack\nAnd if the Russians were so inclined to take us on it would not surprise me at all that they would use cyber attack or E. M. P. to stabilize our nation before they moved on us\nLet's talk about cyber warfare and we're going to go through a number of different areas here that that will affect all of us who do you see a biggest Koppel things are part of the danger could be from some room ... group a playing around with the green but who do you see is the main villain\n... ... group a playing around with the green who do you see is the main villain China Russia or somebody else\nWell I'd like to describe it this way there's an inverse relationship between the capability and the desire of a nascent\nOkay to attack us fortunately the ability to do it or the desire to do it right to two very different\nThings for example China and Russia clearly or have the ability to initiate a series of cyber attacks against the United states that would cause us a lot of problems are taking out our critical infrastructure communications\nThings that are also typically military targets would be the same targets of of cyber attacks but they are also in my opinion the least likely to do that simply because they know we would be able to retaliate in kind or maybe with even greater for right\nBut then you have what I call the the the vandalism levels in the cyber attack level nations for example Iran\nThey would love nothing more than to accomplish their goals with death to America um their ayatollah the spiritual leader of Iran recently said the United states deserves the punch in the mouth\nIn my opinion they are becoming more capable of attacking America in the cyber realm and most likely would do it based upon religious beliefs and in a in an extreme hatred for our country but\nThen you have what I call the vandals and North Korea is a great example oh yeah I'm\nA North Korea to me it's kind of like a nap it's in your ear and it just is hell bent on driving me crazy and getting attention\nThat guy's not playing with the food that\nHe is not and and I call him little on you swat at them and he goes he might go away for a while and then you North Korea is notorious for doing things that are uh you know saber rattling and\nThen people get their maiden and countries throw money at the problem then they come back seven years later I Believe in order to get attention and recognition or on the you know world geo political stage North Korea would like nothing more than to bring down the United states are not gets down to our knees\nAnd they have thrown a tremendous amount of resources are in in that direction but to me the biggest um the biggest threat actor right now is the what I call the wildcard or the cyber caliphate and that's ISIS\nAt this point in time ISIS is not necessarily capable\nOf attacking the United states and bringing our entire grid down but this was what they want more than anything else they're extremely wealthy are estimated worth of over three billion dollars\nThey make two million dollars a day or selling oil and trafficking in a in a you know human trafficking and then in ransom and things of that nature and if ISIS ever put together the right team of hackers\nI'd I don't doubt that they would uh they would be the first a threat to take that our grid\nI think you're probably right on on those fronts and do they have the capabilities now\nWell supposedly they do not um I I recall a quote from sex and see the FBI cyber visiting the John ...\nAnd he ... he quoted that they have a very strong apparent intent to do so but thankfully they don't have the capability\nBut the concern in Washington is that with their wealth and and as that continues to compound daily or will let them by that capability and they have made threats are back in the spring of this year they they posted a very ominous message vowing and electronic war against the west and\nAnd and you know with their typical\nFaceless could figure speaking in Arabic and we send the message and we're the hackers of the Islamic state and the electronic ward has not yet but gun\nAnd those types of threats in the past may have just been dismissed as a these are just a bunch of fools but every day of the news whether it be San Bernardino or or Paris or Chattanooga, Tennessee which is just a hundred or a couple of hundred miles from where I live\nUh you have operatives in this country who are prepared to give their lives\nIn order to kill Americans and the the thing that would be that the pages or a tool to ISIS is they would be able to kill Americans through a taking down our power grid and they wouldn't have to put anybody's lives at risk and in doing so\nDo you believe a cyber attack is an act of war\nIt depends uh and I know this was discussed on your interview with Ted Koppel what's I listen to of course\nI think the uh if if a cyber attack causes death then it can be considered an act of war but I'd like to look at it also from that standpoint and I think that Washington is doing the same\nIf say our oil fields in Texas and the refineries that Exxon and and uh the BP oil and sell et cetera were destroyed or put out of commission for six months or a year as a result of a devastating cyber attack\nTo me that is just as it is as big an attack is if you dropped a bomb on the state of Texas you may not have killed anybody but you've certainly harmed the state and our country economically\nThe question is what type of retaliation is appropriate\nAnd then the bigger problem that I I wrote about in cyber warfare is are you able to accurately determine who conducted the attack the the problem of attribution is a big one is although you may not have to prove the typical criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt\nIt's so easy to mask the locations of these cyber attack or an hackers and their locations that you may think the attack came from India for example but it could have actually been rerouted to several servers around the world in originated in China\nInteresting take their so with all these possibilities out there then we also have to worry about Bobby the sun and so many other things were going to come back and talk more about preparedness [noise] in a moment Costa\nRico soon email newsletters out six days a week is a great way to keep up on all things coast we detailed program recaps the\nFascinating today in St Louis upcoming didn't boat and we leave re audio clip it so much for the ... sign up on the ... dot com boom [noise]\nAt this type of ah at this level so if for some reason our economy does experience that downturn in twenty sixteen and and I would like to echo something that was set at the top of the hour\nMany economists including from your comments economist at Citibank and bank of America believe there's a Seventy five percent chance that America will slip into a recession next year\nAnd we'd go into a recession in a period of rising interest rates\nWe can look at the situation very similar to what we experienced in the late seventies early eighties after the Carter administration um sixteen Eighteen percent unemployment sixteen Eighteen percent interest rates\nAnd it'll be very difficult to dig our way out of that because we've already used all the tools at our disposal to fix the problem or temporarily with a band aid in two thousand and eight and nine\nWould this be a worldwide collapse\nWell ... you can see the effect that that our problems and the oh eight had on the entire world I mean our economy is the center of the economic universe in my opinion a globally\nAnd at the United states were to falter um because I keep it simple for for for our listeners if you if you can't afford to buy goods and services that means the Chinese economy falls because they don't have anybody to purchase their drink\nAnd and likewise a look at gas prices normally you would think wow great gas prices are dropping but it's also a a great indication of a lack of demand\nAnd the lack of demand could come because of a lack of a purchasing power or dust drill output has dropped which again you reported on at the top of the hour there's so many factors involved and all signs are pointing toward the downturn\nYet we're finally raising interest rates probably two to three years too late and it it could have a confluence of events that can be devastating here\n[noise] so what happens once the strict Kearns if she ... a lot of people come in and look into that crystal ball Bobby what happens to folks who might get laid off or or who knows what\nWell that leads into the concept of preparedness and and prepping in general and prepping can take a lot of different levels and and purposes I I Believe in prepping for the worst case scenario and and we can talk about that moment sure but just good frugality\nIn common sense and protection of your family\nShould have a huge saving money or for downturn if you lose your job if you have a month or two a food stored you don't have to worry about your family going hungry and so just just general preparedness for an economic downturn makes good common sense\nBut if you look at the statistics our nation is saving less money than ever before\nWe're living closer to a paycheck to paycheck society than than ever before\nAnd that's what I mean about our country is is is or politicians are lying to the to the folks in America\nWhen they tell you it's a five percent unemployment rate but they don't tell you that the labor participation right is it and it's worse conditions since they started recording the numbers with almost a hundred million Americans just completely given up looking for work or marks Nutley employed\nAt some point in time this facade that's been created out of Washington has gone to catch up with us and it's it's it could potentially be ugly I Hope not I mean you never wish for this to happen but an economic collapse could cause a real problem and I'm not sure that we have the ability to dig out because\nAt some point in time and it's already started the bank of China's gonna stop blaming us money and then we can print all the dollars and the and the treasury notes that we want but if we don't have a buyer for those in our currency is going to collapse as well\nYou have what you call the survivor rule of ... what are they\nWell it it's really just the basic rule of thumb that if you are put in a situation where your life is it risque or in a collapse of them too I like to call it\nYou can only live three minutes without air or you're underwater you have to get air within three minutes or you'll die in extreme weather conditions I'm cold for example or extreme heat like in the desert you can only live three hours without shelter\nThat's right your body can only survive three days without proper high Grayson without water and then if you ah if your body goes three weeks without food then you're likely to die as well so the survival ruler three this is\nSimply three three three three relative to air shelter water and food\nOkay so if you are at least trying to minimize the possibilities that those things can be taken out of your life you've got a leg up on so many things right\nWell and and the and the good down scenario which is what I consider the worst case I'm a collapse of then integrate\nDown scenario as as your seed to seed listeners are very much aware or the power grid operates everything forget the Internet and the ATMs and all of the things that people think about think about the fact that you're not going to have water coming out of your cat\nThink about think about the fact that you're not going to have water coming out of your cat and you know think about the fact that you're not going to have the ability to turn on your your electric heat pump or your air conditioning\nAnd if you live in the northern parts of Minnesota and where the temperature gets to zero and below a many times if you don't have adequate heat in your home you could freeze to death and die that's right\nAnd so the survival ruler three pills you in the event of a of of a worst case scenario make sure that you have the ability to keep yourself warm and extreme weather or cool it it'd be living in the desert for example\nHave ways to procure and purify and taps a ... and store water because you're not going to be able to get it out of the tap and I don't care how many water bottles you purchase from the grocery store eventually those will run out and then likewise have sufficient food to survive on\nYou know it's interesting Bobby we've got some very important sponsors to our program who are dedicated in these areas that you just talked about I mean they make survival water filters that you know takes up contaminated water\nWe've got to see Korean company with their survival radios we've got a my patriots supply with their food emergency food supplies\nThese people are smart\nBecause you know they built their businesses\nAround survival\nYes and then and in in the ... business person will see trends in an economy and they'll pick up on those ideas you know run with it and and and create a marketplace for consumers like myself and your listeners who think yes I Need to be able to purify water but\nI don't know what to do so they might come to freedom preference dot com and and and read my article on a water catchment and purification and then they'll go to my patriots supply and or some of your other sponsors and pick up the necessary um water purification infiltration devices\nAnd it's like insurance George this is the way I I've always tried to explain it to someone who doesn't understand I mean are you may have insurance on your home for a tornado an earthquake or flooding and most events may never happened in your lifetime\nAnd you hope they never will\nAt you and you hope they never will and your insurance company hopes they never will but you have the peace of mind of knowing that if they do you have some form of cover it that's right\nWell prepping is just like insurance you're you're preparing against the catastrophic event at least ... you know whether it be a an economic collapse or a cyber attack cetera but\nYou're you're preparing that if that event occurs you'll be able to number one stay alive\nNumber two you know save your family keep them comfortable until then you know the either help comes or until you know the the nation writes itself or some other contingency and I you know I Love my wife and we have a fabulous life and I want to live forever\nAnd if the Russians decide to take our power grid down I'll be dogged if I'm going to die because\nThey won that is not going to happen here\nPoints I may advocate as you well know Bobby listening to the show on the second amendment yes in a calamity what about guns and what happens in that situation\nWell I have a saying that if you can't protect that it's not yours or a weapon is nothing more than a tool just like a hammer or saw\nThat you used to protect your family in your property or the second amendment is is the constitution it's the law the land or anyone who says otherwise I Believe is wrong\nAnd to the buying the proper weapons for the proper purpose is definitely something that every preparation do regardless of their political beliefs\nBecause like I say if you cannot protect your family cannot protect your home you have to realize that someone with a stronger force is going to come and take it from you and and possibly kill you as well\nWell that is absolutely true terrorism we saw what happened in Paris we saw what
