capital\nOf the angry about having a temperament\nBe on the Supreme Court with that one come from well Dr ... Diane fraud stings false accusations fell apart on them\nSenator frauds things accusations blew up in their face or they they demanded an FBI investigation and the Republicans call their bluff and said okay we'll give you one\nNow that the investigations about to be hidden and they won't even released that one that's a big one why are all the senators saying don't release the investigation what allied they're putting out McConnell now are saying no don't release the FBI investigation of capital\nWe agree with Dr for US Senator frauds thing why one of those Republicans doing are they catering to her now\nNow in other words the FBI investigation probably exonerated cabin or from these charges of rape and such\nSo why are they not releasing it so what have they done they've now come up with a new tack to attack him he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court and I want to ask everyone listening\nLet's say you were just excoriated in public ripped apart lied about destroyed and you get up now and you meet some of those accusing you\nWhat would you say to them thank you well you'd be angry and they're saying his angering meaning showing his mailman is showing as humanity in essence is a sign that he's not fit to be on the Supreme Court how much crazier can I'd get\nThan what these these are folks are doing on the evil Democrats side\nAnd I'll tell you the man was these hearings have been good for America in many ways we've got to seeing the faces of evil\nWe've seen the pure faces of evil and and vacuum the camel or Harris they said was going to run for the presidency I can guarantee you America sees that she's an empty skirt\nShe seemed to be what she is a vacuous individual nothing there there's nothing there she was a small town prosecutor who was picked hand picked by the Democrat machine and they ran are up the flagpole she's gone\nAnd picked by the Democrat machine and they rent or up the flagpole she's gone I can guarantee you she'll go nowhere she still vacuous another one who who flamed out is Cory Booker called themselves Spartacus you gotta Spartacus moment but he went further he's shown himself to be an ... actually idiotic\nI Want you to listen to Cory Booker\nListen to this carefully he says that Kavanaugh's guilt or innocence doesn't matter\nYou should be forced out right now irrespective of whether he's guilty or innocent now this means Cory Booker believes not in the rule of law but the ... in the rule of the lawless and the rule of the Martin in Marlboro how can anyone vote for this man so I think both of them have now disqualified themselves\nA for a any serious consideration beyond what they already are doing here is Cory Booker saying that Mr cabin or\nHis guilt or innocence doesn't matter listen to him and oh three astonishing\nWhen his temperament had been revealed in an emotional moment where do you use language that that frankly shocked a lot of us and not only not whether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial the ultimate question has enough questions to be re that we should not move onto another Kennedy this is\nBeyond comprehension so they've been found out to be liars and attempting to pin the tail on him saying he was a rapist than it is to know that that didn't fly so now they're saying because he reacted to being smeared he's not qualified to be in the spring court ladies and gentlemen the Savage joined let me ask you something if you had been\nPublicly excoriated humiliated lied about and you had a chance to answer some of these questions what would you have done sat there like a moron you wouldn't have gotten angry\nWhat what do you want out of a human being and find a way what do you think the temperament as of Ruth Bader Ginsburg behind closed doors you think she doesn't scream and yell at people you think that which is not used as a temper tantrum for the day\nThey forces that are on the American public are you joking\nYou're telling me that the man overreact enemy you're overreact if you imagine if it was me what I Would have said to them I wouldn't have sat there and take it uh I Would have shown up with a temper is I Would have exposed for what they're vulnerable with I wouldn't have sat there and taking that if they ... me and my family to shreds [noise] so [laughter]\nThis story is called the ugly truth about Tom sure it'd be like you've done your family by ... by Tom sure you need my help hello I'm Chuck McDowell CEO and founder of Wesley financial group ten years ago I started helping boats cancel their timeshare contracts and then the process started what's now called\nThe Tom shirt cancellation industry Tom shares the only thing that you can about you can't tell me how much it's going to cost or when it's going to end when you bought timeshare you give them a blank check to fill out any amount they won't ... annual maintenance and assessment face sound crazy\nThe crazy thing is there's never ends\nEven when you die your family is now going to be stuck with this bird stop the insanity to de calm office now I guarantee you if we can't answer your chapter contract you'll pay nothing\nEvery poll I don't care which side of the islets conducted by shows the same thing\nThe respect or the ... the the I don't even know where right where the respect as the wrong word their opinion the average person's opinion of Congress is that an all time low the average person's opinion of the media is lower than that of Iraq dropping in the New York sewer\nPeople hate the media and last night we hit a new low a new low in America below that it actually is worse than anything I've ever seen about the ... republic which was so degenerate that the average German who was not an extremist by the way you have to understand something about the rise of Hitler the average German hated Hitler\nWas only a small fringe that put Hitler forward the middle class German was repulsed by Hitler\n\nThe degenerate seat of the ... hour period in Germany reached such a fever pitch that even middle of the road Germans said enough is enough and they started to rethink their moderate positions that couldn't take it anymore\nSo we have no longer any gatekeepers in the media except to block conservatives like me from oil outlets in the media is still a miracle um on the radio you got to understand something that I still standing here after twenty five years of being as graphically\nHonest as any person in the history of this media as open as I Am is almost a miracle it actually is a miracle it is it got pocket because I'm part of the red seized from Michael me in Nineteen Ninety four and here I Am\nIt doesn't mean January is going to be the same it will not be the same my show is changing dramatically one hour of radio one hour of a podcast but many stations that have been desperate to drop me will be dropping to show some new ones will come along I'll be very clear with us all political make no mistake about it\nAnd the radio media landscape is going to move in the same direction as Fox News\nCenter left instead of center right that's what's gonna happen across the media landscape center left instead of center right and they're making a disastrous era uh\nThe stress era or on many many levels so now we see what happens when you stand up to the establishment and when the establishment becomes degenerate and sick\nAnd you say nothing about it you are allowed to function in this society but if you speak out is that you yourself become the victim the truth dies and along with it the truth teller\n\nLast night Trump gave a speech in front of a crowd\nAnd while he is right about what he said about Dr fraud the optics are awful he went off the rails now mind you I'll repeat what I said he's a hundred percent right in what he said about Dr fraud he does everything right from the heart\nAnd since this whole for Kavanaugh thing began he's been very measured in his comments he really didn't take sides always the front of the capital and always giving credence to the doctor fraud\nAnd he doesn't even acquiesced to Democrats in waiting another week so the FBI could investigate these claims again I Want to repeat Trump is right about what he just said last night but the optics are awfully went off the rails you see in front of an adoring crowd in Mississippi he mocked Dr frauds testimony\nTo the tremendous applause we heard it\nAnd what happened every news Cast Lead with this all of the ... media outlets all a twisted sister's in the news business\nWe're having panel discussions on Trump's horrible treatment of a sexual abuse survivor he gave them the father they were looking for\nNow this doesn't affect solely the media or the Democrats but demon cat voters who are already looking to take out Republicans and the demon cat fringe activists\nWho are loudly confronting Republicans everywhere they can run into them\nOr it also feeds reasons for guys like Jeff Flake stir and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski to not support capital in a vote on the floor I think it was a terrible miscalculation on the president's part and I have to ask why does he do this\nWhy is it that when President Trump is in the White House setting he controls himself but when it gets in front of a crowd\nHe makes you believe or he sounds as though he's speaking on a telephone to a television personality who calls him all the time and I think that's the problem\nI think what happens if he goes off the phone from this TV personality goes on a stage after getting pumped up by him and thinks he's on television when he's not he has to think about the consequences of what he is saying\nAnd so as I say to you this is a very difficult time to be in the media is especially when I'm Michael Savage and the Switzerland of talk radio right that one down I declare myself the the Switzerland of talk radio\nWhy do I say on the Switzerland of talk radio well for one I'm not a registered Republican I never have been\nIn fact uh I don't go to Republican events I generally don't like Republicans\nHowever in the times that we are in there is no clear a choice than ever as to the safe for party for most Americans and that is certainly not the lying filthy degenerate Democrats to be it's a terrible time to be the Switzerland of talk radio I'll tell you that right now\nAnd the phone number here is uh what's the difference with my phone number is what's the difference that I Am\nA producing a book that will be ethical stop mass hysteria what is a difference I mean I Know you're going to go buy it my hard core audience will buy it you'll never see it on ... on Fox News because they are part of the cartel which is a shame\nNot all conservatives are a member of that cartel they also are blocked from fellow news which by the way is going through a big change now that Lackland Murdoch took it over you're gonna see heads rolling out of that studio he's a super liberal from London\nHe does not want some of the people who are on Fox News to remain and they've known the actual is gonna fall one day wait until you see what happens in the next few months\nI don't know what they're going to do once they get a phone news I don't know where they're going to go watch CNN MSNBC I don't know where they're going to find a job I guess they could always get to Dixie cups and the string in a in a video camera and podcast themselves\nAnd then they'll find out what it is to be obscure in America when they had the chance to open themselves up to a man who tells the truth\nThe whole truth and nothing but the truth to help him God and they chose to ignore him while so many people listen to him they'll find out what it is to be on the outside one day

I don't feel I have been taken though I Do feel my awareness has been raised and I do feel that\nUm my consciousness in my intuitive abilities\nFeel more heightened it I get a sense depending on what I'm smelling or if the hair on the back of my neck is rising that somehow on being televised ethically communicated to the visually I don't see them the way I did when I was\nUm [noise] well\nShove and isn't this something that has really come into the likes of gone but initially it started in Russia hundreds of years ago and the ... were like our medicine men with the first nation people's\nBut shoveling ism has become a course of study um\nAnd I've been doing that for Thirty years where you open your perceptions to more than what is in front of you that you work with nature because it is a living being um\nYou listen to your dreams because dreams are the unconscious way of bringing up to our conscious mind things that need to be observed changed um bought into our world so it's using\nDifferent abilities that we all have a son to a greater or lesser degrees but we all have the capability and so ... is a way to refer to opening the perceptions from my way of thinking\nAnd the dark journey that you have mhm\nHow difficult was it for you to get out of that dark\nWell any parents that loses their child confront that dark journey the person that's diagnosed with something\nWe never want to live our kids ever never\nNever um and for me death ... you know not to be macabre but death was my teacher because it each step were I was being brought through a process whether it was\nBy a planet beans on my on climate teachers are indigenous elders um it always seemed to be proceeded by a death for me and I don't think that's the way people have to learn that's just the way for me it happened\nUm\nYou know my my daughter passed and then my dad and a half years later my brother was on the second plane in nine eleven\nOh no [noise] so they were just over and over again and then my elder teachers started to pass away so in that kind of contact with a teacher and a friend and mentor\n... my uncle from marriage you know not a blood on coal I'm I'm Douglas goal was uh on one of the Boston planes going away and the energy I Wonder if he was on the same uh same plane is so bad\nThey were um there was an American flight and the United flight and my brother was on the United\nStates that's treasure how do you want to it because I think it's important to your story or your daughter died isn't\nSure yes that's true it is important to the story um and I don't use it because it is a story but I use it because it opened my story my life\nTotally changed my life not just in her passing but in what happened after that so a few weeks after she passed away and she had had open heart surgery and hadn't\nHad lasted for about ten weeks after that and\nHow old was she was Eighteen months oh just a little baby yeah little girl\nAnd um I was driving around one night in the rain crying as they usually did nothing wrong with that\nYeah well it was the self imposed isolation that was the only way I could go and um I Hope it's okay to say on your show but I had to go to the bathroom\nAnd since I was literally the last I heard words [laughter] we've had the flip on the way [laughter] [laughter]\nWell I was totally lost didn't know where I was and I saw this light like this orb of light like a a\nOn a home or building and so I stopped there to see if they had facilities and when I went inside there were a lot of people mingling around which was very disorienting to me so I went into\nThe ladies' room and did my business and when I came out all the people had returned to a lecture room that was just off the hall\nI don't know why to this day George but I was totally pulled into that room I sat in a chair at the back I didn't remember hearing anything\n... like a magnet to pull you ended up\nExactly and I remember this blurb turquoise in the front of the room talking and at the end of the\nAt the lecture or some of the words this woman had been speaking had penetrated kind of my fog and I went up to her to thank her for her words and she wouldn't look at me and I thought that was rather strange should\nShe as she was walking away she basically said um now I Know why I'm here I'm here to teach you you're one of the people that are meant to teach and you'll come back tomorrow to the workshop and had a stand Marine I said well I I don't have the money and I don't have the time and\nShe said you don't need the money and you're right you don't have the time um you made promises to great mystery of work you would do on this planet and you're not doing it and I'm going to start to put your feet to that path and then she walked away and the next morning again I don't know why\nI went back and I was in the ladies' room crying again and I thought this is ridiculous I don't know this woman I have no idea what she's talking about who the hell is she and I'm Out of here\nAnd as I open the stall door to leave the bathroom she was standing there with her back to the door and she said I lost my first daughter to know she had no idea about my daughter\nShe just she picked that up somehow ...\nYep and she said um you will come out you will dry your eyes you will start to do this work and it will make you better and she turned around and she left and that was the beginning of my path\nWorking with my first indigenous teacher and then she eventually passed me to my primary mentor grandmother trial in each of the Seneca nation who was a long time teacher but\nThere were many other teachers mingled among huh\nAll right we're going to come back and talk more with Sandy you bought your workshop demonic awakening coast to coast or you\nHave a photo that you can with interest because to ... or you were always on the hunt for unique you don't usually would use for a photo gallery to submit your image simply go do coast to coast am dot com and most over the media bookmobile bring evolution bar and you see the ... [noise]\n\n[noise]\nIs not necessarily always a delight and learning how to use that um to a better advantage to bring it kind of into our consciousness so that we can be better human beings\nUm there's a lot of\nVery simple but not simplistic ways of looking\nAt these things and um all of it I Believe is to bring us to a higher state of consciousness\nOh have you used in your day to day\n[noise] yeah I I Hope I've used it in the best way I Know how I've used it with my clients to help bring them\nA face to face with themselves I've used it in a certain ceremonies that were given to me or instructed to me so that I can continue to open up myself to the other realm [noise]\nUm I Hope I've used it to be a good mother to my second daughters to be more aware of her needs as well as other people's needs that um when they conflict with my own [noise]\nUm I I think it's just about being a good human being about being conscious of the fact that whatever you put out there whatever you do is going to affect not only yourself but and the other but as they say seven generations always\nSure it does if you send our good vibes they come back if you send out negative vibes and they come back\n[noise] yes and and we're all George human beings I mean we all run the spectrum we have good days and days and good use of bad\nYeah more human right my thing and that\nThat spectrum of light and dance they never call it darker evil they they\nRefer to a to Z the light energy or dense energy and always being able to take the denser aspects and re can figure it because everything is just energy into a way that we can work with it in a more and more lightness of being in that that comes from how you clean out your cells\nSo that you can look at your own stuff before you accuse somebody else of theirs\nWhen when Sandy Corcoran her book is such a monitor awakening Sandy what message what message would you like people to take with them after reading this book or listening to this program\n[noise] that every day we have a choice to change and change doesn't have to be huge but change can be powerful if it helps\nUh if it helps us deal with something difficult that we're going through certainly on the planet at this time you see so many different chaotic things that scare people mhm\nAnd I'm One of the things I Would say is that the media has a great deal of energy and being able to help bring a good information to people or fear to people that um\nYou know you can't possibly change in government or a mindset of a people overnight but you can certainly come to the situation by not adding to the fuel or the anger or the chaos by bringing destructive words and destructive actions to it um\nThere's just so much we can do at a very mundane level that can change\n\nThe energy within ourselves and that is there for going to change the energy of how were met by the outside world\nIf you did not have the contact the experiment experience and was hoping to put an experiment on your\n[laughter] you didn't have that much [laughter] would you have been as tuned up as you are right now\n[noise]\nHonestly I don't believe so I Believe that had a great deal to do I don't believe my eyes and my perception\nOr what to do that yeah\nAnd that's why I think you may still be in contact with them I don't think they're finished with you\n[noise] well that could be I mean I don't I I remember as a kid being shown underground bases I remember being shown many different species working on the back side of the moon like we have many different nations working at Antarctica um\nNow the round bases were were on this planet\nYes and I don't think a lot of that has changed um I think from a personal perspective there's been negotiations by different government to work with some of these ... beans and not always to the best\nUm I I don't think the war is happening just here on the earth I think the the war if you want to call it that is happening\n\nOn a on a unconscious level on a conscious level on a super conscious level on an inter dimensional level on earth base level on and on\nA planet level and I hope I'm not a Pollyanna but I think in the end the light will always win and I do believe that some of what's going on right now is being heightened as maybe disclosure and higher levels of consciousness and the need to be\nA work as a planetary system on this little blue marble I think that's all happening in getting faster and faster and faster\nAnd I don't think you're a Pollyanna are I think in the long run good is going to win too I think it's really be a tough road but ah I think we're going to win\nI Would hope so I think at this point I was talking to a friend the other day who was very frightened by some of the things that were going on and I said I really believe we're at a tipping point right now where where many of the things that I was shown that can possibly happen I mean they\nWhere many of the things that I was shown that can possibly happen I mean they the discoveries even now that are happening like a ... on Mars and stuff those were all things that we were shown as kids on the ship\nSo if all of that is coming to pass now if none of that as a fairy tale if government agencies and a industrial complexes have known about some of this stuff for years and it's just kind of sprinkling into the media now and ... and a larger way\nI Do think we're at a point where there are more people on this planet who have raised their consciousness and want things to be different than there are that want things to stay the same and I think that's what you're seeing is kind of the old model the old paradigm collapsing and just holding on for dear life because it's going down\nYeah you do talk to encourage don't you are you yes they do tell me what is that what is a talk show card\nWell talk was one of the um [noise] one of the Egyptian ... okay\nHeart of the pantheon of Egypt the\nIdea is that a thought originally came from Atlanta and brought information to the early Egyptian people if that was a planetary being or enough planetary being I don't claim to know but he was the one who taught writing\nAnd a compassionate heart\nAnd that's what I Try and bring to my readings is a compassionate heart for where the other person is [noise] um\nSo when I talk about a sauce to roll reading what I'm using as a specific deck I can only read that deck and I'll tell you in a minute the story of how I came to that sure [noise] um\nBut even reading that deck I see the major trauma cards there are Twenty one major Trump cards I see those as\nArchetypes that we all need to move through 'em as the divine droplet of divinity works through the physical template and personality but I also read them in what's called lineages\nWhich is a deeper and richer way of using the cards to help the person get clarity or definition on some of the places they are in their life right now although I Do think\nEverybody has free will and that ... the cards aren't necessarily predict is because they don't answer yes or no but they can give you different perspective\nI look at the situation so it's not things that will be it's things that could be\nThings that could be because it depends on the action you take any action you take will leave the speed up the time or the action you take might eliminate the possibility so always you have free will is how you want to deal with the information\n... ah in white and change that has occurred in you ever since you were a child and continues to this day is it easy or is it difficult to try to teach it to people\nTo let them convey what you've learned I mean if they haven't had this contact you experiment experiences you keep saying experiment what do they haven't had the experience how can they learn\nUm I I Believe a lot of people have had the experience and probably the experiments yeah [laughter]\nUm I also think that people are hungry right now for information but I've been teaching for about twenty five years\nI'm this material and it it changes as I changes the world change and I'm seeing more and more people becoming awake and even if you're starting at a different level I mean you're always going to be in a room with some people are in kindergarten and summer and eighth grade and some of graduated college\nUm and I use that metaphorically but\nI don't my classes are always full because I think people are hungry um", "station": "KVWM", "city": "Show Low"}
