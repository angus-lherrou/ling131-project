tactics\nAnd what's going to happen is they're going to raise the stakes tomorrow the next day and I'm afraid that they're liable actual send wants to someone on the other side of the political spectrum and it will go off in Maine were killed\nWe'll send one to someone on the other side of the political spectrum and it will go off in Maine were killed that's I'm afraid of and who they're going to blame it on than most say well we don't know who did it\nWe don't know who did it now we don't know who did it but we're living in very dangerous times you know I got to take a deep breath and step back from here I don't even have a copy of my book stop mass hysteria but I remember\nThat the the book closes would they quote from Benjamin Franklin if you think that I'm a scare monger and hate mongering that means you're looking in the mirror because it isn't me\nMy book is so important for you because it ends with this statement from Ben Franklin indulge me for a minute I'm paraphrasing\nEither we all hang together or we will all hang separately I had been trying to tell America for a long time now\nThat there are peaceful ways of resolving conflict whether it's in your home in your head or or in politics and I don't see a Democratic Party willing to make peace they only know hatred of war\nI saw pictures of the illegals coming over with a new group from Mexico joining them and they're all strapping young men of military age in the in clean new clothing that's what my headline was give us your tired your poor your gangbangers\nThat so what do you want me to say what could I as a citizen with a radio show say give me your tired your poor your gangbangers so what can they do so we have an a gigantic problem because we voted like crazy for Donald Trump\nAnd so far with thanking God that it wasn't Hillary Clinton which is true and we've gotten a lot it's a lot of good stuff but the Alamo now is the illegal immigration army that is surging toward the border\nThis is his Alamo and if he does not stop them it will become has Waterloo you'll have to refer to Napoleon to see what the Waterloo was and as a student of history Waterloo was not a good place for Napoleon\nIn order for Trump to stop this massive army of invaders and to make sure this is not a Waterloo for him and for America\nHe has to crack down as fast as possible on Mexico and make them do the job that they promised to do when we were finagle emphasizing the NAFTA deal with them because that that horses out of the bond as they say and American parlance so how we going to stop these vandals from getting into the country how\nWell I guess I have to read a little history to you like do you want a little tiny history about when Rome was broken into by the vandals individually God's when the barbarians other words broke through Roman broke the nation and a half would you like the little little history\nNow do you find it offensive that I'm calling illegal aliens like this the army's this army of young men\nBarbarians\nHow do you know who they are why do you automatically defend them why do you automatically assume they're all coming here to work\nWhy do you assume that in a martyr Fifteen to twenty thousand there are no drug dealers no right but snow killers\nKnow gang members why would you assume that there'll be illogical\nSo let's both agree let's all of us agree that amongst the Fifteen thousand a small percentage are bad people very bad people of the type that we all know exist in all communities in an all races so why would you want to bring in people like that to your country when we already have a a crime wave in the country that's hardly control of all\nI Know we're not supposed to even talk about it but there's terrible crime in this country especially if you were in the media and you read about these things\nThen you have to arrange walking the streets but I think it's important that your study for one second with me if you don't mind a little history I have a minute or two to do it with I Would do it and I'd say forty minutes if I had a podcast right now which is what you'll get come January I wouldn't cut it off but\nLet's go back to ancient Rome together and let's see what happened in the early history of Rome when the barbarians broke the empire into and how did that happen\nHow did it happen that the Romans couldn't defend their their borders which will call their frontiers how did it happen that they broke through\nWell as I told you the whole story ready they broke through what more do you need to know I go to the whole story that you'll get bored I Know you tuned out already in the age of Twitter and sound bites the minute I said history you went to sleep\nYou turned on either um the nail gun\nOr a something that's a little you know small soundbite and so how did the barbarians break the Roman empire in the in the east and west whale as I describe and stop mass hysteria and as I described to you before on this program\nIt began and the third century of the Roman empire which was listening to very important for you to hear this\nThe empire and the third century was already decaying socially and disintegrating Marley wow does that sound like doesn't a gym doesn't sound like today\nAt that time in Rome was already decaying socially and disintegrating merrily and then they face the barbarians on their borders\nAnd guess what happened next\nWell all on the imperial frontier\nWhich ran roughly along the Rhine and Daniel enemies will now pressing against the Roman borders the Franks and other German tribes have come up to the right\nIn North Hungary where the vandals in what was once that Syria and is now Romania\nThe visit Godzilla west Scott's behind those in South Russia where the Scots or astronauts and beyond those in the vulgar region where the lands and then they were the Mongolian people's forcing their way towards Europe so history is repeating itself\nLet's go to graduate school together and thought for a minute\nWho do you blame how about both parties you want to talk about both parties or cashing in on them on the illegal aliens for the last twenty five to Thirty years you'll have to spell it out for you why do you think that the Congress is doing nothing\nWhy do you think Trump won the election because we wanted something done and he said he would do it that's far he hasn't\nSo you can blame anybody you want\nTo me it looks like the Mariel boat invasion of Miami of the early eighties and we're asking that Honduras Guatemala El Salvador empty the presents and then not houses because if you look at the pictures that are so plain and the picture is worth ten thousand words\nThey're young strapping young men by and large with a few you know in the front women with carriages thrown in for a fact so that Jake Tapper can yank your guilt chain and Wolf Blitzer can chime in and say yeah yeah that's racist\nBut we all know what this is it's an invasion ... oh\nWhat an existential problem what are we going to do about it I'm not just saying it because of the current or it I mean I read existential isn't my ...\nAnd as a girlfriend so I Know ... as if it's a wonderful phrase is an existential threat was originally use the here in politics by Netanyahu with regard to Israel\nA number of years ago when he said it's an existential threat to the survival of Israel and then everyone picked up on it but this is a ... a truly an existential threat to our borders language and culture\nSo the question is why is nothing being done I don't see anything done nothing wrong to the next subject already\nJoined the Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred Savage eight five or four hundred seven to eight to

vibrating resonate in connecting in ways that are far beyond dark are comprehension and understanding [noise]\nUm [noise] so theoretically um we could be surrounded by other dimensions of reality that we are not able to perceive due to limitations in our neural hardware in other words the world that we do perceive is essentially you know the environment\nThat we're immersed in is constructed by by our mind in in a way that our mind can function in\nAnd understand it but\nThat doesn't mean that there can't be other dimensions ah all around us you know\nAll right so that's one possibility the vortex the portal the wormhole let's talk about these UFO sightings in that area can because there are a lot of them so is it possible people are being abducted by extraterrestrials\nWell you know that's a great segue George ... says you know one theory holds that if if we are in fact being visited by\nExtraterrestrial intelligence says that perhaps they're using these actual for Texas or wormholes to get here from wherever they're from um\nThat said uh Alaska does have a a high\nConcentration of UFO activity um the apparently the American military took quite an interest in that you know I just mentioned the case of the missing the fifty four aircraft back in Nineteen fifty where there are allegations and rumors that just weeks before that crap disappeared\nThat there were sightings of UFOs over Elmendorf air force base where that particular plane took off from\nA but moreover going into recent uh times uh there's a very famous craft I'm sure you've talked about in your show the uh the November Nineteen eighty six there was a Japanese airlines flight sixteen twenty eight\nAh this was this a cargo seven forty seven loaded with wind and headed from France to Japan and as it flew over Alaska they actually the pilots\nOr discern three objects or that subsequently chase their craft according to them uh one of the craft or that they spotted they claimed was twice as big as an aircraft carrier and this\nAnd counter was corroborated from the ground by a by radar a workers down there to I'm a I'm a door base [noise]\nUm so you know that's one particular case there was a allegedly a kind of a cover up um when this a radar information was analyzed by different government agencies and they kinda swept it under the rug but this may have been the first real definitive radar evidence\nSwept it under the rug but this may have been the first real definitive radar evidence\nOr that our government our military had it been actually a ... you know that's just one example\nOh within weeks after that incident there were other UFO sightings around Alaska 'em and you know up until she just last year we were up in a a location a mount have which is up in a Dali national park where they are but a lot of UFOs sightings\nAllegations of an underground UFO base there under under amount haze that date back to the seventies and ah there was a pretty notable UFO citing just weeks before we arrived there\nAnd in these particular cases can these people are gone they're not brought back there not still here right\n[noise] that's true um there are thousands of people that have that have never been found um now there\nAre some people I think some of the cases probably haven't solved through the years but uh the you know a good portion of good a percentage of those cases are our unsolved\nAnd uh we got to kind of a first hand a taste of that ourselves and we were up there filming a in the city of Juno there was actually a tourists that went missing or the week that we were up there and there was a massive manhunt that ensued uh so it's it's just a it's an amazing proposition that so many people ... up there without a trace center never found\nWhere what's worse or turn off her tenure heard of course who is also doing a series on the History Channel called missing in Alaska how did you folks all holding in Alaska\n[noise] well um\nWhat kind of interesting George is that uh one of my cast mates uh his name is Tommy Joseph and he's a a a clean get is a Native American coming in\nOr his father actually is a missing person or when he was a young boy his father went out on a fishing trip um a in a boat by himself and never return oh boy\nSo Tommy's kind of grown up with that and um so you know as a kind of a tragic story but I'm a he was driven to sort of look into some of these other missing persons cases to see if he could find some answers find some closure\nAnd uh subsequently uh he I guess got in touch with them a production company and it was working with the History Channel and uh they were looking for other investigators to kind of help him out and I was a one person they reached out to an addition to another guy\nA jak that well who's a private investigator and he kind of work a skeptic so he was going to kind of bring his law enforcement background and of course I'm wherever crypto zoologist but I'm always been fascinated with other anomalous phenomenon so the three of us joined forces and that was kind of how the show was conceived\nIn the movie the forest kind of course they talk a lot about Nome, Alaska for these disappearances is normal ask in this triangle\nNo one was not in the trying not in right now it's on the far\nWestern side of the state um and unfortunately we did not have an opportunity to to uh visit no that was one of the places we were attempting to investigate but um we stay primarily in the uh within the boundaries of what is known as the Alaska triangle\nWell I you know I've seen this movie twice I still can't figure out if it's Hollywood or if these are real stories I don't know\nYeah I I I I don't know either I think it's one of those things they they they certainly made it look like kind of found footage a kind of documentary um but you know I have heard allegations that perhaps some of that was the ... yeah so I really don't know\nNow there's been a number of big cases in that region as well in Alaska now we don't hear a lot of stories a big foot abducted people taking them away well what do you hear out there yeah\nWell I'm actually I'm as we investigated Alaska's version of big foot a which is known locally by a number of native names are ... attack regularly equal to ...\nA skill you can so forth but all of those translated means basically Harry manner Bush man so essentially the the legend speak of a hairy man like figure a giant hairy man like figure very similar to the north American big ... watch\nAnd as we did our investigation is what we found is there actually have been\nUm\nClaims that big foot type creatures have adopted humans on occasion bringing it up in the far Pacific Northwest\nAre now what example of that is a young lady uh in rampart Alaska or back in the Nineteen eighties claim that she was actually kidnapped by one of these big foot creatures these Bush man and that she was taken back to a cave\nA where this thing was essentially living or dwelling with other big for type creatures and that she was held their captive for a number of days\nBefore she managed to escape I'm and she felt that she had been brought there in order to care for one of their infants which appeared to her to her\nOr to be sort of sickly and and she got the impression that they felt that somehow she would be able to help this\nA juvenile creature um that you know that's just one example um there was a very famous story a throughout Alaska that's a\nA known or from an area called Thomas pay which is on the far south eastern part of the triangle and from a book that kind of well known in Alaska called uh the strangest story ever told\nA back in Nineteen hundred a number of prospectors went up to this area um to you know do some prospecting and they had some uh counters with these what they refer to as Harry devils which ... if you read the descriptions it sounds like kind of a big foot creatures spot on\nAnd in fact uh they were chased out of this area they claimed by these highly aggressive Harry man like creatures\nUm so you know those are some of the Alaskan stories and then you have a in\nIn the bigger part of the big ... or you have a the famous abduction of a man named Albert Osman who was a Swedish prospect or who claimed that he was abducted by a family of sauce watches back in Nineteen twenty four this is very well known in the big foot field\nUm so you do find the stories he's accounts of people being kidnapped or inducted by big for\nLet's talk a little bit more about this big foot says I Want you to describe Porsche what it looks like we'll be back in a moment Ken ... hard with us all his information linked up the coast to coast to\nCoast insiders the new version of the coast to coast am happy now available for I'm boon in now Android for Don ... listen libre on demand anywhere anytime ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nFortunate to hook up with Alaska is a pre eminent expert on big but a man named Jay Robert alley and he's collected a number of sightings\nFrom the state of Alaska and actually told me that he has some descriptions that actually characterize these creatures is standing anywhere from twelve to Fifteen feet all wow which is uh yeah so I was pretty blown away by that now you don't really hear about that here in the lower ... not as that\nThey put her sauce watched that big and it's it's really hard to kind of wrap your mind around that that something a hominid form could stand twelve to Fifteen feet tall but there are apparently you know multiple descriptions that state that they're they're literally that big or some of them are I think\nThat would be eerie to see can I think I can I can handle a seven foot big for it but man you see one Fifteen feet tall that's\nEerie\nYes absolutely and you know that a lot of crypto zoology is based on ... and folklore so when you hear these descriptions of man like creatures that stand Fifteen feet tall well the obvious thing is to look at the the worldwide mythology and folklore and obviously you have these enduring legends of giants [noise]\nI mean let's let's be real that's what they call them giants dating back you know hundreds or thousands of years in different cultures all over the world\nSo let's put big set aside as another possibility there are other legendary creatures that you looked at there's a strange one that I'm not too familiar with the shapes shift or called\nWho's taco what is that\nYes the ... the ... is a clinical engine I mentioned my friend Tommy earlier is cleaning it that that's kind of the southeastern part of Alaska the ... is known as the land Autor man and according to the ... people this ... is a shape shift or a that essentially lives deep in the wilderness\nIt bears the characteristics physical characteristics at both humans and auditors which are very common animals in Alaska other two species of honor's there are of course marine honors and then you have the land of the river otters\nA but according to cling legends these ... because they're very conniving and ultimately what they're what they're trying to do is to lure people out into the wilderness\nAnd essentially to assimilate them by getting people lost in the wilderness or causing people to drown or die that you know various death or these wilderness areas\nAnd if that were to happen to you as a clinging warrior are brave for example they you would become ... so essentially it it's a it's an ongoing cycle where these these shapes shifting creatures a will essentially lure unsuspecting humans are the wilderness and then to simulate them\nAnd turn them into ... themselves now one of the really creepy aspects of this legend is that these ... creatures\nWill sort of trick you by I'm taking the ... the former the shape of somebody that is familiar to you or for\nExample a friend or relative and that is one of the ways that they will lure you into the wilderness or another part of a legend the states that they will make it sound like a baby cry what's your what's your instinct is a person if you're out in the woods and you hear a baby cry where you would think well there you know there's a baby and distress\nThat's right you anything suddenly in ... in an appearance you got to find out again\nFind the kid and then that that's the crucial to lure you out into the wilderness and I'm Mike half made Tommy claims that he actually did encounter one of these ... are creatures at one point or in his town of Sitka, Alaska and that he said that this thing looked very much like an auditor accepted it had kind of a strange looking at the eyes\nAre almost like a it was possessed or something and that he ultimately against is better judgment he did begin to follow this thing kind of out into the woods while it seemed to be leading him away from his home and then\nIt kind of came to at one point realize what was going on and was able to sort of break the spell but many of the people that I spoke to they were very adamant that this is not a minute this is not a fable these ... creatures are very very real to them\nThat's creepy that this creature use creepy\nYeah it's ... it's pretty creepy and uh you know just that little ... here a few years ago Charlie Sheen are actually uh I guess it was kind of more of a list of the stuff that anything else but he's staged ache ... expedition of his own up in the state of Alaska\nAnd it wasn't too successful with that one I guess not know\n[laughter] you've looked at under burns these these creatures are intriguing to me because they could be prehistoric but whatever they are we\nGet sightings of huge birds as big assessments what are we here in Alaska\nYeah well I'm as you know George I been investigating the Thunderbird phenomenon for many many years now Idaho elected accounts eyewitness accounts from all over North America but Alaska despite its very small population definitely seems to be a very active area real hot spot for these Thunderbird accounts\nNow of course you have to acknowledge that you have the many native Thunderbird legends and in fact if you go to Alaska you actually see five hundred birds are being portrayed on different ... and native artwork and so forth so they believe in thunderbirds indifferent native cultures their dates back many centuries but\nLeave him thunderbirds indifferent native cultures their dates back many centuries but in terms of modern sightings back in two thousand and two there were a number of sightings of thunderbirds over Alaska it actually made a international news because many of the witnesses were experienced pilots and so forth and solve these enormous bird\nThat had like a fourteen foot wingspan basically the size of a small airplane and through the years\nUh and partially thanks to you for for having me on a coast to coast in prior years to talk about pets I I've had people reach out to me from the state of Alaska that have also seen these ah thunderbirds and they describe them as essentially looking like giant raptor\nTypes of birds very much like an ego with a hooked beak and predatory bird ... a dark colored feathers or but again the thing that really stands out as we're talking about a wing span that ranges anywhere from Fifteen to twenty or twenty five feet across which is about five times bigger than any known bird species\nAre so we we really could be dealing with I Believe something prehistoric in nature or if you go back and look at the ice age or the place to see any ...\nTen twelve thousand years ago North America actually was populated by these enormous birds noticed territory ends\nAnd they did have wing spans anywhere from twelve to Eighteen feet across a and they were somewhat related to modern contours and vultures so they may have had that kind of raptor like appearance of ... in essence what we could be dealing with here\nIs a surviving population perhaps a very small population of these enormous prehistoric birds\nAnd what better place for these birds to remain hidden that in the great state of Alaska\nYou know I'll always remember this incredible story and I believe it was an Illinois can the woman who came outside to see a bird with the Palins stuck into its her son a little boy and it was lifting him up and she had to knock him down with a broom\nYup absolutely that's a the lawn Dale incident you\nNailed it July twenty fifth Nineteen Seventy seven ten year old Martin low was picked up by went up to the giant blackbirds writing from his mother and several other eyewitnesses carry for several feet until they were able to basically\nConvinced as birds to let go of him and are are there are other accounts in history Georgia of of giant Thunderbird type creatures are carrying away small children for example um I don't know the documented cases of the parents you know carrying way adults\nAre but theoretically if you were talking about a bird with a twenty five foot wingspan way perhaps a couple of hundred pounds or more and you know it is it is a possibility so that is something we explored for the for this particular episode that perhaps some of these missing people in Alaska\nGod Forbid maybe carried away by these giant thunderbirds to some remote craggy peak in said the baby birds so [laughter] it's hard to envision isn't it but ah definitely a chill is running down my spine right now like God about is how\nBig do you think the eggs will be twelve inches tall two feet tall how big\n[laughter] they'd be ... I mean a ... you get a badge and an ostrich egg and maybe several times larger than that if you've ever seen an ostrich egg or they're they're pretty big so\nYou know what that is one of the uh uh from a skeptical point of view that is one of the frustrating thing is we don't have any physical evidence of east on her birds no one has found a giant egg or a giant master anything yet but\nUh that certainly doesn't preclude that or the possibility that they exist because I've interviewed as I've\nSaid many dozens of people very credible people from all walks of life who have testified that they've seen these things and I believe them\nSo this is all geared to people disappearing in Alaska so are we talking about all the ... one or two which which theory do you think might be the one\nWell each episode we explore a different theory and um you know what was really remarkable is that as we delved into each ledge in each each possibility the reality of them you know kind of slapped us in the face\nA you know it's one thing when you're sitting there and you're reading a", "station": "KVWM", "city": "Show Low"}
