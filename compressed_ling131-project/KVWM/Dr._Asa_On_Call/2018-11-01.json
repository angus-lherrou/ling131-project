fire Jeff Zucker and you\nFor promoting anti white hatred on CNN and the time like this you're not a yelling fire in a crowded theater you're pouring gasoline on a fire after the murders of the Jews in Pittsburgh you have the nerve to say a thing like this\nAnd Jeff Zucker has the nerve to let you the dumb arrogant at that you are continues to spew hatred\nTo boost your writings no I'm Sorry

that guy was you know God the steroid guy the stripper All right we laughed at it then we said thank God no one got hurt and then Saturday this horrible\nHorrible thing happens I wanted to I tried to warn you on friday what happens when you keep demonizing people on the bottom\nAnd you don't have to like them to understand\nThat you could provoke people into doing things by saying certain things about them\nAnd if you think I'm justifying what he did then you're crazy I never justified what he did I'm explaining the mind of these people and that's part of my job is to going inside the mind of these people trying to stop this violence not started so now we go to Pittsburgh\nAnd here is a Jewish doctor who treated this evil man in clip number two I'll listen to what the Jewish doctor said\nOh yesterday I went up to meet him [noise]\nBut I was just curious as to\nAnd quite honestly he's just a guy\nAnd he's [noise]\nPeople who use evil use this as some others so then how does he get from\nThat to where he is today that's going to be a large base that we have to wrestle with as a society and\nYou see now that's intelligence that's intelligence as a Jewish doctor\nWho went up thinking he'd see a monster and he said just someone sun and how did he get to that from where he is today that's going to be a large debate that we have to wrestle with as a society that's what we mean by intelligence\nThat's an educated man with compassion who cares about people and the country now listen to number Thirteen from the same Jewish doctor\nYou know he was severely injured and he got great care here or many of the people that tend to him were Jewish [noise] you know they're heroes they they they do like the cops to be did their job they when they they confronted the problem when they were ... or core beliefs and I'm very proud of him\nHe's like a lot of people are coming here that\nThey're scared or confused we don't quite understand it\nLet's get my job is to judge other people will give you a bit so pretty awesome responsibility when jobs take care of him\nHe said my job is not to judge and the word not what's left out\nBut he's not like the cops I mean I Love doctors in emergency settings I think they're heroes but they're not like the cops because their lives were in the rest of the cops went in knowing their lives were at risk so it's not exactly true but nevertheless alright the point is that this Jewish doctor treats this anti Semitic Nazi\nAnd he says he thought he would see amongst the quite honestly just the guy and people said he's evil but he's just some of the sun and how to get from that to where it yesterday that's going to be a large debate that we have to wrestle with as a society\nThat's what you should be hearing in the media not the ... stuff that Jeff Zucker puts out on the airwaves every day as a stock in trade that so that's my whole point for today's show basically\nNow let's turn to another element of the same kind of ... and Saturday an evil Nancy Pelosi\nShe's asking why she doesn't tell him down or hateful rhetoric and the whole Democratic Party listen to what she says a number for\nThat unifying I can see all the time to heal I hate when we ran you will see evidence of a fast because one lead you free well half as we are from the new Congress was\nVows if I found a play on some many wine\nAnd that's it that's the whole thing so in other words once you have power again then you'll stop the hatred Nancy is that right Kenya Democrats find anyone else but these old rich white women and these old rich white men\nToo who insight incite hatred in this country Kenya Democrats do better than that now that's a dialogue we need to have in this country you claim you want diversity\nYou claim that you want
