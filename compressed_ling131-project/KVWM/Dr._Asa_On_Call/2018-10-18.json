about Steven Hawkins as tragic as his life was because of a a less did it suddenly elevate him\nTo a position greater than that of a um Albert Einstein how do scientists like Stephen Hawking become demi gods of thought suddenly get all fields including theology it's the same question is Dr Ford being bigger now than Dr Freud how did that fraud doctor for Ford\nNoticed they called her doctor for they don't call them ... that you noticed that just watch out how the media applies labels to people she was Dr Ford everyone in that kind of sanctimonious talk for a doctor how did she become bigger than Dr Freud\nAnd how did hawking become bigger than Einstein as I said Stephen Hawking has died a while ago and now we're being told today that uh he declared in his final book God is not that he or she never existed in the first place\nShe reported he said no one directs the universe\nNow it disturbed me for a number of reasons why should his thoughts on guard meaning as atheistic thoughts on the non existence of God suddenly supersede that of all of humanity from the beginning of the logical history or shouldn't\nBut you'll notice how the media is playing this great role and I asked the question today why is Stephen Hawking considered such a world genius well\nBecause he pushed global warming any now we learned he said there was no God he's an atheist group\nAnd I want to discuss his disease a alas today for two reasons one because of what he said there was no God and we can then segue into what is a ls and other neurological diseases diseases including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's

Steve what's your uh city\nOr in Mendocino okay and this\nAnd and what your book Steve\nIt's called everyone has a circus cat it's a memoir on masking a child's P. T. S. D.\nAnd it finished um I've had two PHD's read it one medical doctor and uh it's going to address the fact that most homeless people were once in the foster care orphanage situation and I was in all of it [noise]\nUnbelievable well that's a correlation I never read about\nHairs here is the author's note which I wrote everyone is like a circus tent when it comes along and blows you this way and that and it's all according to how many takes you have holding you down and how thin your canvas is is that what happens next\nIt's nice to have you tried publishers within\nA we're going to go to somebody ironically in Berkeley first because they publish a certain books this is a it could go both ways they can do is a good read and it can go as a clinical ah tests or for\nExtra nice it's a nice idea it and let me give you an immediate let's say I'm a publisher and it comes to make original idea a well thought out is the is the market large enough for that book Steve\nThe comments are this is one of the most honest here jerking a you know if I'm not trying to be a fear that Michael um but if my wife is a clinical first Dr ... from tough\nAnd she just said that it has a market for both either a heartstrings\nLet me ask you something you can self publish books today you know you can bypass\nYou you're going to get publishers who may not talk to you because there's not commercial enough that doesn't mean the book is not valid you could and go out today into an Amazon related book or on the ... the other services and they'll they'll Britain publishing promote your book for you\nAnd you don't have to sell that many copies to get some attention and then the then part of it is a good part if the book takes off on its own you can then go to a publisher and say look I sold twenty five thousand copies on my own there'll be interested at that time Steve that's how the industry works in a given the call now that's a tip for everyone out there who thinks that they're an author\nYou don't need to go to New York and have your heartbroken they have a whole different you know parameter for books let's be clear\nAnd they'll say to you if the if you even get an answer sorry not for us or\nIts not commercial enough for a good idea if you're lucky enough they'll give you an answer most of the times you won't even get an answer but you can bypass that if you have a book that's a little quirky are different and you think it's worth a ... worth telling or an idea worth expressing\nAnd that is self publishing through one of the major major outlets and I'm promoting it through that service as well by buying some ads and what happens is people will read it if they like it\nYou'll get noticed and then it'll sell and then you go to a publisher at that point with the pre sale of X number of copies it doesn't mean it's gonna work\nNor does it mean if it doesn't work that your book is invalid that could mean that your book is fabulous and the work of genius but the people just aren't ready for I'll give an example as ... as successful as I Am with my commercial books stop mass hysteria being example number one right now going back\nCommercial books stop mass hysteria being example number one right now going back God faith and reason Trump's war and the other stop becoming civil war you name it\nI self published on Kendall a couple of books last year including xenon actually when I actually think it's the greatest work of genius I've ever written\nIt's hasn't sold more than a couple of hundred copies it actually makes me happy to understand that the book is so far ahead of time in that it's not popular enough for the times I had publishes look at it they ... they were terrified of it because it shows a post feminist world that's act\nAbsolutely indicative of where we are going especially after the Kavanaugh hearings if you're talking about a mass killing men that was about a physical reality rather than a a psychological reality so it has a show but it doesn't determine for thinking it's one of my best books\nAnyway that's what I'm trying to say she got to keep on keep on keep on doing it don't let anyone tell you know and don't rely on any one person for the opinion of what your work is worth okay back in a minute\nJoined the Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred Savage eight five a four hundred

country than it's to\nThe United states is going to be defeated but the American people will survive and following the defeat of the United states which is described in Bible prophecy in is he killed chapter thirty eight we are told and I'll I'll read the scripture let me just\nTurn the not too long because I don't get into scripture oh you don't me to read it just give us a paraphrase\nOkay paraphrase at the at the time of the end a great power from the north along with many nations will attack Israel which would have been re gathered back to its land and they will also attack another nation\nThat is also a nation of immigrants a nation of great wealth whose citizens dwell securely with no consensus no walls around any of their city's no wall on their border with Mexico\nAnd that mission to will also be attacked at the same time Israel's attacks the communist and Arab alliances going to attack Israel\nAnd they're going to attack the United states and they're going to take out the U.S has a superpower\nAnd they're going to occupy the middle east they're going to grab the oil they're going to grab control the oil reserves and they're going to eliminate the United states is balance against their power and there'll be in a position to dictate turns to the Europeans who will stand in their way they want to see it at the table to run the new world order George\nAnd they're going to make their move most likely within the next three years\nAnd then what happens to Israel\nCourting the scripture Israel will be protected they no doubt we'll use their nuclear arsenal and\nThe Israelis have a Web surprising people there are very bold militarily they are not afraid to use their capabilities and I mean once they realize World War is underway Israel will forget about the political correctness\nOf measured response in Israel execute the Hamptons strategy which is basically they will\nEliminate their enemies Israel is also a nuclear power and they will\nPrevail and then there'll be substantial loss of life the Arab major Arab cities note that will be hit the United states will be hit Russia will be hit the world will suffer population loss of proximity one point five billion people would be my estimate and out of the ashes of this war\nA one world government will rise in power and the anti Christ which is the figure who will head up the final world government he will come to power and the earth will go into the final period of human history which Bible in\nHe will come to power and the earth will go into the final period of human history which Bible indicates will last for seven years\n\nThis is a scary world\nWar three and this cannot be changed\nNo sir but what can be changes what happens in in my life and in your life and in the lives of our family\nWhat happens to the American people can be change what's going to happen in human history cannot so there is good news well I mean we are facing a World War world wars have happened before there were people living in Europe that we're facing the Nazis some of them survived some didn't\nBut wars happen we the history of our planet has a history of warfare that era of peace and prosperity which the world has witnessed in the last two hundred years particularly the peace and prosperity of the United states of America is and then now I'm only if you look at the six thousand years of recorded history\nTyranny and and the absolute I mean the mayhem of ... of the violence of humanity has been the norm\nAnd so we're going back to a period of time you know the seasons of of our of our earth very much parallel the seasons of history\nWe're entering into a time of winter\nAnd we're entering into a time of you know it's a return of the dark ages if you will Elton John captured it perfectly in a in a recent hit song that he wrote where he said turn around and said good morning to the night there is a new day coming\nOnly this day will be called the night and it it's not up behind all of us\nAnd we're about to turn around and say good morning to the new day that his coming into depth darkness but there is hope there is hope for the people\nWhat kind of non life so we'll be Benjamin people pardon me what kind of life would be for people who are less\nWell for the Americans to survive there's going to be according to scripture there's going to be a great\nI I guess you'd call it a renaissance\nThat the American people that they survive the war are going to ... turned to the cultural roots of our country\nPeople are going to become um religious they're going to become Christian they're going to stop all of this materialism there's going to be a return to family there's going to be a return to God there's going to be a return to the truth\nAnd for the rest of the world they're going to be given over to the darkness of the anti Christ so in many ways this war that's coming on our soil is in effect a blessing because the world is turned over to the dark horse is of the apocalypse the survivors in America are going to have a renaissance of righteousness\nIt's actually going to work out better for the United states than any other country on the earth accept Israel\nBut it's ... very high price\nWell you know what we are approaching you know seven plus billion people on the planet maybe nine in another ten years ... billion to them has nothing\nTo these global puppet masters it is nothing and you know when you take all of the variables into consideration George and there's a lot of variables this is a complex analysis 'cause we're talking about the direction of human history\nWhat are the variables is really the often ignored is a scarcity of resources and I knew the price of oil is down at president because of supply and demand imbalances in the market and because of the recession the global depression is continuing to weaken demand\nAnd we've had a bit of a surge of oil production out of the the ... region for example but the truth of the matter is we're running out of inexpensive oil reserves\nAnd more important than that we're running out of all water if you look at the main aqua fires underneath there are agricultural production regions in this country every year we we think the pumps deeper\nThe same things happening in China we're running out of freshwater\nWe're running out of\nThe available resources to\nSatisfy the demand for growth the world's economic system George is built on evaluation metric that requires continued growth if we don't keep growing we have a recession which throws the whole system into chaos\nAnd the ability to continue to grow the economic system the population in the standard of living is predicated on an\n... never ending supply of cheap raw materials available resources but the resources of our planet their fix their that infinite and so if you look at the projection for economic growth in China and India and the other third world countries that are industrialized and\nThey're talking about adding two hundred million more vehicles to the road and the next Twenty years that would take aggregate petroleum demand from eighty five million barrels a day which is roughly today's production and demand levels to a hundred and twenty million barrels per day\nWhere's that production coming from and when you look at the production data on the super oil fields in Saudi Arabia the go walk feel being the largest which produces about six million barrels per day which is you know roughly eight percent of the world's petroleum production go why has been produced and send Nineteen fifties\nAt first they just put a straw in the ground and the oil came up without even any need to pump it because of the inherent pressure and the underground reservoir but by the early Nineteen sixties\nThey began to experience problems with the pressure within the field they began natural gas re injections\nBy the early seventies that stopped working they went to injection of salt water and they lined the work field with injection well as they began to pump eight million barrels of salt water into the rational for every day in the Nineteen seventies this is going on for over forty years and the underground\nGeology has been changing the field is watering in and all the perimeter wells are being shot in because the water recovery rates\nAre so high that the way I was no longer economical and as a result they drill more and more wells in the center of the real well beginning a couple of years ago George\nHad to go to complex lateral completion hold on Benjamin whereas the break we'll be back\nNeal is to make sure you sign up for the goose ... glitter ... who's who's the I'm Doug [noise]\nThat will culminate in attacks against our communications infrastructure satellite up links will be disrupted the phones to go down the T. V. won't work the power will be out and it's not going to come back on for several days that your final warning people\nThat the ICBMs are ready to fly\nTo get ready but back to the ... of the lord George it's such a huge topic can you know men have been writing and talking and you know giving their bad I guess about Bible prophecy ever since the first prophetic books were written and yet\nProphecies were sealed until the end of time we're told that in the book of Daniel so how would you ever on you of the book it has to be revealed\nIn order for the true answer to be unsealed and how would you know the scripture says at the time at the end men of wisdom would come forth out of the wilderness to give understanding to the many how would you know how would you discern the people who got\nThe true insight into these matters from the seven thousand counterfeiters who are court gestures in the palaces Babylon well they will be authenticated there'll be evidence let me share one little story of authentication ... after the book came out I spoke all over the country\nAnd in one instance I went up myself without the help of God and the crowd was laughing at me and it was mostly young people in their twenties and the girls were giggling and I'm from moving around George because this is a big subject sure a lot of elements to what's coming upon our country\nAnd after a few minutes to basically losing the audience\nThat spoke to me and said I'll take the conversation from here the subject changed now I began to speak with authority and\nI told this crowd the first four judgments are ready to begin and they're ready to come forth upon you even now\nAnd I walked in to the audience George and grab this young man by the upper arm and I sit on the porch arguments are going to come forth Charles like on your arm and I'm poking him in the arm pretty hard to while I'm saying this\nHe stands up and runs out of there and someone chased after him I just kept talking the man who chased him comes running back in five minutes interrupts me how did you know about his arm\nI said I I don't even know what you're talking about I couldn't remember saying this he said well you said it would be just like his arm and that point I remembered I said well I did say that but I don't know anything about his arm will be sitting in his car so scared you can't drive\nThat's why he ran on that list and I don't know anything well he had a tattoo of the Fort horsemen oh revelation on his arm or those are the first four judgments at that point that crowd that have been laughing at me suddenly stop laughing\nThey talk about Trump it's during the end times yes have they sounded\nA no not in my opinion I Believe the seals are opening the\nRider on the white horse the first horse been ... been writing for some time and he wears a crown anywhere is all white and yet it goes forth to conquer the earth but he appears to be a good power he fights for peace and democracy\nAnd he's wearing a crime because the nations of the earth viewed this empire at one time as the legitimate leader of the nations of the world and the rider on the white horse coincidentally also lives in a White House\nWell moving rolling out of one world government of the beast you know the policies that we pursued in the middle east could never have achieved their stated objective it was impossible walk the leaders of our country and do these things\nThe propaganda they tell the people doesn't make any sense if you understand the realities of the true issues we're dealing with but that doesn't stop them from using the propaganda because George the American people there dancing with the stars\nAnd they're watching their favorite and that for a living and that's our football team on Sunday\nAnd their understanding of any of the issue was confined to our country it runs about thirty second deep past thirty seconds they change subjects\nHave been conditioned to think in Fifteen and thirty second impulses and white issue can be understood in thirty seconds nothing only propaganda can be ingested\nAnd so the American people are clueless\nIs the Russians would say they're not serious people now there is always aware minority that listeners of your show people that are taking the time to stay awake and listened to coast to coast people that are looking to alternative media people that are asking the kind of questions you ask on this program these are the people that are alert and aware and they're like some things going on here\nWe are not being told the truth George\nI think that's kind of obvious everybody was thinking right\nExactly exactly so let's get into climate change\nYeah there is a great example of where we are not being told the truth about climate change we're we're being told that man kind this production and consumption of fossil fuels his filling the atmosphere with carbon residents\n... is filling the atmosphere with carbon residue which is altering the climate and in order to save the earth we need to impose restrictions even new taxes on\nCarbon consumption fuel consumption they need to strangle the economy further is there any truth to that at all know the science is the opposite those particles actually are reflective in her having the opposite effect so what is really driving climate change the\nClimate is clearly changing right\nOh huge I mean I'm In St Louis right now we've had four days just started to stop ... I'm not talking about sprinkles torrential rain or the worse they say since flooding of Nineteen Ninety three or were they had a five hundred years one but\nI mean it's just truly unbelievable forty three people died in tornadoes in slums already in the mid west forty three people\nAnd it's practically springtime weather on the east coast\nIt's weird I mean do we we are in winter now is this is this change though is a difficult process she changed what is it\nWell the Bible said they'd be signs in the earth and climate change is one of the science there's a couple of dimensions to what's going on first there is a\nTechnology of whether warfare and there's actual laws that have been passed making it a federal offense to export any weather modification technology outside of the country because whether warfare is a very effective\nWay to wage war which you can stop the weather wars and who can really blame you I mean who really knows who's manipulating the weather right George writes pretty hard to prove that\nWon the harp antenna versus another modified the ionosphere and redirected these wind currents\nAnd you create droughts you can just about to your ... your opponent you can do anything you can make your water supply dwindled away\nWhoa yeah you can destroy a nation by changing\nI'm Wondering if somebody's doing that with the west coast right now who they're still resume question\nThat the Bible said there'd be wars and rumors of war and the weather warfare technology\nExists I mean I've seen the legislation\nWhere it's as I mentioned in a fence to export the technology that law wouldn't be on the books if the technology didn't exist but so clearly there is whether warfare occurring that involves\nProjecting microwave energy and think about a hurricane it's a big spinning top right\nAnd it's a it's a thermal exchange\nSystem that its transferring heat energy into wind and that circular wind up like a spinning top and you remember when we were all young we used to play\nWith those spinning tops I loved them all you had to do is just tap it on the side and what happened to the the spinning top knocked over you know or maybe it didn't fall over it started in a new path\nMine always fellows winds maybe an insight into fast enough\nOr you kept it a little too hard maybe too hard you needed a soft\nTouch but if you take these hurricanes they're huge spinning tops what do you think would happen if we being more microwave heat energy into the center of the hurricane\nWas drink and pushed it\nWould accelerate the that he transmission and increase wind speed what if we start adding energy along one the edge of the hurricane and we start beaming a projected microwave at the edge of the storm\nWe skip it like skimming it like if you get a a something spinning and you just slide your fingers real quickly along the edge that accelerates and changes direction\nIsn't something happening to our son Benjamin\nYes sir there is there is something happening to every planet in our solar system in it it is a scientific fact and as a result of all my work and I'm really an investigative reporter I I'm a gracious research analyst George", "city": "Show Low"}
