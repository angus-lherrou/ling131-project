against the nation's identity there one world order new world order people those to him and his son so don't confuse the two\nAnd here's the problem missed the shift by merging they're radical politics with the electorate religious affiliation\nWhat you're doing is smearing the religion itself and making the the larger population come to believe that all Jews are radical leftists which is where the problem begins that I Want to go into that\nBecause as I was reading about the Nazi who did this this cowardly Nazi to defense will develop in developmentally disabled brothers or this or their seventies and eighties some Ninety this was a cowardly act there was no heroism here\nI was thinking about this how did he know\nThat of all places how did they choose this reformed temple in

people having a good time always defenseless people to the logical conclusion is armed guards\nIf the people on on themselves then okay most people are afraid of guns by and large most people figure guns I've seen this my whole life I've heard people say I don't want to go\nMost people fear guns I've seen this my whole life I've heard people say I don't want a gun in my house and the answer is why well they're afraid they'll use it on themselves or they'll use it against the spouse in a moment of rage\nAnd then there are those of us who understand the difference between fear and reality and we understand that we have to protect ourselves in a society where you can't have a policeman in in every home\nSo we come back to the questions of the day which is should armed guards be placed in houses of worship absolutely no question about it just as we came to that conclusion with the school shootings were common sense would dictate that of course most schools have armed guards around them but not to the progressive\nThe regrets of mine is so blind to reality that no matter what the question is they always come up with the wrong answer\nWe're talking about the fact that hatred is in the air spreading like a virus we're talking about the fact that the media is the host organism that is spreading the virus we're talking about the fact that without hatred these media entities wouldn't survive a week\nThey wouldn't survive a week if they were told that they had to stop it\nIf you took Jeff Zucker in a room\nAnd you said you stop your Mary and that's on CNN from spreading this hatred against white people against white nationalist because you're just starting them up I'll tell you right now Jeff Zucker wouldn't change one word coming out of a Andy bloopers mouth or any of the other characters that worked for him and the chorus line\nThere's no common sense left is no decency left in the media\nSo today I told you I'm not going to write the whole ship of state but I Am talking

Pittsburgh you're not wanted here\nSixteen thousand communists in a group called bend the arc Jewish Action funded by Alexander Soros tens of thousands of quote regressive Jews and now they're rising up and solidarity against Donald Trump\nAnd the board of directors goes along with this do you have any idea what kind of anti Semitism the stars up in the country when the average person out there and they had to land says oh it's those used in Pittsburgh or don't want Trump there do you have any idea what damage progressive doing so this nation\nThey should know that after this killing to stop it but they can't stop it because of liberalism is a serious mental disorder\nThe rabbi wants Trump there the rabbi wants Trump they make no mistake about it it's this group of mentally bent individuals funded by Soros his son in this group bend the ... which is quite ironic bend the arc you hear bend the arc\nI Wonder how long it's been since any of them actually walk with an ark with a toe or from the arc and felt the power of those letters and the power of the books and Moses in those letters isn't magic in it by the way a power that you can't imagine unless you actually have done it\nWhen you're standing in front of those Hebrew letters even if you don't read them and you stare at them and you realize that for thousands of years these words of a God have instructed mankind\nYou feel something that you can explain in other words there's no way to uh to explain that you see\nWell again I don't think we should lose the focus of today's program on the Savage Nation it began with a new ... many of your calling in this hour missed the opening to our number one which is a shame but I understand most people listen for seven minutes or so to any talk radio show\nI opened with a holy cottage the prayer for the dead\nAnd I was trying to set the tone not only of civility but sanctity it was in the memory of those slaughtered in the\nSynagogue and Pittsburgh instead I get callers who are so regressive\nThat they bring up George Soros like he has nothing to do with the hatred right now that he's innocent land when he's been funding these radical leftist groups who in fact are terrifying disease nationalist by the way out of getting their backs up so if you want me to make the connections\nBetween the bogeyman of America today the one that you're allowed to voice contempt for the white nationalist\nI Will do so I'll be glad to do it for you\nBecause there have always been white nationalist in this country many of them died in World War two\nOh yes they mean a lot of white nationalist in America look at some of the revolutionary war cemeteries Oh yes they've been a lot of white nationalism in America\nLook at all of the um military cemeteries around America you'll see an awful lot of white nationalist who went to die ... fight and die for their country\nBut all of a sudden the word white a nationalist been linked together by the radical left into one phrase that signifies something other than being Caucasian hula ... a Caucasian loves his nation suddenly it means something akin to Nazi as him\nAnd this is a trick of the radical left in America they've tripped many people who don't even know what they're talking about to think that if you are of a Caucasian background and you're a nationalist you're a Nazi\nNecessarily so [noise] so therefore we have to look into the minds of the white nationalist especially the one who did this horrible thing this killing on Saturday and I haven't gotten to it yet

happen in the future today there's a story that says that there will be as many robots as there are humans within the next twenty four thirty nine years according to a blog post the writer is a science fiction novel is but you know what he might be right\nA little eight week old kitten who was rescued after being died purple and used as a chew we toys for a larger animal is recovering after it at emergency surgery in uh California hospital during the weekend\nWhere it very well intended effort was made to look for some way to get to perpetual growth but\nThe problem was that the rap to perpetual growth came from migration of poor people to rich economies\nAnd the problem with that is that the that Richard ... particularly uh Germany and some of the European countries got hooked on growth\nAnd as a result or seen some major displacement beginning so we we have a virtual migration going on into the realm of computers crossing that we have a physical migration the physical migration is because of an addiction to growth\nIn St Louis for example it looks like the St Louis rams are they could lead to move back to Los Angeles and the owner of the rams George Wild his report\nWith the NFL and chastised St Louis you talked about it is no roads you know you know just things slow it's not one of the big cities anymore I you know basically a one out of here right right is that happening all over the place over the country\nYeah we we have a lot of whining from spring I dunno I'm not big sports fan right a sports has a function I suppose as awards substitute\nMhm uh people go out and bite literally fight over a ball or hockey or\nThe Romans knew how to use it yeah coliseum\nAnd circuses time right the problem is that this is something that goes back to [noise]\nGosh the Nineteen seventies Nineteen sixties even uh I was a news director up in Seattle during that time the great debate was on about whether or not King County should use public bonding authority to build the kingdom\nAnd and the public really wanted to get a pro sports franchise get the Seahawks going and so forth but there was a little known critic of the stadium project guy named Frank Rwanda\nAnd Frank told me many times they said good idea and everything but\nWe'll never pay for the stadium and it turned out Romano is right now the king dome was blown up a ... shaped charges were used uh my wife and I were on earth sailboat out in Elliott Bay watching the kingdom\nBeing down up and about I think it was two thousand two thousand one no two thousand and it was a remarkable event because you know the public bonding authority or is that something we should\nAs you know the public bonding authority or is that something we should land\nTo commercial interest I we do it all the time of course you know we we bail out the too big to fail and we have all these other really questionable value judgments and it it's one of those things that I'm In in true capitalism you just let businesses they get in trouble\nFall apart but we don't do that instead we're really anxious to a save the jobs in Detroit for example ah bailing out the auto industry and it pays off a the auto industry has been the shining the light of this economy of the [noise] the mythical recovery\nAnd and the other part of the mythical recovery is the ah the stimulus effect of massive migration Germany or a ... you know literally over a million refugees in the past several years but\nIn return for accepting refugees they're getting a huge economic stimulus it it's it's very very highly charged emotionally but when you sit back and try and look at the world has\nA great interlocking spreadsheet which is what I tried to do you find that ... it's not as chaotic it's not as random there's an awful lot of well if this piece works than this piece has to go here\nAnd the news is not nearly a surprising as many people believe it to be on a superficial level\nNow let's talk about some trends here for two thousand sixteen George what do you see ahead for this year\nI'm actually very optimistic I think we'll continue unwinding a bit ah during the month of January but I'm about oh gosh and eighty percent chance that will be at record highs and both the Dow in the ...\nReally even though they got slapped yesterday oh sure\nSure ... you know it gets really interesting um a year ago I was on the show and we talked about you know what I saw him I said well we could have pulled back to as low as Seventeen forty in the S P\nUh we didn't quite get there we got down to Eighteen sixty five in the S. and P. but he also said the Dow should drop under sixteen thousand or so and sure enough the Dow dropped to Fifteen three Seventy\nAnd so ... ... you know the the gas is pretty good uh you have to remember that the the growth we have had in the economy\nAnd in stock prices are low in March or April of two thousand nine\nOr it's just about a perfect fit to the run up in the market\nFrom St Nineteen Twenty one to the middle of twenty eight so if if you imagine the bubble of the roaring twenties that finally capped everything up most of that bubble occurred in the final year and a half\nAnd we're just now coming up on that historical rhyming period I'm not I'm not a you know don't run out and invest money or\nA ... put some money on it on her own but ah generally speaking you know a a high end the Dow of even as much as thirty thousand on the Dow is\nPossible if we continue following this a replay of Nineteen twenty nine\nHow low can oil prices yet\nI think we we're veering here to those blows right now I'm the oil prices probably have something of a floor under them about twenty eight twenty nine bucks\nBut practically speaking low thirties and we've already visited that when one of the reasons for that and again this is how inter lacking a financial relationships explain a tremendous amount of 'em I've read reports that Saudi Arabia\nIs way upside down and they were economy because their break even point with all their social programs they run they run kind of a royal welfare system which trickles down from the royal family\nBut it works very effectively and it's a it's an interesting system of government but but they have a break even point of about a hundred bucks a barrel for uh keeping their country happening\nAnd that way under there\nWere totally under it and and so ... and here's how the news kinda fits together right it's like a big ... so if you've got a country and you have a population\nThat is used to being welfare well cared for how do you keep him in line how do you keep everybody pulling together well the answer is you have an enemy\nAnd along comes the the Shia Sunni split in in ...\nAnd the Saudis of course that's the land of the hobby and so forth are they're very strongly Sunni and the Shiites are the Iranians are pressuring them and and so if if we see a schism in his lab\nA it is being fueled in part by low oil prices because you you have ... read that book report from iron mountain on the accessibility and desire ability of peace\nNo fascinating\nBut back during the Vietnam War it came out as a parity supposedly get peace done by a think tank and it ... it was a great book because it it fed war serves an awful lot of economic function of course\nThe least of which is it's a great excuse to get taxes it's a great excuse to keep people under control regimen station comes along during that a social controls and so forth\nAnd and uh to a very large degree the theory even though was supposedly a satire a the theory of that book seems to be very nicely apply in the modern world\nI'm a country that goes very very militant um take North Korea with their bomb deal today\nHold on for a second worst regret the brake already we'll ... we'll be back and talk more about trends in two thousand sixty\nGet Daily Show updates rate your inbox were free with the coast noon newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com [noise]\nIn terms of future development of the things that I wake up in the middle of the night worrying about\nAh I worry about a dark alliance taking place uh I I I have the I you know it's like a chess puzzle you you put things together in different places on the board and go well if this move happens then what would happen and the one that bothers me the most right now George is what would happen\nIf we had three or four wars laid off at the same time um picture North Korea developing a relationship with ISIS or I saw or North Korea developing a closer relationship with\nWhich is already doing extensive missile testing they've had some launches I Believe on the Caspian off of a platforms and and so when you look at the technologies if the north Koreans the Iranians\nAnd other Shiite interests all got together a that could be very bad and in that\nGulch China is now in a major slowed down a there's no denying it the the uh the Shanghai market was down seven percent Monday or they are definitely in the cooling mode\nAnd what better way to ramp up the economy of China than to go more uh onto a war footing and that of course would bring Taiwan into the cross hairs are worth\nSo so we have we have these um these places are if if you draw\nExes on the map you've got a potential battle a over Ukraine you've got a are undeclared war to a kick out a President Assad from Syria um and we've got the Russians\nBombing the uh the the ISIS ah oil tankers to keep that back channel of revenue stream I ... I mean this really gets to be complicated and then of course you've got to the tensions around Lebanon\nAh Israel is always in a state of high readiness so that's kind of a question mark and then if you go around the globe you've got India and Pakistan both nuclear armed countries\nAnd unlike the the standoff between the U.S than the former Soviet Union during the Cold War or they don't have twenty minutes of flight time between them they've got about five minutes and\n... there's not much time to make up your mind\nYeah and and then if you travel around the world and you see Taiwan and in North Korea\nA and M. so if you had two or three of those really light up but I don't I don't mean you know people from the state department going and passing out cookies or the people from the EU um [noise] it the he used problematic uh the European Union\nA whole lot of uh their top officials ah have retired fairly young you know fifty five a great big fat pension benefits and so forth and and they've really become addicted to the economic stimulus that bringing a million people into what I now call your abs\nBecause of the huge influx of migration um they are in a really difficult spot because they're they're making a bet\nThat people coming to Europe will participate in the system will assimilate and will pay a lot of taxes so the fat cats that are retired can keep getting their money\nAnd it's an interesting notion but I'm not sure there's any historical precedent for it you know people either will or will now to simulate based on their cultural backgrounds and I'm not terribly opt optimistic about that so [laughter]\nYou know the period that gets really icy will probably not come after a until after the onset of a great big depression and I don't think we're going to get there till twenty Seventeen twenty Eighteen now and in one of the reasons is we're what'd you do think we'll get there\nOh yeah yeah yeah no question about it um the the problem with the uh western system of capitalism is if I've got ten bucks and I and you don't have any\nAnd I Linda to U.S interests uh where are you going to get that extra money for him and and so we're always watering down our currency in order to effectively make up the ... what the uh\nUh gosh the the um uh bookies would call the big [laughter] and and so uh we have watered down the American dollar\nTo the point where we we have four points Seventeen percent a just a little over four percent of the purchasing power in the dollar that we had in Nineteen Thirteen when the Federal Reserve came along a people don't realize it but in Nineteen Thirteen of steak dinner was one dollar\nA today it's about twenty five and and you can test that in just about any commodity won but that's what's happened we are we are in this diluting the dollar\nAnd it's not bad because it allows the little guys like you and me to buy homes with twenty percent down living more or less\nLast church sure although the ... started right up a bed you bad debts that inflation\nOr to dry up a bed you bet that's\nThat inflation is not entirely bad because it's a social conveyor that lifts people up and it's still working uh the problem though a comes after we get through twenty six team the reason I'm so optimistic\nAh for the stock market George is I think we're ... even the Republicans\nThink they've got a real shot at it historically they do because the uh the winner of the twenty eight election was a Herbert Hoover and he was replaced with Roosevelt and the thirty two election\nAnd and so historically the Republicans have a good shot at it but the other side of it is that so did the Democrats and both sides believe very strongly that they're going to come out victorious\nWhen that was going to be my next question to you to George is to make a two thousand sixteen presidential election prediction\nWell [noise] the it it depends on if you ask me from a heart level are you asking me from the finance level my my heart is Trump is saying some good things\nA cruise is saying some good things uh I'm less thrilled with Rubio but if I ... and that you know a has a gosh conservative American put it that way\nOr if I look strictly at finance he'll round the real question is can be office of president be purchased and there's a pretty strong case that it can be a hits all a matter of advertising persuasion blocks cost per point in advertising\nWould you rule Jeb Bush ... [noise]\nYou didn't mention him\nYeah I didn't mention him ... cars but the the one liability I think Bush has is he would be identified too strongly by too many people uh has been part of the two previous Bush administration\nHorse absolute and\n... and then we get into the whole problem of the American aristocracy and one can paid Hillary into that box because she too has been around the White House before not as the sole decision maker but they're you know pillow talk his pillow talk\nYeah all of that is true you were down on bitcoin says I still am but you know kind of tempered that a little\nYeah that comes George from looking at Eli wave a application uh basically the the ...\nI'm In this time around maybe the analog discussing money in a mattress a it's a it's a potential way to stuff money on a hard drive\n[laughter] and that's progress for you're right that you know we we go along eighty five years or so and yeah we go from the adverse to the hard drive why are we ever in advance the teeth [laughter] but I think that there is a good chance that bitcoin or one of the crypto currency is will emerge over time\nAnd will become kind of a dollar alternative\nAh the good news about the coins is there isn't right now a an easy way to water them down\nExcept uh you know as bitcoins go up in value or so will the ... and and so\n... which is a fraction of bitcoin and\nSo yeah I think you know there's a case for another run at a a third wave up forbid claimed the first wave took it up to almost a thousand a on that basis there's a case for Fifteen hundred uh Eighteen hundred dollar kinds of bitcoins\nBut again I'm what does a digital\nThing represent in a way of purchasing power I I'm a lot like Gerald ... and the and I like gold I've always liked gold likes over I like um you know having your own personal seed vault and a little bit of skills in gardening but I don't think you're going to need it yeah I think that comes\nA two one cute to a twenty Seventeen\nAre where we we get a new president we're going to anyway but whoever it is turns out to be a disappointment a win Hoover took office in March of twenty nine", "station": "KVWM", "city": "Show Low"}
