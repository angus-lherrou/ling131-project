decided they are not going to uh run through the Iranian sanctions that President Trump will put back in place on Monday\nAnd there are other countries in Europe who are with us um and I'm convinced that over time all of the European countries will come to see that Iran is indeed the uh the force creating instability in the middle east and that we must apply all possible pressure to push back against that to fix it\nSo the sanctions going place on Monday correct yes ma'am Monday\nAnd they'll feel them immediately really take a little time to settle and\nSo are there are already feeling them but a mess the days go on the pressure will increase we will substantially drop the amount of crude all their primary revenue source that they can ship around the world a treasury will put back in place of sanctions on financial institutions there\nAnd we hope that the sanctions were put on individuals and in other places will convince the leadership and we we walk the Iranian people to uh be successful we want this to be a successful country wants to restore democracy that we we think the Iranian people want that same thing\nAs our aim is uh not to hardly renting people but to change

work we can expect more and more and more of them just like we have\nIndividually as we let them across the border we now have probably twenty to thirty billion illegals here\nOr are you being outspent significantly on the ... in the ad wars in other outreach to voters getting in to the polls are online social media and so forth\n... there's the irony of all of this of course we're being called because of our positions like on the legal immigration were being called the establishment Republicans are the party of the rich we're being told\nBut we've got these billionaires point money and I get my opponent's campaign and into all of the uh\nHow you say a combat or a or you're in all of the districts that are in combat between Republican\nAnd Democrat their ... their point in the big guys are pouring in millions and ... hundreds of billions of dollars across the country millions and billions in in my district so it's difficult because uh\nI I Am not very wealthy man my opponent a is a wealthy person and he came here he's only been in California about six or seven years here are they from his dad came out of your well I don't have the money that I spent on the campaigns are here it's a real challenge\nFor close to where it goes to actually having no\nMoney left but we have raised over two million dollars too high opponents four and a half billion dollars on the bench but Bloomberg type money that's coming into the into the race\nThat the press is calling this a forty eighth district race in California a referendum on Trump and the Trump agenda what is your take on a\n[noise] I think that it you know that's\nOne element of the race certainly a a I think though that I've been a supporter of the president on things like illegal immigration I differ with the president once or twice as well on on on major issues that are most things like\nThat on the president's side and I admire the president and the good job but he's been doing so that is an issue here\nHowever the the most important thing is is that my opponent she got a choice to be my soap or the other person how the Democratic candidates are ... and\nShe or he basically does he's a newcomer to the area and he doesn't understand any of the things that go to the heart of what it's like to be a piece of this uh this county in this part of the country\nAnd I mean I grew up surfing on the beaches here and uh I better I I went to high school here in ... and at college here have a ... so what it is is that if\nThe president is an issue but we've got an outsider in this district was trying to a game right to represent us a guy on the is leaving part part I mean really\nYeah well there you know obviously the your seat is it's quite a trophy if the Democrats can defeat you\nAre you been in for Fifteen terms I you came in as a strong Reagan a conservative or libertarian leaning and are you now are in the fight with you know someone who's getting an enormous amount of outside
