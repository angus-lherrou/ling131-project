show that is the capstone of my day I really love watching you and she knew an action and it's an honor to speak to you right now so what I wanted to say is that you made a point on your angle the other night and I quite honestly don't think it's gotten enough attention\nAnd that's the idea that you said if I recall that Trump is teaching the Republicans how to fight and I absolutely think that that was a brilliant insight I mean it I think a true are seeing the results that all over the place right now\nI think Rob that came to me as I was watching Lindsey Graham\nDuring the confirmation battle when he he saw that Kavanaugh I think was getting a little too he was besieged and the questions and Kavanaugh was I think he was getting real hot okay\nAnd I think Lindsey Graham decided you know something to heck with this I'm I'm going to take the floor and I'm going to reset this debate about the Kavanaugh confirmation he did that I think it was after the president's press conference\nWhere the president came out an hour and a half and he was just fantastic and his support of Kavanaugh\nAnd with whether what what the reporters how we dealt with reporters he was having a good time but he said you know what to do this anymore I'm not I'm not playing defense anymore\nAnd the Republicans have got to stop playing defense Trump won by being on the off and he's not in perpetual apology mode because he said\nHe sent a sharp tweet about someone he kept moving forward he didn't look back he's not going to dwell over mistakes we all need to do that any look forward keep moving the ball down the field that's what Trump has taught us as Republican and guess what a lot of Republicans are now seeing it\nHe's transforming the political party and it was in a moment too soon\nI really appreciate your comments Rob we have a great team on the anger mangled we're going to take a break Kellyanne Conway up next\n\nYou're listening do more in your health the radio

Dianne Feinstein recommended these a democratic activist lawyers to Ford\nWhy they never told her she can testify in private and keep her ... her face in her name out of the press as much as she could she could just do it in California they go to them that's something that Senator Lindsey Graham told me right away he said she can do it by phone we can send somebody out there\nBut no no no they needed a clean slate and the cameras\nOn for them and I guess there next client base so it it's just been awful but America has been watching and I don't the after he's confirmed and\nHopefully he will be I won't get ahead of the way certain senators are grappling with their vote decided to vote Lara but um if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed as a justice of the United States Supreme court this will not end there they think it won't end because it's still be shouting at men they've never met for things these men have never done to them personally and individually but\nOther folks won't forget how people behaved\nHow they were her raining folks drive drumming them out of restaurants publishing their their kids' names in their personal home addresses\nThat that's not that's not the first amendment that's just crazy that's crazy\nYou know do you um think that in part I mean are are you argue this last week uh when the president came out of the press conference which I think was one of his best press conferences last week of incredible I mean you could have gone for three hours or that he taught a\nA really needed lesson much needed lesson to Republicans on how to fight\nFor what you believe in a fight for a principal fight for a person instead of being back on your heels cowering in an elevator that that the reason Trump got elected as because he wasn't gonna take that any more he wasn't going to just keep getting pummeled and beyond perpetual a perpetual apology tour for either him sell for America and\nHe he's not they called him ... I think the bullies are the people who are swarming individuals in public or the Senate or restaurants in ... screaming at them within a centimeter of their skin but I think Trump's taught the Republicans a lot throughout this whole thing\nIn a large struck me just last night after I was on your TV show and thanks for having me uh that the way everybody describes Donald Trump President Trump is exactly that they're behaving and when I don't see from him he's\nFuming he's throwing things at the TV he's angry he's a bully it's exactly who they've become he's not\nThat way how they're welcome yeah these unbelievable job numbers and and bringing peace across the world and bring it make us prosper it a ... at home if he's sitting there fuming all day they they own the acrimony they own ... vicious wave via way they've gone after people um according to one gender according to one's politics\nAnd you're so right he doesn't retreat and backed down when he believes in a principal\nOr a principal in this case PAL Brett Kavanaugh and they didn't know each other before this they didn't know each other well at all but the president fallen judge Kavanaugh somebody who sat\nWho is sitting on the DC circuit second highest court in the land over three hundred ... judicial opinions that none of these Democrats even try to pick apart I respect them far more Lars they said you know we have a problem with the five following opinions that he wrote and these particular passages we think he went outside the contours of the constitution the law there is no such\nOr no or John about about\nThey're talking about a passage from your book you can sit in a post it note versus three hundred judicial opinions the answers to twelve hundred written questions over one million documents you need a Mack truck the hall around all this stuff he's produced and you need a post it\nTo talk about a passage in your book so this just drive a lot of Americans even apolitical Americans Laura as a logical and beyond commonsense I respect them more if they said we're angry lost the election two years ago and that President Trump is reshaping the federal judiciary with constitutional less than all this nonsense\nWe're going to later on in the show can have a discussion about\nWhat these currents ominous are doing to poison the relationship between men and women and specifically the ah this idea that if you're if you're an accuser\nYou must be heard and you must be believed and if you're not believe than your anti woman or you're anti victim\nAnd justice Thomas's talked about this a lot you know the ... we all have to stop identifying herself as victims of this or victims of that because I they that's not going to help you advance with the person as being about ...\nDoesn't and that every every man as a perpetrator every man\nHas to shoulder the burden of the me too movement every man is it raises every man is a sexual harassed or by virtue of their gender and then every woman as a victim um even those who many who are that have been victims of\nSexual misconduct or worse don't necessarily consider themselves victims overall and that's being lost in the den here as well I mean if you if you asked\nIf you do one of those are asking everybody who's out there with the masking tape on their mouths and the signs are holding up why are they there what this what is this about\nIt you're going to get answers that I really have nothing to do with his confirmation and really nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh that the Democrats used at Ford because they they breed shirt anonymity they revealed her identity to their world they sat on this for six weeks\nAnd then they set her up with attorneys who never even gay or even the of telling her what her rights were what she could do and they're using Kavanaugh and\nHis shoulders should not be\nShould not be shouldering the entire me to live by the way\nLarge ding ding ding happy anniversary when you were interested in me to move it but you know who started it not Brett Kavanaugh Harvey Weinstein yeah ... years ago today it was Harvey Weinstein\nMajor democratic donor you're not going to find him in a picture of Brett Kavanaugh if you're going to find it in pictures with Hillary Clinton and a lotta a lot of a powerful now powerful female actresses in\nHollywood who look to the other way long after they were just starting out long after they were all very powerful and very wealthy but let's remember how who got this all started let's remember he's facing criminal charges he's facing criminal charges and doesn't learn to women describe and kind of not something thirty six\nNo charges he's facing criminal charges and doesn't mean that aren't women describe and kind of not sending thirty six years ... years ago and still and corroborated\nThis was a a moment yesterday on MSNBC\nA network that I literally don't even watch anymore because it's so pretty it's not even interesting so predictable but this was Mika Brzezinski are reacting to uh your comment that Dr Ford look she was not treated badly she was treated like a fabric egg let's listen to make a\nWhy can't you be the egg Kellyanne the fabric say egg and tell your story because he say women should be heard you talk to both sides in your mouth\nYou say that women should be heard their stories are believable or credible and understanding a compelling well let's hear yours\nThat's very convenient to drop that but I Want to know your story I Want to know what happened you should have justice ... shouldn't hold on I'm not done well I Know you hear about you know K. you can't just throw that out as a political dagger to protect this reprehensible creditor of a president\nYour reaction to that\nWho I have the reaction to that not I think that many people generally has made my point for me that people are judged women are judged by of what their grief or their harm\nOr their recourse or their quote victimhood based on their politics and I think many people are making the point for me\nBut I don't dignify many things out there\nAre because they're they're wholly irrelevant and I will tell you a lot of blowback yesterday a lot of pushback and a lot of low back on and I'll I'll have my say about that at some other time but\nAt the moment I think it's completely irrelevant given how ... how high the stakes are Laura or to get\nKavanaugh confirmed in as an associate justice in United States Supreme Court but it won't be bullied I won't be bullied either and I I won't be bullied um and I I'll have my say I'm not going to say much else right now that that I find it to be\nOn basically are relevant and when I talked about the fabric ... which by the way is trending on social media

some other question and Christian Walker was shouting questions and I said she's been treated like a ... in the process\nSheet you you could do it privately in California it's her attorneys who didn't allow her that courtesy and that decency you can do it I'm not on camera you can do it\nOn and you might tell us and you have to explain you weren't as she said you wonder if they're ... and by the

got yourself to blame 'em ... by my to my mind\nWhat's happened here in Port and only in part was directed personally at Kavanaugh my ... my take on it is that the overarching purpose of this\nIs the into roar um effect that it creates for conservatives and and maybe not just conservatives but anybody who doesn't\nA toe the line of the new empowered progressive Democrats basically they are telling you\nThat if you try to crash your party this is the kind of thing we're going to do to you and I think the only way to combat that is to fight it aggressively and make sure the people who pulled that uh have to be held to account if you if we just getting a crouch\nAnd let them keep doing it to us there won't be any us left because no good people will want to get into politics\nWell and I I really mean that is not just someone from coming from someone who supported the president or in a campaign but coming from a a lawyer and a longtime conservative like myself\nI really believe Trump bought the Republicans how to fight I mean it's not going to simple formulation but\nFor a long time Republicans were just taking it and they were afraid they were all just like they were also like\nIn an elevator on any longer I've never seen Mitch McConnell fight harder than he fought for this nomination yeah well I think\nHe's showing Trump is showing that this is what people have one at all along and look at this sometimes to the president I think goes way overboard and makes me cringe but if I go into my head if I have to pick\nI Want somebody who's going to fight than somebody who's not and if that means is going to be excess from time to time then you know then there's going to be access from time to time\nBut I think he's showing that there's a hunger on our side to not just stand in a defensive crouch and keep taking this stuff with which we've been doing for years\nWell I think it's important that we have McConnell out their Lindsey Graham John Cornyn or even been fast talking about the mob mentality that we can't become a ... a country by mob rule where people are afraid to go to restaurants\nYep [noise] yeah and I and I think Laura that if you don't raise this stuff\nAnd turn it into an issue particularly when we're on the cusp of an election you don't have a compelling way after the election to say that you know this was on the table for people to consider and you have a mandate now to stop it because people voted against it\nSo I think this not only has to be fought but it has to be ... up\nA as an election issue and frankly it helps the Republicans to tear it up because\nI I've seen you say this what are you know on television and heard you on the radio said a million times ordinary people commonsense people do not like the stuff I mean they see these these uh Lenski I direct action tactics\nAnd they say you know there are some parts of this\nAgenda that I may agree with but these tactics are not America and and I don't think that's the America anybody wants who sensible\nNow and again people like Feinstein who was he's a liberal but she was fairly well respected until I think the last you know a\nCouple of years where she's been especially the last year where she's really been pushed left I mean she because of course their primary challenge and the and the\nCalifornia has become more and more or less to gone more or less and less left the country almost\nAnd yeah well now ... now a new person ... you probably know this better than I Do but didn't California instituted some system hold on\nWe just have breaking news Lisa Murkowski is voting no on the Kavanaugh cloture vote so that means you know for the confirmation so that's one person or the Republicans have already lost a and Collins could be a yes but Murkowski is a no\nI'm flake is a yes on the cloture vote\nA so that's a\nI don't know anything you want to say about that Andy before we\nGo forward yeah and as you I think pointed out the cloture vote just means we're going forward I'm ... and this is not over until it's over I mean I Know people\nThought that finally we had this buttoned up yesterday or this and there's been so many twists and turns to this and the other side is so rabbit about it this is not over until it's over\nAmy Coney Barrett Raymond a royal has said you better get the private jet and childcare ready for her [laughter]\nFrame and keep saying that Andy that's on line and they just I Hope I Hope you mean there are some childcare and that one way of light out of Indiana are you going to need it\nYeah yeah Notre Dame the need to double time childcare right she's like she said but my mom had six she's got even more than that I think\nI've got seven you know a ... amazing by the way but you know then ... will be back in back right\nNow the I'm going to ask an unpleasant question what is this nomination goes down this weekend what would you advise the White House what should be the next step here a blitzkrieg very quick nomination if someone else or should they or someone suggested doubled down on cabinet and ride it all the way to the midterms\nAre right I I I Would have to ask\nA sorry to interrupt again I'm Sorry anti hold that thought Joe Manchin just voted yes for cloture then I think Joe Manchin the easiest Santa Cruz overland the boats yes go ahead sorry go ahead any\nYou know I I Would just have to ask the smart\nPeople is there someone that we can get done before the midterms and if there's not been I think you have to double down on Kavanaugh on say you know if if you vote Republican and we get we get a a a majority in the Senate\nOr then we're going to nominate cat the cat and all over again you know turn it into an election issue but I don't know the politics of it well enough\nTo let ... given you the big thumbs up when you said that the that you're thinking you\nKnow the anti ... is a legal yeah that you know he's a legal eagle he's always law you know constitutional law\nBut you you know you can be a political a political consultant if you want and actually be a good one handy because that's exactly it just like what they should have done with Obamacare Mitt Romney remember when he announced the Obamacare is a law passed\nIn twenty well Romney kind of just dropped it after he did his soapbox a thing on the at the hardware store like one of his eye sockets they just drive of should take it out all across the country and said it's going to destroy your health care and that would have been a great issue remedy and do it but this is a this is a great issue for the Republican\nYeah well I'm going to go from the who the Clint Eastwood and say a man's got to know is limitations um [laughter] I don't know that I'm the political guy or you're\nAll right so a mansion as he asked for cloture ending debate or so it was like Murkowski isn't no it was just I don't know about mccaskey\nMurkowski isn't no it was just I don't know about ...\nThis is why the whole family dynasty of senators has got the ... the idea that just because your father or your husband or your brother was a ... that suddenly you're you should be in the Senate I never like this whole dynastic approach to\nIt you know to the Senate and the house of representatives I I remember her father I mean and then she when she becomes a big liberal so I don't get that at all I never I never understood that but you know patently the indigenous people\nIn Alaska are therefore Murkowski because she does throws a lot of money they're way so they're they're all there for this\nOr any McCarthy thank you

here for judge Kavanaugh I think what you said about people finally just getting sick to death we see a lot of people saying we were going to a vote Democrat but we're changing our vote we can't believe these tactics\nI think that um the uh the additive thing innocent before proven\nUm that you have to prove you're innocent says what has sparked people to be just outraged in America we believe in the bill of rights and the constitution\nAnd that means that you are innocent until proven guilty and not the opposite way and that's what's really sparked people to be angry and feeling as though this man is an utterly destroyed without any proof and its change their mind\nYou know you you see a lot of that and and I think um the ... again I think the American people at their core our fear beyond ideology beyond anything they're fair minded people and had these allegations handout\nHad a witness or corroborating evidence been produced they might have taken a very different view of this but the unrelenting salt on this guy in the face of no evidence at all I think that his outrage and let me tell you learned this the other day and we are in complete agreement I think\nWe may not

know that the truth matters and an Indiana votes have consequences\nYou know we have a very tight Senate race here as well\nAnd when people choose to actually say they're going to vote for somebody because they are qualified are not qualified and then every five minutes the parameters change as to what we're utilizing to determine our vote people remember that\nNow and one of the the biggest things in Indiana that we're saying is mothers are concerned about their children that are going to be the next generation leaders ever being willing to run for anything I've talked to so many millennials boys and girls are young men and young women\nThat are saying I never want to put my family or myself in that position you know how in the world is judge Kavanaugh holding up underneath all of this especially for his own family so it's really it's a fascinating to me that these women are making it about\nRace when everybody involved in this particular incident as white\nEducated and and upper income so it's a doesn't make much sense to me that that's\nIt's become about color it's become about um women it really is as much about a judge Kavanaugh having the right to um have his innocence presumed to be full and be proven guilty so that's\nLike that's where a lot of Indiana I think that's where a lot of voters and Americans come down there they they feel ... that they didn't have a real strong feeling about Brecht coming on the same way the president said a ... up until we can go I didn't know who he was\nBut watching this play out watching that dramatic testimony seeing the accusations and the lack of evidence I think they come down to what you just mentioned\nIt seems a presumption of guilt and something else politics\nPolitics is overwhelming all of this this is ideological blood sport and a man's reputation whose family be damned we're going to take this nomination don't becomes the marching orders no matter what adult calls\nAnd I think the American people now are about to have a referendum on that idea that you can take down a political opponent at any cost with no evidence and shame destroyed his reputation for all the time\nIn public and even force of a of a woman who's going through some sort of distress into the open to be used as your political weapon that I think you use\nThe Americans look at that and go man this concerns me ginger I Want to ask you um you you have a a big governor's race a hotly contested one in Georgia between sushi Abramson and Brian Kemp he's up the Republican Brian Kemp like two points\nDo you believe female conservatives are going to rally there in that governors\nYes I did and I think that having a hearing is going to really play into that because it's making women\nAre really upset that people are playing that the women against man card and I'm Stacey Abrams is a woman\nBut Brian count is as a conservative man who stands for our conservative principles personal responsibility limited government and lower taxes all the things that we are that's our party is all about so I really do think and I have seen just in the last week or so across this date\nPeople are more motivated than ever now to get out get out and vote and not only that but volunteer that I was at the camp campaign the other day people were coming in to get yard signs and the topic of the conversation was exactly what we're talking about the Kavanaugh hearings and how\nWe see this politics being played out and they'll they they are really playing dirty the leftist play and dirty and ... people don't want to see this they really are discouraged\nYeah no I I you know as I look out and watches it it does have all the markings of the last presidential election where we saw a lot of drama for the cameras celebrities coming out now we've had walkouts in protests and signs in confrontations with senators and these dramatic moments\nAt the same time in coffee shops in factories yeah in the school on to pick up the kids if you listen closely you're hearing something very different this same dynamic I think is what propelled Trump into office and it was that kind of well he called the silent majority\nI'm my sense is working Americans\nAnd Americans would not by nature political activists they don't get out in March the working there working they privately held their views about politics that they've spread over the dinner table or to their families ... occasionally to their friends but it's not something you go to war over\nAnd ... today in Washington I have to tell you\nI've seen friendship shattered people simply do don't talk to each other\nAnd it's all about politics it's because they they disagree politically and it's become an ugly violent thing where once it was dialogue to try to convince the other person to your point of view today it's slash smashing destroy\nAnd I don't think Americans particularly women really want that now their core group I think who do and we've seen them in the streets but moms wives working\nWomen I I I don't think it's where they live I'm going to give a quick round Robin we're going to go through every body again a starting with military Potter of from the Virginia Republican Party in West Virginia are your thoughts on where we might be headed here in these midterms\n[noise] I think that are due to the situation with this nomination of a a very very qualified a judge the Supreme Court I think that the Republicans are in our job to get out and vote\nA for Republicans conservative Republicans that will support President Trump's agenda and I think the Democrats were also get out and vote the right way to for people because West Virginia's counties there's fifty five of them\nAnd all fifty five went for Trump in the election\nSo that meant and twenty six states that means that we'd had Democrat votes as well and I believe that the Democrats also are a work or to get out and vote for Republicans this time\nSo I think that that everything's looking good and we love our country and we want to protect our country so and I'm going to spend every last minute I can uh football last breath\nTrying to stand up for what's right for our country\nOkay well I don't want you to do that for a military we now we need you in December so hang it may be my last breath I'm so busy [laughter] oh well you keep going great to talk to you ginger Howard last where do you um you're you're the you're in Georgia in the Republican Party in Georgia\nOr given this enthusiasm we're seeing given the cabin all fight in the in the way it's being processed by voters what impact will end up in the midterms\nI ... I think it is energizing new voters more and I also think that people that were kind of neutral and on the fence that were energized about midterms because a lot of times people don't get excited about the terms I think we're going to see it where you've heard a lot about the blue wave I Believe the red way is going to come and people are\nSick and tired of being bullied around and they're going to stand up for their freedom so we love our country we care about our country and those people are going to come out of the woodwork and I think it's going to be a ... it's not just going to be a way it's going to be a ... and people are going to eight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Show Low", "day": "05"}
