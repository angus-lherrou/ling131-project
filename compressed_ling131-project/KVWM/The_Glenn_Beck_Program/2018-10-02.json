on to other places so the people who say we shouldn't have have um we shouldn't have renegotiated this thing or just that you know engaging in self deception and I might I might know that both the secretary Clinton and President Obama both when they ran for president\nPromised that he would renegotiate it they just didn't do it in the final analysis but they both acknowledged that it needed to be re done so what the president did which I think was terrific is we have we have by far the biggest trade bloc in in history at one point two trillion dollars and we've now rewritten the rules in ways that are\nThat are better quite frankly for all three countries particularly better for America that's who that's who pays my bills and do I care about and better in a whole variety of ways\nIt's the the auto rules of origin are extremely important in terms of making sure that manufacturing moved back to American stays in America\nThe there is a a sunset provision that there's going to make

limitations on how state owned enterprises\nWhich is you think China Ken subsidize so there's there's a whole variety of things in various pockets extremely important agreement\nBetter than than anything in the states has ever negotiated before it's going to make a real difference for working men and women in this country now some businesses and some Wall Street guys left to figure out another way to make a fortune\nBut in terms of working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's going to make a big difference and it's going to be this is the that the President Trump trade a prototype and we're going to use it going forward with countries around the world so it's really really an important day\nWe're talking about Lighthizer us trade rap or one of the chiefs of course negotiators in getting us to this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement I bought one of the things that were wondering how this works any still Republican majority Congress\nCould this mean what's the mechanism for this passing where there's there are some Republicans supporting it some probably won't but more Democrats would support this than Republicans correct\nWell I Would not say that I think you're going to find a Republicans and Democrats both supported uh hopefully strongly there there are a few Republicans who will probably oppose it because they don't like the fact that we're going to bring manufacturing back and they think that that ah\nOutsourcing is not a problem there are some Democrats a little ... in part because it's just something that the president wants and they're against that or they think it doesn't go far enough [noise]\nBut but I think ah the vast majority of fair minded members in both parties\nWill support this now one of the criticisms you have which is sort of an odd one in the wall Street Journal is they have this view that well we never should've talked to labor unions and Democrats when we put it together and then they draw the conclusion that for that it's worse for us\nWell if the Democrats should uh take over and of course the exact opposite is true we we we designed this to be bipartisan for working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's not something I I Believe it's going to end up being\nPurely partisan and if it is a kind of thing that can only be pass with Republican votes if that's what we had to go she added that I Would agree with the with the people who say it would have trouble passing but that's not how it was designed and it's not what we did\nThis is what I'm John Harwood um CNBC said specifically regarding autos listen\nThere are some elements of manage trained in it that are less free that is to say the provisions for the auto industry if those provisions work\nIt means our cars will get more expensive for us consumers but there's also a chance that they are complicated enough that they will be worth it for automakers to comply which means that the president's\nStatement about a new dawn for the auto industry that is almost certainly not correct your goal I guess my I\nMean if I had to make one word it would be nonsense [noise] uh you wonder about people who make statements like that there there are so palpable crazy and you wonder what else there thing that is also crazy so just to give you an idea all\nThe ... the major auto companies General Motors Ford SCA was used to be Chrysler Honda and Toyota have all said this is fine they can work with this they've all said it's going to move more jobs back to America but that's not a bad thing\nYeah that's a good thing they've all says workable they've all endorsed it so that the kind of people who don't know very much about what's going on and make those kind of wild statements I Would just take them to sit down and losing their belt and they're tired and breathe ten times and then just read something about it\nAnd they'll realize how they don't know what they're talking about this was going to be\nReally very very important for um for American manufacturing it's going to bring a lot of jobs back\nWe at the end by the way it's not bad for for Mexico or for Canada either it'll it'll help them to the biggest single thing we do let me just give you an idea what the biggest thing we do or what the two biggest things we do one is we increase the content\nOf cars that are sold in America and Mexico and Canada but sold in America [noise]\nThe the the content that is made in this region is increasing right now we say it's sixty two percent and it's really more like about fifty because of loopholes and all this special interest stuff we're going to raise it up to Seventy five percent\nHow was that a bad thing under under the ... the person who's going to lose out on this is China in places like that under the TPP that these people all endorsed half the car can be made in China and sold in America duty free it's completely lunacy\nThe people don't live with a talking about the other thing is we're requiring that a certain percent of the car [noise]\nBe made in a high wage area that is to say in America now it could be Canada also but in America for the most part that's not a bad thing at all why shouldn't we say if we're going to give you the best\nArt that's not a bad thing at all why shouldn't we say if we're going to give you the benefit of selling cars indoor market with no duties better than we treat anyone else in the world why shouldn't we say that a certain amount of those cars should be made in America by\nAmerican labor I think what President Trump promised on his on the campaign trail he promised he delivered\nBob Lighthizer us TR uh what's next I mean are you guys going to get a deal done with Europe some of the European countries ... deals with Switzerland or some of these other smaller countries I Know they've Swiss are anxious to do a deal with the guys I Know that first hand\nYeah now we have a variety of things that we're we're talking to the Japanese were talking to the Europeans [noise]\nWe have a lot of things that we're doing a small deals dot com singles and double that people don't even know about we're talking I won't go through but there's a bunch of other countries do and then of course the big the big elephant in the room is China and one of the funny things I'll tell you there's one last time on the\nWall Street journal editorial because you brought it up they kind of show a graph of the American S. and P.\nAnd then they mark certain things to sort of say oh look at this was bad for the U.S in the what they don't mark\nIs when when the president announced his his thrill one which was like in March since then the market's gone straight up when the president put on tariffs on China intellectual property and into it for intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer the market's gone straight up from them I was kind of laughing this is like\nOne of one of these things what you've got you've got ten data points less drop out the fire to prove the opposite that the other ones that you should look at it I I ask any of your your list or to look at the thing if they happen to have the hopefully\nI'm looking I'm actually looking at it now yeah gender back in March eighth but July and August when he's yeah\nYeah I just look at the ports put up the bottom just show where the where the that the China actions are the markets like straight up from their right I mean this whole area is right as well\nI'm Glad today that I I Know without prompting what the thrill one means like how many how many people know that other than you ... when I shouldn't careful\nI I should be careful I I used we used yet we all sort of jargon and the shore dance and whatnot but I mean\nWe have a statute that allows

period sheltered change the timeframe from being in the mid eighties or early eighties she kept switching back and forth with it happened in college or is it happened in high school\nYou know really flush out exactly what her story is she right on the stand a lawyer would grill her about that they would grow or about the details of hurt continent but somehow we have to hold her with kids love\nRight then again feminists are supposed to be about equal treatment I thought that women are strong enough to stand on their own they're not a bunch of damsel in distress and yet ah you're exactly right on the ... last night um the entire angle the opening monologue was devoted to\nThe a credibility gap ah for moves forward a in relation to this entire matter and extensively relying on\nAnd on an unbiased prosecutor who was a sex crime prosecutor who not political figure who said look changing narratives changing story of a memory of even recent events she seems to change or is unclear\nA not a case that would be brought even under a preponderance of evidence standard not a I'm not a beyond a reasonable doubt but a preponderance standard\nSo no probable cause even to undertake an investigation given the lack of cooperating information but in a in a culture where your right DC we're feeling Trump's facts\nThen you know it's always going to be how you how she makes you feel in her testimony\nWell that's exactly right it's about how she made people feel because I didn't even find her feelings credible to be honest I'm and she didn't\nShe didn't vote like someone who was just now bringing charges about this horrible thing that's so Trump traumatized her for four years to thirty six years in fact in her college years and her marriage and everything else and re decorating and you know we had\nHe had no emotion that corresponded with what she was saying her PDF the trauma and horrors of it all was there would've been more anger\nThere were more fear and passion and more directed a she was attached to her anytime she ever talked about the assault\nShe was very detached and her description of it and and I don't mean innocent people can associate dissociate when they're raped and stuff that she wasn't right and this is thirty six years later and she said she has pie TST which means that you're heightened in your awareness of what happened and so she just did not she was not ... to me and feelings or fat or but\nAt the end of the day we need to look at the facts\nAnd the fact that measure up she lives in the ... and in high school that was very party environment that carried over to a degree in college you think she got off campus after that and and things calm down\nBut you know again not to blame the victim but we need to look at the entire circumstance of her life and his life if we're going to bring this kind of thing up at the last minute Laura last we had to bring up with a context to this right before Supreme Court nomination that would be\nChanging abortion possibly\nThere's a reason for this you know we've got a really really need to protect our country and protect presumption of innocence and this isn't just about Ford or or ...\nIt's about our uh liberty principles and about our democracy about our society and and what are we going to hold his values going forward but at the principle that we're going to hold to to keep us all secure and free and personally responsible\nRight we're basically now a incentivizing unsubstantiated claims and incentivizing this type of intimidating menacing behavior\nOf you know attacking people in public restaurants or elevators or\nYou know these the people who are always worried about safe spaces DC and triggers and all are the ones who are are the first to get in your face first ones\nBecause they are driven by\nThey've banned in fact\nThey've abandoned objectivity so they can't have a discussion on this level\nSo all they have their subject is kneeling and power and if you're not going to come to reason together if you have no basis of the ... objective truth in order to have dialogue than the most powerful the biggest bully in the room that's going to win and that's what we have going on some of them this movement is a bunch of bully\nThey're bullying everyone in order to advance their power and it and part of that to advance there's always the struggle between men and women that there's always the threat and if you're always the victim then you always have power over those who are\nTrying to abuse you and you know so this is what's been going on in our culture it's been going on in different kinds of fears now what's going on in the tight relationship scare of men and women and its ripping our country apart\nAnd you know if we if this means that we have to let the races go free because we can't prove it it's better to stay presumption of innocence to save the innocent than it is to round up all the guilty\nOh I'm actually the fact that just real life that's that's what it's about being a grownup world\nYeah well I think again we see that these activists Soros folks who are costing flake who lived up to his last name I mean the the their perpetual\nAdolescence look at me look at me look at me watch me watch me you must listen to me don't you dare look away from it that's a good kid just like an eighth grader this is not a serious adult with a serious way of\nUh of discussing issues they they mean to terrorize people you say bully I say terrorist is a type of political and emotional extortion they're playing this game and it it has to be exposed and resist it at all costs and and they have to feel\nThey have to feel the heat right back on them as as a journalist and I say this in a in a in a way meaning look journalists don't like to be demonized as fake news and so forth but imagine of journalists were finding themselves surrounded in an elevator\nWhere where citizens are one inch from their face screaming at them and it I think that'd be the first ones to say wait a second you're intimidating the press but what about intimidating a a a a citizen in a in a in a restaurant or at a gas station is as Maxine Waters urge people to go after them and it does that count at all not only not only\nKnow and and but we like you said we need to fight back we we just can't sit back and take it in which we've done for years and look where we are a\nAnd that is one of my reasons for challenging a Christine Ford about you know her own behaviors I'm not I'm not accusing for anything I don't know what she did detailed day to day when she was in high school or college but I Know the environment she was then and it again if we're going to persecute\nSchool or college but I Know the environment she was then and again if we're going to prosecute him or questioned him prosecuting and then we need to ask her the same kind of question and you know you can't answer if you can't show what kind of character you are\nUm you know when you're bringing these accusations up in the political sphere then why should we ... we are not obligated to believe you just because you make allegations we're not obligated to our team just because you're allowed in bowling yelling at us and and the restaurant\nYeah we're we're not you know we're not going to have to take it from you know\nWe have a right to speak as well and I think more people need to speak out I think that's what the Trump election was all about that you\nI think uh it's about people having just about enough of a bad policies bad economic policies that foreign policy and twisted a political correctness and identity politics I think he called BS and all of it\nAnd he said look I'm Out of it and I've done all this thing but I just it's just ridiculous and I what before we let you go real quick do you do you think that this could actually boomerang against the Democrats in the midterms\nOh absolutely and I hope so and we need to get the word out the Democrats are very good about organizing on the ground base and then turned and we need to know that we can't sit back because the economy's going really well and the fat and happy need to be activated and we see what's going on in this kangaroo hearing\nAbout what the right of the left is when you take it seriously and we take their how their infants and making sense at all and cooking for the perfect example of how baby as she was that's what they're reducing women to be", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Show Low", "day": "02"}
