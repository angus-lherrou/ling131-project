had a big\nDebate the other night uh are only statewide televised debate and my opponent I chose not to show up the only Democrat who didn't show up for the debate\nWell how\nHow would that be even possible I mean\nThe Democrats have made some fairly significant\nHeadway in in\nA both the Senate seat since Norm Coleman and a sense a you know we've lost the governorship pull energy and then he tried to run again\nAnd he he got a defeated obviously I'm In his bid for the Senate ah but\nWhere where are we now and trying to and trying to rebuild the Republican Party in that state Minnesota economy has been doing so well and the Trump era of just two years we've seen a massive uh uptick in the states productivity this is all positive why would people want to vote against that now\n[noise] really don't out we have a or Minnesota is turning Red Cross the whole state people are feeling it they're happy with the way the economy is going and I think Tina Smith didn't show up to the debate the other night because she didn't have any answers to this and where she stands on the issue she's so far\nLeft and so extreme and and part of the resistance and obstructing everything good that is happening on the ground a and then she's also a for\nOpen borders and she wants to Minnesota to be a sanctuary state and she is directly tied to Keith Ellison still continuing to campaign with him\nYet uh being as hypocritical as as they are she's again you know wanting to impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh adjusted cabin on call for another investigation so\nMinnesotans are are some of the most well educated people when they go to the polls we don't have to register Democrat or Republican were free to move without the cabin when we go vote and they do their research and and uh we have some of the ... we have the highest turn out\nIn the country when it comes to voting and so we go educated so it was really disappointing that Tina Smith didn't want to debate may or at least tell the people of Minnesota where she stands on thing because she knows that's not what's resonating on the ground well\nA Speaker Ryan Paul Ryan was in Minnesota uh yesterday and warned or the day before yesterday was warning of a\nGreen wave of democratic fundraising and a visit to drum up support for uh some of the house candidates are Paulson and Jason Lewis and there are there are two of the more

flipped our state house in two thousand and fourteen to Republican our state Senate in two thousand and sixteen oh we've got up on the iron range which had voted Democrat for\nMore than sixty years is now going to flip the Republican we've got a great candidate up there and he's plus Fifteen or all of the rural areas are farmers are\nReally on board with what the president is doing finally somebody is fighting\nFor our farmers and putting their issues at the forefront of campaign so\nIt's all it's all the the uh of fake media and their rhetoric and talking about the blue wave and it's I'm not feeling it anyway and that's just me not just me as a candidate I really am not when I'm traveling throughout the state there's a lot of energy behind the president and and even when he came for the two rallies he's already done to rally\nThis cycle here in Minnesota there is a lot of excitement for my campaign and for the the rest of the candidates throughout the state\nOur current housley it is a fantastic to have you on a ... everybody needs to get out there and vote because the woman who was appointed Tina Smith a is even worse than Al Franken if you can\nBelieve that and she you know she uh obviously you know thinks that she'll be able to just snuck or the\nMinnesotan voters for more liberal policies in open borders forget it ... the last thing the Minnesotans need our politicians in the state\nOr in a a senators representing the state who believe that they need more regulations on the small business owners and more problems for the medical device manufacturers who have done such a great job\nTo ... to reinvigorate the Minnesota economy after the uh the great recession so care current housley has got to win the seat that would be phenomenal news\nAs we march or even after this

I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIf you're inducted and you need help cold trinity a one eight hundred seven mine for over four three something when\nI first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I looked at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical debt that was in my life would go way\nUnity will consolidate your account to do one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interests and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nWhat I Would tell other people please pick up the phone and call trinity just let them put together a program and see how affordable and easy it is to pay off your debt\nI'm doing great thanks for having me back on\nA John tell us a first of all I Want your reaction to this a series of comments about President Trump that when he says he's a nationalist that means essentially he's a white nationalist John your comments\nOr I I think that books get so wrapped around the axle around the around identity politics and it's exactly what's driving is a part of the nation we're all Americans and\nKnow the politics and it's exactly what's driving as a part of the nation we're all Americans and one of the great artists that I've ever had my entire life is leading Americans at the battle in Iraq and bringing them all back home you know one of the things that you look at when you look at things like the Olympics are the only things that are that look the same on us\nOur our uniforms are we are together all American and I don't have a a black message or white Mr said last night but a red white and blue message and I I feel like you have\nA the the progressive marks is on the left who don't have a message\nAnd they don't have an identity so we need to use identity politics in order to keep themselves in power I reject that fundamentally on either side far left are far right and I truly believe that by serving all Americans as as equals moving all up together is exactly the type of leadership we need Washington\nWell again the lurch to claim racism\nOr at every turn and claim is either a combination of ... being a wild or racist or Trump being Hitler which is\nWhich is now it's so disgusting on so many levels and insulting to Holocaust survivors and you know all people everywhere are but to me that's a sign of Democrat desperation John they have they have no real solutions Debbie Stabenow your opponent\nIn this Michigan Senate race clearly has no idea she has no solutions for America it's all about insults personal insult a and attacking the motivations of those with home mom you know she disagrees\nAnd this this is a basic this is absolutely base you know we we learned the amount of the state of English class we'd be logical fallacies ad hominem attacks\nOn what you don't have any facts to back up your argument you go to direct directly attacking the individual you go to directly setting up these fallacies because you don't have yourself anything to stand on\nDebbie Stabenow a for her part has been a career politician for forty three years of collecting four million dollars and the tax payers only gotten the five who her co sponsored bills into law in the past Eighteen years and ... buildings she likes to bipartisanship is a buzzword when she's anything but\nShe's a solid a as a New York senator\nLoaded with Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton Ninety five and nine to ... some of the time respectively and the promises he she's made around ... around lowering pharmaceutical drug costs around and taking care of education in a round of funding emergency\nAh funding for our troops who are deployed\nAnd in our veterans who were coming back home she's broken promises to what I said are all the time and I would I tell people in the state of Michigan to ask is why should we believe this time senator staff and now she will say anything to get reelected\nThey engage in this politics to drive us apart and what I'm trying to do is bring us together because we're all Americans and we need to rise up together to make sure that we in all this ridiculous rhetoric\nI Love this uh I'd love to have used to having a now claiming she's against sanctuary cities where was she when the Democrats had uh two years of\nOf majority rule in Obama's first two years in office I mean I don't\nRemember Debbie Stabenow standing up for the American worker back then I remember standing up for a better trade policies against a China or Mexico and I I don't recall any of that but now because she wants or forty four year year career and politics to continue suddenly she's Donald Trump on immigration I don't think so\nShe she is a selective uh in her position she has a higher survival like you and she does whatever her polling and Chuck Schumer will tell her I'm centers to have it on and you can\nSee our debate a on John James for Senate dot com and Barlow around 'em but senators now will do is ever convenient\nUm she voted against case law she supports sanctuary cities and uh she will not do anything to secure our border she's been in a position to get comprehensive immigration reform done over her entire period over the past two decades or in in Washington and has failed to lead\nAnd so I Would say this is not that we need to get done right now are we need to end illegal immigration\nAnd ah the only way to do that is to get someone who's going to be more than just talk about it but somebody who's going to work with anyone and everyone to get this thing done because this is a matter of uh of economic and national security and it cannot be kicked down the road and one thing I Will guarantee if Debbie Stabenow gets re elected\nNational security will be jeopardized in our ability to grow our economy will also be jeopardized\nHey John what is the reaction\nAmong African Americans in your state uh Europe proud combat veteran are you a West Point graduate\nAre you um you're a Republican which is is you know is is not something that a lot of people in Michigan you know are are used to because the Democrats still have a\nYou know they'll have a monopoly on the black vote but are you finding you're getting more\nBlack support in your state is or or does the Republican label's still scare people off\nWell I'll tell you what if people get to know me for me is people begin to disassociate a me from the are by my name or the color of my skin or they begin to realize that hey guys um this this guy made\n'em want a Republican primary in a in the state and uh I'm going to be the only African American at the top of the ballad of and and people are starting to realize that everything that I'm saying I'll rings true\nAnd you take a look at ... now has failed to do with with uh with what concerns African Americans and uh and Michigan is regardless of race around the state uh they're taking a look at this keeping an open mind and beginning to come over\nUh I I Believe that the only ones who are not are ones who are who can't see past a of a a blind hatred or blind allegiance but those who I'm Talking talking to who are keeping an open mind and I recognize the I'm the best leader\nUm Fort Michigan into the future I bring balance an actual experience on both from a combat environment understanding veterans' issues and national security and from a business environment understanding how to create jobs and how to protect the American dream for future generations to include our children Detroit is the most segregated city\nYou know now it seems like a hundred and it's it's not that I Love those rights but historically one of the most beautiful places incredible architecture incredible history of music and arts and architecture tucked in in this amazing decades of Democrat rule\nHave destroyed so many great American cities like Baltimore and in St Louis and and now are of course Detroit making something of a comeback but\nOut so much more needs to be done John James best of luck to you and your race against Debbie Stabenow in Michigan uh everybody get out there and support a John he's just a fantastic a young man and a ... he has the right idea to the state\nAnd he ... he doesn't want to be considered a African American Republican candidate he wants to be considered the right candidate for the right time for the state of Michigan\nA and John we wish you all the best and thank you for your service to this country uh we honor and we support you were going to take a break a five five forty Laura we're going to close out with another update yet another\nPipe bomb has
