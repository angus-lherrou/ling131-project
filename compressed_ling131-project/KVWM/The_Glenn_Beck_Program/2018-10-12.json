they have have I Would just sit and make me feel that the guy that he can get to see my dad all the time like a guy\nIt would have thought it was something about when I put\nFeel like Superman who made a Superman that was the favorite superhero and you made a Superman tape for me\nSo Donald Trump or as someone who\nDefied the odds to win the presidency that is what Kanye West is\nIs referencing there I Believe like anything's possible in America\nThey all said you couldn't do it they all said you your campaign would flame out they said you would get trounced by Jeb Bush they said that\nUh the Hillary was then going to destroy you and it was going to be a member of the other productions that Trump would lose in a massive landslide you remember that I Do we played 'em every night and every day\nWell all of that was false and Trump became president and Kanye West I think as a man who you know he didn't have a lot of male role models Donald Trump has been a friend for a long time it doesn't mean Donald Trump gets everything right personally we know he hasn't none of us do\nBut I think that there was something profound and what he said there the ... the Hillary campaign slogan was I'm with her and\nFor African American men they love their moms of course a lot of these women are heroic are trying to raise kids on their own it's not easy\nAnd but they he's saying and it's it's probably in today's day and age not politically correct but he doesn't care to I I wanted a male role model to follow in a ... someone who\nIs going to bring male energy to the office of the presidency Hillary slogan didn't speak to him it's just his personal opinion I mean you can disagree with it you can say it's well it's kind of off\nOff base Hillary was just really smart and she would have been a bit better president how we obviously no that's not true but ... do you notice that Don Lemon et cetera did not actually speak about any of the substance that comedy I brought up let's keep listening to Kanye West's let's listen to\nThe needs of lot of other need someone to help him and the guy them and then he's a hug more than anything calling you back away from the cameras\nDo get some help and then come back and make your case nobody if you want to be conservative if you want to support Donald Trump that is your business but as you're doing it have some sense with it make sense educate yourself oh wait a second so\nJay Z and Beyonce who were at the president's side and on speed dial I think they joke they're big policy experts and George Clooney because he testified before Congress he's the be all and end all and human rights and in Africa I mean I guess I woke up okay\nHe knows more than all the diplomats and all the people voted their lives for this well I mean you could raise a question about that right but no one ever did they never raised the question about any of these folks and how about Miley Cyrus running from dorm room to dorm room\nKaty Perry running around college campuses ... trying to explain domestic policy to\nStudents okay these people wouldn't know a domestic policy if it bit him in the back side will take a break John Cornyn coming up your calls eight five five forty Laura we'll get to all your calls Kanye West helps Trump and the Republicans\nFlip the script this is a unconventional move and we'll see if it pays off it certainly is interesting don't go us\nYou're listening to morning for your health the radio was actually on a mountaintop giant nine Seventy eighty WM show also a DJ I Hope\n\nThis is Michael ... and here with Mike stole from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down the cost of\nMany Medicare plans are decreasing this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate\nHelp markets offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plan plans I can eliminate you're out of pocket costs plans with zero dollar premiums and even plans that pay you back\nWhat is that people need to keep in mind with so many new options it can be confusing you can get objective help to find a planet may cost less and cover more with lower co pays more choices like dental vision and prescription drug coverage\nAnd the freedom to see the doctors and you don't miss out on savings you deserve our health markets Medicare assistance is free\nYou know at some point it it gets to the level of incitement we're not talking about free speech we're talking about inciting people to violence like Eric Holder did which is a dangerous and I don't think ah I don't think we ought to reward that at all\nNow and it seems to me that the more successful Senator Cornyn this administration is the more Congress you nights with the president on issues such as this statement actually and United\nIt's almost like it's driving the last ... into a an uncontrolled frenzy ... and they can't stand it the better Americans doing they are there more and more angry\nWell as you know or the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court and they can't stay on the idea that a President Trump is now pointed to outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as our confirming a number a larger number probably the largest at this point the president's see I'm\nA court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is the driving them I think too uh too that there's a unattractive uh to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThere was an interview with a colleague Ted Cruz's challenge or the other day Beto O'Rourke about on the confirmation of Kevin I'm going to play it and get your reaction let's listen\nLet me get you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh would you voted\nTo confirm him I Would not have we the Supreme Court justice who believes in voting rights\nA justice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and have access to the health care that ensures that she can he fails more an inch in every single one of those tests so the next justice to be nominated can only be confirmed if she were importantly she can make those qualifications\nYour reaction to that\nWell they do ah I Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guy but clearly he's not running for the United States Senate from Texas\nI'm he's out of step with the with Texas values and and this and ... every other important area my only suspicion laws he's running for the Democratic nomination for president twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats and the hard left\nUh who are who are ah we're seeing a or create these the sort of a mob rule\nAnd then it or what is your best take right now on the Republicans in the midterms me you heard ... are very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how does things really look we'll start with the crews see\nWell I think Ted's and that's in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this was all about turnout we know the left as angry the people that are still angry that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd mid term elections we usually see a down there in a turnout but uh I think the Kavanaugh hearings have energized our our base and um we've seen people like governor ... and in Tennessee said well he would have voted for\nA cabinet all but I'm the truth is if you elect a Democrat this mid term then we're going to jeopardize our ability to conform more federal judges and a Chuck turn the send it over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't think ah ah the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not speaking at this back on the ... issue for a moment I devoted a lot of time on\nMy show senator to uh discussing what next when the president if the president gets another Supreme Court pick\nThe incentive to me seems to be still\nThere for that type of circus we saw for Kavanaugh\nIn namely there's no there's no repercussions for leaving a FBI report or or a or a letter or anything confidential that's not supposed to be public there are no repercussions so given the fact that there were no repercussions silly now there hasn't been yet\nDo you think it's appropriate for the president or would you recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this information about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press [noise]\nSo I have a pretty good suspicion about how it leaked out to the press has you know after Senator Feinstein sat on the SAT on the letter\nAnd then leaked that set it to the FBI after the initial um the initial hearing than it was returned by the FBI to the judiciary committee's background investigation file where it was available to every senator on the Judiciary Committee\nSo much suspicion is that uh one of the one of the Democratic senators or their staff are the ones ultimately responsible for leaking\nThe letter or um ... cats are a doctor Ford's warrior although she certainly did this or Dr Ford interests very well in the way she handled all of this but yeah we're gonna we're going to get to the bottom of this or are they ...\nThey'll probably be an ethics committee investigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this because this is simply unacceptable and thank goodness we didn't reward this with a\nA success and killing the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nYeah I I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important for the country going forward\nThat names when we need to know names we need to know who did this and we need to know the extent of the a collaboration\nWith outside groups many of them funded by the political ... of the Republicans and how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails and their text messages I I just think you know getting involved the ethics an ethics investigation is fine\nBut there is nothing like an FBI investigation of really trace what happened who did it\nAnd someone is lying someone dying here\nWell I guess what we need to do is identify the what are the jurisdiction the federal district whether a federal crime was committed here\nAnd a five the what the jurisdiction of federal district whether a federal crime was committed here a ... I hadn't really thought that much about it but perhaps there isn't that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been a federal crime committed I wholeheartedly support that investigation by the FBI\nOr Senator John Cornyn uh here in the lower end up show senator or for the next to you know three and a half weeks or this is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I\nHave the sense that the Republican Party is more unified than it's been I don't know since when I mean it just it seems like all hands on deck\nPeople are working together they're not back biting each other as much and Jeff Flake is is not a fan of the president's he wants a primary challenge but Marco Rubio said\nThe president will win reelection Nikki Haley thinks she's going to campaign for the president twenty twenty or what is your sense of the Republican unity right now\nMore and more optimistic that I've been in a long time or I'm In the record of accomplishment with the Republican majorities in the house the Senate is pretty darn impressive I Know the mainstream media doesn't cover a lot of the success that we've had here but\nReally just focus on the judiciary and the fact that uh the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become the crucible and which I think a\n... that it has United all all Republicans and people all across the political spectrum from the center right uh to the right\nAnd so I'm I'm very optimistic but we just have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who didn't support either Gorsuch or on Capitol or some of the other Democrats on the\nBallot Catskill McCaskill exactly in Missouri I'm did not support President Trump's nominees and that I think is going to be the issue that's going to pick up seats force in the mid term\nSenator your reaction to the Kanye West of parents in the oval office yesterday\n[noise] I just think it's hilarious that are that the mainstream media is hyperventilating over that uh we all know that President Obama had rappers and other celebrities in the oval office during his time\nBut there is a double standard as we all know uh for this president and I just thought it was a I thought it was pretty hilarious\nYeah I mean Michelle Obama invited that profane rapper common to the White House to read poetry his his his stuff is filled with every expletive on earth but he was up there reading poetry so no one ever think that's great we're reaching out with this wonderful it's authentic and meanwhile Trump as if I'm here in West in there\nYou have to admit Senator Cornyn\nTruck makes things pretty ... pretty unconventional and in in kind of holds up a mirror to the Democrats does he not\nI I think so well it's it is just drive he makes their heads explode and they act and all sorts of or Russian irrational ways and\nAnd uh we've seen that the the judicial confirmation but we saw again yesterday on on TV and uh I picked this or we just need to get this midterm election behind us we need to keep the house in the ... so we can continue making progress for the American people including the adding more federal judge to the bench\nOh my gosh that is the judicial branch to co equal branch of our government\nArticle three judges and we need more a Trump nominees on the bench and when you declare those are cleared those through Senator Cornyn again thanks so much for all you did a confirmation battle over Kavanaugh's Iraq I Know our listeners are free to appreciate a great a great uh greatly and please come back soon\nTwenty years ago you know what I mean I don't want to have an actual large you're\nListening to the talk giant nine Seventy Katie WM shallow twelve Seventy K DJ I Holbrooke broadcast service uh\n[noise] this is a Fox News alerts American pastor detained in Turkey for two years said free\nI'm Dave Anthony it was after Andrew Brunson was convicted of the trial\nToday a great day although sentence without charges he's only having to do time of the house arrest lifted the travel ban lifted the control older lifted paving the way for overtime to the U.

think that is perhaps as significant or even more significant than cognac because of impact of Jim Brown drought\nNot only the black community but the white community as well\n... well the ... yeah I

... this is he's not Lincoln here let's not get ahead of ourselves I think\nThere are people on the right who want to suddenly crown Kanye West is the leader of you know African Americans in in
