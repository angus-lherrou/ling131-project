was trying to lure him back\nTo Saudi Arabia for some but not for some purpose so but the key thing here today is you've got the prince of Saudi Arabia crown prince and the gang put the credibility of Saudi Arabia on the line that they did not do this\nAnd so you've got to America is checking it out\nAt the same time as this looks like a real ... at the same time they're very serious state interest in the U.S relations with Saudi Arabia so you got to balance those things out\nYou know I remember you know Richard Nixon and we're over there and try to toast and Mao tse dong it the same time they're going through the massacres with a great broader and cultural revolution\nBecause we needed to deal with the Chinese against the Russians and the Cold War it's a real conflict here between

for a magnificent investigation which means individuals responsible for that decision would be sanctioned beyond that there are other options that we can take like I said that's something that needs to be thought through carefully but it needs to be very strong and meaningful can't be symbolic it can't just be words Yuri I realized that\nI Do agree with mark ... excuse me Senator Rubio to this extent [noise] or you can't just brush this well if if the investigation forged ground French and the crown prince\nI don't know how you make the future leader of Saudi Arabia persona non grata and impose sanctions on him personally so you can't come to the United states and she uses bank accounts or something like that she got a real conundrum here so I think what's going to happen\nIs the the Saudis are now working with the Turks and the Turks are a lot of countries over there in the middle east to have a real vested interest in not having a breach between Saudi Arabia and the United states showdown or you're going to see these\nInterests of ours against the sort of a moral position you gotta take which is this is an outrage or can't be allowed to happen and it's got to be punished by sanctions at least against the individual someone suggested that the solution is going to be the inevitable wrote agents went and did something they weren't supposed to do\n'em and they wanted to give the crown prince deniability\nRight may mean dishes in ...\n... exactly and over again you know when I was running a dumpster considering running against George W.

[laughter] I'm Sorry this is funny now Donald Trump was asked about this or on a on the south lawn of the White House before he took off or Florida let's listen\nTo\nWhat\nYou let her readers yes\nOr no no no he went on to say he hope she's running for president he hope she's running for president he went on and on about that that was the least interesting part of the uh the White House lawn but nevertheless he was he was like well I Hope she does run because this will be an easy way out for me\nYeah I Hope she ends up being the nominee I mean what Democrats are putting forward now the progressive left Democrats\nWill change our country and and we did a video actually recently talking about what socialism actually means and the cost of it because Democrats keeps saying free health care free that's free everything and they're not saying this well quadruple your taxes it will destroy our country go look at Venezuela\nEducated on this if you like the country that we live in today with a with economic opportunity with prosperity with wages coming up at Democrats are not that people you want to vote for\n'em and I have to ask you about what the house looks like I Know it's hard to predict every races is different but\nDid anyone predict at this point that the Republicans would be frankly making a comeback it looks like\nIn this midterm election cycle with the Kavanaugh a win for Donald Trump and he turns around and I think he fights for for Kavanaugh unlike anyone else and now the people are like this can't he's the best clothes or we have this could actually help in the house races\nIt could it is helping we're seeing that in our data obviously they are in the U.S put a huge ground game in place we've trained twenty five thousand field organizers that's five times more than we did\nIn twenty sixteen to turn out our boat to educate voters to talk about the results I there's a lot of house races and the balance there's about thirty so the house is going to be neck and neck I think until election day I think that every counts\nTo determine the majority and then the Senate is breaking our way\nOut in North Dakota and Missouri\nI was in Indiana this weekend with my run I mean the energy and the Senate sides great we could definitely pick up seats which is unprecedented in her mid term of a first term president so I felt good about where we are Kavanaugh

I looked at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical that that was in my life would go way\nTrinity will consolidate your accounts into one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you save thousands of what I Would\nTell other people please pick up the phone and call trinity just let them put together a program and see how affordable and easy it is to pay off your debt\nSoftness with which they're handling\nAt the foot and when that shows up they show up prepare for battle they're not counter demonstrators they're not counter protesters they are to search is a group an anarchist group and a police state to be more sort of early on\nTo keep the peace to the friendly to keep their officers safe and it's not really going on at once\nTo keep the peace to defend life to keep their officers safe and it's not really going on once the crap hits the fan so to speak or then it's too late so\nI think a different strategy of more of a ... a circus strategy by the Portland pd and all throughout the United states is necessary because we are at the states now and I I've been saying this for two or three months using the term political violence of people in the ... and they laughed and said it was hyperbole notes not now it's on\nAnd there's a a patriot prayer group that was holding their rally and they had one a couple of months ago and it and to flip did the same damn thing they showed up prepared for battle they start fights they like conflict\nAnd like I said a the police are there to keep the peace not let this stuff happened not been but don't break those or fail strategies and until they make it clear\nWith a answer for that their antics are not going to be allowed to go on under the guise of protests because this is not protest and I'll tell you what what irks me as well as when a commentators I'm not talking about you but there are commentators\nAre on the right who continued to refer to what ants a foot and some of this other political violence is when they're shutting down\nOr an intimidating people in a restaurant they keep calling at protests it's not protest it is insurgency answer for calls for the killing of police officers they call for the down fall of the United states lawfully Institute a government\nNow and I know anyone who calls that legitimate protests doesn't know what they're talking about it it's it's intimidation uh it's it's a type of of political extortion too when they do it to the senators and\nIn the elevators I keep saying sheriff Clarke why does even allowed in the halls of the U.S Senate why should why should people be able to to get within a centimeter from someone else's face and scream at them in in the halls of the uh the capital that should be allowed\nRight and but see these groups they realize that not much is going to be done about it and I write\nYou know senators and another congressman congresswoman too you know keep their decorum but then some of this is happening to private citizens for instance at Trump rallies for instance just this rally held by the Patriot prayer group or in Portland, Oregon and I've been saying for a long time to\nThat we have to have more effective counter measures and people say well what does that look like and I could tell people what I Would do and I don't advocate for what anybody else to do but I tell them you're going to think about this now you have to have a plan because they view\nToward any other cheek taking the high road walking away they view that as a sign of weakness and like you said Laurie you hit the nail right on the hit this is designed to intimidate and incite fear in people to get them to alter their their\nVotes for public policy that's why I'm calling this\nPolitical violence it's gone on for too long it's gone too far and and the more that you let this go on the worst is get I mean we should have learned this from the sixties which is the the anarchist movement that I studied to know what they're up to to know what their antics are and also know that what they learned out of the sixties law enforcement meaning of what they learned\nWas that those soft masters just lead to more people getting hurt\nMore people getting killed more property damage and\nThey ... I Would like to think that we learn that that doesn't work but we are committing the same mistakes or in law enforce\nI agree and I think we're seeing the same results and we'll get into this and just a moment sheriff Clarke at the border with this new caravan caravans approaching the border or so we'll get to that in mind but I Want to play something for you this is from Donna Brazil on ABC's This week and and it was on a panel with Chris Christie and others\nResistance that about ... [laughter] about people who do not want the health care for one week about women who want to be or we can listen to when they feel that it's time to talk about their problem of sexual assault not about mob\nThat you're running it maybe the food would be about but when we listen to what the Democrats were coming on TV you're talking about is talking about and painting Brett Kavanaugh run by the beating Donald Trump and the reason is taking the feel I agree with Rick Silva mob\nI eerie action to that\nPolicy about gun in Brazil you know but then in Brazil are not too long and we had a great conversation and she told me the true she said the stuff happening on the left as wrong she knows it's wrong but see they don't have the courage to call it up when I hear of people like her and I hear others not denounce\nThis violence it is a mob and she ought to just admit it but like I said she doesn't have the courage she saw the backlash when she came out with her book that really took the or the DNC and the Democratic party to task and she saw the filter blowback\n... she better scurry back on to the ... plantation and that's what she did at the end of her her a book tour but I think that's what she's up to again she needs to exhibit leadership people in the Senate\nYou're not going to get it from Maxine Waters with others in the Senate leader exhibits leadership we call this crap off for what it is\nTo tell these people to knock it off but what they do Laura's you know or their tacit approval is comes from the silence and if they do say anything like they try to make that well it's not a mob it's really about health care no it's not just trying to to frame of narrative\nAnd a ... everybody knows what she's up too but they do it with a wink and a nod when when they try to uh when they're forced I should say that say that anti ...\nSome of these other goals this I'm a feminist movement when they're pulling their crap you know they do with a wink and a nod when they go well yeah maybe a little bit but you know their their silence give tacit approval to this political violence\nOr and share of Clark before we let you go ah the Democrat Stacey Abrams and other she's running for governor in Georgia saying that they represent both documented and undocumented\nUm people in this country and left a whole bunch of other groups they claim to represent a and now we have this\nIs mad a crush about to happen again on the southwest border with more caravans of people showing up because you know we basically are just now releasing people who are coming over with that with children\nBy this is dangerous they continue they meaning the left they continue to push the envelope on this stuff she doesn't represent undocumented anybody citizenship is you know means something in this country they're diluting the meaning of citizenship and what citizenship means is that all the rights of privileges\nThat are in the constitution or belong to the United states citizens not non citizens so they're actually taking the citizens of Georgia what she's doing the the residents of the state of Georgia and she's making them second class citizens\nAnd again on this Congress must work with the president both on the wall and of course allowing for immediate turned back at the border sheriff Clarke otherwise we're just going to keep this this keep happening and it's going to be an entire a migration of people from Central America into this country I\nCompletely illegal not wanted by this country not why by the people but just because they can and they know if they cross the border there no one's no one's going to make 'em leave\nWell they're gonna have to be turned back but I think there's going to be a moment of truth that really is\nA in terms of this administration I support the president's policies on immigration\nOr illegal immigration and you know it is you're you're right it's the Congress who has not moved on this shame on the geo pecan Congress I think they squandered an opportunity here who knows what's going to happen in November but they squandered an opportunity to straighten out this an elite this broken\nOr immigration system to\nThe street now the elite this broken\nImmigration system\nFinally seal the border that's the first thing that has to be done everything else that that people are proposing follows stealing the border because if you don't steal the border\nWe just saw last week with some guy committed some heinous act against the United states citizen of beating has been deported six times lore six we heard stories of people who've been caught that have been deported\nThirty times it's not a made up number but the ... the borders so poor or easily or they can easily get back in Seoul no it's a matter of\nUm you know the eleventh hour and and I don't know we're going to maintain the house I I I Hope when I see we the Jill ... I Hope they can but if they don't all this stuff is off the table but Democrats are not going to allow that wall to be built they're\nNot going to fix this immigration system they're going to get citizenship\nThrough some measure to illegal aliens amnesty I'm Talking about\nAnd you know of course we have a president that will put a block on that the Senate will but at the same time we shouldn't be fighting the battle right now we squandered a GOP Senate and I'll squandered two years for heaven's sakes with a very a strong\nPresident ... arms of stealing the border and immigration a broken immigration system they squandered it so this is what we're left with\nAh the website is Americas Americas sheriff dot com sheriff David Clarke former sheriff of Milwaukee\nOf course spokesmen and senior advisor of America First action but a police joined him at America's\nSheriff dot com David thank you so much we really appreciate your time today\nYou heard it it's a it's a wakeup call for this Congress do not allow this country to suffer even further because law and order has dissolved at the border is not fair to the hardworking people in this country and those Americans who truly do need", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Show Low", "day": "15"}
