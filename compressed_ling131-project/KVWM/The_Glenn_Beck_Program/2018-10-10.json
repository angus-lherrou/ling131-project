the young\nAn example of civility and so for US Senator who say get in their face for congresswoman like her to say get in your face and then what happens is uh the president's press secretaries and Senator Cruz or pushed out of restaurants\nThat are surely that is encouraged by what are these congresswoman and senators are saying and it's wrong\nOr I Believe in a freedom of association freedom of speech freedom to demonstrate\nBut it ought to be peaceful and you shouldn't do anything that's going to encourage violence because even if or a congresswoman doesn't intend violence there's some people that are going to take it one step further than she intended\nAnd she needed to back off about ... steps and a and not surely not be in your face if you're going to have a democratic and representative government function properly\nUh I got to be a a ... you know a few feet away we got to have a a discussion a dialogue I got to have respect for people that disagree with me and she ought to respect for people that disagree with our\nBut in your face is in a way to do it\nWell she said a year ago or that she was gonna take Donald Trump out\nAnd what does that mean let me see is that this I'm lesbian or gay algae beauty dinner and she goes I'm gonna take him out\nThat she wasn't saying take 'em out for dinner is I take him out and\nTelling people that are getting harassed in restaurants and\nIt seems like that that message really has terminated the permanent protest a mentality in the Democratic party senator and in my concern is that someone's going to end up getting hurt we already had Steve's at least get shot you would have thought that the that the Democrats would have calmed everyone down after that\nUh but when you have Susan Collins been cornered in an elevator\nIt's one thing when Jeff Flake is cornered an elevator but then you have poor old Susan Collins yet people being ... scream data centimeter from their face\nWhile they're trying to walk down a hallway I mean what can be done about this\nWell ah obviously for those of us that are in public office and in\nIn public places and we're confronted with that and they're doing it under what they think is First Amendment rights the only thing you can count on his police protection and we have but then you can't have police protection\nFor four five hundred and thirty five members of Congress or every place they are spread throughout the United states even relying upon local police\nOr you can't do that as well so are are are I've come to the conclusion and this repetitive of whatever kind of already said to you but are\nA democracy will be a stronger a with respect full political discourse as opposed to what is happening when you a quote unquote get in their face\nWell but what senator what responsibility does something like a Dianne Feinstein or Cory Booker or Kamala Harris have to to speak against this type of harassment and intimidation this isn't just carrying a sign in and chanting some things is is\nCornering women in elevators this this is something and we have we have people threatening to kill cabinet or teachers and Minnesota I mean people are taking this all the hard if you if you say someone's like a combination of a Nazi in a sexual predator enough times\nSome whack a doodle is gonna you know take take matters into his or her own hands got help but so what responsibility does the Democrat leadership have here\nUh I don't think they're going to exercise it but they gotta\nThey gotta responsibility to renounce it\nNo I Would I Would I'm waiting for that ah I'm waiting for that undergrads they there go ahead\nYou wait a long time I think I'll Try [laughter]\nSenator Grassley are the lessons learned from this Kavanaugh saga of many of us thought that\nIn the beginning when we had to put off the hearing and and take it off from the Thursday vote initially kick it off to Monday and then I got delayed because of the Ford allegation\nIn any thoughts to solidifying the rules so you can't extend hearings past the close of the original hearing date so these kind of anonymous allegations can't drop and make a difference again\nFor all I've read your\nTweets when you took me to tears called me for ... for not calling for a whole but but you can't you can't ... if I call the vote today on we went along we we weren't all yeah tend to tend to rely on and so you gotta have some respect for people that are on the job here are you doing it\nAnd so we we waited until we had the votes\nYeah no I corrected myself after that I didn't delete the tweet because I said and then but I corrected myself and then you and you and McConnell both\nHindered handled this master fleet in the face of incredibly difficult and I think ...\nI'm a highly emotional highly charged atmosphere and when people say that Dr Ford was disrespected which is a guest on my show said last night she was disrespect and I said\nOh my gosh Senator Grassley said that if you need something repeated or you know if you are you okay do you need anything I mean you couldn't have been more solicited of Dr Ford I I Can't imagine how you could have been\nFrankly yeah well\nIt reminds me of how I was confronted by Iowans because uh in the Thomas hearings because I was so mean to Anita Hill and I never asked a single question but I was sitting beside specter that did are questioning and everybody thought I was factor\n[laughter] [noise]\nOh my goodness I'm Senator Grassley a there was another moment that I have to get you to react to um this is Heidi Heitkamp of course Democrat in North Dakota decided divide vote against having off a lot of people have talked about whether the court\nRemains legitimate you heard Hillary say that it's a shame that things happen as they happen because the court always was respected and this is what\nShame that things happen as they happen because the court always was respected and this is what senator hide camps then\nYou're obviously in the midst of a very tough reelection fight and I know you you feel voting the way you did was the right way do you worry are you concerned that it may have cost you your sentences\nAt the end of the day you all have to look at yourself in the mirror and think about what your future holds if you compromise or something like this based on politics and I I Believe the yes vote would have compromised um my true belief that um this person did not have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court\nThey're still repeating that the temperament issues Senator Grassley\nHe listened this gets back to ... he's got twelve successful years on the DC circuit the second most important\nA court in the land he's been college or even people like Garland a said that he had that sort of a approach to judging and that means judicial temperament and not only are you have a personality\nThat is tempered you also leave your personal views out of out of a decision making you look at the law and look at the facts of the case and just to use those two things to go by\nSo consequently uh ... what what she said Sandra Hi Kim said\nPlus your question brings me to a history of Thomas\nOr is it going to hurt the Supreme Court I listen to the same thing twenty eight years ago and then I look at twenty eight years record of Thomas on the court and I've never seen any retribution on his part towards anything that was set against him at that time\nAnd he was mad when he said he was going through our high tech\nHigh ... yeah\nI think\nYeah so so you know after twenty eight years though is the same thing about Thomas not seeing it I think that I got great confidence that Kavanaugh's going to bring great\nPrestige and knowledge and academic background and more importantly is work on the second highest court ...\nCourt and it's all positive\nNo it's it's ... he's the one in the most qualified people period of time to sit on the court\nA Senator Grassley the uh the Susan Collins um situation in main course all these leftist billionaires promising a to flood\nOr the her opponent whoever that ends up being a with lots of money you want to raise three million dollars for Susan Collins I Know Mitch McConnell has said the same thing how was that looking\nWell we're just getting started at that but a conservative even though a lot of times they disagree\nWith Susan Collins they got to look at her as a senator of great principal\nAnd we need to respect that\nAnd I said three million it's going to take a lot more than three million to elect her but they raised ... million against her so our goal is three million dollars right now and everybody that ought to respect her and want cabin on on the court ought to go along that line and I hope a rallying cry\nFor Republicans over the next twenty eight days between now and the election is remember Kavanaugh and this November ... election is a chance for Americans to reject the mob rule that you have seen over the last three weeks\nTwenty years when will you know what I mean I was going to have an actual reemerged in one day you're\nListening to the top giant nine Seventy Katie WM shallow

in my neck you know it's like you can't turn your head one way and your neck hurts forget about it I don't have any more I didn't believe that my pillow was going to be so great until I tried\nIt and

at the White House at the cabinet thing and I said well yeah I think some picks the dust and the president what did you say your best friend what what what's the theory there congressman\nUh I I don't know but I still know the facts are facts and that you have to give it McCain memos that we subpoena\nThere are all these stories out a earlier this week that talked about how serious they took the alleged comments Mr Rosenstein paid about actually recording the president in the oval office wearing a wire or tape recording in whatever they were or a phone recording whatever they want to do\nUm and there's the fact that it now looks like Mr Rogers by not going to show up tomorrow so we don't do that for sure but we're starting to hear rumors that he's not coming to talk to Congress like he was supposed to uh tomorrow\nOr in I'm In the Judiciary Committee so\nI made me think that because he has a good relationship with the president now he doesn't have to\n... well maybe maybe or maybe it has something to do with the stories that were written that said you know what you said if you are or is that the stories that said he said this and this is my tape and this page and then when I talk to you Mr Baker so a book will or\nWill hopefully he'll hopefully he'll take change his mind that will be there tomorrow so we could asking the questions that I think American people deserve to have the answers to\nCongressman joined explain James Baker the ah the man who is the attorney at the FBI and why\nHis involvement in all of this and his contacts are so important to the narrative of how this whole Russian investigation was started\n'cause he's the chief counsel when you're the chief counsel the FBI and you're the guy in the middle of the two biggest investigations run by all these key players struck page McCabe call me a\nThat is important and when it's now now being recorded that uh he was he taught to both McCain and paid shortly after this meeting took place with Mr Rosenstein and that he understood it to be a serious comment made in that meeting that's why we need to talk to Mr Rosenstein and never forget the fundamental facts\nWhen have you ever seen this happen at any federal agency James Comey fire director former direct FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe light three times under oath fire Jim Baker chief counsel first demoted then left the FBI we used to pay jeopardy I counseled demoted that left and of course Peter ... up\nTo counter intelligence demoted then fired top people the FBI demoted or fired\nAll the people who ran the Clinton investigation and then now as we know launched and ran the Russia investigation until Mr Rosenstein named Mr Mahler to take that investigation over so that's why this is important that furniture Rosenstein needs to be in front of us so we can asking questions about all that\nYeah he's not going to show up there's no way I don't think it's my producer will make it either no no he's he's not he's not going to come I I just\nI I guess I don't understand why that he they claimed it was a joke and maybe I just don't have the sense of humor I really thought I had but I don't think that was all that funny like I'm gonna wire myself or get wired going taped a president and then get the twenty Fifth Amendment going I don't understand why is that funny\nI agree with you I agree with you completely Laura you shouldn't be joking about it about matters like that in front of the ordinance made that is this is the guy who in effect is running the Justice Department and whether it's sarcasm or joke or what it should not be set\nUp particularly remember the time that this was done this was when the whole stinking town was all spun up this is between may ninth twenty Seventeen and may seventeenth twenty Seventeen may ninth as a date Rosenstein writes the memo that the president uses to fire call me may seventeenth is when Rosenstein names\nAre lower as the special counsel sometime in between her and it looks like it happened on may sixteenth is one this alleged conversation took place so even joking about something in that timeframe when that whole city was all spun up about all the special counsel and obstruction of justice and all those issues\nAt all the more reason why you should not be saying something even if it was a joke\nAgain the the main question that is on the table I think as a mother is gonna do among there's going to do but the main question on the table is why did you serve email an American citizen\nBased on information you received from and paid for from the opponent of\nDonald Trump and if that's the other hand are now you can you can start surveilling someone because they traveled to Russia and\nSaid hello to a a government official at some point and years ago you he was questioned and the poor little Carter Page mean where does he go to get you know his reputation back and where does he go to get here legal fees paid I mean he's just twist into in for years\nNo I'm a ... it's good you brought that up because we sometimes it's important to go back to the basics\nThe Clinton campaign the DNC paid Perkins carried off or who paid fusion GPS who hired a foreigner\nTo go talk to Russians and put together a document that was completely false totally bogus totally uncorroborated and that document became the basis we're going to a secret court to get a warrant to spy on Mr page because he was associated with the other parties can paint\nThat is what happened here and ... and they used the press\nTo get all kinds of information flooding the FBI so so fusion GPS is a newly ... works for them she get information your husband's events lentils it to the FBI so she gets information your purse or top Justice Department official so you've got all these sources sending the lie\nTo the FBI which gives it more credibility I Would say the more people talking about the live easier the law is to believe and that's exactly what took place you are but it's still a lie and they use that to go to spy on the other camp it's\nWhat's wrong with the um what's your what's your sense about uh the mid term elections I mean do you think Kavanaugh the energy from that is going to sustain the Republicans to cut maybe some of the Democratic gains that there are still predicting in the house I'm well how do you see this playing out\nYeah I Hope so I Hope so and I was I was in or out about across our district and lives in Florida the other night when people were fired up that that our Senate helpful\nAnd a ... good man was being attacked by the left I think a lotta people are beginning to see that the left is going completely crazy we did a tweet the other day I had more people come out and we said today's left a plot Capra Nick destroy Kavanaugh\nAnd that's today's left ... they they embraced of radical you know ... when he disrespect the flag and brace Cuomo when he says\nAmerica was never that great cheer on Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed people who support the president or an old by the way it will destroy Kavanaugh to prosecute I mean that's today's left and I think it is beginning to fire up conservative voters are Republican voters I Hope it sustained over the next twenty six days and that we can\nKeep the majority in the house you look over your shoulder more now with ah with what's happening out there\nYeah I mean I think you have to uh none of us are just as you are but my ... an appalling I where we're at a back in June literally two days after Maxine Waters did her first ran and we got what I what I call the treatment from a lady were out and she started we're in a line of people get moving into the theater and um she just started\n... you know yelling shame and evil and Jim Jordan\nUm she just started ... you know yelling shame and evil and Jim Jordan terrible all this stuff so I mean it's ridiculous we we would never do that the people who were on the left\nBut they seem to want to do that all the time now so you do kind of just watch or you know um well I Wish they wouldn't do that I don't think it's appropriate but despite about argue about the idea let's not let's not make it personal let's not run people at restaurants and do all the things that they're\nThat they're going to do it without to do it and say yeah it's it's what they have now they're holding on to the anger by the way there was an interesting thing which I forgot to ask you earlier congressman\nAndy McCarthy the former I'm just I guess the term southern district of New York he made this point on my show last night about Rosenstein and why the president may not\nEnd up ah removing him as deputy AG let's listen\nI think the president realizes that if he were to get rid of a Rosenstein at this point it would be like firing call me times three and it would give mall or a reason to extend the investigation why would he want to do that I mean it looks like now\nThere's not going to be any charges they're stepping down they transitioned a lot of these cases that they brought to other components of the Justice Department this is about or\nWhat do you think about that yeah it's pretty right it seems like things are pretty quiet so they must be writing the report Korea\nYeah I I Hope so and I think that's that's probably a ... that could be right and uh obviously respect ... I'm In all the things is written about always done so I look I don't think of any changes made the Justice Department till after the election until after Bob ... I think that that's obvious it's obvious that\nI'm the president wants it a new attorney general and um I think that that will happen at some point too but I don't think that's going to happen until after the election it until after the special counsel's that work is finished\nA Jim Jordan always great to talk to Congress and very set of Ohio congressman thanks so much\nWill take a break close out this hour a lot more to get to Michael Savage is also going to join us stay there\nThe Laura Ingraham show\nYou're listening to Laura Ingraham your healthy radio addiction on the mountains talk giant nine Seventy Katie WM show Trump Seventy K DJ I Hope\nShe's in the midst of perjury [noise] what is the way people [noise]\n\n[noise] I Know [noise]\n\nWash the new season of the man castle now\nAs much as ... as I can tell your threshold overcharged for anyone\nWho are listening to the talk giant nine Seventy KB WM shallow twelve Seventy Katie GI Holbrooke broadcast\n[noise] this is a Fox News alerts hurricane Michael still on track to be the most powerful storm ever hit the Florida Panhandle I'm Dave Anthony\nIf you made the choice not to evacuate please find a place to shelter Sikh place of refugees\nGovernor Rick Scott Michael's I won't make landfall for a few hours but the outer bans are already hitting Fox's Jeff lock out in the middle of its\nWar on our own here we're not expecting any worse for where we get into your thoughts on us is on all of the people that I made the choice to stay part of our study these large structures that are theoretically a\nHurricane proof for when they were going to see\nTo the former\nFox is Evan brown has the latest on the hurricane live from Miami\nDay for most areas along the Florida Panhandle coast cities too late to leave for some other areas the evacuation window is sharply closing FEMA chief Brock Long\nAnd you need to leave 'em this is the final call a for anybody that needs to get out or try to do so those you stick around to experience star search don't typically lived to tell about it\nEspecially with storm surge reaching nine feet or higher ... am eastern Michael's holding when's it a hundred and forty five miles an hour the storm's eye is about sixty miles out from Panama City\nThey live and Brett Kavanaugh was at work at the Supreme Court hearing a case on immigration is the end of the FBI gets questions the capital but the newest justice Fox's Rachel Sutherland live in Washington\nState FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Senate Homeland Security Committee the supplemental background investigation into justice Kavanaugh was specific unlimited ends go that direction of the White House\nMy folks have assured me that the whole process was\nFalls re decline questions on specific written instructions from the White House counsel Don McGahn\nCommunications occur between the White House office of security and the FBI security division\nSome Democrats have called the investigation this chance day this\nIs Fox News\nOr you taking my address and tired of paying fifty dollars per tablet\nMolly John has generic thank God for just ten dollars per tablet ten dollars for genetic by ... is a savings have forty dollars per dose calm down and get free shipping on ten Catholics are more of generic land\nIt does call now and get free shipping on ten Catholics are more of generic Molly drivers in North Carolina pharmacy licensed in all fifty states for information go to Molly generics dot com or call us at eight hundred five seven eight when six boys the eight hundred five seven eight once ...\nOnce a day for tennis you're ready to play\nIs everything All right this site is pressure liquor dean knows that allergy congestion can get in a way of enjoying the moment [laughter] go ahead and practice without liberty helps you breakthrough congestion fast but like Rudy combined the non drowsy anti histamine plus a powerful decongestant for twenty four hours of congestion free breeder\nAbout another that only if you go easy on me get a leg or a\nDean and give back to the moment starts working in one hour available at the pharmacy counter\nPresident trouble beyond campaigning again ...

should be fill up at a hospital not an option for a parent on a birth certificate ... this is not optional\nYou know this is like how much did you away\nAt what time were you born and what is your sex these are facts determined by the birth of chill Minnesota non binary gender identification on driver's license approved by state okay and that was uh when was that just last week right last week\nAnd and so ... this is a there is a trend here now these are grown ups in the case of Minnesota on their driver's license saying I Am now identify as whatever okay\nYou're an adult you can identify as whatever you'd like\nBut a baby at birth should they be allowed to the parents have the option of redefining the sex of the child on the birth certificate\nOkay Brent Pennsylvania you wanted to say what print yes I kept\nA renter there go Hi just as good as brand you I'm from New York the what the uh gender identification I Want to know if I can identify as a rose Bush because I Am pretty do I still have to pay taxes\n[laughter] I that I don't know but uh ... be careful with that they might clip you know take your thorns okay thank you for the call 'em let's go to Bob Bob or you're in Minnesota right\nYes\nNow your state just passed this law where people can define whatever sex they'd like on their driver's license so you're ... you're really in the middle of this experiment\nWell I I think the whole thing is is the socialist the Democrats are are following solace is eight roast radicalism and they're trying to remove God from the ...\n... and we love this country was built on God's press falls of male female husband wife we let it happen and we wonder why this country's gone in the ...\nYeah well Bob Look there certainly are in the Bible and in in classic Christian belief a ... it is it is held that God created the male or female but let's put that aside for a moment\nThere is something called objective fact nature itself that corresponds with this idea so the notion that this is some invented gender hierarchy\nInvented anything it's a fact of life like there's a free and their eggs and there are sperm their old you know these are these are objective facts built into nature that religion and man have acknowledged and embraced\nBut when you when you try to redefine the thing at its origin\nThat is concerning my problem is people are looking away from reality from science from ... the the sex of the child itself and I'm not so sure we should give parents the right\nTo shift or bend the sex of their child or or not to find that at all on a birth certificate I think for the purposes of the state that's a bad idea\nThat has many many uh uh ramifications thanks for the call 'em let's go to Kay in Iowa you wanted to say what\nI think you've just said part of it what I Believe this is is the spirit of deception\nYeah I think it's spiritual deception and confusion because it just is this the last man said he got out of everything so now it without the gender identity with all of a stab at least in the book of genesis you're right he made them male and female\nSo now let's try to change what God did so that's all part of another idol it's it's something that is against what God created and that's\nWell part of another idol it's it's something that is against what God created and that's why we have this it's deception and confusion at the spirit behind it just like everything else that's going on in our country people get becoming Derek on radical\nScreening I heard ... have the other day it sounded like an insane asylum the same hollering that you would hear that would come out of an asylum we were in a bad place right now and I'm only God can help us out of this and that's what they want to kick away from us we\nHave to be fighting for it\nThank you get a this story just two days ago published a Utah on man well a person in Utah becomes one of the first in the state to receive non binary ex markers\nOn birth certificate and driver's license now did this person we're going to look at the story but I think what they did was go back in\nA re classified themselves in the bird in the birth certificate right retroactively so they went back and you know again to find themselves ... was a female but is now a dent defying as acts\nYour thoughts on this end where this could lead we're going to take a quick break eight five
