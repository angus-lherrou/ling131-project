Sunday Morning you know special\n[laughter] well and and that's what that's what people are so frustrated NATO in our state that on our country they're ready for governor it's got to put them first of the special interests them in a former director for ISIS sportsmen under the Obama administration called Stacey Abrams to get out of the race after this\nOutlandish comment that she made and you know

wants to do and she's going to raise taxes on artwork orders to pay for and people are tired of that are waking up turning out and we're going to put that red wall\nBut we need conservatives across

president is so frustrated about uh Brian I have to play for you something that Stacey Abrams\nIs a beating on pretty hard which is the\nClaim of voter suppression despite the large voter registration record levels of voter registration in the state uh which of course can play both ways but ah we're going to a place and get your reaction let's listen\nYou're sixty three thousand people who are being forced to go through unnecessary hurdles to prove their bona fide ease but the second is that you have a hundred and fifty nine counties thousands of volunteering paid coworkers who are going to be asked to substantially verify that these ideas are sufficient and the challenges there is this this is his objective standards\nIt would be much easier if he actually did his job and process people in a proper fashion and we did not have the ... system\n[noise] ah your reaction to that uh the the law\nUh your reaction to that uh the the law that requires matching matching from a\nLicenses driver's licenses to voter rolls they\nClaim that us secretary of state are disenfranchising are suppressing the ability of especially minorities to vote in the state your response\nWell no this was a law but I Am following state law that we have in Georgia for up barefoot case in process because we believe that we should and I support this that we should bear a\nWho individuals are before we register to vote that's why we have a stick or a citizenship check this flight we have when you get your driver's license in our state\n... this is a manufactured crisis they did the same thing before the two thousand fourteen reelection governor Nathan Deal\nThey did the same thing before the presidential election of Donald Trump and they're doing the same thing now we had record turnout Donald Trump was elected in Georgia most votes ever cast in our state so I don't see how that butter suppression\nRight before this outrageous claims came we announced that we had or people on our voter rolls than ever before the state of Georgia\nBecause we have things like online voter registration up push the general assembly and implemented a secretary of state ... years ago we have eight thousand more people on our roles now that we hit had\nTook office she voted against outlined voter registration she does not support our common sense photo out the lawsuit voted against our citizenship chit\nThe counties are the ones that are flagging these individuals because the information from local groups is not properly filled out on the form and by the way all these people have to do to be able to vote is the same thing that I Would or any other Georgia citizen that his own our roles they just have to go to their polling location\nShow their photo out the most likely their driver's license and they can vote so that is not a hot hurdle for people to do but they can't blame me on their own canvassers can't fill out proper type or register to vote\nAnd if they use their own line system they never had any of this problem to start with so she's blaming me for problem she created a and she's blaming me for following state law that's why I think\nGeorgia voters are a lot smarter than she gives them credit for they're going to see the smoke screen this all they're doing this to drop their base out\nBut it's working in reverse because the Republican base that conservative base\nAnd hard work and Georgia's are going to reject a solo on November the ...\nAh well the the argument is that well if you have a letter and missing in your name methods like Laura a

uh again mentions of immigration as the nation's most important problem have averaged only you know five percent of the last Seventeen years the Gallup as an asking\nOn generally a monthly basis immigration is the top issue in the United states slightly edging out the economy okay\nAnd it goes on and on about this uh a Reuters poll found that Fifteen Percent of registered voters said that immigration is their biggest concern topping economic performance and health care immigration and the writers it's so what's the top issue for voters in the election\nOr that number is higher of course among Republicans with twenty six percent of the G O P voters citing immigration as their major concern just seven percent of Democrats said the same\nUh but listen to this forty five percent of black voters in forty four percent of Hispanic voters each said that immigration has had a negative impact on their community now why is that the CBS Hugo poll why is that because\nOf course they live in the areas where immigration has a profound effect on the public schools the healthcare system\nOr in some cases crime a housing the list goes on and on\nThese are the facts Donald Trump is more in touch with the American people on immigration than pretty much any politician alive today he understands it\nJoining us now I'm delighted or he is with US Congressman Tom Garrett Republican from Virginia fifth congressional district\nOr he's going to give us a the latest because he sits on the all important House Homeland Security Committee as we see these caravans up and running again with the mass migration from Central America coming into this country because they know there'll be caught in alternately released\nCongressmen I can tell you my listeners are infuriated by this they want Congress to act they want these loopholes closed what can you tell us about what Congress could do in short order to prevent this nonsense off from continuing\nEvery time will pass the bill or something that is funding stopgap measure will yank the rug out from underneath the president who wants to keep its promises of securing the border your lead and bumper\nWhere the gentleman that I use that term loosely talked about hardliners on immigration is symptomatic of the fact that the left as co opted the lexicon changed the meaning of words that I'd like for something to do explained to me when\nDefending your national borders and sovereignty became a hard line stance because essentially what they've done it said if you don't want to open borders than you are mean\nAnd the American voting public needs to think hard enough to understand the very ridiculous underlying assumptions that I Am all were robust and help the legal\nImmigration system is I think you are\nOr a robust and help the legal\nImmigration system is I think you are but at what point did securing the border has become controversial and and and and why is it that Republicans cut the rug out from underneath the president as it relates to keep his promises on security our borders I Can't figure it out um and and that\nJust as well let me tell you about something that happened Congress man this is very concerning again to my listeners and viewers on Fox ah this was a earlier this year when we had the opportunity to rain and these ever broadening asylum categories meaning domestic\nAbuse and fear of gangs or what have been included in the credible fear a categories as as affecting social groups in a particular country so a bad effect\nOn certain social groups Jeff Sessions comes along as attorney general and says ... no no no no no\nA domestic domestic abuse and gang membership that's that's not part of what constitutes credible fear\nCongress sadly David Yoder a congressman from Kansas and a a his ... a democratic ah in ah North Carolina both acted to remove that\nFrom the ongoing congressional action on there so that was gutted by Congress that's the kind of thing that is going to make it more difficult to hold the house of representatives for Republicans it's it's insane that they took they they decided to got what Jeff Sessions wanted to do their\nWell look Kevin Yoder and Kansas has got himself in a tough fight and Republicans always think that moderating on the message that got him elected in the first place is some sort of magical formula for reelection\nI disagree dance with the one who run yeah I'm In and so you find yourself in a terrible catch twenty two nobody's listening right that's a joke I'm but I'm I'm a ... if we lose the house maybe will actually get up off our butts during the lame duck session and keep some of the promises we made three or two and a half three years ago\nI got the upside you know that the Republicans might act like Republican\nWell I think again this is the most important issue for most Americans are who are answering these polls immigration is either number one number two and these caravans come into the country if Republicans lose the house it'll get worse not going to get better it's going to get worse ah but\n... except maybe we'll get some some courage right UC UC leader McCarthy now talking about border security and I'm ... I'm Glad he is but I mean why now I fear that there's a political motivation what you're saying\nWell again I I'm not I'm not understanding really why Paul Ryan is still in its speaker of the house I think if you're going to retire or they think Paul Ryan is going to turn out to voters and in twenty Eighteen I mean God Bless par and I like um a lot but I you know there's going to turn out the voters the guy who's flying all over the country right now Donald Trump anger and\nCongress I'm telling you Congress is going to rue the day that that didn't get the money for this law they did an appropriate it and they didn't change the stupid asylum laws that allow people to be gaming the system and then caught and ultimately released because we do not\nHave the facilities to house them seven hundred thousand people and immigration backlog now ... court backlog claiming credible fear another client that's absurd\nWhoa that's prosecuting for the better part of a decade and domestic violence as a scourge on any nation but it's hard to prove domestically it's it's real hard to prove when the Clinton emanates from El Salvador\nOh that's why they're saying here\nI can fear alien abduction but that doesn't mean that it's actually happening\nYeah well again I think you and you seemed you understand this congressman Garrett but the American people or you know like we we got cities with with the homeless a villages ... villages we got a bitter veterans on the street we have people who never were able to get back on their feet after the great recession or our opioid addicted\nWe need help for those people we cannot we cannot be the saviors of the entire world we can do our best but\nAt some point we got to say you know we're here to focus on the American people and I hope that\nYou take this message back to your colleagues in Congress because I'm telling you people are ... are are a light with a with rage about the situation a congressman thank you so much for joining us would definitely do on TV soon we'll take a break a lot more to get too including an outspoken advocate uh again\nOr more anger on the radio addiction on a mountain top giant nine Seventy eighty WM show while Seventy Katie G. I.\nBill O'Reilly here my new book and the killing series is killing the ss on for the worst war criminals on earth it's about Nazi evil and those who enabled\nThe buckles on us Nazi hunters risk their lives to track down mass killers like Adolf Eichmann were protected by force there is a reason why the killing books are so more than ... million copies so I Hope you check out killing the ss as well\nOr your word your identity could be held hostage you should be because ransomware does exactly that this is Tom Kelly studio of my id care making every American safer from the affected by these up as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from ransom where is the backup your computer often\nHarvard received billions in federal government money they're literally taking your heart or tax money\nAnd using it to discriminate against you\nWell how am I so they take all this money to have billions in an endowment I mean they they could basically get free tuition to almost every student and still be a be you know swimming and money uh\nBut this would mean the federal government is subsidizing racism title racism\nOr you know uh affirmative in a more but it's it's not just ... more than a hundred universities publicly endorsed racial discrimination I in the Supreme Court's Fisher decision or you know\nAffirmative action is a nationwide system of government funded state sponsored racism um and it it she has a huge impact on admissions\nSo what what do you um what do you think is going to happen in this court decision I mean the the the belief that diversity is the founding principal of America\nOr is I mean I bet if you pull people in colleges and universities pulled the students most would would cite diversity as a founding American principle of course America's founded on liberty not founded on diversity is founded on liberty but they they think that's\nSacrosanct the colleges always list that as a compelling interest and there are a lot in their defense of these lawsuits are that diversity should be a consideration I think the court has said it can be one consideration but it can't be the Supreme Court and the Michigan affirmative action case but it can't be the only consideration correct\nOr you're you're absolutely right but you know I I kind of this is the point I Want to one of the points I made when I spoke at the rally was I I had the opportunity to go to UCLA after I got into medical school and dropped out UCLA is a school that doesn't practice affirmative action in admissions and\nI learned that it was possible to have a diverse class of African Americans Hispanics Asian Americans had whites without practicing racial discrimination is missions so I don't want anyone to believe that affirmative action is essential for a great quality of education you can have a great education just\nLet people in based on merit because there are smart people of all races religions colors and creates\nWell the uh the opposition um to your point of view and say that you know you're merely your your goals would merely penalize those who have been systematically subjected to racism so there's historical racism in the United states\nA vast we must give a leg up or special consideration to those who come from that class of Americans so that it is fair then because\nHistorically they were subjected to this type of a systemic racism\nOr I Would argue in many ways it is the ultimate form of racism to assume that blacks and Hispanics and Native Americans on my dad\nCan't compete ah based purely on racial grounds I think that all races can compete on a fair playing field and UCLA and UC Berkeley and uh the University of Michigan and other schools across the country which don't use affirmative action or living proof of that\nYeah well uh this genie park who's Harvard Asian American alliance president ah was on MSNBC and made this point\nThe lawsuit is not about protecting Asian Americans in this brought by an anti civil rights activists named had were well my rights activists who was trying\nTo bring down Mary and civil rights protections in American society town and ultimately about his goal to bring down and says I'm going to mention that is actually designed to increase fairness\nIncrease opportunities increase in the cage and better for everyone which is good for Asian Americans as well\nUh your response to that [noise]\nAh affirmative action is racial discrimination against Asian Americans all of the statistical evidence shows that it is much harder to get into college graduate school as an Asian American for every student who graduated from Harvard gloss like her\nWho is a horseshoe to Harvard or who was an Asian American there was an equally qualified Asian American student somewhere in America\nWho got rejected because of the schools racially discriminatory affirmative action policies those Spiegel spoke at the Asian American coalition offer education's Raleigh a just a couple of days ago so they're speaking for the few who got in\nThere is a massive number who are victims of racial discrimination from schools like Harvard\nHow do you think this is going to turn out this court decision I mean you can never guess depends on the judge you get depends on a lot of different factors but how do you think this was going to come down\nUh it it it comes down to a ... it it comes down to ... for the first time in our nation's history we have an anti affirmative action majority in the Supreme Court\nAh we have a Justice Department who was on our side who sees this as racism or a President Trump has been our greatest ally\nIn our fight to end racial discrimination against Asian Americans and whites in the form of affirmative action or so because we have this powerful law alive who is a champion for equal access to education for Asian Americans and white people are I think that India and we may prevail\nOh it's going to be there this is probably going to go on for some time on the federal district court level than to a court of appeals and ah if they determine the circuit split on this to the Supreme Court\nUm VJ this is fascinating are we going to get you on TV you got to come on TV with us soon a v J in them now his book almost black the true story of how I got into medical school by pretending to be black or what\nDo you think about this see it's racial bean counting and the words of some it's contrary to what we hope that we would achieve a colorblind society\nA and does it encourage more resentment among various a minority groups and others I instead of just respect for talent and individual merit aid five five forty Laura your reaction to this and a lot more coming up\n[noise]\nWhether or not you're for or against affirmative action it's done for into the house of action has negatively impacted Asian American groups and you can be for affirmative action in Saudi
