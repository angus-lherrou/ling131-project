opportunity to to prove or brand and she blows it by voting against him and her whole brand went right out the window and then\nOf course is like if she just doesn't fit with the north Dakota's coda a mindset in the\nThe spirit of North Dakota which is one of my party courageous a mile still still has that frontier feeling well other than that it's not very popular a state but it's a pro Trump conservative\nPro Second Amendment of course and believe in fairness just general fairness in the cabinet deal just wasn't fair\nAnd I think most people just that you know and so she's obviously not going to apologize for not supporting him but I think that was the\nStraw that broke the Democrats back\nIt was ... but at the same time you know I've had a double digit lead for quite a while on her and\nAnd I think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just blew up with the cabinet thing because again her everything she's pretended to be was revealed in one major illustration\nSo and the fair to say she was really big but also\nShe's a former state attorney general she was a former North Dakota attorney general so the idea that you didn't understand fairness or due process or the value of it at a time Laura when the polls in North Dakota\nNever showed ... never showed even thirty percent support for ... for opposing governor but rather short anywhere from sixty to fifty sixty sixty four percent\nFavoring confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so\nIt wasn't like she didn't know where North Dakota and stood so she had a hard time and by the way even ... blaming\nHer ... she changed her her opinion first she believed him and believed\nA progress report then she didn't believe him but believe professor port and then it was not about that at all it was about his demeanor she watched his hearing or you know with the phone turned often noticed his demeanor\nYou know it's just ... it was phony on top of phony and again I think it was just the veil removed because everything you described about North Korea's lord that the independent spirit the rug and is the frontier spirit\nThat's what she has pretended to be\nAnd now all of a sudden it's quite clear that she's really quite a liberal activist\nNo I think again people have been well they've been exposed during the Trump era\nI then media have had a ... mirror um I think raised up to their bias ah and it comes out in different ways but Trump really has driven people\nTo just peroxide dozens of frenzy and fury and upset and and the last always takes it too far they took it too far with Kavanaugh or we don't know what's really going on with this these packages that were sent to Trump's critics but I think people have a lot of theories there um\nAnd I and the leftist they're never satisfied with they get one thing and that's like okay we're going to go to the ... and now we're going to push for universal health care and it's going to be Medicare for all and it's going to be healthcare for illegal immigrants than\nA one lesson that you you know assuming un which looks like you're going to um congressmen in North Dakota or what lesson did you share with others were listening across the country about about this period and politics and\nWhat we need to do to keep this prosperity going obviously the markets had a rough ride last few days but in general things can't be couldn't be going much better on the economy\nNo you know the main lesson I Would share and and you know I was a energy regulator before I went to Congress six years ago in in North Dakota and the the thing I Would share is let\nLet's return to a respect for states ... you know the the these incredible laboratories of democracy called states will show the way and North Dakota chief among them and by the way\nSo will the soul of the states that I Would consider bad states places like California\nNorth Dakota is the second leading producer of oil in the in the country not because we produce more ... necessarily although we have a lot of it obviously in technologies on locked it but but because places like California that have lots of it\nHas screwed it up okay they have a right to do that and and they have a right to have a a cost of living higher than than there are a ... quality of life but\nI I'd say that the thing I'd say is this trust the laboratories of freedom at the state level and that's what President Trump is done he's restored\nYou know states' rights and and that's what ... what do you have a cabinet does on the courts and ... and just trust people at the most basic and local level and that means with their tax dollars that means with regulations it means having a respect for a return to\nCooperative federalism and you're going to find a federal government is far more efficient\nAnd much less not necessary frankly in many cases and you'll have a you know you'll have a much better country in my view\nUm congressman finally or a month at a time but your\nThought on these packages arriving at the residences or offices of Trump's critics\nWell it's my first thought is as a as a member of Congress my first thought is you know here we go again and whether it's you know the left or the right we all need to be more diligent ... and it's frankly it's scary but my my main thought his let's please not jump to conclusions let's\nYou know this is less than twenty four hours oh let's let's calm down let's let the FBI and the other law enforcement agencies do their work and let's see we're all of this leads before we create something you know different than than the reality that it that is behind it all in the meantime it's always a good opportunity for self reflection on\nOn our own individual behavior in what contribution at any we make to this\nThis discourse that's going on this the lack of civility in a without pointing fingers today I think it's a good time for us to look at ourselves\nKnow it's a great way and I'm putting it um

Mattis is expected to send the eight hundred more troops to the southern border\nA defense secretary Mattis is expected to sign a deployment order a that could send eight hundred or more troops to the border with Mexico to help border patrol authorities stopped this caravan the officials tell CNN final details are being worked out including where the troops will come from and their specific tasks\nNot yet clear if part or all of the new deployment will be federally activated National Guard forces or in fact active duty troops the troops will not engage in lethal operations to stop the migrants instead they're expected to provide fencing\nWall materials and other technical support oh that's ... that's going to work at several points along the border where does believe the migrants may try to cross\nThe troops will also provide tents and medical care for border authorities in those areas the troops retain the right\nAh as it says of self defense\nBut border patrol officers will still be the one physically stopping illegal migration\nThe troops are expected to be in position next week this deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort along the border to support border authorities with other technical assistance well what do you make of this\nAh\nMy concern is that because it's that ... they can defend themselves but my concern is that someone in this crowd maybe someone who infiltrate the crowd or someone who wants to cause trouble will try to trigger some type of incident at the border that's what I'm afraid of\nUh and then it will be see you

asylum interview they state they have credible fear they give it a few talking points that are already given to them on the way by immigration activists and then they get waved into the country they get a driven to a bus depot they get a bus ticket and then they're off\nSo why wouldn't all of Guatemala and El Salvador and Honduras\nEventually figure out a way to get to the border\nAnd come into the United states they're not going to be deported unless they commit a violent crime and even then\nThey have sanctuary states and cities who won't hold individuals once they're released so they can be picked up by ice and deported\nSo we're making it an obvious choice for people who want to come to the United states and not go through legal channels we're we're we the people of this country if we don't get leaders in place who do this job right then we're going to see our country ultimately lost\nTo illegal immigration we have now more than twenty two million people\nWho are illegal aliens living in the United states many of them are children who have family ties here they've worked here are some of them criminals the lion share or not but they are here\nAnd they're not going anywhere so the question is to just drop all pretense of a border at this\nPoint I mean you could see the art and it's just easier at this point that we don't have\nA border okay there's no border just come in if you want I don't think most people want\nThat there was a great piece in American greatness dot com about how illegal immigration has hurt black Americans most\nJust published yesterday and the reason for this is that most illegal\nImmigrants overwhelmingly seek work in the low skilled labor market first and because black American a labor force is so disproportionately concentrated in the same low wage sector the same urban areas where illegal immigrants flood into so there's little doubt that there are significant overlap in competition for jobs\nIn this sector of the labor market so given the inordinately high unemployment rate still for low skill black workers it's obvious that the major loser in this competition are low skilled black workers'\nWages are under cut by people who prefer to be paid in cash or we have fix Social Security numbers and African\nAmericans are in other poor Americans are left to deal with\nThis it's wildly unfair uh Bob in Florida on line four and I will tell you this ah Rhonda Santas is the only choice for Florida oh we're going to play the sound from a last night's\nDebate in earlier that demonstrates why Andrew Gillum\nCompletely played with the truth to put it politely about his acceptance of gifts from lobbyists and those who seek political\nFavors are political consideration which that should in of itself that should be disqualified and he's blaming race of course for any question about his ethics so we'll play the race\nCard or a soundbite more coming up let's go to Bob Bob welcome\nThey were you know you bring it up is Andrew Gillum gets elected I'm going to have to leave Florida with but she'll that's that's just the first point but just basic said about all these people are going to be down there at the border walking in people and take them into his all the all those people are called the cheese steaks\nAnd they want to be part of us they're not carrying American flags why are they all\nStates and they want to be part of us are not carrying American flags while they are carrying flashing their own country slugs around they don't want to come here to be Americans do you want to come here to take what we have with it for us\nWell some excellent points are carrying the Honduran flag other blue flags that's a blue wave blue wave of foreign foreign flags\nOr the Democrats and others to throw a ... why haven't authority has given us more information about what's in these packages that's a good question people are asking that Lou Dobbs tweeted about that whether they're a hoax or were actual bombs\nThey were clearly what the timing in the eyes of many at least people think they were clearly designed to influence the election talking about election meddling\nI think uh violence attempted violence attempted intimidation attempt at terrorizing um I mean we we do deserve information probably faster than we are getting it but I think they'd have don't want to copy cats and so forth so I understand that as well\nUh let's go to Theresa Oklahoma Theresa welcome [noise]\nI Would like to hear these who are in favor of the illegal immigration pointedly asked how much of your personal time in your personal many\nDo you spend on humanitarian causes and helping your fellow man I have all ideas it's not very much it's just the soundbite for them and they really have no care for those that are around them they don't have a charity in their hearts it's all about political maneuvering\nThat's a great point well I think again if you if people are willing to sponsor\nIndividuals who apply for legal of entry into the United states sponsor them economically sponsor their education sponsor their learning English and be fit financially accountable for them and also civil reliable\nIf they commit crimes I don't think you'd see many people signing up I mean we know they enforce their their perimeter around their house with alarms and\nFences and gates and and\nServants I mean these people have more more of a perimeter then the White House and they're complaining about our border being enforced or say it's not fair\nI don't know how many people John Case it gets taken into his own uh his own you

was not good enough\nOr and they're blaming him for creating the atmosphere that resulted in these packages being sent\nOne of the president's been blamed for everything gets no knowledge meant for

race that's why Joe Donnelly has tried to become so Trump being when uh you know he never has been always with the liberal side of his party's so uh\nUm I think this is just another example of how they try to distract and ah give him absolutely no credit for all the good things happening\nMaxine Waters said today she responded to these packages saying I ain't scared on she called on the president to take responsibility for the kind of violence sourcing for the first time in different ways well this is a year plus after Steve ... was\nAlmost killed at the hands of a rabid Trump a hater Andy Bernie Sanders supporter and everyone seems to forget what happened in fact I was astounded by the security there would have been dozens dead\n[noise] exactly I mean if it let me of um I think the real exposure to this kind of approach occurred in the capital hearings and all of his challenging Democrats in these red states or the amount of just absolute negative or lives and distortions that\nSchumer's packed step into George Soros and the rest of them are I think it's exposed and ugly underbelly of uh what they're about which is a lack of any message\nA completely obstructing and trying to play down all the good things that are happening with the Trump agenda\nAnd I think voters are going to hold them accountable uh when I think uh\nThe Kavanaugh hearings for who's yours would have been part the point where our race changed in many others and I think enough was enough and they related back to my race and many others I sell something\nFox dead on across the board than negative advertising that just swamped the airwaves and that's because they're afraid of their record\nWell again the Democrats don't want to debate the issues because they have absolutely gone out of the business if they ever were in the business of\nA proposal to actually advance our economy or or grow our prosperity earn force the border I mean they're just not interested in those conversations so they resort to personal attacks and even on issues where they agree on to some extent like Schumer agrees with some of the things that Trump is doing on trade\nHe won't talk about those because you can't give the president any credit for anything anytime anywhere\nNo doubt about it I'll give you a great example in my race I took on the health insurance companies about\nTen years ago to make sure it'll be Affordable Care act the first word of it it never was and it was doomed to fail because you had big government hooked up with big health care is specifically insurance\nAnd I covered preexisting conditions and no cap on coverage and Lara of health premiums flat for ten years and then the absolute truth and it's kind of blown up in the sense that they can't believe a conservative\nActually might out of a solution for what they've you know that's their pivotal issue they think they went on that at all I did was a maid of consumer driven made a transparent\nThe kinds of things that you'd like in free markets and a great result I go to the SAT out I'll talk about that and that's why we're going to win the race against the guy like Joe Donnelly and it's been a career politician that's never had an original idea since he's been there\nI think that again when you when you see how absolutely nutty the left is driven by the Trump progressive results the economy\nThe fact that he's not going to be back on the heels and constantly apologizing I mean that's the that's the type of Republican they liked the best they like someone like a John Case that coups forever back on his heels and apologizing for being a conservative and Trump's is not going to do that and that drives me crazy and he calls them out on and and I think it\nWill often pass the time we had that type of planes speaking politician\nWell I mean a thank goodness that's exactly where I'm coming from an alarm the other thing you're going to get as if a gender really healed than I talk about tax reform but I Do think it's a incumbent upon conservatives are business owners now that you've got more Django in your pocket\nShare it with your employs we've gotten that by\nFurther lowering healthcare costs after keeping them flat for ten years and I've preached out all the time you do that\nI really believe that's the signature piece of legislation that they gambled would not be appreciated would that ten months and people now adding up a more money in their own pocket and if you get business owners like us that ... gone out there in touted tax reform we want to share the benefits with your employees\nPeople quit looking through the false hope of a federal government that the Democrats believe and that hasn't delivered over the last two or three decades and\nReally has put us on the brink of a financial calamity if we don't get more people in there that are going to be able to solve things and not worry about the political ramifications that's why I'm going and there'll be more obvious I think that jump on the bandwagon stick our necks out and\nJoined the uh you know Trump trains so\nA lot of an active and well we cannot wait for election day uh Mike I think you're gonna win this race or the people of Indiana and we have a huge audience in Indiana\nYou got to get out there and vote get everyone you know to get get to the polls vote for an advance thing economy and an America\nThat's growing that's more confident and optimistic and do not go backward we don't want to go backwards to more identity politics more mass illegal immigration got to deal with this with the new Congress close these loopholes\nAnd Mike Brown would be fantastic in the U.S Senate I I just can't wait for you to come to Washington I think you're gonna win this Mike and I'm I'm so glad we're in\nWe're going to win it than that I'm looking forward to it and uh Laura thanks for the support and we're going to finish a hard end of the tape on the six and a can't wait to be a reinforcement for a great agenda\nWhen did you graduate from um H. B. S. by the way\nI did in Seventy eight the bank right outta college a wife and I got married in Seventy six lived in Boston for two years\nYeah my wife and I got married in Seventy six lived in Boston for two years back home town and have been here ever since uh she got a business for forty years in our downtown as are the only job in a race for kids and three of the four kids work in my business with\nA fantastic what a great story I'm Mike Ron here on the lower Ingram show eight five five forty Laura Indiana get out and vote vote early and consider your future your children's future what kind of future do you want for them don't go away\nWe'll be talking with the ...\nAiring this thing\nHere anybody here supporting Joe Donnelly\nVoter is there anyone support Joe Donnelly\nOh I got hands not so much the Democrats here and you guys like ...\nI don't I don't think that like those responses\nThe Laura Ingraham show oh\nYou're listening to Laura Ingraham your health the radio in the mountains giant nine Seventy Katie WM Sean Haney gee I don't\nI have such a sweet animal people wouldn't want to pet\nHim and they cannot get close to him and it would be if my dad didn't want to touch the dog away from me even after we were about she would still stay very bad and he\nDoes your dog itch scratch stink worship like crazy come to diner bike for help\nI N O T the fatty I think the digestive enzymes that are cooked out regular dog food\nAnd it was definitely worth trying after he started smelling normal really kind of dawn", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Show Low", "day": "25"}
