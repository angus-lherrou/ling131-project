this resonates with you at all you see I think well I Will share my theory with you in a moment this is John Burma reacting to the same bite you just heard\nShare my theory with you in a moment this is John Burma reacting to the same bite you just heard President Trump saying I Love when this guy mark who's running for Congress in uh in Montana\nOr I Love any body slam that reporter and yeah he was charged your body so I guess a reporter came up to them was abused will be four bodies finally got thought Trump was tickled\nBy it and said so on the stump John Berman said there's\nNothing like making a joke out of body slamming a reporter with another journalist was dismembered his fingers cut off three weeks ago and the administration has been dealing with that damage control and try to provide cover for the Saudis frankly that very day\nAnd that night the president's impulses to joke about an unprovoked attack on a reporter sent Jacobs by this August\n... he's talking about Greg ... a ... G A GM forte who's running for ah for Congress out there in Montana\nUm does this Walsh with you does this negate the mobs somehow out there a swarming Capitol Hill in your community in marches and rallies breaking windows antifa\nThat whole ah explosion of violence and hate we're seeing\nThe congressmen in a disagreement with a reporter who slams them down equate with these mobs were saying by the way that happened back months and months ago\nAnd is Trump's side comment I I think it's just a joke I and and to add to this\nNot unlike Lesley Stahl which we we decompose ... or ... or a demystify that interview written decompose we broke it down for you last week earlier in the show and\nLesley Stahl unwittingly I Believe no was really used by the president as as a stand in for the rest of the media\nAnd I think when ... when the media begins its echo and they stop having original thoughts but begin to echo one another the public utterly tuned to them out in fact this is why I Believe so many Democrats gave the president a second look\nBecause they said wait a minute wait if all these people are against him and they're all saying the same thing what is this guy really doing and they looked closely\nThat may be what's happening now as we approach these midterms I see some of these polls everything tightening up that naturally happens in the mid term\nOr will there be a Trump effect let's go to cliff New Jersey what do you think Clinton what move do you what is moving due to the polls what's the issue\nWhat is moved me to the polls is that the Democrats I Believe or behind this march and I think that all you talking heads\nShould find out who's paying for their bathrooms who's paying to treat them coming north and you're going to find those Democrats and then publish it\nAnd that total change\nMhm you're talking about the caravan which we're going to get into in a moment Pat Buchanan joining us uh yeah that caravan is moving up and look\nI'm there is certainly a an ecosystem let's put it that way there is an ecosystem of support for this caravan\nIndividuals who fund the housing the food the legal services for members of this carbon and not only that Caribbean but more\nI I don't know if you saw the story the other day Lutheran refugee services as well as ah the Catholic migration refugees services came up with a statement demanding that we'd be more welcoming to not only these ... but anyone seeking to come to the United states\nOf course they get hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants every year that had been stymied by the Trump policies you see as his contract that the number of refugees allowed into the country their coffers have emptied\nSo they have a material financial interest in this and it's hard to think that these dramatic displays the people\nCrowding the border and that's what's happening now by the way apart from the caravan we're seeing a surge of the border and it's not individuals it's families because they know that their ticket in you have a kid it's a ticket into the country and they can't refuse you and I can't separate you\nSo you have a catch and release policy happening where they're coming across the border we're taking their names of releasing them into mainland American\nYour thoughts on that is that a concern at all\nWill get into all of that with Pat Buchanan cliff thank you very much for the call out with also share some other uh reports with you hear how the Republicans might be able to hang on to the house it's close but it's a possibility Raymond Oreo sitting in for

here my new book and the killing series is killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals on earth it's about Nazi evil and those who enabled\nThe buckles on us Nazi hunters risk their lives to track down mass killers like Adolf Eichmann were protected by ruthless force there is a reason why the killing books are sold more than ... million copies so I Hope you check out killing the ss it's well worth your time\nOr are you worried your identity could be held hostage you should be because ransomware does exactly that loses Tom Kelly suit your biology care making every American safer from the effect divided up as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from ransom where is the backup your computer often\nI think the ... to ... in my view the Democrats have no agenda I mean the economy isn't very good shape extremely good shape unemployment under four percent and but when the economy is good the economy is usually not the issue something else becomes issue\nA and I think that the that the Democrats are really they're pushing this ... thing and and the the murder of him and this tremendously lurid tale of murder and the consulate in Turkey\nI think too you know they're they they have no agenda and they're seizing upon this and tried to attach it to to Trump but this is a what exactly for him and\nHis the Democratic party's great agenda what is their contract with America what are they going to do or pretend they're going to do since the only house they can get I Believe is the one house of representatives what is their agenda they don't have one the big issue in this campaign is Trump\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is the he is he is the centerpiece and\nUh now you're seeing some pollsters saying by internal polls are the president's approval ratings are are surging\nAnd that the Republicans could squeak out just enough seats to hold onto the majority if that doesn't happen if the Democrats take control of the house even by a slim majority what do you think happens what will the next\nYear look like what's wrong [laughter] I'm sure it'd help [laughter]\nBut now you're very gay shouldn't you know as far as the eye and say anything\nThat can enact anything they can't you know we revise Obamacare and send it over to Republican Senate then send it down through President Trump at the White House so they can't do anything so they're going to investigate everything\nThey will be looking into his tax returns are going to be looking into any financial connections with Saudi Arabia that go to get the Boulder report there'll be looking into alleged you know alleged a obstruction of justice and the Russia investigation all of these things in New York\nThe southern district of New York will be investigating and the grand jury here in DC\nSo I think that's all that they've got going for the you know but they don't want to raise the real issue you've wondered if you ask him deeply what you believe it ought to be they would say you know the goal here is impeach Trump and lock him up but you go ahead and announced that is your goal and you shrink\nYour base your democratic base down to it's hard core which is insufficient to win the house of representatives to the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue\nYou don't get the broad based sort of the ballots and you live over in northern Virginia you know they've got a fighting chance on this congressional district here right if you did something like that it would kill it\n... that I Want to play something you you just mentioned the impeachment the I word impeachment uh last night\nThey do a roar go debate over three games a NATO Rourke um\nWho is Ted Cruz's challenger in Texas did a town hall meeting and he had this to say [laughter]\n[noise] and you said in July that you would as a member of the house right now vote to impeach hadn't changed your mind I haven't according to the constitution that mean that the president has committed the crime that tree than primary bribery or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those you think the president had committed\nI wouldn't like in a impeachment to an indictment there there is nothing there to proceed with a trial for a full vetting of the facts and to make the best informed decision in the interests of this country and our future\nYour reaction to that that does that help him and help democratic candidates across the gun it\nStill didn't hear the charge was\nExactly he died that\nDoes that help it doesn't help that are over ... it was in a and veterans got his own problems he's not or ten voyage down with sixty two million in the back I think mhm but I you know no I don't think it helps him I think what federal work it seems to me he's running short of heart left\nOr very far left for Texas a course in Harlem for the Democratic party\nI'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't see himself as Abe Lincoln who lost the Senate race in Eighteen fifty eight and came back to win the presidency and the Eighteenth shifting\nYeah well aside from height to there's very little commonality there that I think yeah I I don't remember honest Abe on a skateboard but maybe I missed that chap ah you'll find a little I don't I don't know what I'm going to ... I'm a corner you and\nPut you on the record year do you think the Republicans hold the house and Senate going into these midterms where do you think the populace is right now you know the the the the people out there who are elected term\nI think the I think over all that you would have to say that the Democrats are probably going to get to twenty three votes to take the house I mean that would be a dramatic victory over the photo Republicans and I think the Republicans are favored by even more to hold on to the Senate\nOr they've got to lose a number of races where they're hit right now to lose the Senate and so I Would say it's going to be a Republican Senate dealing with Supreme Court nominees and appellate court nominees and it could be a Democratic House with all these investigations all risk but I don't I don't necessarily believe\nIt it's a bad thing to have Nancy Pelosi's crowd and in charge of the house and doing all these things with the American people I don't think you're going to be enthusiastic about especially if they've got great foreign domestic problems\nThat you can always great to hear from you thank you for joining us and we will be in touch OK you take it easy Randy thank you that and er into old you are listening what is driving you to the polls this November are you is is there an issue it was the one idea\nThat you could not lose and you felt you had to\nYeah that you could not lose and you felt you had to move on um I keep hearing it was capital others say they're concerned about the border still others say this mob mentality or you know we're going to play you a little bit\nIn a little bit with the president said during that rally last night what the challenge really is stay right there eight five five forty Laura we'll get to

posters at NYU there were all these little these little violence ... violence so we we drove recently called in the pansies anyway um tell me where we stand in these midterms Matt\nUh when you look at the polling data a real clear politics has the the generic ballot Republicans down seven points does that mean anything when we're this close at this late date\nYeah it does a great question um you know basically that generic ballot has been as high as fourteen Fifteen points a CNN poll\nTen days ago or ... or so that show that that why what you're seeing is that in almost all the polling that they are now that's a that's a common thread that a generic ballots start off very bad for Republicans because their car a lot of big cities and quite frankly they're calling a lot of people who aren't at work\nWhich don't tend to be Republicans are and as you get close election they got a better idea of actually oh we're never raining in mid term it's like you know roughly twenty five percent of the people vote so attorney ... ... that's the real tricky question\nYup well here's here's the thing I'm there is this other CBS battleground poll that has Democrats up three in the toss up\nDistricts now if you're only up three and a tossup districts that within the margin of error and in the Trump total era I I I have to look at that and say this could go anyway this this is yeah I like to call right\nI was in Florida for a speech this week I had a woman came up to be in the lobby the hotel\nI've noticed is a clean story don't worry as you said um she said\nHey I I just want you to know I never voted in the mid term I'm so bad about the ... street capping off I'm voting for the first time it it it ... this is this this is the silent vote are not going to get picked up and all\nI think it's absolutely a dynamic that's Eighteen similar to how it was in doubt sixteen there's a lot of Democrats who are looking at their own already\nYou know a Gallup poll came out rented that fifty seven percent Democrats are comfortable with the idea of being a socialist party the Democratic party gifting becoming much more radicalized that means that in the swing districts that you're talking about that um you know the the the whole\nThe swing districts that you're talking about that uh you know the the the whole question about what the socialist\nPeople like or cause you Cortez et cetera uh it's really wake you a lot of people up a normal folks countries day maybe I Do\nYeah and I I also think when you see these explosions as we just played from uh NYU last night attacking a of of a statesman like Henry Kissinger he's Ninety five years old and when you see people yeah\nQuite mental that is what I thought you were going to tell me about the woman who came up to you in Florida Man I thought she was going accuse you of being work on them up you know when you see that kind of crazy explosive behavior toward people a that's a big turtles in middle America and really anywhere in America I think I think it's a huge journal tell me about the Trump effect\nHe is he is dumping all over the country including in Arizona tonight we're going to be covering that live at ten pm on Fox\nUm what is the Trump effect has he nationalized what was a local race a few weeks ago\nWell first of all it's just work better president would stand by a nominee like ... and it's a story that our president\nWould basically go all over the country this aggressively in a nonstop fashion to campaign for all these candidates and I do agree with you I think it's nationalize that they can erupt from\nEverything is about Trump even if they try to make it about Trump he's too big of a personality he's too big of a player in our politics so yes it's about trumpet Republicans run from it because they don't like a portion of what he does or big state\nBut voters know the difference that down from the one guy they don't think that every Republican is Trump they know how Trump is and I don't know why some of these Republicans have so much trouble just be yourself be who you are authenticity is on the rise of politics and that's a good thing\nIs the reality the Democrats don't have any stars with Trump's magnitude they really can't\nCompete and there's no leader and there's no articulated governing vision that's the other problem with these people um what are your concerns though Matt should the Democrats wrest control of the house what will that look like\nWell they're going to start persecuting people like my wife worked for Donald Trump they're going to go every White House staffer again they're going to try to bring people down to their whole idea of the mob mentality that taken over the Democratic party will try to dabble power house all the about trying to get\nAir quotes corruption corruption\nEverybody that solves Trump they're going to try to think strategy every truck which Donald Trump is agenda is so obnoxious and toxic that we have to destroy anybody associated with it and it's going to be a very\nVery harmful and long two years for the country I feel like we're at our website already I don't know what's gonna happen if the

Democrats should have it seems to me come up with a governing agenda I don't know why they didn't take Newt Gingrich's playbook and run with it they should have had their own contract with America saying look\nThe Trump years we can't stand what he's doing but we're going to do X Y and Z they didn't do that they have no what are you going to do you're going to run against joblessness\nYou're going to run against high wages you're going to run against high benefits businesses growing small businesses regulations coming all what are you going to do well I'll tell you what Kamala Harris was announcing a five hundred dollar tax credit\nShe's caught Trump fever\nSo when Democrats are coming around who your way of thinking even though they try to dress it up you once you've won and that's why I think Trump is nationalizing this election and trying to keep his agenda and his voice at the center of it Terry Alabama does that work for you and what are you focused on during these midterms\n... exactly right I think Democrats not look like they're evil\nYou look at what they can't I Can't do a great read capital a young age right now because you could go back they\nFall while I'm In that group and we can go back that your state for a while and it\nBut we lost you there I think we're losing your there Terry but I got a point and I think you know to to to too many the Supreme Court has become the holy of Hillary's you just almost a high church too to some on the left\nWhere they see that as the ultimate instrument of control and social change\nAnd deprived of it they feel they've somehow lost something that's era treatable so this was a major below even though a Brett Kavanaugh is a down the middle of the roads straight down the middle jurists she's not a radical he's not he's not\nThe next battle is going to be the battle royale you want to see blood on the floor come to Washington for the next round of confirmation hearings when Ruth Bader Ginsburg gives up her seat\nAnd Trump appoints maybe a woman a conservative woman to that seat or more a a a rich restrictive jurist one who reads the law and interprets that appropriately\nAnd doesn't make it up if you get a let's say Amy Coney Barrett\nGod help us all I'm leaving I'm going back to New Orleans\nI mean it it it it will be what we saw from Kavanaugh will be a cheap warm up\nFor what awaits that nominee thanks for the call Terry or we're going to take it very quick break we'll be back in moments Laura Ingraham show continues what are you focused on this mid term and and\nJust do these
