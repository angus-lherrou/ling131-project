on\nFox or something I don't know we played it on Fox maybe it was CNN a congressman Gary Monday who also I think they're trying to downplay this\nWhere they were trying to downplay the impeachment after they've seen these polls and\nSo this congressman cycle that's not why my people in my district are saying they're not saying that they're clamoring for impeachment of Kavanaugh see I thought they actually tried to do that because it'll just me and the Republicans will smash them back just smash them back was that Steve ... he was on\nHe's well maybe he's more of a straight shooter he's the host on MSNBC and\nHe's looking at these numbers independents are moving toward Republicans and Cavanaugh is a big part of it\nI Can't falling behind by eleven points in one poll last week and then eleven quaint get came before she announced her opposition to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court show again if you if you lose a cabin or senior Democrats right at that point you got to pick up in Arizona that's doable you got to pick up in a vat of that's doable\nBut then you're going to need like a Tennessee or a Texas also the polling news not encouraging for Democrats

minor minor ... I don't know what it was the other high jinx guys who can't hold people accountable for things they do in their\nTwenties I mean things they do in their Seventeen yet but things you do in your twenties and no no no no that does come on baby do is just he's ... you can't hold on to any other the standard is it do it is real first name is Robert Francis they'll get Robert Francis\nO'Rourke can't can't get more Irish so but it's fatal\nAll that he was called that as a baby or a little boy I guess and then it stuck why called deem a demon dog but um when he when he was like for a promotion I'm not that he's not going to say well the dog is running\nLike a I when I see the matrix it has a dog doing is that is nicknamed the demon dog so we called dog\nHe's not going to say OK call me dog 'cause that's what my mother called me right it's just that when he's gonna do\nYou're listening to the lower income show a five five forty Laura ... I'd say last night like I felt\nThat at the White House with the the energy of the people the energy of the old establishment even like Mitch McConnell I've never seen Mitch McConnell more happy in my entire life ever never seen him smile like this I've never seen him better than he has been over the last three weeks never seen Lindsey Graham better and you know why\nThey're doing what the people want and they're United with the president that is a good thing\nThat's great that's that's fantastic I praise people when they deserve it and they deserve it\nWhat I think this is going for us is ... drilling shot that we are not been able to figure out how to achieve and it was\nWe were literally hunger is all ... all of us would try to get in our places to go to our homes over there who are basically almost ... and the whole\nWell that's it that's by the way that's Mitch sounding excited\nAbout them on adrenalin that these are natural and he's been yeah that's what he's on an adrenalin rush ... maybe Nikki Haley just guy had an allergic reaction to that little ear cup they put on her ear for the translation of simultaneous translation they wouldn't provide her with a hyper allergenic ear cups so she has to just\nI really think it's time for someone else well here's a story I was talking about earlier Trump Administration disowned hit Nikki Haley's plan for a un meeting on Iran\n... September seventeenth during the Kevin crush\nThe Trump Administration is disarming a plant presented by UN ambassador Nikki Haley for President Trump to hold a meeting at the un that was next week a couple of weeks ago focused on Iran according to diplomats familiar with the meeting Haley had announced that Trump\nWould share a meeting on the world's biggest diplomatic stage quote to address Iran's violations of international law in general instability around so throughout the entire Middle East region\nFocusing the meeting on Iran drew immediate concerns from us allies who believe that the topic would expose sharp disagreements among the U.S Britain and France\nOver the twenty Fifteen Iran nuclear deal which Trump unilaterally withdrew from in may other U.S officials also voiced concerns that an article of UN Charter would allow Iran to participate in the meeting because it's quote a party to the to the dispute under consideration\nRaising the prospect of an awkward in contentious stand up between Trump\nAnd representative of Iran\nSeems like the Trump Administration was right about this one stay there\nAnd you're listening to more anger on your health the radio addiction on a mountain top giant nine Seventy KB WM show also Katie J I Hope\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments that Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nIt's called ratio and here's how it works with ratio you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part of rates go down\nYou get the lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nYou're more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now Judy power has rink Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage rich nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also ranked is highest in the nation for mortgage servicing ratio\nCan you can you can you using her phrase can we segment some of that James so I can listen to it again maybe I'm just a little ... right now because I haven't slept enough maybe I'm just a little tired last night was a big night\nNo it was a very I mean I'm going to I I had to put the champagne glass down and then go do my show last night\nAnd we were celebrating at the White House it was fantastic everybody who helped Brett was there all the justices were there everybody was there who\nYou know who who really was instrumental in helping this nomination this confirmation his law clerks his old law clerks who helped it was great great to see everybody and maybe I'm just a little tired so I Can't follow the really an an incisive logic of costs the court as\nWell I think a lot of it has to do with changing our strategy around got pregnant you know there's a lot of inside baseball and inside the beltway as you know you can only hit that term thrown around\nA\nOkay these just asked you what are you going to do and she answers well we're changing our governance strategy is inside baseball\nI'm a forgive me but she at least what I've heard she seemed like a very attractive person and maybe she's a very nice individual I'm sure she's a nice person\nShe got people to go out and vote vote for probably a nice person I don't understand what you're saying we need more organizers okay you'll be in government you will be in there\nBut you see all goes back to what I'm saying they have NO PLAN for how to improve this economy it's all about creating the new social construct\nTo lay on top of the u._s. understanding as it has to be like\nAll abortion all gender fluidity higher taxes open borders legalize everyone legalized drugs pot all\nAll of it has to be foisted on the American people [noise]\nSo like Obama she never really will leave the organizing world\nThere are very few organizers will Congress and I do think that organizers operate differently if all different kind of strategy\nYeah they they're they have enough money for mommy and daddy to just walk around with these profane signs and whale and moan and claw at things like the Supreme\nCourt big brass door that Supreme Court video how many have you thought it was as funny as I did so last\nNight on the angle every time I kicked off a Trump agenda item winning agenda item Everytime I did that we played a snippet of of the protesters clawing at the door to make a point the better things are getting in America the more than happy they are\nBut the ... I just found that to be a scream by the way there are a lot of\nDifferent angles that people got what their cell phone videos of the protesters clawing up the door so you can see like the the hundred and twenty pound guy\nLooks like he's wearing skinny jeans he's banging then you go you see the woman there's like this this liberal woman who's like trying to pry open each these doors if I walked through them enough times I Know\nThese doors probably way their their ceremonial doors they probably way I don't know four hundred pounds their giant\nClawing at the door is trying to open them this is kind of a metaphor though isn't it for what they're they're trying to\nTheir clawing and banging at the more traditional understanding of America [laughter]\nShould America down\nThis is not shutting the traditional understanding of America down about ... ... they know they're not going to shut the Supreme Court down scores of course going to go on and heard oral arguments this morning they continue to go on\nBut it's about shutting down you your voice intimidating you so you're you're back in the corner of an elevator it's about shutting down this idea of traditional families\nIt's about shutting out the idea of understanding of American history shut it down pulling statues down with ropes and the middle of the night it's all a piece of what they are and what they become\nAnd its public schools it's private schools and colleges\nIt's indoctrination it's the mass migration of the country of people who are here illegally\nWho are not brought up to understand what makes this country so great in our in our history\nTo understand why this is so important to preserve our country you really do have to understand why how it was so hard to founded this country the American founding against all odds we founded this great republic\nIn the term rent tremendous sacrifice of our framers the original are signatories of our constitution great sacrifice I made\nBut if you don't understand any of that then\nYou kinda just arrived here in America it's yeah it's it can make money here boys is so great can make money\nIn China make money and you know Qatar and make money a lot of\nPlaces and why is this place so great why is it why is it special so we can see what we saw over the weekend\nProtesters fine ... that protest is is is welcome under our First Amendment I'm Talking about the way you protest the weather is dignified or undignified\nNow we're not seeing a lot of Rosa Parks out there today we're not seeing the classic non violent classy way of protesting this is a God or approach to protest\nTo run senators out of restaurants go to their homes is that going too far\nI think that is the rules that there are a lot of people who are very very much ah I'm motivated but what is going on ... because ... and all that and say come forth in our country\nShe went to the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez school of logic apparently or\nHer on her own uh went to hers or Alexander I went to her own knows I Can't tell which so in other words Mazie Hirono God help you in Hawaii Mazie Hirono wants more of this\nPeople people are upset that I keep saying this but I'm going to say it again imagine if conservative activists\nKamala Harris James imagine what would happen Kamala Harris gets cornered in an elevator\nYet her and she's she's backed up into the corner of an elevator imagine what they would say what's the life what do they say it was anti women it was intimidating it was harassment\nThey would claim that all Republicans who didn't denounce that type of\nOf a a behavior and conduct that you were anti women and it would be a thousand percent Trump's fault it would be you know you think you'll be all Trump salt in this case why don't we hold Democrat leaders are responsible for these type of protest they should be held responsible they're not condemning it\nAnd and they had their moment where they said well maybe Maxine Waters one a little too far that lasted for like five milliseconds but they hold Trump responsible for Charlottesville\nI said they're responsible the Democrat leadership are responsible for the less the is running the asylum in these protests\nAnd teeth and all of it\nEight five five forty Laura will take a break a lot more to get through Nikki Haley resigns as the UN ambassador Trump and Haley ah are
