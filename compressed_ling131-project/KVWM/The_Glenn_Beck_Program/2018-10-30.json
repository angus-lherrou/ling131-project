taken off the less connotation a feeling anti Semitism hate even violence do you\nThink that is fair and do you want to clarify what nationalism means\nTo me I don't have to clarify ms I Love the country and means I'm fighting for the country I look at two things ... the national is I'm somebody that wants to take care of our country because for many many years you know there's better than anybody power leaders have been more worried about the world and I have about the United states and they leave us in a mess\nWhen the president chose that one nationalistic kidding thought about it very hot and it is wrapped up and they've connotations of a sudden this aggressiveness of dominance of one race on one country over another\nIs that the way you view the word nationalist when you hear Trump talking nationalism do you think Trump is as the BBC's Katty Kay saying there and MSNBC Trump is using the quote dog whistle\nOkay oh you racist out their vote for me is that what he's saying [noise] remember that\nTerrific book written um and it was just it just came out recently by your um has any called the virtue of nationalism\nAnd his point is that he's a conservative Israeli writer and a political therapy Faris and his point is that\nNationalism as properly understood this post World war two or twenty first century nationalism\nIs merely stating that country's deserve to have\nA their focus on themselves in order to keep their own national identity and culture intact so Japan is Japan nationalist will gas because Japan has tight immigration but they also believe in the Japanese culture that there's something unique and beautiful about it\nAnd they're not constantly passing judgment on others but for Japan they want to preserve their history their culture their language all those things that they think make Japan special\nAnd I think for Trump and and this applies to other countries as well but for Trump the same thing for him what makes our country wonderful is our freedom our liberty\nAn includes the free speech freedom to worship right to bear arms all the things that we have guaranteed in our bill of rights our constitution\nBut the last has to grab onto these terms if Obama said the word nationalist and explained it as Trump is they wouldn't have any problem with it but it's Trump Trump represents an existential threat to mushy headed liberalism they know it he beat them\nThey have to take away the rhetorical devices and weapons and issues that Trump has successfully used against the left to expose the left they have to remove those topics from his discussion if they can do that they believe they can beat him\nHe is and I let that happen all the second migrant migrant care of and has entered Mexico according to Fox that just broke here we go so Trump can't talk about that either can't talk about the assaults on Mexican police I guess either okay\nOh let's go to James in Florida on line three James welcome\n... hey Laura let me tell you that was the best interview I've ever seen the president thank you nice job last night at all the points it must have been very exciting for you to be in front of a bank us today\nBut I I have to tell you that this is a joke this is another thing from the left they knew this was coming these people only here for economic reasons everybody knows it and the fact that he wants to stop this anchor baby goes right along with it I Wish she'd signed that executive order today\nWell again we're going to get into the birthright citizenship issue another issue that the leftist completely botched and some Republicans have totally botched is well we've been talking about this issue for almost Twenty years\nAh All right we're going to all your calls a congressman Dave Brat is also going to join us he's in the fight of his political life\nI remember brat came onto the scene when he unseated Eric Cantor a this is back in a twenty fourteen and now he's up against the far left a woman who uh think she's going to be able to take that seat because of the redistricting that's happened\nA but we're going to ah we're going to fight to the finish on this one is well

a very dangerous new direction or that are no Americans want to move in that direction and so what we've got some huge challenges healthcare you know they want the Bernie Sanders thirty two trillion dollar socialist healthcare pays ... ending Medicare is you know it\nDouble tax rates personal and corporate\nThat put you an automatic recession depressions so that that's the direction it it's just like you said it forward versus backward\nWell here's what I see happening on the left and\nI Would imagine that young people don't like to be told what they can and cannot speak about like issues that they just are not allowed to to address any longer because if you say you want our borders and force then you're for a mass shooter [laughter] I mean is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard but this is what the left\nIs absolutely trying to do they are trying to take your shoes off the table\nThat Trump connects on and one of them that you connected on early on and you were way ahead of the curve on this\nWas the issue of immigration or the sense that we have a sovereign right a God given right to determine who comes in our country and why they come in and set the terms and set the rules and the left though once\nThey want they want is kind of take those issues away and I neutralized tromp on the campaign trail and probably neutralize people like you\n[noise] [noise] yeah and that won't work immigration you know it's Seventy to eighty percent issue the Democrats are being told\nOr not to mention it right by all the\nHead honcho there's an article in the hill yesterday the Democrats are just sarcastically\nCaving on these issues and just saying that well we don't have we don't have a party platform to run on why starting out there that cynical they know they have not offered a platform on any issues in immigration is I think the issue especially in my district and so yeah you're right that the kids were loading up with Twenty one trillion in debt\nAnd then catch and release you know these are all children have got to cross the border right like the cat which are good people in there but there are other people that have not been vetted at all or any family that comes in with two kids that's twenty six thousand dollars to go to school for one year\nAnd who's paying that bill rights and you run those basic issues by that by\nThe taxpayer and by the kids and say you're paying off is that you know we're putting all of this on your credit card you're going to pay it off\nAnd we don't do a good enough job communicating to the next generation or the problem is they're going to have if you revert to a socialist you know do grow the economy I taught college for Twenty years last the Obama period a high end college graduates couldn't go out by the job and now it's just a day\nAnd night that the economy is just\nAnd the kids are getting multiple job offers wants to just it was really interesting it's just the job mobility people are leaving their jobs because they're that confident than go get a better job\nIt's been a long time since that's happened and so are the kids are moving up the the wage chain you know it it it's just great news and so we what we got to share that with everybody\nBut there is a group that has just dug in on the resistance right we're offering result\nThey want to resist like you said right they want to have enlisted best vacations they want to page the president impeach cabin all my opponent won't come down on any of\nThat of course not so what is she saying hey I mean you know the question out asking his final final days why why she hiding well why is that why is your challenger\nMitt spanberger hiding on these key issues in the the voters in Virginia and deserve to know the truth about what she really believes about the changing nature of of the state the the economic burdens being laid at the feet of the taxpayers of Virginia\nBut she's answering in these glib cliches\nIn bromide to make us every everyone's going to feel good but that's not how the real world works she needs to answer these questions why she hiding I Would keep saying that where is she why she hiding\nRight right one of the things she hired and came out months ago and of course the mainstream press a let her hide but she worked at a a Saudi\nA school she calls it an embassy school the only problem with that there is a U.S government shut it down under Chuck Schumer and congressman Israel because as anti Semitic anti American anti woman\nThere was a bar right what hobbies fundamentalists Saudi training school that produced terrorists and after the fact\nShe says she still proud that you work there but like you said if you're proud of it the fact that you worked at this school that is they hate school then why didn't you put that on your resume she's hiding everything she's hiding or policy platform she's hiding her position on healthcare immigration taxes\nShe won't talk about in public because you know they're losers with the people of the seventh district in Virginia\nI Want to play a ... I Want to play a sound bite me this is from Joe Lockhart Clinton's old press secretary again words in subjects that they want to take off the table before the midterm vote let's listen\nHe's still talking about global is um which is a dog whistle for a for a semi he's still going after George Soros another dog whistle for anti Semite\nDonald Trump doesn't change um he might have moments where he reads the paper in front of him but he will change I mean if if if the largest slaughter of American Jews in American history\nWon't change his attitude is rhetoric nothing will well I got it yeah it\nIt it sounds different from Joe ... someone who was on CNN with Allison camera on a uh but I don't think that was ... and that's the sense that you can't say the word\nGlobal list what why why not I mean they're the lessons use the word global is plenty of time but again they are the ... one day if they want to take the college speech code mentality in voice it upon society at large in that way they fix all the debates\nYeah the the left is very good and this goes back decades right they uh training manuals they try to take your strength away from you\nTake away your strongest points right my strongest point is Iran as an outsider I voted that way right my small business score is a hundred percent and uh I have the support of all the the small business folks across my district that set or I'd sit around all the county\nAll the small business folks across my district center I sit around all the county\nAnd so they're taught to talking points for me is I don't get around and not being paid off the farm but because of an Obamacare vote and so\nYou're you're right that talking point is right they're very smart on how to get the language they do not want to have a policy if you're out your window Ninety that they have to ship that off to the politics of personal destruction they have a hard time with me 'cause I went to seminary that no I Love everybody\nAnd so they have a hard time shifting around that way on me and so now they're just running crazy commercials\nThat you know the biggest thing I Can't believe with the national media ... ... it's it's just horrible the house voted for pre existing conditions ripe to help people with preexisting condition\nIt passed the house and that's the number one issue the leftist running on saying we're against it after that was the

circumvent all our our our legal process to become citizens and then to use some of the benefits discussion ...\nYou are listening to the lower income show a five five forty Laurie I think I I think a lot of folks in the media believe Trump stepped in it when he made that comment about birthright citizenship in that interview he did with ... [noise]\nI think again the media really miss out for hand where the American people are on this I think most Americans are probably shocked to hear that illegal aliens living in the United states\nHave a child and that child becomes an automatic so I think most people they don't focus on these issues are off doing other things Trump all of a sudden brings\nWell they don't focus on these issues are off doing other things Trump all of a sudden brings it up like why and then you go to U. K. doesn't allow it Spain doesn't allow it France doesn't allow it Canada does allow it it's other than the United states the only really advanced economy that allows this bingo automatic citizenship\nAnd Trump brings it up and it's uh we'll see where it goes but I think I think it it just as a matter of common sense setting aside constitutional\nA language which it does not require a what the left claims that requires\nA it's it's open to debate it's a fascinating subject I joining us\nNow Mark Krikorian also get to your calls eight five five forty Laura a Mark Krikorian is going to sell some of this for us Mark I'm\nThe president brings this up ah yesterday and\nThe media there have love in response are basically saying oh how dare he how dare he dog whistle dog whistle\nOnce again\nYeah well I mean that's to expect and quite frankly but uh the president is I mean I think this is a smart move I haven't seen the executive order hasn't been issued yet but what I assume it is is that he is interpreting\nA clause within the fourteenth amendment\nIn such a way as to not automatically give citizenship to kids born to tourists or falling students were illegal aliens\nThat phrase a it's complicated to get on the radio but it's called subject to the jurisdiction thereof that phrase is ambiguous Supreme Court has never ruled on it there's never been any legislation saying that's what this means so it's perfectly appropriate in fact long overdue\nFor the president to say this is my interpretation\nWhat's gonna happen if somebody is going to sue\nIt's going to end up before the Supreme Court and then we'll have a ruling one way or the other about whether the kids born to tourists\nUm our or illegal aliens are automatically citizens or not and depending on how they rule then whoever doesn't like it can you know try to do something to advocates to ... or something but it but the only way to get this process even start it\nIs for the president to do this issue an executive order and what it'll mean is that the state department won't issue passports for instance to kids born to Chinese burst tourists good women who um and then somebody will sue Raphael you will find one of them they'll sue ... will be a lawsuit that this is\nUm you know whatever you think about this issue with whatever you think the policy should be this is the smart way to heat up the issue so we can move it along in the process of\nYou know public debate because all we're doing now they're saying well I think that this senator and Eighteen sixty eight men X. and somebody says no this other senator in Eighteen sixty eight meant why when the amendment was passed\nThat's pretty sterile that's not getting us anywhere this\nReally is I think moving the ball forward regardless of what you think of the issue I think this is smart move on the part of the prison\nI completely agree we have to get this thing resolved I mean this Long Beach birth motels a Florida birth motels the Chinese the Russians and Mexican south Americans it is becoming a booming business just in Russia alone\nOr and they get around all the other restrictions on on what we want from Russian uh investment in the United states by suddenly you have a kid was a passport and your golden yeah your gold and\nGet as as a kid has a passport you can go to a for instance UC Berkeley at um lower rates that's one of the reasons they're people from Korea and turkey who do this\nAs a way of um helping their kids dodged the draft once they get older because they can just hop on a plane and go to the United states and then they don't have as all it's a retirement plan for some people because you know you're having a kid at thirty well by the time your kid is an adult and has a job and is working\nIf uh you know you want you can sponsor you for immigration so that when you're finished working will retire in the United states I mean there are a bunch of different reasons people do this\nNone of which is in the

strong\nAh and despite the fact that consumer confidence optimism small business unemployment all of these numbers are incredible what are you finding out there on the trail and could be a media conclusion about this uh this type of district be wrong\nOh absolutely it's wrong because the leftist jacked up but so are we and you'd always jacked up the taxpayers are getting screwed in New Jersey for years and they do it and they understand that and the state has gotten more and more on affordable with every democratic governor frankly the Democratic legislature around here Jack it up taxes every chance they get so\nUh that's our message or much let's continue to grow this economy let's cut taxes ah people know that a Democrat from New Jersey is not going to Congress to cut their tax is just not going to happen it doesn't happen in Trenton it's not going to happen in Washington and\nAnd that's the distinction were drawn and people respond to that because it's their felt experience

bigger sacrifices and is to keep our country strong and free and so if that's what we have to do this year to help our country and that's what we're going to do\nWhen you look at\nThe national debate

that you bring through a territory wherever they are let's not say they're all good people or by people they're just comment on their own people\nWherever you bring that kind of massive amount of people through any territory\nAnd it's dangerous they're going to take over the jobs that are going to take over it's dangerous thing everything's going to change mhm all the products of anything

pillows called eight hundred\nA pull at politicians and getting help and comfort from groups within the United states who also had been aiding uh these masses of people as well so there's a\nComplicated Web of facilitators behind the scenes a who's who put the word out that it's as long as you get into this group Katie you'll be protected because there's strength and numbers\nBeing part of a caravan does not give these special rights [noise]\nUm but our message is simple and our message is clear we will not allow a large group and I've authorized migrants to enter the U.S and unsafe or unlawful manner we've already seen these groups for say break immigration laws in Mexico and Guatemala and quite violent and dangerous tactics that you mentioned\nImmigration laws and Mexico and Guatemala they've employed violent and dangerous tactics it'd be mentioned against both Mexican and Guatemala and immigration security teams the secretary made clear last week that\nWe will ensure that our men and women on the front lines of protect and defend it and the president has done so in calling up the military and ensuring that we have the resources we need to not only secure the border but defend our men and women on the front lines\nHave you I'm prepared already a and homeland security with the chance that the president was referencing yesterday that\nThere you're going to now started housing people intense so they will not be released into society at large does as they are being now because they're just simply aren't the facilities to house them\nYou know what we're doing is ensuring that we're prepared for you know these caravan size we're seeing every single day on the border we've seen that in the rapid deployment of the U.S armed forces will have fifty two hundred on the border by the end of this week\nUm we are continuing to ensure that all us laws are enforced and upheld but at the same time right now we're not able to detain illegal aliens throughout the tendency of their immigration hearing right now we're forced to release after twenty days if you're a family unit the words out Laura\nI mean right now we're seeing a six hundred and twenty percent increase in family unit apprehensions and the last five years we are a record number of family that apprehensions this year alone what that says if you have a child with you we have to release you into the interior\nThere's also a hundred and ten percent increase in the last two years of male adults coming with children than ever before we're not able to detain them and immediately return\nWith our us immigration laws right now so even if we have the space until Congress acts there's\nNot much we can do and the way of deterrence to immediately apprehend and repatriate which ... which is border security\nWhere if there were children but if they're individuals without children you could detain them at the border correct\nCorrect and we're actually repatriating about eighty percent of the male adults that we apprehend\nOkay well that's a it's a pretty decent percentage well record\nLow a male um of adult apprehensions this year I think it's like a Nineteen Seventy one is the last time we were the slow in terms of adult apprehension so that's the only and you're able\nTo deliver a consequence ... you know migration pattern change when we're able to say that we're going to refer you for prosecution you broke US law we're going to send you to a judge and have a penalty\nYou know illegal aliens they they know they know where you left a lot better than members of Congress do\nAh this was Terry McAuliffe course a good friend of the Clintons former governor of Virginia a speaking about the uh the use I mean current governor of Virginia speaking about the use of the military what so some\nYou know there are thousands of miles away their goal and three miles an hour it's several weeks and by the time they did it and he was the point\nHe did as the show today to deploy the army donor what a disgrace this man has no politicized the military and his use or military for political purposes it's wall I was in the Marines today I can tell you is ... children who are wearing the quality of our country to protect our country\nPresident should not politicize\nA former governor of Virginia obviously this is called sleeping for three hours a night a Katie uh you you heard what he said the president by referencing the military as he has been doing sending them to the border that that is politicizing the military\n[noise] you know all I can say is this president didn't create this caravan this caravan you know took off with no control over who started it and when you know in Central America but I Will tell you that there is no way in which a large group of migrants should be able to come into our United States\nAs a large group just because you were in that group this president has every right to ensure that our borders are secure and defended and that's what he's done\nIn the homeland security department people you know think about in a border control and immigration Customs Enforcement ice as part of homeland security now right I always think it's part of state but it's part of homeland security correct absolutely\nOut so we got the left wants to abolish ice or despite all the great work I does with human trafficking drug interdiction uh and obviously important work in deporting a dangerous people from the United states um but I think\nPeople don't really quite comprehend that this is not a victimless crime illegal immigration their their victims or economic victims there the effect\nOn public schools affecting our health care system how closely\nIs homeland security working with other agencies on the effects on American society of math illegal immigration\nThe secretaries just in Yuma, Arizona last week with both Ron fatality acting ice director and Kevin macaroni and into had US Customs and border protection to meet with local sheriffs local officials to ensure that they have the resources they need to handle the influx of family units that they see it the border\nYou know we're meeting with these NGOs and these communities to ensure that we aren't just releasing into communities because of the sheer number we're seeing every day at the border I mean but someone has to pick up the tab when we transfer aliens to hospitals\nAnd that is the American taxpayer\nAnd I think people forget that every time you you see the illegal immigrants dropped off at bus depots or even flown around you know the the when you know the kids are kids are coming unaccompanied they're placed with a quote sponsor sponsors sometimes themselves are illegal immigrants\nThat costs money it doesn't come out of thin air as my mother used to say someone has to pay the tab\nNow we have Thirteen thousand children unaccompanied alien children in a church has custody right now they\nCost us taxpayers thirty three thousand dollars each annually\nWow just that just people have to chew over that figure thirty three thousand dollars each illegal immigrant in the United states annually to the American taxpayer\nThat's more than it cost for me to go to college\nOh my gosh this is Brock Obama just a few days ago on the uh mid term trail referencing this issue of the caravan and the president's concern about it once was trying to\nMalnourished run these rebels\nThat's the most\n[noise]\nThere for my\nFear mongering Katie\nLast year we apprehended Seventeen thousand criminal aliens at the border three thousand special interest aliens we know that there are criminals and this flow and the care of and that is headed north border security includes the ability to remove those we apprehend and gives us the right to defend our borders it's that simple\nKatie Waldman spokesperson for U.S Department of homeland security Katie thanks so much we'll check back with you soon we'll take a break
