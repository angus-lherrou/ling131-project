and more a bizarre as things go on\nWhat do I mean by this started here let's start with the fact that nobody is taking any responsibility for this there's been no indication here\nAnd so of course obviously that feeds into all of the other motives all of the other conspiracy theories that are out there but I find it very strange or that there is nobody I mean this is ... listen this is some

put out there do no chatter Ambinder webs about what's going on here I find that very odd especially in this day and age\nBut it's interesting because there's a lot of criticism or that as being levied out there a lot of a lot of speculation we're going to be speculating here I mean that's the only thing we can really do in in the absence of more concrete faxes we have to have some kind of speculation a of this\nIn fact that's why I'm bothered by something or I'm bothered by a piece\nThat was written by Chris Cillizza at CNN not ... as a former Washington Post reporter or he is someone

about the bombs by the way are going to be joined at nine thirty five by Todd would former\nAir force pilot a national security columnist for the Washington Times and the editor in chief of ...\nDot com it'll be talking about the national security aspect and getting into this interesting theory\nNow to understand a little bit more about me I have a background in Russian studies actually have a degree in in what was Soviet Studies at the time now Russian studies and so following the Soviet the former Soviet Union ah what's going on there and the U.S Russia relations is a an area of great interest to me\nUh and in fact I I'm I'm Still very close to my college advisor or and we spend a lot of time talking about especially in light of what was happening with the elections and the so called election meddling by Russians um about about one of them are putting them\nThese so called election meddling by Russians um about about what um are putting them ... ... ... ... once [noise] and it's interesting because she said to me ... and and this is always stuck with me while I'm a ... does not care does not care who is in charge in America\nWhat why don't report and cares about is selling as much chaos as possible and using the very things that we consider our greatest strength in our Democratic Republic to use those against remember what am I buttons martial artist\nOr and so what he wants to do is feed chaos now when this issue happen obviously lots of chatter amongst people about\n... about a a you know who might be behind this what the motivation is who would help so it hurts a lot of folks talking about uh uh someone who might be a progressive because as we know progressive is like to use a a bombs and their tools of of terror that's a fact\nWe don't like guns they like they like bombs [noise] um but the reality is that you know so so that's that's as we're talking about this someone said to me\n[noise] you know and what about what about the possibility\nWhat about the possibility that this could be\nA a a Russian effort and then FSB effort now I had a conversation yesterday with Peter joy ... Russian expert he was actually attacked possibly by uh uh putting cronies present I I ... anti pollutant stances\nHe he specifically said to me no he did not believe that this was a Russian effort this would have been sort of beyond the pale but isn't an interesting\nI edit the abuse that Chuck Todd was talking about this uh yesterday on ... on on MSNBC\nI have this fear that it could be some Russian operation to design to do what's happening now more of this you know I think we've we and so in some ways we shouldn't rule out of me and I think it's a ... a very strange moments and and we have no idea where it comes from\nWe have no idea where it comes from it's absolutely true and remember I said context is everything right when we talk about when we talked about uh the Peter Struck Lisa Page the FBI situation with regards to the Trump campaign contacts with everything that timeline\nYou had to understand the timeline in order to understand what was going on\nThe same thing can apply here and get knocked conspiracy theorize and again I Am just trying to find meaning in what is a very bizarre situation\nVery bizarre situation how how do you have ten bombs or a fake or otherwise go through the postal service without a without a um a post mark on them and without that post mark on them\nHow do you discovered that they came out of Florida now that's very strange to me but but the point is this is interesting [noise] so this all up the episode started happening a couple of days ago last week\nLast week the United states announces\nThat they are pulling out of the intermediate nuclear intermediate range nuclear forces treated the I N F treaty signed by a a signed by um I'm President Reagan\nIn negotiations were pulling out because the Russians are violating that treaty Vladimir Putin's turns around and says if the United states starts deploying missiles in Europe\nThen the Russians are going to have to retaliate they're going to start targeting those countries and that's a that's a very direct threat\nAt the same time us backed forces and us equipment is being used to kill Russian or or to kill a Russian soldiers on the ground\nIn Syria Russians are not happy about this and so to me given what the Russians have been willing to do\nIt is not beyond the pale if it wasn't remember the Russians were literally killing people in Great Britain or trying to kill people in Great Britain I should say\nLiterally trying to kill people in Great Britain we know this\nSo it it to me it's not it's not beyond the realm of possibility\nThat they would turn around and send bombs that were knocked that we're not real bombs fake bombs dummy bombs through the post office to a bunch of democratic targets in order to turn the left and right against each other even further that is what ... once\nAnd I think it makes a heck of a lot more sense than either a right wing or left wing or sending fake bombs through the mail\nIn any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd would former air force pilot editor in chief ... dot com national security columnist for the Washington Times taking your phone calls eight five five forty war that is the number taking your tweets at Andrew ... on Twitter I'm Andrew Yeager I Am sitting in for Ingram\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to Laura Ingraham healthy radio addiction on a mountain top giant nine

free fantastic vessel called them at eight hundred for a zero fifty two zero six or go to Jenny dot com that Jen you sell dot com\nWell it was possible I mean look they just break nerve gas all over the u._k. yeah field several\nPeople or one person and so it is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an active war targeting you know former political leaders and for you know the vice president's et cetera are of the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point and that's just my point you know I have reporters\nAll over the ... former Soviet Union and I I just don't believe that they would do that\nAt this point in time well let me ask you this because getting getting back to design a treaty and you've written about and I agree with you wholeheartedly the time has come for America to pull out of it um but ... has now turned around and said that that if the U.S starts placing intermediate range missiles\nIn central Europe he's going to target and I don't know what he means by targeting maybe you can lose a day that's on that but what you know that he's going to target these countries I talked to what is it what does that mean\nAnd and how and and what what is what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by putting on the treaty pullout\nWell that that's exactly what you would think he would say I mean what else is going to do except threaten you know the U.S in countries where we may deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles\nJust like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan with that person to Z against the ss twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations\nAnd so when he means by targeting is is really just putting the coordinates of Warsaw or you know hungry or whatever in the in the uh targeting a timeout holes that carry this\nTime and this is so you're literally he literally means targeting like like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a at Detroit there's literally he's talking about about changing darker coordinates\nOh for sure he he I mean what could I mean my point of that article is that we've seen this all before it and this is how we bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia can keep up with us economically especially under the Trump economy which in\nTwo years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can keep up and he's trying to Boston and then I noticed he went to the United nations and the you know tried to drum up support there to force us to not withdraw from the treaty but this is classic Trump negotiations that you know threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with and had them stop violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more he's a former U.S air force pilot or he is a national security columnist for the Washington Times on this piece in the Washington Times an arms race with Russia bring it on I think it'll go up on on more as a a Web site\nCertainly will go up on the Andrew language show page on Facebook said go and check that out there explain to us a little bit about what ... dot com is because that's that's fascinating to me\nYeah well I Know I have a long history or in Russia studied it in the air force academy the language I learned about the Soviet Union flying for the air force I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years\nFocusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know a lot about the region and I just really realize that the west especially Americans in you know middle America or don't know anything really about what's going on over here so\nI had built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly the traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis culture\nOpinion as to what's happening here\nWell and the important point and and you and I own a gun to talk more about this because I was I was a Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I also learn the language are you at the very least I Need to rush up on my Russian so I'm always looking for and we'll talk to us\nBut the pot a show dog on a show so I felt my but my my question a lot of people but they don't understand is it is that this is really it's not for food and it's not about\nReestablishing the Soviet Union but it really is about reestablishing the trappings of the Russian Empire and and you're exactly\nRight and and things like me\nWhat the bank you but you got ... [laughter] I think it was supposed to be able to claim that a little bit explain explained what that means in the modern context of what a modern Russian Empire looks like\nWell I don't know what a modern Russian Empire looks like but I'll tell you what the ultimate looked like it stretched from Poland and people don't notice all the way into San Francisco there's a port roost you can go to in San Francisco yeah it'll exist today as a monument and so bizarre empire was huge Russia before the Soviet Union\nWas one of the most productive successful countries they said do you\nReally have the world with their economy and their agriculture\nAdjust now a hundred years later got back to that point and so that tells you what the Soviet Union did to them it destroyed them economically destroyed them politically culturally I mean what Russia last with the Soviet I'm a you know the ... revolution is just astounding and well that's what I don't want that happening here so we had a lot about\nThat but I mean this is this is why this is changing stance visa V. Russia is so important I mean the the idiotic Russian reset that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual the the the you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strengths it's not quite that\nBut the Russians have to respect your ability to push back and and to know that you're serious about what you're doing I mean don't I mean that that's what makes what we're doing now so different than what the Obama administration tried to do with my right\nOf course and if you want collusion I mean the bombers or their their entire administration on down we're the ones that clue to Russia and still probably are in some ways\nUh you you look at a uranium ... you know those sales you look at a what's going on with the Trump dossier cetera I mean there was interrupted interaction with the Russian security services by the bomb in his administration against a political candidate and so\nIt's just amazing to me that people don't get that still or they don't want to I guess\nTaught how to folks have folks find out more about what you're up to the good working and doing that I wasn't I get in touch with you when I Want to talk Russian whether you're\nA well I can always\nGo to ... dot com T.

their lighted tall like close to the election to try to get the\nYeah I was I I I think there's that does this seem possible that's why this piece this morning and thank you very much for the call 'em

of these false flag operations I I'm Sorry I'm not going to call me step back\nThese false flag operations I I'm Sorry I'm not going to call it that we step back I don't mean that in ... what I mean is that you have Democrats who will\nPerpetrate these kinds of crimes\nAs a way of raising the stink you know I'm a there was a a feminist activist\nIn Wyoming or who had claimed that she was being threatened to turned out she was spending threatening emails to herself or the same thing happened just recently with another democratic activist a on a college campus up you know at this issue of\nFolks who claimed to put up I'm the founder of anti Semitic graffiti are only to a racist graffiti only to find out\nThat it was in fact done by the people who they claimed it was one we've seen this happen before\n[noise] so that's why I tend to discount of these things are let's go to a let's go to I'm Mike in Texas Mike welcome to the war and grim show\nThank you a question that that is the one that we heard many times over in it in five weeks ago\nBy liberal under our during the cabin on hearing that was ... credited not a word\nOr it could really identify again have it so I Would

was never any attempt to hurt anybody\nIt's it was obviously\nA question has to be asked\nIf it's a lot and it's a lot and questioned in in in in the law cui bono who who who to whom is there a benefit to this and I think you are you are correct in that regard I mean this is the again if it fits in with ... razor here\nI'm a you know the the simplest explanation is usually the correct one and I know I I've said that a couple of different times but I Want to make sure that I hammer that point home sort of we talk about these things um but that's also why I I Do think that we cannot discount\nWe cannot discount or that the Russians might be involved here in some way shape or form it's interesting when I had this conversation or a yesterday with a a Russia expert who who did tell me he did not think\nDid not think that the FSB the Russian foreign intelligence service was involved in this he did nevertheless say but on the other hand there is strong evidence to indicate\nThat bizarre ... you know the cameraman and his brother up as your car up in Boston that they may very well have been trained in influenced by the Russians\nThat they are all sorts of weird things that were going on with their radicalization and and that the way that they built this they're bomb there pressure cooker bomb is not something that would have been readily available on the Internet\nAnd so uh that that I found fascinating there is a real benefits\nAre real benefit continuing benefit to a lot of foreign powers or by this continued a discontent in a in the United states affect somebody tweeted it I don't have it in front of me you know or that the Russians would very much like Democrats in power that's true to an extent\nBut the what the Russians are really wants is they want chaos or my thank you very much for the call listen when we come back\nOut because I didn't want to talk a little bit about the primaries in a couple of folks have asked me to talk about the caravan and the

that that seems that you know it's one of those things I often talk about you know when you do public speaking you have to know who your audience is I Can't imagine that a guard study from LA played well in the first congressional district of South Carolina\nIt's just that because it let's be brutally honest with everybody on on the right you know\nDemocrats don't have a platform this year not to say in the past Democrats haven't had something good but they don't have anything to talk about we should be focusing on the fact that we have the bad economy we've had in generation no yeah the lowest them climate\nAmber and if people don't see that they I I just can't put my arms around it but I Believe the Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are toxic to this country\nThey are toxic they're all about the rhetoric is all about the negativity they embody the exact opposite of what an American should be\nWe should stand proud and strong together as a country\nMy ... my desk to South Carolina state representative Katie Arrington she's the Republican candidate for Congress in the first congressional district on and on that point you know nobody it's obviously off the front pages today\nAre but this was we got a the the third quarter GDP\nA measurements today we knew we were going to be getting those obviously nobody is talking about them or because of um [noise] uh uh because of the other things that are in the news is fake bombs story a and and we now have a a GPA of three point five percent of the third quarter\nA President Obama when he was an office said we were never gonna see\nGDP above two percent of the Trump a communist turning that around obviously this is very important to other folks you're talking to the see this in terms of jobs and more money in their pockets are how are they on those sort of uh the Trump tax and regulatory agenda one of those same to you about that\nOnly a lot more money in our pockets of Trump you know tax agenda is positive it's up to Congress to get tax judo path\nWe need to ensure that small businesses and the middle class yet permanent tax relief absolutely paramount we have to do that that is that's going to be a huge focus on going into session but other than that when you know we're looking at the regulatory you know I have some big manufacturers in my area\nA Boeing being one of them shore and they just four hundred new people\n[noise] the terrorists no one likes that terrorists no one likes a tariff but President Trump is standing firm and putting America First and that it's imperative we need to remember that this is the the world's best negotiator let the man do his job\nYou know it's interesting regulate it got\nNo go ahead go ahead please reducing regulations\nAnd think well ... Gillette businesses thrive is what we need to do I mean we ... government that fundamental belief and I'll get Senator Tom Davis and the state of South Carolina credit for this one because he told it to me and it's been part of my ... a Democrat fundamentally\nBelieve government is to set up problems and Republicans believe government is the problem and that is what Trump is doing the government's the problem is getting rid of it finally we got Congress working to it with him on that and we have to eat them a mental going is paramount as my ...\nLike far as my colleague at the Competitive Enterprise Institute Wayne Cruz says you don't have to teach the grass how to grow you just have to remove the rocks from their lawns and and he's already been ... that sort of by one of my other Bailey works is is the is this issue of regulations but but you know and it's and it's interesting because you talk about this issue of negotiation and\nAnd and Trump [noise] um I I have a I had formulated a theory on what I called Trump's rules of acquisition I'm a star trek Duke uh this is a friend using the phrase the rules of acquisition\nAnd rule number one is always be willing to walk away from the table\nRight rule number two is sometimes in order to demonstrate your opponent\nYou're willing to walk away from the table you have to walk away from the table and will number three is don't pre negotiate with yourself I mean this is\nThis is the great folly of a of a you know democratic negotiators cream negotiated over the years is that they've always Purina go shoot it individually inevitably sold out American interests\nAnd so yeah I understand probably Boeing is unhappy about a tariff on let's say aluminum or steal or what have you but nevertheless it is a negotiating tactic to take the strongest positions don't you think\nOh absolutely and we need to remind ourselves that that you know I look at what we're going through right now it's like a child

there's no oil out there [laughter]\nThat only thing he he is running\nOn a platform I'm going to stop offshore drilling from South Carolina wow and I said yeah and well number one he doesn't

postal worker you can\nHelp a elucidate us on this on these issues\nProduced a drawing or Sean I said John Sean here or no worse yeah ours is the thing I I was\nI worked for the postal service as a clerk and I feel in postmaster for time and a half years after my twenty seven years for for service\nAnyway this is not better unusual when you consider the characteristics of these packages [noise] um I don't I have received things from the Mayo personally that are good things and I'm like oh what a calculator or something with\nStamps on there that have not been cancelled wow the region or knock Andrews because those are called SP ours which stands for small parcels and rules that can't go through the processing machine sure when you get a letter that goes for the machine\nThe machine just sprayed it the cancellation on there for efficiency of speed doesn't do that with those types of cracker church had those packages had a\nPipe and they're not a PVC part but there are actual lead pipe or something that could do to enrich yes it would have waited too much\nAnd it would have alerted people that there's something wrong with this sort of it's not gone through clerk clerk at the counter or care to ask them questions and and camp for over ... stamp\nShore so\nFor the fact that they're not canceled there's not that unusual\nWell let me ask you this and ... and when we were running short on time here but real quick so without it being cancelled how would they be able to track them back from New York to Florida\nWhere I couldn't go probably uh uh they're basing it on the fact that one of them was male and then ended up with a with being returned to Florida I'm from I'm not exactly how they got a ... a lot more clever than\nRight or [laughter] well this was an old so I appreciate that that is that is incredibly helpful information and in the end right I mean we can speculate I can offer my opinion I can offer my perspective but we're also in the business of providing soccer so Sean thank you so very much for giving us those that you have a a great weekend right\nYes I'm no expert but I think I Know enough from working with it\nYou know just to be

acting like it on this issue and they have gladly pass the buck and allowed in facilities care of it has to go north and become our problem well they've got to do their part well this is part of it\nWe have leverage on them particularly a trade\nWhat happened I'm Sorry no no but this is what's happening in Europe I mean let's not forget that a lot of our friends in Europe are struggling to sort of the same issues of mass migration and you have a situation in which you'll have migrants refugees from the middle east\nShe was a mass migration and you had a situation in which you'll have migrants refugees from the middle east coming in arriving in Greece and they will be facilitated in crossing certain countries so that those countries can get them out of their their continue as part of it it's interesting you talk about this\nHe talking about the issues of national security and I've been down to the southern border and I urge anybody in every one if you've never been down to the border go down to the border in in uh in Arizona and California\nAnd watch you know there's highways that that travel right along the border I Want to say it's a high five I don't remember I Know it's on I think that that goes north south I think it's I tend interstate then goes right along the border there\nAnd I've watched people cross the border it is a scary prospect even if people are not coming you know into commit harm but the idea that something like a simply walk across this patch of land and and my great that that is a frightening prospect to me then I'm thinking as he was on the eve\nOf course and by the way you know people want to make us seem like we're a xenophobic\nA you know paranoid people because we talk about uh the the danger for of course border here's the reality the president was far off by the way when he said that there could be middle Easterners or for example we had no idea it was causing here's what we do know\nThis isn't conspiracy theory nonsense isn't from some far right website\nThe Laredo station of the border patrol tells us that this year they have already arrested six hundred and Bangladeshis are crossing illegally now why do I mentioned that because obviously Mexico's a very long way from what I'm saying that that also happens to be a country that has a real problem with\nIslamic hairs are so there are reasons for us to to fully that anyone coming here from Bangladesh even coming legally but the fact that they're coming illegally through Mexico I think it's very I\nSure and tells us you know that we don't know who's going to be caught six hundred how many have we not caught um so it doesn't make sense for economic security\nIt doesn't make sense for national security it's not fair to legal immigrants there are just so many reasons why we have to stop it and I think we need to get Mexico to do their part we need to use trade\nAs the leverage and say we're going to start trade restrictions and by the way that doesn't work if it comes to it we will see all this border there will be no trade from Mexico I Hope we don't have to get that draconian but I think that option has to at least be on the table so that we don't have the crisis of them actually crossing the border walking across as happens too often as you mentioned\nAnd by the way the interstate that I was looking for the interstate eight in the south of interstate panic goes right along the border in in Arizona and California and my guest is Steve Cortez and we're talking about this it it's funny because I I come back to ... you said the thing about being a phobia and I I Want to also make it very clear I've said this a little bit earlier on on the show\nBut one of the one of the great things about America the thing that makes America the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth is affected anybody can come to America and become an American\nRight that that is that is an essential element of who we are it's a wonderful thing it's something you can't find anywhere else the you know just about anywhere else that you go in the world but I can move to France today\nI could live in ... in France for another Thirty years I Will never be considered French Japan in the same thing Korea the same thing\nBut anybody can come to America and and become an American it's the beauty of who we are we're just saying that you have to do it within the process you have to do it legally you and you cannot expect if you're going to come up here on moss and and do something about it so\nThe president's talking about deploying troops down to the southern border um there is a lot of discussion as to whether or not this violates posse ... I don't believe that it does having read the various statutes that are out there where do you come down on this\nRight now I don't think so because it's it's a clear danger to our borders external dangerous so you know I don't think it done by the way I'm so glad you made that point two of you know look the mainstream media you played that Joe Scarborough and he was just\nRidiculous morning yes totally insulting to America trying to make this a racial issue they often do that by the way when they don't want to talk policy what are they do they just call this race of course and and try to dismiss us but here's here's the reality of America's not a race or you know as you point out right and if you believe in our values and our constitution\nAnd if you're going to bring work ethic and skills that we need a than we want you to become a legal immigrant and you're so right the second you are you're an American\nQuestions asked that doesn't happen in the rest of the world oh so this is not about race remotely like it is about citizenship and it is about borders and it's largely by the way I'm pointed out to the Joe Scarborough is largely about protecting American citizens many of whom happen to be minorities\nAre black and Hispanic Americans I Believe soccer more than anyone from tolerating illegal immigration\nOr why because many of them are working class people who have to compete in the labor market against illegal immigrant labor so it actually harms black and brown Americans perhaps the most of all to tolerate porous border\nYou know my ... my my my colleagues seat motley and less government dot dot org has talked to a great deal about that issue about sort of the economics of this as well in the end for me it comes down to issues of national security it comes down to issues of sovereignty\nIf we don't control who is migrating here on them in any nation any nation that doesn't control who is coming in a pretty soon finds itself without a nation and we certainly\nDon't want that seat court says how do we find out more about what you were up to\nYou know I'm On CNN most nights beyond their anger that tonight and on Twitter ... court as the C O R G E S C\nListen I appreciate that will put up links on the underlying or show page I'm sure we have links up in the ... page thank you so much for joining us today\nThanks for having me free ... and it's interesting because he was talking about are the issues of of people of color in America\nA and one of the things that I wanted to get to today I really didn't get a chance to get to was this issue of uh the president speaking tonight at a gathering of conservative African Americans are they're going to be posted at the White House today and then they're doing a gala event tonight here in Washington DC\nUh you know president is really doing what he can because\nRight it's funny or the American dream is about everybody it is about every but it's about bringing everybody in and the only way you can do that is by creating the conditions whereby everybody can succeed\nWe've talked about this about sort of a good economic news today uh the uh we have the GDP out a GDP is it the third quarter GDP a three point five percent of a\nTenth of a percentage point above a where it was expected that as a immeasurably good news and yet and yet we're not talking about this by the way I Am taking your tweets I I did get them as I said I Do read the critical tweets here\nKevin tweets and Andrew\nPlease I'm saying ah every two seconds of when I get excited to fix up eight when I get excited I I tend to speak over myself and I get a little closer to my speech be when I'm looking at breaking news on the TV sometimes I get a little distracted by that so I Do apologize\nSometimes I Do try to work very hard on my on my verbal textbook Kevin thank you so very much for listening so intently to that\n[noise] ah Patty writes in on Twitter by the way you can tweet at me at Andrew underscore Langer\nPatty writes I found you a good job of filling in for Laura we need evidence confirm if this is a liberal sending the bombs uh it must be what idiot we keep sending the bombs with so much attention didn't Brennan have rice them come from sent to him I got to go back and look at that I don't remember a friend and got it I Know a bunch of conservatives did certainly it was sent to folks and\nRemember a friend and got it I Know a bunch of conservatives did certainly it was sent to folks at the Pentagon a Bible certainly double check on that it was we got a couple of more minutes here on the show\nBefore recalls out for the day I'll continue to take your tweets at Andrew underscore Langer continue to take your phone calls\nEight five five forty Laurie is the number eight five five four zero L.
