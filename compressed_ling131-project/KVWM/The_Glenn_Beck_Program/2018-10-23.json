Supreme Court\nJustices dinner McCaskill is and she's just terribly out of step with the state of Missouri of what the people of the state voted for and that's why we're going to replace\nSo right now on this issue of this migrant mob I don't like calling in a caravan it does not\nNow that doesn't really [laughter] that doesn't really capture it in my view I one of the people of Missouri thinking about like a crush like this on the border I mean it's a ... it's going to be a crush and it's going to and it's going to cause a huge problem for immigration officials and it's for the national guard\nThat I think that the people in Missouri really worried about it I mean I as I travel all over the state I have I have people talk to me about it especially the last few days I mean this yesterday every stop on may all over the the people ask me they said what is going on and they would say that they got us but we have a president\nWho is strong and who was willing to take steps to defend the country\nOn like the Democrats unlike Claire McCaskill who they're open borders policy of course are what encourage this kind of lawlessness of this kind of a threat to the country and now they have Claire McCaskill of base of this threat sponsoring an open border bill\nI I just can't think of anything worse I Can't think of anything all week I Can't think of anything that's more dangerous for months tutor for the country\nWell when you ah Josh look at uh the rest of America right now it seems that\nThe support for Donald Trump is growing you than his highest point in his presidency which is stunning given how perpetually negative\nThe press is I mean it is a negative drumbeat coming out of almost every mainstream media outlet even with that he's at forty seven percent which is higher than Brock Obama was a how important is the president in this race for you\nTo report and I'm a very voted for Donald Trump by almost twenty points\nOn that that is a huge huge margin in Missouri which is still a swing state and it's because people want to what they want a stronger America I mean people voted to rebuild our country that's what they were voting for much day when they voted for President Trump and his policies\nAre rebuilding the country under good from Missouri You know we've got our lowest unemployment rate it decades of the state of Missouri\nJob growth finally hitting new high we've got blue collar economic growth job growth but at this point since the Nineteen eighties in the state rural unemployment slow so we're finally starting to get those jobs back from overseas your wages grow but\nHere's what scared folks is that the Democrat Claire McCaskill want to take all that away throw it all in reverse reverse all the games and then go back to the policy of weakness\nOverseas weakness on our border and the you know we just can't have that that's what this election is about\nJosh how has these if at all these undercover videos of Claire McCaskill Harris her and her staff is that\nResonated at all what the voters where people are are saying that work for a while we have to kind of lie to the voters we can't really say what we really mean about a various issues\nThough I think it's been usually resident and you know the people to pay to to have a politician especially lifetime politician like Claire McCaskill the one thing to their faith in the open up behind their back into the sea Claire McCaskill on tape\nSaying that she wants to take away Second Amendment rights you know he's a constitutional rights\nBut the belong to people by virtue of our constitution to hear her talk about I was to take those away from all by citizens here staff talk about\nThe ceiling the donations from Planned Parenthood and other extremist abortion groups to talk about the fact that well you know the McCaskill really agrees with Brock Obama\nOn everything but she won't say that publicly because you know Missouri voters are are so close minded I mean that's essentially what her staff was caught thing over and over and over again\nIt's it's really the condescension the contempt\nFor everyday voter is really remarkable and people are tired of that they want somebody who believes in the state who is not ashamed of our way of life and the state and it's going to go represented\nA Josh ah when you look at the makeup of the Democrat Party today the perpetual mob mentality that seems to be encouraged and even celebrated or by some of their top leaders or\nHow does this you know I mean it seems like maybe it's just a big cities and this is happening it's not so much and\nAnd you know in in places like Missouri but if it's covered a lot in certainly certainly at Fox and other networks is that on people's minds of president says mobs not jobs ah and it seems like people just wanting to calm down and government work for them\n\nYou know I think that you get ... you know I I think that what the Democrats have on offer what Claire McCaskill's offer against chaos at home and weakness abroad and this this model behavior it it is chaos in it at all\nAnd I think that folks watch mobs driving people out of restaurants screaming them down and public\nBanging on the doors of the U.S Supreme Court and shouting obscenity is I mean this is not the United states of America or this was not civil democratic discourse I'm all for strong disagreement that's great that's the first amendment but\nTo try and shut down speech and harassed intimidating even use violence against people I mean and have Hillary Clinton as you say Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder out they're encouraging it is clear McCaskill you know she is she's going right along with it I mean she is happy to see these ... employed\nThat is not what the people in my state voted for that that is not who we are as Americans\nAre Josh I'm the concern I think a lot of a conservative religious voters have is the social transformation of the country the the idea that gender is something that is changeable and uh\nThe idea that gender is something that is changeable\nAnd uh that you know that we should really\nCelebrate these things in public schools and and obviously the conscience rights and the religious rights of many say that's not what we believe we love all people but that's not what we believe how ... how are the social issues playing in your state this election cycle\nYou know the Missourians are leaving the constitution and they believe in the first amendment first and then the guarantees the freedom of religion to churches\nTo individual you know this is something works but the most of my career hold a bit of politics you're\nYou've been in the background I Know you do a lot of girls out there\nYeah yeah most of my career because this is a lawyer\nBut as a religious liberty lawyer and people are so they are reminded people uh you know we don't discriminate against anybody based on their religious views but you know what we believe the importance of value face it we believe that the important about your family a community of those things go around\nAnd churches in our houses of worship and we want to see those protected and I think again the left wing agenda which has become so hostile\nTo people who have a so hospitals are religious liberties just like a talk show through our Second Amendment rights just like it's become ... free speech really think about it what what the left wing of the really offers this uh you know you agree with us or you shut up\nInto that it's just not what the people of ice they want people to country\nI'll tell you Josh why I think that Missourians are going to do the right thing and vote for you I've met many reasons obviously substantive reasons when you have the right views on critical issues from crime to the economy and immigration so forth but I'll tell you why I think you're going to win is because the New York times is already writing ridiculous\nArticles about about your office in turmoil first of all you show me an office that doesn't have personality conflicts and and uh and\nPeople moving in and out and departures and so forth

just say well we hope everybody who comes into the country is going to be economically self sufficient bringing no uh you know bringing no problems with diseases not be a burden at all in our schools our health care I guess we could just\nHope for the best see that's what the Democrats want they want to hope for the best that's why they're all for the most part they're either silent on what to do with this caravan they don't want to talk about it\nThey know this is a radioactive issue for them they not speaking radioactive they know this is a terrible issue for the Democrats reporters worth their salt should force Democrats\nTo ask questions was should we do with this caravan what should we do with all these people do you think they should all coming to America do you think they should all be released into America including women and children just to show up at a later date which they don't do\nWho do you think should pay for their health care do you believe that a free schooling is what what needs to be done for anyone who gets a foot hold over the border though the Supreme Court ruled that that we have to do that\n\nBut when is enough enough when when one is the human tragedy of all of this both inside and outside the United states going to be enough for the Democrats\nI think it's important to stop this caravan impart to send a signal to the rest of Latin America no you're not going to be allowed to come in and in part because in the process of stopping you were going to learn a lot about the laws of need to be changed\nAnd frankly Congress maybe in the lame duck session ought to be challenged ... not to know my comprehensive reform plus they contend dumb things let's just fix one step at a time and begin to make it possible to manage our border\nAs usual Newt Gingrich is one hundred percent correct do not allow politicians to get away with these glib generalities all we're ... we all were for border enforcement what does that mean\nYou can't enforce the border that's being crushed by fourteen thousand people at one time can't do it so what do do they mean when they stay there for border enforcement do they think the asylum laws as as they exist they shouldn't be changed so anyone who lives in fear of crime and their home country should be able to come here\nOr anyone that just wants a better life should be able to come here\nNo matter what\nThat's what the standard going to be so we better get ready to double and triple our population really quickly and all that entails environmentally with infrastructure with new schools that need to be built a with massive changes demographic changes to our country we better be ready\nAll that entails\nI don't think America wants to any part of that we want our country to be an orderly uh to be an orderly place a safe place a clean place where freedom and liberty is guaranteed by people who are informed about our history and our founding\nWho don't consider America just a place to go to

doing there shouldn't be a lottery system people who end of the country should be based on merit we should be selective on who comes to the country with regard to those who come across the border\nI Would say look you want to keep people together and keep families together do it do it within twenty four hours and send them right back and the thing is is we have an immigration office apply to come in as far as refugee status what we've done is we've taken away all the rule\nClaim to be a refugee none of the rules apply so typically if you come in here and you legally immigrate there are some decent prohibitions on getting on welfare you know and getting on government assistance\nIf your refugee apparently all those things go out the window so everybody knows that when you come he claimed to be a refugees you can get on welfare and get into government housing and this is something that should change I'm fine with\n... we can absorb people if they want to come in for\nEach year\nPeople that we can emitted into the country and how many we need and will make that decision each year but uh we can't allow just people just to to come across the border by the thousands\nI'm Talking to Rand Paul here on the lower income shows Senator Paul what do you think um are the most important issues facing the country today given everything that we're seeing all the great\nAdvancement we've made in the economy the Republicans are leading by a historic margin in the handling the economy Seventeen point advantage in trade and the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll a those two issues are are massive plus it's for the Republican than in a tough midterm cycle cycle normally\nNow what do you see especially coming from the Kentucky perspective\nI think the good news is overwhelming and often obscured by the media you know all the all him being carried away with all the Trump to arrangements said or\nThe good news is overwhelming we have an economy growing at just an amazing pace over four percent annual growth unemployment at historic lows the main thing I see is I go round Kentucky when I talked to plant managers is\nThey said we have a shortage of workers a shortage of people who are drug free with work ethic and so the answer here is this is a time before but this is a time when we should convert or work programs that are welfare programs to hey there's a job down the street programs and I think if we were able to do that\nYou know we have a great future coming ahead and most of it's because this is what Republicans off in the Washington don't get they keep calling it tax reform and the president directs them no it was a tax cut a significant tax cut will return money to his rightful owner leaves the money in the private marketplace and guess what\nThe private marketplace will boom when you leave money in the private marketplace and so\nAll of that has been great and I don't think we can emphasize that enough and I think in the election they come to fruition that not only the cabin on the inside of the Republican base but there are reports that early voting in seven out of eight states that are reporting\nWhere people can uh decide how many a Republican and how many are Democrat the Republicans are are in a big upsurge with early voting\nYeah which is is is you know music to my ears because Tom Steyer and sorrows and others have really funneled an enormous amount of money into voter registrations on college campuses which are overwhelmingly I'm moving to the Democrat Party or Senator Paul why should Americans\nCare about this Saudi killing of this ...\nWho ah was living in the United states he was a was he he was\nPreviously a kind of a sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood and he you know he was mourning the death of bin Laden although he thought bin Laden went off the wrong track and not to radicalize Smith Media have been tied up on this story for you know a couple of weeks now\nI Would say that ah the killing of cars showed me by the Saudis is just one more incidents of things that they do that or not good for America\nThat's been over a hundred billion dollars over the last several decades a supporting the drop is around the world that teach hatred of Christianity and Judaism and Hindus they're over ten thousand madrassas in Pakistan supported by them the ... network which is a group of\nA bad actors in Pakistan that attack our soldiers in Afghanistan they all the leaders of it went to him the process funded by Saudi Arabians Saudi Arabians fund addresses in Indonesia that used to have a relatively moderate form of Islam is a big Islamic nation\nBut there there's a growing faction of uh those who now believe in violence against civilians taught by the Saudis so the Saudis are bad they have been doing this for decades and we sort of turn a blind eye and say it's all Iran Iran Iran we have to support the Saudis\nI'm not so sure that the Saudis are lesser evil than the uranium to tell you the truth the war in Yemen is going to drag us into another war in the middle east thousands of civilians are being killed\nSo the killing of the journalist I Would say is just one more item\nAbad action by Saudi Arabia but Saudi Arabia sent arms by the hundreds of tons of it into Syria to al ... an al ... they they they supported the worst and most extreme elements of the Sunni extremists in the Syrian civil war\nSo no I Can't think of a reason why we shouldn't be hopping mad about this but what I've advised as we should quit selling them arms or should quit aiding and abetting them in what they're doing throughout the middle east and the world\nWell the administration and the president himself yesterday said you know they're and they're important partners of ours though in the middle east is that not the case I mean they've actually assisted American interest in the middle east is specifically obviously with Iran which still is the largest state sponsor of terrorism\n[noise] yeah but I Would call the Saudis the largest state sponsor of radical Islam you know they really teach it throughout the world the people who came attacks on nine eleven ...\nIf you really look at worldwide terrorism is the Saudis and their form of ... is that is being sent to an export around the world [noise] so uh as far as arms\nThey buy some of our I'm sure but I don't think the armed our military arms are or something like any other private entity like widgets or whatever are armed or something unique we paid for by the taxpayer F. sixteen is not something that\nWe can get jobs by selling F. sixteen to China or Russia I Would still be against it because I'm not I don't see our arms trade as jobs program it was about our national defence and I think selling arms the Saudis actually puts it I said at greater risk\nIt increases or risk that Yemen is going to devolve into chaos in Libya before it in Syria and Iraq before that\nChaos is where terrorists breed so if we want to stop terrorists we need to quit aiding and abetting the Saudis and creating chaos\nOr I Know a gym here who's the Saudi foreign minister responded to your uh view on the show you down and he said this\nI find it very surprising that some of these thousand miles away can be with us in the oven\nFind it very surprising that some of the six thousand miles away can be about ... miles away with no access to information or intelligence so this is a judgment call them the parts of senator of phones [noise] this is not in fact it's based on the notions in some situations\nTo take a swing it that\nA lot to excited to be lectured by some autocrat from a dictatorship you know the Saudis have sweet thousand people in prison right now without trial so he says oh we shouldn't presume the crown prince to be innocent until otherwise proven\nOr like a three thousand people in your country that you locked up in jail and you don't give a trial too\nSo I think it's pretty galling for him to western standards our western standards of presumption of innocence and say oh you need to presume the crown prince innocent it's a dictatorship nothing happens over there without the crown prince begins all the Fifteen people that were involved with killing and dismay and bring this journalist\nApparently many of them are henchmen there travel with the crown prince when he travels it goes up to two people who their punishment now has been being fired to chop ups or to the chopping up and that just remember him and other journalists\nAnd you get fired my guess is they're uh they're banished met will be in royal exile somewhere with lots of money the lower level people they will probably executed an outlet talk to anyone because they would probably look like the crown prince and this so no I'm not too excited it'd be lectured by these people\nA Rand Paul here on the ...

getting on the ground based on what they were carrying their backpacks and everything the very well coordinated they had a coordinated message a very\nVery very few of them feared off that message because they're with leadership within the group you know I speak Spanish so I Know what's going on around me and and and thank God I had you know you will catch people in the line okay move this way don't talk to the reporters right now we're moving forward cat did say that\nAnd I said well you told me a minute ago you didn't have a leader in the group at the mad at the head it's actually telling you guys so I'm assuming you're a leader oh no no no no we don't have any leader\nActually telling you guys what do you know so I'm assuming you're a leader oh no no no no we don't have any leaders we don't have any leaders I'd go up and talk to the gentleman no no we're just trying to keep moving forward I said well you guys have matching backpacks you have\nYou know the flag of Honduras at the front of your group nobody in the group actually looked that tired or hungry um I was told by one of the people in the groups that they did have some bussing\nA that people were in the villages and they heard it by word of mouth or that they heard the news or that they were coming to America to look for jobs this is about poverty so\nVery well coordinated effort according to the intelligence officials on the ground there are groups actually organizing this I'm In Honduras uh remember there's and you know a lot about this or is there is a big battle you're in a politically between the various a conservative\nOr a government and uh the socialist government so there is some suspicion that a socialist groups in Honduras along with a you know open borders society and others there's a lot of talk about that here\nHave been coordinating to do this march so that it would coincide with the U.S a elections a mid term elections and create a lot of a political fodder to the United states and here in Central America\n[noise] one thing that I I find to be very disturbing are the ah are those who are facilitating this dangerous situation\nFor children and women along the way a and these are people with flatbed trucks of these groups in the United states who are sending immigration lawyers down to coach these are individuals or they did that in the last\nCaravan or they're doing in this in this other one in and others as you pointed out on their way or if something is done to stop this there will be well they're not a Sarah a group of thousands every week coming into your into our borders ...\nAbs yeah ... absolutely or this is not stopping I mean what I was down at the border and it was a very precarious situation you know there were so many men it was it was it was it was a bit dangerous I mean there was some concern among the intelligence officials there ah you brought up such a great point um that the\nWomen and children that were a part of these caravans the big first wave and the second wave that were put in the front of the lines of basically for the media\nOr in danger every second that they are traveling with these groups are according to what I'm all in officials apparently a child a baby I'm with trampled on when they first the first part of that second wave rushed through uh the border and the baby was killed\nNow remember their intelligence apparatus has people embedded in these caravans to to try to gather information to find out what's going on here\nWho is coordinating this they talked about this baby that died that was trampled to death when his mother was knocked down to the ground a the baby was buried apparently asked by some of those leadership within the group to take the baby away and bury the baby so that\nThe Guatemalan government we didn't have any access to the body\nOf one of the reasons or the government wanted to know and obviously wanted to bring justice to the child's life with so that they could charge people that were coordinating this group with either manslaughter murder or because it's just becoming a really dangerous situation for the people that are moving forward\nAnd for the United states and our us southern border this is extraordinarily dangerous and a big problem for us because some of the people within these groups are not just regular farm workers are people for villages that are hard working people um there are good people in these groups I think they've been used\nAnd they're being used by these coordinators but there are some as Thirteen gang members there is some pretty bad guys in these groups to\nUm we know that from seeing their tattoos from talking to them while I was down on the border I'm definitely gang affiliated people so we're we're not what we're seeing here is people being abused and you\nBuy these organizers by these governments\nAnd I I'm telling you there are people within the ... I'm Honduran government socialist political activists political groups that are helping with this coordination and they're presenting a huge problem or not just for for for our country but for their own people as they make their way down here I Know there's\nMore ways that people ready to move forward because remember once they get this thing started once the ball yeah ... there's no way to stop it it's a snowball effect that people will just\nOh of Eric ... going to let us into a country and they coached them my coach them a credible fear credible here this is what you need to say when you get to the border this is how you say in America\nOh and it's just a it's just a game I mean it's what you say a few lines and then you released with a piece of paper and a judge shows try and hold women and children separately you can't keep it keep them longer than twenty days and then\nThey're off to the races and it's and it's pretty much over and I think a lot of these democratic socialist organizations in the United states know that once they get into the country\nThose new you know temporary you know migrants or whatever the provisional status they get\n... feel like a a debt of gratitude to the left and be ... Democrats if they ever get amnesty that's what they want then there's a demographic shift in the country that is you retrieve a ball for Republicans in irreversible because of the sheer numbers\nYet a great point I mean which is the reason we've seen some of those reports coming out of California and other parts of the country where we've seen that illegals have voted right\nUh and and there's a shift and there's a ship it if they become citizens of course there was another shift or one of the interesting things I spoke with a somebody from immigration and Customs Enforcement of the United states and part of what they're seeing is is that for example men will take young girls\nYou know the ... the the under Eighteen or children and the women will take the boys because once they reach the border and if the you know as as a mother says well I don't have the father they can't really separate the child from the mother so that they just released them into the U.S with a return to court date\nSo we're seeing the catch and release it still ongoing\nOh we have men who have little girls they know they can't\nPut them in a holding facility with other men because they've got a a child they can't separate them so they released them so we're still seeing the same problem that we've seen for years happening right now and the president you know President Trump is is very adamant about\nThe fact like look you guys can't control your borders work in a pool aid or the ... the complexity here is that okay we understand that but our borders are being overrun too so I think the most important thing we can do\nFor the United states where the Guatemalan government even with in Honduras right now for the Honduran government that's working against some of the socialist a\nA aspects of their of their country of political an apparatus is to actually find out who is funding this is any us money from us aid going to find these groups that are coordinating the separate than we really need to start pulling the funding and we really need to hold people accountable because what we have is it\nReally the funding and we really need to hold people accountable because what we have is a caravan of people there as well with children in women although those numbers are a lot smaller uh from what I've seen than the men that are coming across and saying\nWe're going to charge you were going to find a way to stop this we're going to pull that funding from\nFrom usa a group that are that are actually assisting and that's a caravan and we're going to hold people responsible\nFor the people that guy along this track because believe me young women are being raped a there is a lot of concern with ... with children are being uh exposed to this type of a brand new with\nKara walked me put on the back of cars so people should actually be charged for this and held accountable if they're not I'm afraid that this is going to continue we really need to expose doing this and what's going on\nOut well again follow the money\nSomeone's paying the fuel for these trucks someone's paying for the\nUh the food the accommodations not everybody's sleeping on the floor every night you don't you can't move this ... this number of people without an organization behind you you cannot it just now I don't care what people like it it would be the equivalent of walking from Boston to San Francisco\nWith a with a three year old child I don't think so you're getting ... you're you're getting help along the way from various organizations and people and the United states has got to crack down on this because this is a conspiracy to thwart us immigration law\nAnd overwhelm our immigration system and it just has to stop Sarah Carter oh we want to get you on TV but will ah will try to work that work on that with you because there's that fascinating report keep digging there while you're there and be careful though okay be really careful", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Show Low", "day": "23"}
