and then um another time a former friend accused me or spread rumors about me that I was sleeping with her husband and I had no way to protect my reputation and so I Would have believed her if\nShe had come out with Kavanaugh's demeanor and said you crave you did this to me and if he had taken her to meet her and said oh I don't remember I don't remember what I did when I was in high school I Would have really the story but I didn't believe it\nI didn't believe her allegations from the get go just because of the timing of the letter and I want to start a match on your show right now Dianne

testimony objectively would say it wasn't credible\nAnd Mr Trump President Trump is willing to hope that balloon of the social why he's willing to say no Santa Claus doesnt exist we need to grow up\nAnd and I I just I I think that's you know I think that's what he's trying to do here\nI appreciate it a five five forty Laura uh this is going to go down as one of the hardest fought

the Democrats exposed it they leaked it and they exposed it intentionally for their own purpose\nBut this is part of a bigger attempt by the Democrats to take this to a new level I mean the paid activists that are around right now or my wife and I were physically accosted at a public airport on Monday This week because of this these people were paid by the center of public democracy\nOr they get money from the open society foundation which is George Soros who was putting to listen to this more than thirty two billion billion dollars into this effort over the last couple of years this is a bigger issue and it's not going to go away when we confirm Kavanaugh this week\nNow and I think ah you're exactly right I think it's time for conservatives to stop playing defense\nAbsolutely everyone

group as you said Center for democracy and I think it's time to turn the tables were okay sunshine on you who are you people\nWho are working for this organization you are carrying on and I think you could make the argument senator that are in maybe a good lawyer plaintiff lawyer can do this\nOr just go to good litigation attorney could do this this is kind of a it's a Rico deal like these groups are working together to deny other people their right to movement free movement which is guaranteed under our constitution ... association\nOr they're ... they're acting in a way to deprive others I I

else that you serve the wake us up you're exactly right Democrats had been playing off is for the last hundred years this time for Republicans to stop being a minority party in ... and and grow and grow up and\nYou don't have to grow up and become a you know stop playing defense this is this is the time right now\nA senator for do ah there's so much a that is happening uh which is positive or in this administration\nThe news has been a ... ... only negative uh because ... that's just where the media are they're not going to that ... I mean we've had this NAFTA deal path okay a or B negotiate has to pass the Senate\nEveryone said this couldn't happen they said Trump was a big uh ...\nUh Obama ridiculed I'm going to made his way this magical hours I'm going to renegotiate all these deals well you know didn't took actually work to do this like Nineteen months of work I and and you know you always hear nothing on this huge lower milestone for this administration\nIt's huge but it's part of a is part of what's going on this this economy is growing at twice the rate it did\nUnder President Obama we have a new free trade agreement with South Korea were about how wall with Mexico and Canada Europe is talking about zero terrorists we have China paying stepping up and paying attention to us now we have a nuclear\nConversation going on with North Korea to to end up in denuclearization of North Korea this president's agenda is working at all we talk about is what the Democrats want us to talk about that what you're saying is that we need to be on the off is talking about what's working in his agenda before we get into these elections in a few weeks\nI I can tell you the senator no one's going to want to try to stop\nMe moving in a public street or tried to harassment restaurant\nOkay there's a new I tolerate that anyone comes in my family and my kids they they they better be ready they better be really ready because this is I I'm not intimidated by some\nRich kid who lives at home with his parents and and it's free time you know jumps on the move on dot org website to get his marching orders okay like go home to rich parents and and and who pay for your your three square meals a day and you're you're you know your your activism on the side of it I just it just doesn't impress me I call these people right after their faces\nLaw that's where we're going to be ... this week and it starts right here in the United states at people who are supporting this actively encouraging and fighting it we have a state representative that\nActually was involved in our altercation on Monday a state representative from from Arizona okay of all places here in Washington these are not genuine people who are ... out\nA doctor for it or anything else these are paid activists this is a George Soros conspiracy and it's time we wake up expose them in stand up and fight for our country because that's what's at stake here\nYou think we have enough Republican money bags types to counter the effort is dire and Soros because they're just pumping tens of millions of dollars in both or into voter registration and two are educating people in these training sessions\nOn how to approach new voters uh this is you know they're going to the ... the new a Puerto Rican voters and in Florida and and lay on the line on them like oh Trump hates you and you had to throw the Republicans out and Georgia you see this tight governor's race\nWhich is really disturbing to Stacey Abrams Rayburn Susanna left wing or Georgia could elect a left wing Stacey Abrams to be governor great state of Georgia\nThis is what you were saying earlier one of the one of the good byproducts of this is I think it's a wake in the Republican base a was a little pass it particularly in Georgia maybe this year but I'll tell you this um that race and George has drawn thirty million dollars from a a Mike Bloomberg and ... and two other California investors what they're doing\nFrom um [noise] uh Mike Bloomberg and ... and two other California investors what they're doing is they're California investors in New York donors are trying to sneak into Georgia instill that governor's race because they believe that's the way to the presidency and twenty twenty to get those electoral votes down there and it's just not going to happen we're not going to let that happen Laura\nI'm David Perdue a hearing the lowering them show a Jeff Flake yesterday seemed to kind of shift the goalposts a little on Kavanaugh or maybe it was just commenting on his overall demeanor with the committee let's listen\nI was very troubled by the the tone of the of the remarks or the initial a defense that a judge ... capital gave a ... was something I Hope that I Would sound that indignant if I were a if I felt that I was unjustly\nMaligned but then it went on and the interaction with the members were sharp and partisan and that concerns me\nA year reaction was concerning to you Kevin ... face of a old are low but your\nFloor he did exactly what I Would have expected him to do he was in ... and he should have been listening to what these guys are saying Chris Coons says if judge Kavanaugh seeking a lifetime appointment this rink court\nAnd who I think now bears the bears the burden of this proving these allegations that presumption of innocence has been a trashed in this whole process is not convenient for the Democrat I mean they talk about him being Cory Booker again cause an evil\nOr the other one said a a Yale alum said people will die I mean the vernacular here has risen to a level that we haven't seen in decades Laura and it's dangerous Republicans had better not be asleep at this because these people are now mobilized they're funded\nAnd quite frankly this is just this the tip of the sphere of water are there ... there are more activity I actually\nA Center for do in Georgia just going back briefly to this very tight governor's race\nUh what is your sense what are the people need to know I'm again this was this poll by landmark pretty decent polling outfit I likely voters hum\nAnd it was basically a forty five forty five dead heat or the governorship is very important for so many reasons the state of Georgia\nAnd the growth economic growth and George has been very strong ah but what could a left wing governor due to that growth\nWell here's what they what she's saying she wants a single payer and she won't always give away programs that would cause a state tax has to be tripled this is the most extreme liberal progressive candidate that Georgia has ever had and she's getting funded by all these outside donors not donors in Georgia by the way\nAnd so what's happening is all of this conversation about war women everything else has can do the issue Georgia right and it was rated the best state in the country and what to do business and she wants to tear that down\nWe have a great Republican candidate Brian Kemp is going to make a great governor and Republican so they get the vote out we will win that election\nI think that uh the people of Georgia and maybe they've gotten a little uh a little\nBit of an awakened awakening during the entire cabinet ideal I think camp should make this a huge issue down there and push push this uh the Stacey Stacey Abrams\nEnough just come out in the cabinet thing but I Would push a right to the wall and on nothing I mean it and the figurative way not literal way said don't start talking about and you can't even say anything anymore and everyone's in every little word you say like slice and dice buddies left wing groups again funded by George Soros hateful little people in their basements\nUm but I I Hope they continue to press this issue because I think can't imagine that people in Georgia like what they say\nOn it was funny because when\nYou were listening to be taught giant nine Seventy Katie WM shallow twelve Seventy Katie J

actually coached on lie detector testing were together for the four days leading up to the actual writing a letter from the twenty sixth of the thirtieth\nIt would appear this is a conservative a tree house they would appear that Ford was with McLean again the retired FBI agent and former former New York field office spokesperson at the time she wrote the letter the Feinstein\nThat would certainly begin to explain quite a bit about who exactly was handling ms Ford and how there would be an intentional effort from a subject matter expert on how to best position the attack against Kavanaugh\nWho better to scrub the Internet history and know what process he is and people to enlist in such preparatory work than a retired lawyer who were deeply inside the FBI a lot of people are saying deep state was involved in all this not only did ms McLean possess a particular set of skills to assist system is forward\nBut ms McLean would also have a network of de OJ an FBI resources to assist in

because they want to know what you can get done in a week an FBI background\nBut this FBI connection with the woman she was now reportedly within ... beach it's fascinating\nSo again if you want to

fathers\nAnd husbands and I would stick to all those issues congressman because I think this I think this is Brett Kavanaugh issue even though you're in the house and it's all determined in the Senate I think it cuts across party lines I think it is an awakening for Republicans this midterm election cycle your thoughts\nYeah do you you're you're right on the money is I I Want without wanting it a path\nBut this one the millions and billions being spent and then the tactics that you mentioned my town hall there they seven hundred activists came up from the laughs wearing a pastor as he gave the opening prayer at my left town hall it's all all on video people go Google it and that people just leapt door walkers were spanberger\nA campaign just left a piece on my house my daughter is home alone for people show up at the door looking at my windows taking pictures walking around my house to leave a piece of ... health day\nThat my daughter has to retrieve you half hour later she stayed in the house that go out that God uh and then the young man that was busted we have video of all of it ends up talking to spanberger within a half hour\nAnd so I you know what do you conclude from that ah it it's not good out their their their you know patient people at a restaurant\nA note due process or in it it's the leftist fighting with tactics we've just never seen before it especially on the phone right now but it's a get out there no matter where you are in this country and support a support good conservatives are that are out there running because they need help right now there's a lot of folks\nAre that are deep down in numbers I'm running a tight one and so all they need help too but uh it just ... you're right or we just need to stay on message at\n... ... one of the biggest thing Iran I was immigration and the left there's nothing that separates that the mainstream voting rights uh Seventy eighty percent issue the left right and I was ... open borders\nA sanctuary city is no rule of law that they are they running as moderates but they're left of JFK by a mile and so that's the big new change\nYeah it's a radical you know we have ... real results in this Republican a majority the results versus radicalism\nIt's yeah in fact her feelings it's information over intimidation results over ... over and over and over again\nYeah GDP is four point to right now it's going to be over four and a half but\n... it's what Kennedy achieve what you did your Kennedy did supplies\nI but I Will tell you David uh Dave I'll tell you this and I tell us on my Republican friends running numbers don't make it numbers there's a reason your opponent is doing a commercial with a a with a medically challenge child\nIt's about emotional ... so you have the emotional argument is your father is your son's your brothers and real victims of sexual assault has been a had been you have ... are in jeopardy because of what's happening in Washington\nIn ... and that that's right that's what you need I mean I ... the numbers are you know that's it's great\nBut you get people to outlaw hung up on a motion to\nDo with that my my opponent said don't don't look at the numbers that skinny number and my response to that and go look at a hundred billion Walmart shoppers\nWhose sales are through the roof and that the kitchen table issue right everybody's life is way better off now everybody ... thousand bucks back in the pocket and it it's a family issue it is a kitchen table issue in so they\nAre they're they're running against the good News I'm I like where we are but uh\nWe we just got to have all our our entire team start focusing and messaging together and like you said we gotta type stories that's where I ended up people\nIs Ryan and raising money for you if he's raising money just for the a congressional campaign a committee but is he ... ... ... raising money in parties are you getting money from them\nYeah Yup yup Paul Ryan's or helped out in a a bunch of other outside groups are committed to help out\nA thank goodness and so what they're doing that around the country\nAnd uh we were we can win and the economy is so fundamental right and it's just it's not just the numbers the optimism every small business I go meet with the buying a new truck or buying a new little piece of capital equipment they're hiring one more person but that's a huge deal most of where I live which has made like small businesses\nAnd they're all at a good mood so it's like you said that the key is they have to get out and vote they cannot stay home we need everybody out everybody in a boat tell your church\nYour church your business is your sports clubs just all the good decent people need to get out and vote\nFor we're not backward you want to go forward we need to go forward like this was optimistic pro American pro American worker pro manufacturing base\nAnd thank God we have people in Congress like Dave Brat and a President Trump President Trump by the way is in the rose garden yesterday uh oh was it yesterday on Monday started Monday during the NAFTA announcement said this\nI really believe that the people of our country they want the wall and they want border security they don't want to open borders like the Democrats want to have\nAnd I really think I have a very big decision to make some time right after the election very quickly do I want to do it before the election personally yes but I don't want to do that for a different reason 'cause I have some very fine people that are running in close races in uh may affect them and it may not it may be good for them I happen to think it would be good for them\nI think Trump is usually rightness political calculation is he is he right to put this off though in a Republicans until after the election\nIt either way it's his call I mean usually with a problem in the budget process it we've lost our leverage right we we let it be known nine Senate Democrats will block us\nAnd so right now we don't at the beginning of the cycle or it after the election our laboratory back to a hundred percent so he's probably right on that call and uh we got to have a fight on that one right that was one of the biggest rally and cries up his election\nAnd of mine and the people want to see it and a nine Senate Democrats lock it uh we got to let the world see that and and the whole parties gotta come behind the president on this immigration issue because it is the issue\nAlready got to come behind the president on the immigration issue because it is the issue that just divides the crony elites up in the city from the average person back in my district yeah everybody I talk to you you want a wall you want to be able to or do you want to get rid of\nA gang activity and ... it's not just immigration is tied to the opioid problem than no three hundred billion doses of you know in order this year in one year\nThat's like human trafficking that's like the gang activity right down to the family mental health depression of the kids is up Seventy percent\nThat's all tied it we've been working like crazy with that on our with our share of the immigration is intimately linked to all these other fundamental social problems we have you don't get it right or we're not going to solve these problems\nUh Dave Brat here on the lower income show go to Dave Brat dot com help them in this race he's one of the finest US Congressman that we have serving in America today he's he's with the president on all these critical issues and we need more Dave Brat and Congress and we need him to
