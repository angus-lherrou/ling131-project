FBI report which the committee has reviewed on a bipartisan basis was there ever a whiff of any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse he wants to some of that\nReally she thinks that the tweets that Grassley has been sending out miss characterize what's in these FBI find\nIt so it's it's casting a poll that there might be more information about sex abuse or alcohol abuse in\nThis FBI ...\nLet's go to Scott Connecticut on line three ...\nUh the I think a lot of people I've lost and appreciation for actually how profound your through all the political saturation of all you know the back and forth how profoundly positive you exposure of the left or they're they're I mean they're rabid\nAggressive approach to your to need need for power um it's\nIt's really almost like a like a drug addict addicted to the drug they're addicted to the pursuit of power so they're literally anything to get there and what's happened in this Kavanaugh hearings literally\nFrom what I you know for I'm fifty three years old and from what I can see this is literally one of the most important periods of time\nTo witness you know that they it's their own destruction they did it to themselves but everybody else can now see I mean I've got plenty of Democrat from that or\nIt's just common sense you take a look at what what's been going on and everything that they're loving it this guy and they're really taking themselves down they did it for themselves and it's very very odd\nYeah that was the uh that was the opening show last night now if there's any doubt in anyone's mind just how\nOut of control the Democrat Party is how they want to so chaos where we should have calm where they want to rebel routes and intimidate instead of show results intimidation over ideas\nThat's where it is\nI think about it it's intimidation tactics you saw in the elevator and the restaurants in airports intimidation over information\nAnd insights they intimidate this is all ... they're the biggest bullies in town they're intolerant other of other people's views while they claimed to be the most tolerant they call you haters while they're the most hateful\nThey say that you're anti immigrant when all they do is talk about white privilege racist and you're they're obsessed with race we want all people to be treated\nThe same the rule of law should treat all people the same doesn't matter what color your skin is when you cross the border illegally that's the that's why the law so important doesn't give preference over one group or another shouldn't a five five forty Laura glass half full I Believe that's coming up next a former assistant FBI\nA a staffer from New York has interesting insights on what we're about to find out or not about these reports\nYou're listening more angering your healthy radio addiction on a mountain top giant nine Seventy gaining WM show a\nWild Seventy a DJ I Hope\n\nThe ... that are real life story from community debt management I had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nIf you're in depth and you need help coal trinity a one eight hundred seven mine for over four three something to talk to a certified comes from where\nThey were able to take all of my different payments and put them altogether\nTrinity will consolidate your accounts to do one easy to manage monthly payments put a stop to late fees and over limit charges reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you'll save the house\nAnd they were actually able to work with my creditors or being able to pay off to Fifteen thousand dollars in the last Eighteen months\nNot make a copy of it I don't know if they're going to allow it to make notes I don't know how they're gonna stop that and\nUm and then they can leave that for the next person to review but this is it's just a matter of time before something like that leaks out\nBottom line is how many and abused you have to do are\nAs many as it takes to delay this past the election that's what\nIt looks like they're out of cards so the the current day I'm going down on this don't you don't you get that sense there's no there's no more delays are going to vote on this this weekend\nI think those should not be any more delays you do the best you can do in the bottom line is the only thing that the that the Democratic side of the house really wants to hear is how many more interviews you can come up with people day after day after day that have something negative\nDue to allegedly offer ... and only to delay or looking at a a vote I think this is a ... it's going to be voted on I Believe by the end of the week\nThe um the complaint is that they did not\nInto judge Kavanaugh's drinking when he was in college or law school or high school that that wasn't adequately investigate it and the supplemental what was your response to that ...\nHow do they know that if they ever read uh how do they know what's in the supplemental you know they they don't know what questions are asked who was interviewed they might very well have interviewed a couple of guys that the the judge has some beers with\nOr who said yeah I had beers with them and nothing ever happened to you know they don't know that they just surprising that they just want to keep the pot stir it up in order to the you know continue that the alleged doubt\nA contrived out I look at it is but those that are opposed to the\n... we have an update here that Bill Bill a question for you Ronan Farrow in the New Yorkers are reporting that ah the FBI prove ignored testimony from former classmates have Kavanaugh these are people that went to Yale with him and uh they ... the ... they're trying to\nRonan Farrow claims he's a primary eyewitnesses are witnesses to the Deborah Ramirez allegations the problem is as you read into the store you realize these are all here say witnesses who claim somebody told them that somebody told them that this happened\nSo would the FBI pro those people are they're just seen as not credible witness is\nProbably not credible witnesses and and bottom line first of all is coming from Ronan\nA secondly I'm a these if they're if they're not I witnesses after that they not permitted on the stand and a quarter law never mind are doing this and it you have to make that cut off someplace into what is ... you know calm and what does make sense to do\nAnd none of these people make sense than anybody can come up with some sort of a story I heard from a friend of a friend that doesn't that doesn't carry any weight with anybody mhm\nWell again people think that the FBI is conducting some global investigation into any allegation no matter how remote\nAnd interviewing people on a hearsay basis where people have just hearsay recollections of things that happened Thirty years ago it make sense\nMakes no sense floor and that's not happening I think the problem that exists here uh the bureau is going to get sucked on the one way or the other if it comes out the way it appears it's going to come out the the the the the Democratic side of the houses are going to say they're all from Trump bands from the bureau\nIf it if for instance something comes out that that does give everybody a pause and ... and it's credible uh then you know the beer is going to take a black guy from the other side of that was I just think it's a it's a very tough way to go but it's an investigation that um was demanded and done and let's get the vote\nI think again in the end people want to have\nPeople to have faith in our in our institutions of government especially like the FBI and\nYou you don't want to believe that the FBI is acting in a political manner ever and I think that the media do an enormous disservice went on an issue like this with no you know with with no corroborating contemporary contemporaneous witnesses\nTo expect field agents or the FBI to be doing these types of\nYou know broad ranging ... is this kind of broad ranging slew thing into the background of some and this is not what is what the FBI does and people don't either get that or the media has been so remiss\nIn not reporting properly what they're all the FBI is\nBut if you see the ignorance that it's a willful ignorance of the media and then the the poor people who don't know any better or who don't have time to delve into these issues I'm like wait why are they keeping the secret is outrageous this shouldn't be secret this is our Supreme Court you know that's going to happen\nOf course it's going to happen we write is a combination of everything that you said or bottom line is the some of these people\nTruly don't believe um that does anything going on it's wrong here it's because of who they support they have to say well I Believe that uh\nThat the judge Kavanaugh is guilty that you can't look at the facts and come out with that conclusion but they do\n... you're on the lower Ingram show bell thanks so much for spending some time with that former assistant director the FBI\nWe'll get to all your calls eight

that there is no cooperation I'm going to be fair here I'm not going to ruin a this guy's life on the basis of two people who testified who I think are fair if there is no cooperation and that's certified by the FBI\nThe Atlantic has a piece out um here's why white women are abandoning the G O P A new evidence suggests that many of the women may now agree\nAh and they were made some joke about Tina Fey um who took white women to task after the Trump election who helping him get elected providing him with\nFifty two percent of their support Faye Faye focused her remarks on college educated white women forty four percent home of whom voted for Trump saying chastising them for wanting to go back to watching HGTV and forget about the election you can't look away she said\nWell now a it looks like some women are taking that to heart a morning console political poll found that President Trump's net support among Republican women had dropped by night teen points\nWell that's a huge drop if that's if that translates into people voting for the Democrat Party that could be a disaster for the geo pay\nWell I think that is that the biggest\nBut both change in the electorate concern for the Republicans and and victory points for the Democrats so far which is that the closet what I Would say the closet conservatives in the country are actually independent suburban women [noise] who voted twenty points for Romney who voted probably\nThirteen fourteen points for ah for for President Trump\nA and they've been up for grabs I think the Democrats than making\nVery good kind of momentum with them I don't think\nThis cabinet nominations never hope that I always thought that a woman nominee who even a woman nominee what might have been more conservative would actually have been the right strategic choice here\nI I think Republicans have held on to the working class voters Trump took but those are the voters were up for grabs and I don't see anything coming out of the Republicans to women back\nYeah well the again you would think the economy which is of course on fire women care about prosperity and security and all those\nIssues that Trump has focused on 'em but nevertheless at twenty September twenty six\nUs see uh LA Times poll\nCounted twenty eight for ... or ... percent point advantage for Democrats among all women eight twenty eight percent advantage among married white college educated woman women a group along tied to the G O P the Republicans now lead by only five points they had a much bigger\nA much bigger lead among that group of women before but now those are low as well um this is this is a substantial block or the\nMarried college educated women that's a substantial block but among all women I mean I I think a lot of this might be tone you know Trump's tone women like things calm they like things to be calm down and I think that they they sense that things are chaotic and\nThey seem to be blaming the Republicans so that maybe the stuff for the last couple of weeks might change that I don't know\nWell but they're also more skeptical about the economic progress if you look men are like wow this economy is through the roof\nWomen who've as you're right we point out typically are even more concerned about the economy and its effect on them and their family or less understanding of an improved economy and that's another area where the Republicans have really failed to drive their message what every day\nEvery day that the the national question is is she\nA rapist or not\nIs it David openings focusing on the economy I mean you've seen the last day or two incredible jobs numbers ... uh come out and the focus is primarily you know in the cabinet issue and it's going to stay that way at least through you know middle of next week probably\nYeah and that's um I think that's why I'm Mitch McConnell wants this vote to happen as soon as possible this is what my barnacles said this morning on MSNBC let's listen\nA lot of Republicans have come home and the state of Florida and the Gillum race he was comfortably ahead you can go to other states that show\nAgain the races are tightening in do you think that perhaps Donald Trump did see data that shows that this is driving conservative than conservative voting base\nUp back home of course he didn't do plays exactly to Donald Trump strength the one thing he is an expert in is resentment and specifically in this case white male resentment\nMale resentment um I think the white privilege discussion is\nDriving even more men though to the Republican Party I think people are really getting tired of this identity politics I'm Mark I I think that that Democrats have gone way too far in uh\n[noise] well ... as you do a for a long time I I've been against both class warfare and identity politics\nAs a as a moderate Democrat you know I've always been against those two in favor of current or the right kind of you know social policies and balance I think what's really happening here is that\nThe Democrats were completely energize they were looking for an opportunity to vote against Trump and the Republicans without a leader without a particular message we're incredibly disorganized\nAnd I do think this thing has awakened the Republican base you know in a in a way that it's backfiring on the Democrats unfortunately\nUh [noise] I think they still have an edge but I think they probably could have had to wipe out the way this thing was heading and and now I think you can see it kind of a balance among turn out here because the stakes of this election have been just raised you know so high now\nYeah and I I Do think that\nAgain you see what the Republicans are capable of when they stand United with the exception of the\nThree I'm more liberal Republicans who you know are are dragging their feet on the on the nomination ah the\nThe party when it's United is pretty formidable I mean even if ... bunch of older white guy pretty formidable ... never seen Mitch McConnell so you know it's so good as he's been in the last week just as a political matter\nWell but see that's ironic thing that I think you'll see this in the Senate races and I think you see a lot of the Senate races\nTightening up because the Republicans are coming home and there's no question that this Kevin ... is a highly partisan ice vote and if you're in a state that voted forty courts for Trump you know there's no question that is going to be a large percentage\nMore way above a majority that would run a sea confirmatory in the Senate this has done a lot I think\nFor the Republicans you know in the house you know not so much you know Ryan quit his job and I didn't leave there's no leadership\nMuch you know Ryan quit his job and didn't leave there's no leadership there is no message we're we're McConnell or as you say has stepped up maybe some people think we're leaving some people you know what I think too harshly but as you said he stepped up you've got the message leading in the house there's nothing\nYeah houses are less it's right or left in it that Paul Ryan should have left if he's going to retire should've left to let this thing it'd be taken over by someone who wants to fight for these issues Paul Ryan's basically not even a factor right now a Mark Penn thank you so much for joining us it's always great to talk to you on radio and on the angle will\nTake a break a five five forty Laura do you believe that this uh the politics of rage that we're seeing right now I think the people that Trump was embodied the politics of rage\nUh but now it seems like the Democrats have taken on that role at least during this cabin I issue\nHow does that translate in November are you voting have your vote are some people have already voted voting early encouraging others to vote you got to spread the good news if you believe in going forward in this economy and you believe in this basic principle of fairness and as mark said if you really shy away from my identity politics\nA political correctness used as a cudgel to silence people you've got to vote you got to get out there and vote and vote Republican
