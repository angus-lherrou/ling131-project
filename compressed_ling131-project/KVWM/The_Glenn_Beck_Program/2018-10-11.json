to change the narrative about the rabid left turn\nOf not that hurricane but their own party that Donald Trump goes to a rally because tens of thousands of people were waiting and there was nothing he was going to be able to do at this moment that wasn't being done to help the people in the panhandle and as you can see from the comments from Rick Scott Marco Rubio and\nRhonda Santas they were getting all the help they need it and then some and the preparedness on the part of a Florida was just it's amazing and it's and it's a horrible thing to see this flood coming in a in the aftermath of hurricane Michael could have been a lot\nComing in a in the aftermath of hurricane Michael could have been a lot worse but uh it's still bad I mean that the fact that this storm actually moved in the direction that it did by twelve miles it hits the air force base didn't hit the residential area as it could have I mean this could have been\nI mean as bad as it looks this could have been a ... just heart wrenching loss of life\nSo we're going to find out more about this a as a day goes on as daylight hits the panhandle and you're able to see just how much damage was done or the strongest hurricane to hit the panhandle apparently ever\nA but again the area in which it hit was not where they thought it was initially going to hit on in Panama and Panama beach area so we thank God for that but still a huge amount of damage was done\nSo do you think Donald Trump doesn't care and that's why he went to do this rally in Pennsylvania like he didn't care\nBy the way the Democrats didn't care when when we lost in American ambassador in Benghazi Christopher Stevens after the attack on an American compound in Libya where we had four dead including the ambassador and\nPresident Obama\nDoesn't acknowledge that it's terrorism clearly clearly acknowledge it and they flew off to a the southwest to do an event\n\nNow it's what's good for the good is good for the gander but it

were obviously some you know with thousands of people lined up\nBy the time either make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours already otherwise it would have been really unfair all of the people that were weighed again we're talking about thousands and thousands of people\nA five five forty Laura or what could have done what can he do to satisfy the left I mean look at four point ... percent GDP is not satisfying the lap of renegotiating NAFTA\nDoesn't affect them they said he couldn't do it\nPutting China back on its heels doesn't

try to please the left do the right thing makes sure Florida is taking care of a it's a judgment call I could've gone either way on that frankly but it is pretty it is pretty hard\nWhen you have all these people there and you have taken care of business in Florida you got FEMA on it you got all the emergency station set up they're being given all the support they need and you're back in what two hours\nIt's it's I think it would have been a tougher call if it were in like Minnesota or California then it's five hours out five hours back but it's not like the\nPresident isn't constantly on the phone I mean he does have world class communication on air force one this is not like you just checked out of the hurricane but again you're not pleasing these people let's go to Dennis in Florida\nWest Palm Beach Florida where I just was over the weekend Dennis that red tide and I'm not talking about the kind we want was brutal I got my lungs still hurt from that red tide that fumes that uh I inhaled at the beach go ahead\nWe all have our issues\nHere in Florida it's part of our lives ... what I Would like to say though is the last night I don't know if anyone mentioned but the lady that was on from the Democratic party [noise] um I don't know if you noticed or not but when you were talking about someone being hurt or even killed she actually smiled I found that a bit frightening\nI miss that I got to go back and look at that I'm so focused on the show I'm not kind of looking at the at the gas and the double boxer yeah I I'm very worried that someone's going to get hurt\nOr with how left in ... and left wing and rabid and frenzied the left is becoming we're going to go back to the Eric Holder remind you a little bit more of why Eric Holder was always a problem he's going to be running for president\nIt's holder if Booker it's perhaps Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren maybe all Bernie Sanders going to give it another world ah but I'm going to remind you of what kind of person\nIn any a log that Eric Holder is later on in the show for those of you who've forgotten remember he said yesterday when they go low we kick them basically\nIs Michelle Obama must love that\nLet's go to Virginia and Calvin on line one I Love the name Calvin Calvin go have\nYes I see a red way called me\nA lot of leeway in part of the state where I live um we don't live up in a bubble the DC area we live out in the ... or we're just so you\nCan hear your Calvin ... call back when you're on a good line you're in a brutal line there but I Love the commonwealth of Virginia\nVirginia changed demographically and it's changed politically and the connection is obvious guy or immigration growing government presence it's changed Virginia but I think the good people or Virginia see what's happened with this economy they don't want to go backwards\nAnd anyone out there listening anyone you know in Virginia seventh district thinking you're thinking of of not voting or your complacent you better get out there and vote in the seventh district of Virginia specially and of course Dave Brat is what I'm Talking about\nThe day brat races key he is\nA Trump guy he is a conservative he is hard working he seeks to represent the interests of the citizens of the commonwealth\nOf Virginia and he does a great job get out and vote everybody has to get out and vote if you can already voted early vote early but\nGet out and vote Rhonda Santas in Florida he adds up against this Gillum this horrible socialist guilt we Florida\nGovernorships going to be a bad deal so everybody's got to get out and vote that he and he's getting millions\nAnd millions of dollars from a left wing billionaires Gillum humans as the mayor of aid at of one of the few cities in Florida that was handled and run really badly you want him nowhere near the governorship I can tell you that right now eight five five forty Laura oh let's go to Mike in Arizona on line three Mike\nHow are you I'm great I was so proud to be a conservative and I love my president I think you didn't ... I don't want him to cater to the Democrats have you go what their city and he should have\nBeen accused of being wrong then if you could go on down there and pay more attention in study showed leadership you do what you were supposed to get the ... or ... if you were suffering because\n[noise] so I see a red wave in our area I don't know of any Democrats are going to be elected year I'm I'm just like\nMy own and but just like you got to hand a timely she did the right thing on Kavanaugh I mean\nHe that would have been a real kick in the stomach of conservatives if he hadn't voted for Kevin ... so that's a good thing I'm going to look at the glass half full here because that's the only way you can go forward or the Federal Reserve though I Trump is I was going to do a segment on this last night on the show and we we we were so jammed up we couldn't do it\nWe're going to do it tonight on the anger my ankle so tuned in ten pm eastern Fox\nNews during one single more anger on the radio in the mountains giant nine Seventy WM J I\n\nThe fun starts to move indoors with friends and family to make sure your most important home improvement project is handled with select blind dot com interior designers agree that one of the easiest ways to improve rooms appearance is by upgrading your old blind shades and shutters\nSlick blinds makes ordering blind online simple and easy the of high quality easy to install blind shades and shutters you can look at them today and select one dot com\nSelect lines takes the guesswork out of ordering blinds on line by offering unbelievable deals plus select lines has the most online reviews and five star ratings on the planet\nGo to the website you'll see five star ratings that'll make you smile that's more than a million by the way satisfied customers just go to select blinds dot com the simple and smart way to get lines\nWhatever Donald Trump does he's gonna be attacked\nAnd these people don't like him they wake up in the morning they say I Know what he's done something terrible what is it and that's kind of their approached everything right now and it makes them frankly a little bit nutty\nWell and I think that uh again the the theory and the frenzy\nAh has gotten to a point knew that when I was talking to folks\nSay yesterday who were in Washington in the Nineteen sixty eight riots after Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy or both assassinated\nAnd they were saying that they hadn't seen anything is is angry and frenzied since then do you think that's accurate\n\nYeah I think I think basically you had extraordinary intensity up through Watergate you had a\nMemory at a million people surrounding the Pentagon at one point or you had soldiers who found that they couldn't go through airports are being harassed or they knew it was a very bitter very divisive time uh but I think after that\nUh we became sort of more normal for a while and uh now we're drifting back a because this is a genuine a cultural civil war I mean you know [noise] what Hillary Clinton said that it wasn't and actors and shot some people but she's basically right or when we're point\nOr somebody like a justice cabin on\nIts because we want to return to a constitutionally based\nCourt system that uses the American system is this model not some European or South African or other kind of system and as a result if your a left wing a Democrat we we we are at the end of your world ... you know they had hope desperately to change America and now\nThe American people are responding and saying no we don't want to say we liked Being American and I think that has become just an enormously bitter blow for the\nUh people who who thought up until election night two thousand sixteen they were ... Hillary Clinton who's gonna when they go at the two justices you got\nAnd he'll or even ... oh my God you know they'd be so far to the left and so so unwilling to look at the American constitution that it will really been a very dramatic difference compared to where we are now or I Want to play\nFor you or Larry ... who of course famously bombed in his protection for twenty sixteen but nevertheless has this protection for the midterms\n... has ever been an abnormal presidency were in it\nAnd the Trump is violated sold many of the rules of politics and so many of the norms of politics a red wave ain't going to happen it's just a question of how big the blue wave is sick it'd be sued ami it could be a middle sized way they can be a small way it's going to be a blue wave\nOr what is your reaction thought well maybe he's right with probably isn't\nI'm In the first question I asked is how come we just won a you a state Senate special election\nIn Texas state Senate seats in Texas were bigger than congressional seats eight hundred thousand people along the border sixty three percent a Hispanic ah and we won the first time in a hundred and thirty nine years what's his explanation\nOr how come a mix Sally the Republican nominee in Arizona is now head or how come that uh Kramer the Republican candidate in\nNorth Dakota is ahead by maybe fourteen points or in his in ah\nTennessee is people to realize that Britain is actually the Democrat actually wrote a book explaining that Obamacare didn't go far enough and explaining how you could get to a government run health system branch and starting to fall apart mhm and Tennessee is going to end up affecting remotely I'm just getting a sense of\nYou know somebody else a sabbatical and say uh where is the worst of the blue wave in the Senate I don't think it exists\nNow and of course we see these races in somebody's governors' races the one that I'm really watching is the Andrew Gillum\nVersus Ron I'm a dissent is because for me and for so many of watch the growth of Florida and how well it's been a run by Rick Scott\nAn end to the idea of turning that state over is critical that state is in a country electoral politics to a guy who is basically a socialist is just that just cannot happen and yet he's getting millions and millions of dollars nude from all the usual suspects\nCharlie Chaplin I mean you'll um is ah\nThe latest great hope because he came out of nowhere as a radical Democrat uh he won an upset primary victory or eat the\nKey temporarily looks very good I think you'll be fading day by day as this goes on but ... but when you say governorships remember that there's a study just came out the ten most popular governors in states\nAre all Republican every single one of the ten highest rated governors or Republican or the governor of Massachusetts hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide the governor of Maryland hardly a red state is gonna win or in a landslide and the reason is exactly why they were building a majority in the country\nThey get results\nThey don't just have resistance are they actually have things that work they don't just have fantasies and strange ideas and I think we have to be prepared to wage a campaign that drives home again and again and again\nThe difference between a the kind of left wing fantasies that are not you can't afford them you can implement them a long run they're not going to work and I think that's one of our key jobs this campaign is to draw the distinction between results and resistance\nAnd certainly the attorney General Holder was a perfect example of a resistance says the alternative\nYeah I I really think and again we'll see how it translates into turnout\nI I really think and again we'll see how it translates into turn out I think those images of the protesters banging on the Supreme Court doors completely out of control\nOr I think that's I\nDon't think people like that they do not like everything Trump tweets or\nThey might be annoyed at some of the things he says are exaggerates crowds I what\nI get that but I think the this frenzy people want it all to calm down they just want things to calm down they want to come down on both sides and I so I think the Democrats made a really bad miscalculation on this ... thing and\nI think it puts them in a much more vulnerable place in a midterm cycle that they thought they you know they were going to just roll right into with you know fifty seat pickup ah so that's my sense of it in holders comments Maxine Waters\nI don't know I think all of it is it gives people a bad feeling\nWell and I think you can draw the contrast you mean here you have an economy which is booming at a level people said was impossible your jobs being created your lowest\nBlack on unemployment in history the lowest Latino unemployment in history or you have a remarkable achievers would deregulation you have solid conservative judges being appointed so every time you turn around right now are you seeing genuine results\nAnd then you have as you point out um people who seem crazed\nUh I mean is this really the America you want you really want people who come into a restaurant to harass people and drive them out you want people banging on the Supreme Court doors and I and I think in some cases of course we know that George stores and others actually pay for them\nOr which doesn't you know does that justify him but the whole system that the left to try to create I think is in the end or not a sustainable system\nNewt I Know you're doing a lot of uh\nOf events before the midterm uh elections and there's one on October fifteenth or\nWhere you can register to um attend an evening with Newt Gingrich and you'll be able to hear you talk about what's in store for the country what's at stake for the country in the mid term so how do people end up uh attending this do they do and and and let me\nLet me just say also that we're we're very excited they can go to\nAn evening with Newt dot com I just repeat the and the evening with new dot com Leo beep and I are going to be they're talking about our American story and I'm going to take questions and frankly let the audience to direct me I'm going to let them sort of pick what other topics we should talk about\nWell that's fantastic oh my gosh that's it will be a lot of great an evening with new dot com so you can go there and I'm just have a lot of fun and look it's time to\nIt's time to stand up to the America you want and I think I think Americans have they have a good you know BS detector Newt for\nAn ... an artful way of saying it but I don't know ... with with Trump's eccentricities came amazing results I mean I eccentricity as we all have them but incredible results in ... including the handling of this hurricane I might add a and you just have to look you know Rick Scott's\nI'm sending my candidate for US Senate and I approved this many\nBy an immigrant

worse\nThan um you expected and are we approaching perhaps a Nineteen sixty eight\nStyle a type of frenzy in the streets\nBut I think we're ... or beyond that now I think it's worse that I've seen in my forty five year journalism career yeah basically a nexus of ah the media the corrupt media I'm now a promoting embracing um whatever word you want to use the most\nRadical progressive movement ever seen in this country ever in the history of the country\nSo you have a guy's like and everybody knows this named George Soros but others as well with unlimited amounts of money we're basically um formed organizations\nAttack and destroy people with whom they disagreed this is why it's different than the Tea Party or the uh uh hypocrites on CNN and MSNBC who you know from day to day will change their story depending on what they're told to do\nUm you have now a bevy of organizations and you saw in the cabinet hearings\nThat send people out these aren't mob people these are targeted\nPeople who are paid to do certain things\nYou know to confront senators in elevators or with the CNN camera right behind them to ah prevent um Senator Cruz and his wife from having dinner the these aren't accidents\nAre right to get Bill O'Reilly off the air\nNot an accident mhm\nOkay so you have this and in the past journalism reporters would have investigated it because this huge money behind it but they don't now\nInstead they promote it they're in business with the radical left in business with them CNN and MSNBC make money lots of it promoting the most radical\nProgressive organizations in the country which will stop at nothing including violence to get political power so that's what we're looking at\nDo you think that ah the president's handling of this\nAh the star and the way he's addressed it has been helpful has it been illuminating\n\nI don't think he knows what's going on\nThe way I just laid it out to you and your listeners\nI I just don't think he knows what's going on I don't think he knows the seriousness look whenever you have organizations\nThat are in the shadows that people never heard of I'll give you one color of change Mm All right and you've got twenty of them\nAnd they take their orders from big money the radical left people All right they say okay you pay us this and we'll do that the woman who confronted senator\nFlake in the elevator is paid one hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nBy George Soros funded foundations\nWas widely reported Laura you hear that\nMm no no no\nOkay and so people think it's spontaneous oh this woman just showed up to yell at a flake because she's a victim or whatever she said she is that's not what's happening and you know I I draw the correlation between what's happening in America now what happened in Germany\nIn the late Nineteen twenties and Nineteen thirties we've had a fanatical movement Nazi ism\nAccumulating power behind the scenes by violent methods\nAre there and it was big money in it as well okay while the population was looking away wasn't interested was engaged and the media in Germany uh basically we're afraid of the Nazis and they wouldn't tell the truth about that\nThat was more of a fear thing than a than a\nWhat we have now is that the media in America is ideologically in line with the progress ones there cause in the media is the same cause a George Soros so it was a little bit more extreme than the editors of the New York times but not much [noise]\nSo this big picture that's formulated over the past I Would say ten years um I don't think President Trump understands it\nUm and I'll give you another thing if I were President Trump I Would order an FBI investigation into the cabin or debacle\nBecause I Know and I think you do to that it was no accident Dianne Feinstein held back that letter from Dr Ford for six weeks that was not an accident\nIt was no accident it was leaked against Dr for its wishes which I'm not exactly sure were sincere\nBut let's say let's take it for face value that letter was leaked putting the woman in danger and it was leaked by somebody in Congress because only two people had the letter\nSo the FBI should be investigating that and should get to the bottom and I'll tell you if they start that investigation which I Would order if I were president that scandal that whole thing is going to unravel fast because that was no accident what happened a cabinet\nAnd the women were all the women are all lying by the way they were all line\nTwo and a couple of people are looking into this who actually knew or knew both of them now now you two of them and\nWhatever it was ... I went through this I went through this myself mhm right and and I saw things leveled against me that were insane\nAnd I you know at this point in this country people are going to have to want to make a decision by the progressive left this figured out that they have the media in their pocket and they can do what they want\nThey can do exactly what they want and they almost got capital they almost got him and does this kind of country what\n... is is it you're not going to get an honest take from the media they're not going to investigate things they're not going to try to find the truth except it\nExcept that because it's been ... been in play now for quite some time so who do you depend on to get the truth\nOnly the apparatus is the criminal justice system and I'll put forth that President Trump should really see a bigger picture he takes everything personally and he fights back effectively himself\nThe bigger picture he picks everything personally any fights back effectively himself but I don't know if you see in the big picture what's happening here you know once you start to a road basic rights like presumption of innocence you process which you say they don't matter as the senator from Hawaii say don't matter\nPresumption of innocence if somebody accuses you of misconduct none you're guilty because in the past some women have been abused I mean think about it\nThey're they're attacking the fundamental rights that Americans have un habitat\nAnd nothing what is what is being done nothing\nAnd I think bill I mean it's a division but I'm just so worried about it I Can't\nI Am too I Am petrified of this I I ... I completely agree with you and\nI was slammed for the last three weeks for saying just because someone alleges something and says this is my truth doesn't mean that you can just say okay this person\nHas to be fired this person has to be boycotted this person has to be a thrown to the kicked to the curb\nDenounced um put up on across crucified lose a promotion this has got to stop that 'cause I got up at anybody\nWell and it how it happened it happened to me it has to have obviously things happen to you look what happened to you things yeah and it it is a brutal unfair situation and and once you're accused of something where do you go to get your information that way\nAnd there isn't anybody in place to rectify it although President Trump could do it by trying to get to the bottom of this cabinet mess or new column posted on Bill O'Reilly dot com is it is about this issue mhm is about ... exactly about how uh your truth has replaced thought truth\nOkay so ... and I and I

funding the ah anti war protests of the sixties is that they became crazier and crazier and more ... more touch\nAnd what happened was was that they temporarily took over the Democratic party and they came up with a nominated George McGovern who was a lunatic and who got creamed by Richard Nixon in Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd it's so so the Democrats swore that we're going to happen again so they they took control of the party and nominate a centrist Jimmy Carter that won\nThe Republican the Democratic party has now spinning out of control again as it did in ah sixty eight virtually assuring that they're going to nominate a very extreme left is a Marxist Democrat who Trump will have an easy time defeating in two thousand twenty\nDo you think that because as mass\nImmigration and social media there is more of a chance of the country embracing that left wing radical ideology than it was a Nineteen Seventy two\nNow are they actually social media is just the opposite you know we we we it is taken power this is part of the reason why\nThe left are so enraged because they are losing power and authority the Washington Post is a sad joke itself let's face it the New York times is set joke CBS NBC ABC I Can't remember the last time\nI watched any programming on those three networks except for a football games are on a on Sundays on to the to the networks are but I don't know anybody who does is that their power is draining away too\nYou know the luring them show and the Fox news and two of you know Newsmax and one American news and conservative talk radio and blogs and ... so they become more and more and rage they become more and more marginal and they're doing just the opposite there were telling\nTheir marginal viewers Marshall readers or marginal listeners and send them send them all through the Republican Party which day by day is looking more calm and placid at a reasonable just because of the craziness of the Democrats\nSo it's important than that the president himself a I think appear\nCalm and this storm don't you agree with that and\nI wrote Donald Trump's image is set for the American people you know he can't he can't really altered or change it or what but but one thing they do believe\nIs is that he's done a pretty good job as president certainly better than bronco bomb and certainly better than Hillary Clinton would have done he's got a chance to improve his standing as as you know people uh you know a job approval and things like that as a ... economy can prove\nNorth Korea ISIS other things like this uh but it stand is pretty well fish but it's it's in he's in better shape\nThan the Democrats are worth a are at this point in time\nSo go go back and this goes back to the historical moment in we talked about this a bit last night since you're Reagan biographer I'm so many great Reagan books how Reagan dealt with the riots and will will play a bit of sound uh those if you missed the show last night let's listen to\nThose people who do four days in advance that if the universities to go ahead with that construction they were going to physically destroy the university\nAnd many negotiate what do you have to negotiate what is what it sees a public institution that's right but the universe its own community and for the community in Berkeley that live around all\nOf it began the first time some of you know better and are old enough to know better let young people think that they have the right to choose the laws they would obey as long as they were doing it in the name of social protest\nHe gets up any leads yes yeah that point what do you know construction he was talking about\nThere there was a there was a park there in Berkeley and they love wanted to uh build some type of bizarre a memorial to a Vietnam or you know the north Viet Cong soldiers something as bad as it was completely out of control it was just it was basically the left you know a stickler thumb in the eyes establishment is what it was all about\nBut what I Love about Reagan or old friend Marty Anderson who's to say that Ronald Reagan was\nHe said warmly ruthless and if you listen to Iraq and he says these professors somebody if you open up an audit no better you know the way he just did\nThem but so smoothly is so clearly and so you know a ruthlessly but it just it was the master of this type of thing\nAnd I I just I Love the fact that he ... he he went right to the ... the salient point here Craig which is that\nIf people are led to believe that there outrage or their emotions or can justify any conduct their behavior then we're in big trouble after ... that it's a huge huge problem\nSure but it is situational ethics and that's the difference today between the modern Democratic Party in the modern liberal movement in modern American conservatism is is that you know rule of law is one thing where is is that the rule of the mob is quite another by the way this idea that are over on CNN you can't use the word mop look up a Webster I tweeted out this morning\nWebster's Dictionary ... just a a describes a mob as being an unruly group of people set about to cause a political or people but that's what they've been doing for the last several weeks was exactly that so you can call them up because you're defended by the Webster's Dictionary\n[laughter] yeah I agree with the mob one of the Tea Party when they're dressed in period garb yeah and [laughter] that's\nWhere the left doesn't get it because they're incapable most people on the left is that they they're they don't they ... they think in a linear sense and they think well if the Tea Party at a protest and the liberals at a protest that must be one of the same no ... no one in the same id motives has everything to do with it\nNow and it's again it's\nFeeling feeling is enough yeah right as long as they feel and they're on the right side then that's all you need so if you feel like well you you if you want to want to stand up for women\nIn El ... then you then you got to go out and vote Democrat like what\nBut but that may be upset is before the show I beg your part of a hat but the difference today between a moderate conservative leader modern certain politician in a modern liberal politician is the liberal politician\nGoes before the voters says give me power so I can do good things for you and some voters go oh gee I felt pretty good you know it but it but a moderate\nAnd some voters go oh geez I felt pretty good you know it but it but a moderate conservative and that's an emotional response because because liberals going to do with the good things for you moderate conservative politician goes before the voters says give me power so I may give it back to you\n... have to think about\nIt you have to go through the intellectual discipline to realize what he's talking about which is a Republican form of government conservatism federalism\nWhatever iteration it comes in is that but it's about taking power away from Washington and send it back to the states and localities and ultimately the individual or the frame or ... founders intended to be there in the first place\nWell again power to tired of the people that are trying to find a lot that slogan but they never really the only\nThat's the Latin basis for the Republican\nYeah power to the people stays with them not so but some big nameless faceless bureaucracies a crack I Want to play one more thing fee then we're out of time now this was Jeane Kirkpatrick I think it was it the Nineteen eighty four Republican conventional Dallas yeah let's let's Harry Truman\nBasic source of our spring spirit\nWe believe in the dignity of man that\nUse to talk\nThat the San Francisco Democrats have very different\nGod she was great but she wonderful old friend um I was there on the floor in Dallas that unless you get that speech he also brought down the house when she called the Democrats the blame America First crowd\nThat forgot about that oh my gosh\nSpeech was a perfect desiring burner and and it just has so many applications today she quoted rebel and he said when he said that um that the civilization that feel guilty for everything isn't capable of defending itself", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Show Low", "day": "11"}
