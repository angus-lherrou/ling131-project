Democrats' chances\nOf a massive blue waves wave now slipping away because of cabin on probably this immigration and these great numbers on the economy that came out today with Trump's approval Republicans approval way way up um looks listen\nTrump is not a wholly new force in American politics he's but he is the most vivid manifestation of many of our worst characteristics you know the constitution was written for moments like this it assumed that we we're sinful and driven by ambition and appetite and greed\nTwice they made it so hard for us to get anything done\nThey basically bad that we would get things wrong\nMore often than we get them right and we have proven them correct uh with with astonishing regularity reaction to that\nBut I I agree with his analysis of the constitution but to what end at what point I don't understand the point he was making is is that what is Trump done to violate the constitution says like Trump is supporting the constitution that liberals were were ... were were opposing the constitution so I don't understand I don't understand his point\nNo I I again it's we're sinful because we elected Trump that's it that's why we're sinful it's not one of the because of of all this other stuff that happened and criminality and pornography and all the other things that we've embrace we're sinful because we elected Trump\nBy the way just a racket I think the ah the blue wave is going to turn out to be a leaky faucet\nBut [laughter] I I\nJust there's nothing I sense out the law there's no you remember Ninety four you could feel I mean I felt that there was an upheaval coming against Clinton and the elites are just everywhere as the Republicans were dominating\nA debate and winning the debate and know the Democrats were left just defending bill and Hillary who want to do that anyway especially since I got\nForty three percent of the two years before is that is as close as Trump is he still talking about issues that are
