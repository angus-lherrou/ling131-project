enough tradesmen and ... and what can you say tradesmen any more people who do trade\nWe don't have enough of of skilled uh labor's hand on hands on labor's we need that and that's where people from all walks of life all walks of life can learn a skill in your you can learn a skill after you left your your current career\nAnd work I'm not talking about being up on a roof and roofing that's more of a young person's job but you know what I'm Talking about the idea that America has to import uh foreign workers to do every American job is lunacy\nI when I grew up we didn't need that probably didn't have that problem when I when I was growing up Americans did all sorts of jobs from picking a tobacco which my brother did to picking fruit which I did\nWho I mean all of us did all of this work in yeah if you have to pay more to get Americans to do these jobs good you should pay more I told you and I was in Switzerland it was really interesting to talk to the Swiss about a Swiss jobs they don't do this big importation of laborers in Switzerland they don't do it\nThey didn't actually people who do everything from sweeping the streets to caring for children they get paid for doing that work eight five five forty ... let's go to Evie in Florida every [noise]\nHi Laura I again I think on on with this being an American the situation as far as the border but at the you know an American citizen here I I don't want to just think that this voting is going to help what more can we do\nWell the border the voter has to be enforced the president's right if these other countries won't enforce their borders we need to put a we need to put some thought into how we're going to better do it here and he's got to ... and if it's a national\nEmergency the president has extraordinary powers\nAnd drugs guns or criminal element or gangs we've already caught them trying to get into the country and we've already arrested people who are within the so called migrant population\nWho are only coming into the United states to hook up again contacts we brought you story after story about that\nAnd this president understands it they this president gets this like no one else how many have you saw the\nFrightening the frightening display last night on the anger mango it was called meet the chairman you remember that movie made the parents so it was called meet the chairman and I went through chapter and verse what would happen to various committees and the house of representatives\nOr if Republicans lose control of the house and let me tell you something forget the new Jamie Lee Curtis rendition of Halloween the movie the most frightening thing you can imagine is what's\nGoing to happen to the financial services committee the house ways and Means Committee the Appropriations Committee the intel committee the energy committee\nIf the Democrats have their way eight five five forty Laura let's go to Eric in Michigan Eric go ahead\n[noise] so I Believe that the\nEasiest and quick solution to the border problem would be to open the home studying act to all of the federal land for rounding border and as you can make a structure dwelling a part of uh being able to get into the home studying act\nYou could just as easily make if that they need to put up a barricade or anything or whatever and with the uh that's already covered the priority on any old studying act that open up your could wind up with a lot of our own study which would be helping all the American and at the same time\nCourt one hell of a wall dollar\nOf another interesting idea well our our callers have more interesting ideas and most Republican or Democrat congressman or Democrats just want an open border open borders open markets don't go away\nYou're listening to morning from your healthy radio addiction to mount some giant nine seven WM show somebody gay DJ I Hope\nThe ... that are real life story from trinity debt management\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nIf you're in depth and you need help cold trinity a one eight hundred seven mine for over four three something to talk to a certified towns where\nThey were able to take all of my different payment and put them altogether\nTrinity will consolidate your accounts into one easy to manage monthly payments put a stop to late fees over limit charges reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you'll save the house\nAnd they were actually able to work with my creditors or being able to pay off close to Fifteen thousand dollars in the last Eighteen months\nIt is and I got to tell you I saw that Chris Cuomo a prime time last night Steve Cortez as a warrior ... for the president he really is you know he he's a Latino in his president is a is Aaron\nCame here legally and he indoors so much defending the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I looked at as a model he I Know when I get off CNN after defending the president\nI get so many threats some of them death threats I'm certain ... gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing and for the fences I'm so proud of him and your um ... or ... the Democrats signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living\nTry and take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools they're just out in the country and they're working and they'd like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much under the president's leadership\nAnd then on the other side they see chaos identity politics constant cries of racism or an embrace\nOf illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been a case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders its it's beyond clear\nAnd I think it I think this blows up in the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue in actually pass legislation to stop this this is an emergency what's happening to this country\nAnd to learn the now with back there on the income and toward the border and I think the president is standing tall you know\nI I've been in politics since the Reagan Era and do you have to we first met in Washington back during the Reagan years\nYou know I've worked for Jack Kemp and and it was people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country and and had backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president like Donald Trump and have backbone\nWould never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd you saw what happened when the president just said simply nope I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have that are approved\nAnd confirmed a Brett Kavanaugh rethought spines grow and senators we didn't even think Adam any re Lindsey Graham was a hero\nOf German Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates from the strength and the White House and the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when\nHe came down that stairway in Trump Tower\nThen his speech which shocked everyone he promised parts of the word and they tried to conflate like you mentioned uh illegal immigration with immigration and they've tried to do that over and over and over again and they're still doing it today\nBut it's not working because the average man and woman working every day in America you know taking their lunch bucket to work you know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumped the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nAh you're listening to your health the radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been done in the last few years on immigration are shows that most people want legal immigration either to remain the same and that's a million people here it's a lot\nOr or to be decrease so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain as saying that the Gallup poll from June\nUh thirty seven percent want the level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration twenty\nNine percent want it decreased okay twenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration\nAnd that those are the convenience factor the inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration is doesn't affecting your life your kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work\nOr in a given a school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrant for for a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent less\nSo you know people don't want this\nYou're right I live out in western New York where it's a it's very blue collar area and a ... year a year or so we've seen\nYou know truckloads of illegal or legal immigrants arrested or the seven eleven\nOn their way back from a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen a chain of Mexican restaurants in and uh and west in Buffalo or where they pulled out of a whole load of workers where\nThe owner of the restaurant was housing them paying them in cash on he just got a found guilty the other day\nOf this kind of crack down needs to continue because I'll tell you in western New York in Buffalo where we used to be a strong steel worker town\nWere not anymore we're we're starting to come back under the leadership of president Donald Trump\nBut men and women here need these jobs need these jobs and and the they know who's taken the job they know what illegal immigration is all about and the Democrats in the mainstream media spend their time trying to\nGas light them on this issue talking about how important\nAre ... immigration to the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're complaining is illegal immigration but president isn't against immigration\nIs against illegal immigration and I think the American people see through it you know my wife is an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process is the first immigration process\nAnd then the citizenship process it's difficult it takes time and if it got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it\nYou know and the problem she sees is it\nTell you it's really worth it you know and the problem she sees is it from people were all surrounded by people who are here illegally some of them are now over ... etcetera\nAnd since it's infuriating and again I say this repeatedly you ... if you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own governments and in one way shape or form a and they've been told you can come and stay\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they it can't happen because because ... without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely right a border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people an orderly process of immigration is what we need but\nLook the chaos at the at the border\nIs is not dissimilar\nA Michael to the chaos that we've seen in the streets and the ... in the aftermath of Kavanaugh a and the Democrats prefer that because if this chaos you need more government government grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier than when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\nIt's true and if your listeners white\nWhat they saw during the month long confirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh screaming in the hearings the people running down the always a base of the United states Capitol screaming at senators but the people trapping senators\nIn an elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras the mob people outside the capital and after he was confirmed the people trying to literally rats with their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building if they like that\nThey're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today\nWe would lose the house the Republicans wouldn't lose the house\nBecause a lot of people who were not measure well by the polls and twenty sixteen they call a deplorable right that people who had voted in recent elections because of their frustration with issues like illegal immigration making up their vote didn't matter at all\nThey found a champion and Donald Trump someone they fought\nA non politician to make change for them\nAnd you know in in a midterm election\nThose kinds of folks tend to think well I got my guy and I'm going to go ahead and sit this one out and they don't take their lunch break to go vote they don't drop their kids off early at school so they can go vote on the way to work or they don't you know a skip the for the birthday party after work to go vote\nAnd and this time around they better do it because they think the part of the president's not on the ballot\nHe is on us you know ... that's an excellent point and Michael what's happening the twenty seventh congressional district in New York Congressman Chris Collins what's happening there\nWell Collins as of some of your listeners might know or was charged with insider trading yup I'm a recently after it was too late to get him off the ballot um you know he declares his innocence and you know we believe the presumption of innocence but New York twenty seven is an hour plus eleven district it with a safe seat\nAnd uh they have a pretty strong Democrat running against them\nKind of lead and for the Democratic socialist type of thing really a Donald Trump has said he's open to impeachment and he's

we\nEvery respect [noise] so it's\nMuch easier for me to do this and it was when I was campaigning when I said this will happen this is a much easier situation [noise]\nYou're listening to the show eight five five\nForty Laura we're going to bring your attention to critical races across the country one of them is Pennsylvania seventh congressional district where Marty no\nStein is running to replace the retiring never Trump or a Charlie Dent\nA thank God he's being replaced and Marty is in a tight race against Democrat lefty Susan Wild\nAnd this has been redistricted but I'm telling you something Marty as the person you all have to get out and vote for in Pennsylvania seven he joins us now and also is an avid cyclist was in the two thousand\nUh Olympics as attract cyclists there's a lot of ah incredible stuff for his community and it's going to support the president's agenda on the economy immigration trade all the rest of Marty it's great to have you on tell us what you're finding out there what issues to the people care about most as you're approaching the all important midterm fight\nHigh lower first of all thanks for having me yeah you know covering every corner this district which is now a new district pencil in the seventh district has everything from the urban core of Allentown Beth I'm an east into the\nCause of farming communities in the northern tier work district called asleep built a region ... what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is that people are happy people are happy with and she counts\nAnd now what what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is that people are happy people are happy with this economy they're happy with what our president's been able to accomplish we're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know as a rather nice buzzing economy right here in this district and people want to see that continue\nThey don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now a lot of voters are getting very very much engaged and they realize what does that steak if they flip the house on a course in in Congress\nWhat what uh when when you see the redistricting that well obviously a it is is being done in many cases to add\nA urban voters to what it's traditionally a blue collar or a more conservative district it makes the Republicans jobs in in in a way more difficult to try to run for Congress for the first time or run for reelection\nBut on the issue of for instance immigration where we see a thousands of people now are being funded clearly to rush up to the border or even in rural districts where you know they do need some agricultural workers and so forth people don't like the chaos and lawlessness are you finding that as well given the news on this new crush at the border\n[noise] yeah I think that's really on a lot of people's minds is just the radical a resistance we're seeing from the last uh the rush of people to the border again\nWe we we we read this chapter before we've seen it happen um most people I'm Talking to up to the majority of the people I'm Talking to understand that securing our borders a first step towards a workable immigration platform\nOr we need to secure our southern border and there's no question about that and everyone I've been talking to was supportive that\nI'm so immigration\nUp here in Lee high value in the seventh district although we're not a border state uh it is something that's it's a on people's minds\nA and Marty's Susan Wild is they they ... they hope that she's part of the what they are going to call the year the woman or because of the me too movement a woman's march and so forth are so ... what would they try to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district\n[noise] well that's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is a she ran in her primary or somebody\nOn the ... are left now she's trying to move to the center but a her results speak for themselves or you know she she's\nShe's for radicalism she's from a welfare she's for no borders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy in Iraq or see\nYou know for impeaching the president and teaching Kavanaugh but she won't say that in any commercials she won't say that any public forums but at the end of the day that's where she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's what she's going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen\nMarty when I see the uh the amazing economic growth that's been made possible by this president's focused uniquely on the American worker the American people\nIt's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that or go backward\nI I've been watching some of your a campaign or commercials in advance on line\nAnd the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back they don't they want they want happiness and calm they don't want chaos in the streets and people weren't black masks\nAnd smashing car windows and in a in raising the flags of other countries in America they want America to be a safe prosperous nation where security is paramount in our our virtue is freedom a is always you know upheld and raised high and I\nThink it's jobs not mobs we want jobs we don't want mobs I think it's as simple as that\nI think it's as simple as that and you're right a lot of voters in my district agree with you a hundred percent now the other side it's got a small little motivated base of folks we've seen that the results we've seen in the primaries they're very vocal uh you're right they show up in ... uh we we announced a campaign um our our\nBrand opening of arcane campaign headquarters the night before they threw rocks to our windows uh you know so this is the type of stuff we're seeing even locally here in Pennsylvania seventh district which in my opinion I was born and raised here my family's been here five generations I've always called at home I never saw it like this before in my life\nI'm a relatively young man I'm forty seven years old\nBut what you're seeing right now the resistance from the other side is is is it's it's really quite alarming\nFunded funded Marty by socialist billionaires who don't like the fact that America standing strong for national national economic growth and so forth Marty notes dean\nDarling I don't know where I go to the radio and interest on a mountain on giant nine Seventy eighty WM shallow twelve Seventy K DJ I Hope\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management\nMy story begins with that a lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIf you're in depth and you need help coal trinity one eight hundred seven nine for ... for three something when\nI first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I looked at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical that that was in my life would go way\nCommunity will consolidate your accounts into one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you saved thousands what I Would\nTell I think people please pick up the phone and call trinity just let them put together a program and see how affordable and easy it is to pay off your debt\nIf she loses I saw something on TV say I guess it was Charlie hurt yesterday on the Fox special report panel it'll be the last time we ever have a Republican Congress person in this Fairfax County district which is right\nNear DC so this is now been transformed because of immigration illegal in otherwise and liberal policies\nFollow always liberal policies always follow\nWear a mask crush of illegal immigration has moved into a community that's why the ah African Americans and Latinos in poll after poll will tell us that immigration is adversely affected their communities\nBecause it has so I'll give you that a stat just a moment Dr Marc Christian is\nWith us or he is the director of the global faith Institute former Muslim Sunni who converted from Islam to Christianity\nAnd he's been following the media and their use of manipulation of this story from turkey wearing a ... a Saudi journalist or who wrote for the Washington Post\nOr is or was murdered and apparently it's on Donald Trump's falls Dr Christian good to have you with us or what how do we need to look at this story mid term voters I don't think they're focused on this this is not something that they're you know it just affects their daily lives but the media are using this story to do what\nFigure which would have immediately after the ship the local community and and you're right when you have a party that is run by by them and uh uh you know all of those old ah guards it's it looks like they are often from inside when I I think actually this um\nYou know story about a ... a reporter and everything else is going to have an impact on\nThe election if we are not going to get the truth out and and the reason of that has this when you know many people actually don't understand you know the situation between the states and Saudi Arabia and try to a point out that the Trump is a you know he's a cozy to um you know the Saudis and the that'd be killed and\nAnd also to dictators and so forth which is far from through if you listened to Trump in his last quarter on his before this incident broke out\nEmbarrassed at the Saudi Government publicly at least four times and that was a huge big a media thing going on in the whole Middle East so uh when we look at this incident I think people need to understand that Trump is not\nI'm backing up the salad is because he loves loves the dictates of his old for personal gain because this is nonsense [noise] he's doing this because of the Saudi Government the government the government is doing a good work that helps that are not states and he's in America first\nUn American interest a president which is different from by the Obama and all of those previous president with a lot states and why I'm saying that because you and you look at what the current um gum prince and the south the government is doing their heads making many fronts the number one is\nThe author hunting by defending the Islamic movement by looking in house arrest more than five hundred moms in Saudi Arabia and all\nThey are fighting the Muslim Brotherhood in the country and even in other countries they are helping the states um when they are fighting Iran and its aggression in the middle east\nYou're helping big time they get on a the Iranian sanctions are and how the Trump is putting those on by living oil prices and and on all the stuff also the current administration or kind of leadership in\nUm a Saudi Arabia is hurting usher in a peace treaty\nThat never ever be imagined before and Donald Trump is about to announce that are very very soon what is going to be involved in Saudi Arabia and and but it's an Egypt and Israel which is gonna be eliminating the danger of this conflict has been going on for seven years so Donald Trump is supporting um you know the ...\nA leadership in Saudi Arabia because of those reasons and those seasons alone and all of those\nHeads are not states not that dictatorship and ... plus ... all of this we believe in this country that everybody is innocent until until proven otherwise so when we are dealing with this issue as when we have to\nFollow the due process to go to the investigation and find out what's going on and you know I I tend to believe that I Am American inside out since I'm a great in the United states but still ... over there and my ... in my home routes\nYou know nothing happens by coincidence when uh the president of turkey is very much all over the place about this you have to understand that this happened at the same time\nOf the Trump Administration embarrassed in public and the whole Muslim world by arresting a the the the faster and the release of the pasture happened right here at the same time all of this incident going taking place\nExcellent point well I think again mark America in ... in the American voters if they're given the proper information and not the talking points of the left the which again it's\nIt's the it's so sad and it's so predictable they always go to racism they always go to a phobia ... this is all they have it's it's women are oppressed in the United states or every minority group as a press in the United states the president loves autocrats the president ...\nI mean it's so predictable that it's almost boring to talk about but meanwhile the Democrats are giving the big thumbs up to thousands of people who are about to cross into America unless we do something about this thousands and thousands of people many of them this is an adult men for\nMilitary age men who are have joined this caravan and are being supported by someone or some organization\nTo storm into this country to try to change this country electorally\nThat is the goal here the goal is to replace the American voters who elected Donald Trump with a new class of voters who have no background or understanding of the American story that's what's happening and it's outrageous and Americans have to stand against that total lawlessness\nA die hard and what are your what are your thoughts on the immigration issue I I think the Democrats have made a big mistake thinking this is going to help them in the midterms\nWhen the Democrats and the left and the media that supports the left is a crazy and they have gotten ideas this is why they always go to this year's men and all the kinds of ideas that they talk about that means absolutely nothing\nBut when I pay attention to the media and what's going on number one is in the last two days they start talking about how the Hispanic votes are not going for the Democrats but go for Donald Trump and an historic away and then right after that they start talking about the current events\nMarching to the border of the United states and what they are trying to do is to try to divide and to try to uh make the Hispanic\nVotes jump into the vote a boost and try to vote for them so this is a very well organized by the media and I have no idea how did you\nSo this is a very well organized by the meat yeah and I have no idea how they do it but I have no doubt that everything is it the night you pay attention to the gate you talk about it for three days\nHow the Hispanic is holding Fort Drum in a historical way and then all of a sudden we haven't you know a problem on the on the order and then we have to figure this out and do not Trump's days we're not going to let that happen and I think Hispanic votes water in Americans can see through this\nBecause I trust it that when you come to this nation and you believe in it and we understand that they'll put that you have you're not going to be seized the by the uh the bidding filthy works of the left and what they're trying to do every day or two American the American fabric\nA mark Christian um you're such a treasure we really appreciate your voice speaking up for truth and freedom and religious liberty and a common sense pragmatic foreign policy\nOr where we have to make alliances with people and or been in countries that now you know we don't agree with on a lot but for the better betterment of the American people sometimes we have to do that\nAnd don't keep your eye on the ball people because what marks that is exactly right this is calculated and and it's actually so transparent it's pathetic\nA doctor my Christian here on the lower income show will take a break get your calls do you agree that this is a calculated strategy\nGet Donald Trump out there on this immigration issue and think that because he talks about it Hispanic voters will start turning out on moss against him and the Republican Party eight five five forty Laura Laura Ingraham show [noise]\nYou're listening don't Laura ... healthy

and ask for the campaign was going and then people just kind of circled around I guess [noise] um\n[noise] one young man was asking me ... policy questions and then told me about himself he ended up wanting to yard sign so we I gave him one\nAnd then another gentleman entered the conversation and had a lot it was a back and forth\nDidn't seem any thing to be worried about the ... at the time I

head and send them flying is is like I said before it's not something I was signing up for\nWell Shane a first of all the left is trying\nTo intimidate good Americans like you from running for office they're trying to frighten people scare them and if that doesn't work physically attacked them out of a race physically prevent you from running\nAnd this is being encouraged by the Democrats at the highest levels\nEven those who claim over not for violence of course we're not for violence then where are they why are they supporting this caravan approaching the U.S border that is lawlessness complete and utter lawlessness they embrace lawlessness if the ends are in their minds justified noble\nSo that means they're justified excuse me at the end is noble and the end is electing Democrats or you can bring more of a a ... social spending framework enforce that on the American people of all the goals of of of more of a democratic socialist approach to governance\nIf those are noble goals and you can get there by any means necessary including a sucker punch of someone that gives them a concussion and messes up there by\nA and this is why conservatives Republicans of all backgrounds you must ensure that these people are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law I Would file a civil suit against him a and I would I Would I Would move on that stuff I Would sue him\nFor what he did and I hope you I Hope you do that you know anything about his background\nI really don't um I I I've I've heard a few things that I'm a I guess he's\n... he's in the trades of some sort that is what I've learned but beyond that I don't really know much about him ... I just knowing that the ... big guy to\nBe on that we have Democrats are in the state spoken out against us\nYou know I I actually know so like both of our senators are Democrats and neither one of them to my knowledge as of yesterday anyway had come out and publicly denounced it um [noise] I Will say that my congressman or Tom Emmer he did call me a soon as you heard about it\nWas the first time he's ever call me but it and you know give me as a condolence to the support and all that I was you know\nBut but other than you know none of none of our representation of higher up people have come out and said that to the to the last I looked at me like\nImagine if you needed to\nBe the ... the thing this is the norm now it just you know go out and\nLike you said getting their faith kick them when they're down with a bit of comments or I got tore up for using that exact line of Facebook response of calling out the comments from Hillary and Eric Holder and Maxine Waters and and if somebody actually spend the local publication as my understanding that\nHow would how would their their comments have any influence in rural Minnesota\nI don't know if they don't think we don't have radio and TV oh here it was [laughter]\nYeah so Eric Holder if they go low we kick 'em Hillary Clinton if they go low we hit harder or whatever it is she sent\nA right yeah well and of course it doesn't affect I mean I don't know about this guy I don't know what his deal is but of course it has an effect\nAnd it's meant to intimidate it is a type of political intimidation and its physical intimidation and up to the point of committing crimes\nBut again they they they attempt to dehumanize entire groups of people like if you're a conservative in Minnesota and you run for office and you and you call it as it is they have to call you a racist you they have to say that you're anti women\nAre ... you imagine what they would have done Shane if a a liberal female Muslim candidate for instance\nUh was brutalized or hit by someone else a woman as let's say a concern about just give the gender that is a conservative woman here said you don't you're not you're not representing my interests you imagine\nAnd I wouldn't mind you know first ones to I'd be the first one out there to condemn that physical absolutely attacks\n\nWell I could say I certainly wouldn't wish this upon anybody I don't know and and and you know I grew up my mom was extremely liberal my entire life my dad was a poli opposite very conservative they never thought about it\nIn fact that they would tease each other you know let's go Catholic voters vote I mean it's I guess that that this doesn't need to be everybody's everything where if you don't agree with me I it's it's all out just throw it out and\nBattles it says\nIt's a it's a sad place when we become actually\nA shame how does your race look\nAh in theory I'm going to Seventy thirty district so they consider\nUh in theory I'm going to Seventy thirty district so conservative speaking so it's a strong Republican district that with an unfortunate part is we do have an independent that shot the GOP endorsement and rented an independent but\nAside from that but the downside of this is a I ... the doctors have told me or you got to lay low you have no idea what this says I tried to tell them I only have three weeks a campaign left and I ...
