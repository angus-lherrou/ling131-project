don't know if it's the phone connection but I just want to make sure it's pleasant for everyone listening but I Know you wanted to raise the issue of Obama and I and I think you're echoing what I said this is\nThese are the community organizing tactics this is why when his when he won his campaign he didn't dismantle his presidential campaign apparatus you know that right it was Obama for America was the uh was was his campaign\nOr a organization\nUh oh by you know every every candidate creates an organization of fundraising organizational structure right when he became president\nHe didn't dismantle\nHis his fundraising capability or any of his outrage or any of the things he just converted Obama for America to a political action committee called organizing for America was still owe SAC he could keep the same logo it went from Obama for America to organizing for America has been a\nConstant constant\nCommunity organizing effort at the highest level with the greatest budget that any community organizing entity is ever\nHad and it in ... it literally has created an army of protesters who work every day every single that you know that women\nWho are confronted Jeff Flake in the elevator you already know by now that she's the head of a community organizing a company that's partially funded by George Soros Foundation we already know that we talked about it from the day it happened right oh it was so organic it was so natural this woman stopped Jeff Flake and the elevator and start yelling at him\nAbout her alleged sexual assault a\nThat here's what you may not have seen she's making over a hundred and fifty grand that woman she's making over a hundred and fifty grand\nCommunity organizing doesn't come cheap but there's a whole lot of money in it right now\nAnd they keep raising more and more and more and they have armies that are dedicated disrupting our society disrupting our government and disrupting your life and the only way to stop them is to keep them out of power we cannot reward these tactics\nAs soon as you read what what is rewarded we'll be repeated\nYou want to stop to what you're saying in the streets right now you need to stop them on election day ah let's go to a destiny alec kids City Maryland not listening on my home station WMA a hello destiny\nHi Larry I'm so happy to talk to you oh my goodness I excited I'm excited to [laughter] so um I had an idea just now thinking about how to get more people are like kind of like the comic fang okay and the expos that like the truth and not within our rely on the mainstream media\nAnd I decided I'm going to invite a bunch of my friends who are mostly liberal 'cause you know easy area I'm and I'm also a millennia else other than that [laughter] but oh All right I'm going to read it to them to lifting different talk radio shows throughout the week and then during\nThe weekend we all get together and debate at and try to talk it out and see if they gain some sort of perspective because I feel like if you're listening to talk radio right now like\nI can kind of have common sense Ukraine already know what's going on but it's different for people that kind of just\nI don't know it could yeah CNN and MSNBC and they don't know and it's like\nThat's cool so do you think there'll be down for it I mean 'cause I I worry about millennials that they're not really open to you know they're sort of in their lane you know and and they just sort of like they know what they know when they're not interested\nYeah I I have hope though I've had conversations recently it was okay and I think talking to people that are made in my age group and a lot of them agree that this was just like insane and just unfair\nWow that if they can kind of like get into it more and talk about more issues I mean it's common sense I [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nI Know just today I I hear your voice that ... that's how I feel subtypes to thank God I've got a the time that I have with a microphone so I can vent I don't know what it's like for you guys that don't have a radio show ... great to hear from you in a tell all your millennial friends a ticket to tune in and just listen I think that's a great idea\nI think that's a great idea listen I listen I'm biased because I I'm In this business but I think talk radio or\nIs it has a an incredible incredible reach an
