as they did in Portland is that none of salt that's a form of assault isn't it\nThat is that is a form of itself and the individual assaulting people will be held liable if they're caught part that that's what happens now they're not caught I caught\nWell the cop stood there on his motorcycle I haven't seen get fired yet by the mayor Ted Wheeler I think it is uh Portland, Oregon\nI mean the ... the cop was on a motorcycle and the same street they were doing this the people the black lives matter people calling them every name under the sun and re directing traffic or you can blame accomplished not playing the copy blame the mayor is the issue here\nBut what's the good of blaming anybody if they attacked the man who was in a car is Seventy years old and started banging on this call with sticks what what could he do\nThat he got out for some reason I Know you're you're talking about old man and elected he jumped out to look at it and he actually did the right thing after word got back in the car and left as by standing there he would have just have more damage your mad at her but he did the right thing by leaving\nBut no one has been arrested by the mayor of the city of Portland, Oregon and out of control hell hole a garbage can he used to be one of the most beautiful cities on the west coast it has become a filthy garbage can\nLike San Francisco under the liberal totalitarian fascist to run this city Seattle Portland or San Francisco\nI can name five other cities that have deteriorated as a result of ultra tolerance under the guise of liberalism\nAnd so what is the average law abiding citizen supposed to do hide\nUnder under federal law bring them into federal court bringing the local municipality and sue the map that there are possibilities for individuals agree there are federal alternative however that goes to show that those states and cities are operating like a neo Confederate the not abiding by the laws that you're not going\nWow I like that and the confederacy so in other words they've already declared\nYou're not going wow I like that and the confederacy so in other words they've already declared a a break away from the union and they're running under their own addict is flack\nFor years unfortunately for years unfortunately and now All right well\nThanks lawyer lawyer or a Chris thanks for your sage record but what I hear from you is don't do anything basically\nA until you're attacked now I'm not so sure that's the right approach\nTheir arm intermediary steps such as taking out your ... your iPhone and photographing them the way they like to do the way they rationed police now for Twenty years immediately get out your iPhone or start photographing them the minute they knock your iPhone to the ground and grab it they've committed a felony is that correct\nAnd I think he's more if they're trying to take it from you in criminal law once they were forced to take an item from someone that becomes robbery as well that's all right\nI'll ... who's going to help you at that point the restaurants going to send out the ... the the Marines is going to help you oh you ... it was going to help you nobody\nNine one one you're right you're right we're at a point of no return it the police are bigger than I thank you for like you're dedicating your book to the police law enforcement\nWill let me send you a copy of stop mass hysteria which more lawyers like you understood\nWho the police really are and the left wing vermin lawyers to go after the police are actually the ah the equivalent of the retroviruses that attack our own immune system and prevent diseases that are nascent or under the surface to proliferate\nA I'm a student of epidemiology and I do know how it works and what our own defense sells the white cells\nAre attacked by a white cells that have been infected by a certain virus\nAnd then attacked the white cells themselves and start killing our immune system\nNow you understand who left wing lawyers are and what they do to our police who are our first line of defense against invaders by infecting the defense cells themselves including many police departments have been invaded by them Obama carefully made certain both our military and our police\nHad been um\nA and I use the correct word he had been infected\nWith these retroviruses called ultra liberals in law enforcement it's almost a misnomer how can you be an ultra liberal and be a law enforcement\nWhat does that mean you're going to selectively not enforce the law if you like the politics of those breaking the law is that what it means yes that's what it means to Eric Holder\nSo now we are seeing the world when that was unleashed upon us by the Obama holder team a two for we've got a two for out of them okay so
