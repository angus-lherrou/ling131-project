CNN MSNBC\nI talk with the president Donald J Trump\nJust to give CNN MSNBC perspective on this on July seven twenty sixteen\nMicah Xavier Johnson ambushed and fired upon and killed a group of Dallas texas police officers to civilians are also wound\nHe stated in postings that the reason he killed the cops was retribution for the number of times cops have killed African American men so he sought out officers to kill who he perceived to be white and he murdered them in cold blood using semi automatic weapons and then went on a course killed himself\nNow that's a big story same thing happened Baton Rouge same thing happened was re most in lieu officers in New York City\nAnd there is a regular event in our country real police officers were gunned down not because of the color of their skin but the color of their uniform which is blue\nWhat is it and the national consciousness\nOccasion by the national media that causes such owner disrespect for police officers that weak minded nationalist another hate filled individuals many mentally ill will take it upon themselves to hunt down officers to kill the murder without good reason\nI I I like to see media coverage of that event tell me why that is going on and tell me why the president of United States\nBrock Hussein Obama were knowingly and willingly repeatedly made in the oval office with representatives of a group who would advocate the murder of those same police officers black lives matter\nDel Rey ma casting and others when in March around in Dallas and elsewhere what do we want dead cops wondering we want them now we want to kill cops\nPigs in a blanket from like bacon\nOr what is it and so when we obsess over the death of Jamal cause Yogi at CNN and other news organizations are now doing\nIt's terrible that I guess his fingers her cut off he was decapitated it was butchered awful Assad citizen killed in Turkey and the worst way give it to mention it needs to do\nBut the only way the media will focus on a murder is if that murder can be used against Donald Trump or Mitt Romney or George Bush or some other Republican tell me how this murder so the murder of Jason Alison barge down Kentucky butchered murder\nOn an exit ramp at two o'clock in the morning leaving his wife Amy and two beautiful kids without a husband without a father there is no political benefit for CNN nothing they can't they can't use the\nSame way with uh the murder of ... New York city or the cops in Dallas in Baton Rouge advocate the murder welcome to the White House a group that advocates the killing of cops advocate get them into the White House get their pictures taken with the president\nHuh how's that possible so when the media obsesses over Jamal could show ... it's done not because his life had more value that officers rainbows and Lou\nIt's done because they can use that as the question is America complicit did the sides by some condominiums from Trump\nDecides go to a hotel near the White House to get Trump money it's all this crap in their heads losing out horse manure coming out of their ears as if this murder has so much more important than the unsolved murder of police officers inside of America\nAnd it's sick and some others continue with

that Obama just went away and then a with us I said look\nWe want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said as soon as I recall me back but I'm going to give you one more chance and and he said that's okay I'm going to tax the cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nAnd they immediately have a plan and came over and talk and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with um I can tell you they want to sure like what\nAnd now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with um I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the rebuilding where five hundred million a year five trillion over ten\nWe've built Shanghai we built Beijing at some point we've got to start building America they got the new airport we don't have the new airport they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point in our money's got to come back to America\nYou're so right so China's been taken out five hundred billion dollars you people have no idea what that is five hundred billion we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President she said we can't do it very simple we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've now put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been in effect what people don't say is that would take it in billions of dollars in our treasury because it said twenty five percent\nSo we're taking in billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become expensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make the product here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we\nUsed to do it so China has been looked China's the biggest civil mall by far it's probably sixty percent of our trade Louis we lost\nOver the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade we lose with everybody those days are over bill\nNow Leslie wherever the midterms coming up one of my favorite movies is Jimmy Stewart it's a wonderful life I look at Bedford Falls\nBelow sea takes the house Schumer Texas Senate your life becomes miserable the last two years what do you say the middle class Americans all over the country that say you know what\nWe don't want Bedford Falls away it look we want the New Bedford falls what do you say to those who say the midterms relax take it easy not important ... whether it's black burner Heller we don't have to worry about that what do you say to motivate the base\nWell I Hope she's going to do well first of all he's a great guy but I I just say just country what just forget it ...\nYou have to go out and vote my poll numbers are so good but a lot of people say I'm not running so we're not going to be one percent Rasmussen fifth one now we're doing great and and then they say you can add a lot to it because when people hang up and they say we don't want to talk to you that means it's a Trump voter I don't know if that's good or bad but that's what I mean it's a we have to\nDo well I Will say I think we're going to do very well in the Senate and a lot of things have happened since justice now justice Kavanaugh Fifteen Fifteen to judge many many judges\nAnd we're going to have a hundred and forty five judges fairly soon when you think about it I mean a hundred and forty five it will be close to fifty percent of the whole judiciary not only to Supreme Court justices so but that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with justice Kevin because\nI've rarely seen a person treated so badly man of great distinction a great life and the way they treated him was horrible and since that happened Republicans are looking so is everybody they see what's going\nOn under the law of unintended consequences because since I've had many women were spurred my air you know bill I with Kevin ... they don't want to say publicly but if you send in a in a weird sense Kevin all as motivated the Republican base or otherwise it wouldn't have happened\nBeen a great friend of mine and I appreciate it you've been a very terrific guy it's also a terrific talent you know a lot of people can't do what you do you know this is talk brothers Russian about uh that's not too many and Sean is you know so it was great but these are great people great talents\nAnd I appreciate it do we have to do well I think we're going to do well in the Senate I think we could pick up some seats in the Senate and the polls\nIf you look three weeks ago and you

six weeks after it's over so it's one of those things but\nI Hope it does well and uh I Hope that Steve does well I think he's doing well fuck ... capital when I hear is doing so I think that's very important and I'm here for him\nBut I just wanted to thank you for everything you've done and and hopefully people are going to realize that this is a very important election midterms I think frankly I think people are viewing this is very important you know usually midterms are like sleepers yeah people that they are energized and for those that say that the\nThat the blue is energized meaning the Democrats and we're not ... I think personally I think we're more energy and you're not going to believe the energy but we had it in Erie, Pennsylvania the other night with twenty five thousand people outside of a twelve thousand that arena it's been amazing\nAnd if that kind of you know action shows up\nIn three weeks and you imagine it's just a little more than three\nWe got the energy for the next three weeks because you're like Elvis law\nBut you could only move this big equipment so often rock cafe and Secret Service and all of that but they were very very busy and we're going to the races that are close we're slightly ahead or slightly behind and we'll make it a lot of steps\nAs the president you're the best you're a great American idol that all the time you know you're a great America keep doing what you're doing for the voices you don't hear in the face as you don't see those people you're the hero I was with Reagan an eighty four when he came here I thought Reagan was a star he was the Rolling Stones or the Beatles you're on the Ed Sullivan show I'm Serious about\nBut I really do appreciate your support such an important voice and you've been with us and uh\nYou know just say hello to all your people you have a lot of\nUm you're a great America thank you thank you very much for like\nNot only counting on Mr President thank you very much I'm sure we'll do it again I'm very honored to have you in office and now we're so much better off than we would have been of Hillary Clinton had won so it's continuous more built counting the great American and for the great one market loving my\nHave you ever thought about the word education well it means to lead forth\nThe word fourth raises another question which way is fourth how do you know you're going in the right direction the easy answer is it just depends on which way you want to go\nWell my friend Dr Larry ... president of Hillsdale College says young people almost always say that and that they've been taught to say that but you and I both know that's the wrong answer let me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College\nHad Hillsdale they understand that true education means pursuing the highest answer to that question which way is fourth he'll still students are challenged to discover the right way forth by reading the greatest books by the greatest minds in history\nAnd they learn the meaning of the three ultimate unrelated things the good the true and the beautiful and I encourage all of you all of my listeners to learn more about this remarkable institution and live in for Hillsdale dot com that's L.
