running for governor in Florida and Jake Tapper does a lousy job you know he pushes the left wing narrative\n[noise] they never ask questions related to capitalism private property rights\nThey never ask questions about century city separation of powers they never asked I it's always while he asked about the Fifteen dollar minimum wage of course Gillum supports that\nEverybody who's tried it as regretted it Seattle tried it it was a disaster it's a disaster for the employees\n\nIt's a disaster for small businesses they go out of business you been to a McDonalds lately seal the kiosks that they're building that is to get around the Fifteen dollar minimum wage and others are doing it now as well\nThe left doesn't know how to create things the left only knows how to destroy\n\nSo Gillum supports a Fifteen dollar minimum wage you know what else he supports Medicare for all do you understand what Medicare for all means you folks on Medicare means Medicare for nobody Medicare for all means Medicare for nobody\nIt means Medicare as exists today even for people who are in their seventies and eighties and nineties will cease to exist as it exists today\nBecause they're gonna put tens of millions of other people into it change the system altogether they want government run top down health care they can't seem to figure out how to run the Veterans Administration they can't seem to figure out how to make Obamacare work so what do the left to well\nThey nationalize more things and they control more things that's the right answer to everything they just don't have enough government they just don't have enough taxes they just don't have enough control\nBut it's always that way because they can't work so Gillum wants to destroy medicate now he talks about

median Arab I follow my own conscience my own principles my own belief system look around the world\n\nThe coverage of this could show the matter is horrible as that murder is\nIs well beyond the kind of coverage that other\nHuman rights abuses that take place in this world which are far more expensive and systemic\n\nHow many other people have been murdered by the Saudi regime I'm sure many others do we know who they are no we don't have the finest idea of who they are\nThe we know how many no we don't know how many well why not because the media could give a damn that's why\nThey could give a damn as I speak to you right now\nThere are black Christians in the Sudan her being slaughtered and rape and tortured and the most horrendous waste their\nBlack Christians being slaughtered and

detail of the delivery of one and a half billion dollars in foreign\nUndercover darkness\nDelivered on an airplane a non American airplane hoping they wouldn't be seen to the\nModel Nazi regime in Tehran which has one of the highest execution rates in the world\nObama didn't come under criticism from the same people who are involved in criticizing our president who's had no role whatsoever in any of this so the media use it to attack him the media use it to attack conservatives\nI think I read some way or the or the pro Saudi conservatives who held up pro Saudi conservatives somehow\nWound up in that group Mr but it was if I ever said anything that makes me a pro Saudi anything\n\nI said nothing the last two weeks I wasn't on the air\nI said nothing the last two weeks I wasn't on the air\nThe media are diabolical their disgraceful\nI don't know of anyone that's possible who's making any excuses for what the Saudi regime which isn't incest us rollback\n\nRegime I don't know anybody who's making any excuse for the brutal assassination\nOf this journalist but what people are asking is about the coverage\n\nOn the one hand it's non stop on the other hand or they're reporting everything about the gentleman who was murdered\nYou're not allowed that and you can either way while you're at it don't ask about climate change Donna you can't ask don't ask about anything\n\nYou know there are legitimate policy questions can we debate those\nIs the president right when he says I'm not going to forfeit a hundred and ten billion dollar purchase of American military armaments which the Chinese or the Russians would sell otherwise\nWhy is that a controversial statement\n\nThe purpose of that cell is the benefit us if it purely benefited the Saudis that would be one thing but it benefits America\n\nI mean as I said earlier in the front of what the hell we open an embassy in Cuba it's a police state that tortures murders\n\nPresident's been attacked because of his heart policies on China I told you Iran has one of the highest execution rates in the world China has the highest execution right in the world as the Tibetans\n\nAsked the other religious minorities in China ask any of the political dissidents how they're treated in China\n\nAnd these aren't real trials that take place in China at all\n\nAll right so what should we do\nWhat should we do\nThese are legitimate questions that ought to be engaged discuss\nPolicy thoughtfully considered\nBut who is neat jerking around now the media and all that the president monster that President muster that President said Thirteen different positions on this\nIt's a non American citizen in the Saudi\nConsulate Saudi territory within the country of turkey\nWithin the country of turkey\nI despise the Saudi leadership I despise the turkey leadership\nDespise them all\nBut I Know how dishonest the media are when my name is thrown around when I'm off the air for two weeks is if I said something which I

N.\n... let me explain talk radio talk radio is not this\nYou know it's not it's not the uh ... this isn't the wizard of Oz were behind the curtain there's talk radio and there's Mr begun all the rest of it and and uh there's the person behind talk radio talk radio is hundreds if not thousands of local\nRegional and national hosts the vast majority of whom don't know each other that are owned by\nSince the vast majority of whom don't know each other that are owned by different businesses different companies that have different affiliates so it's not like hey talk radio let's all get together and work with someone so it doesn't work that way\nSo it's not rational to begin with that's number one number two if that's what we did then we wouldn't be talk radio anymore we'd be GOP radio I don't want to be GOP radio\nMy whole point in the first hour is this is an election about us you need to go out and vote about partnering with this one or that one each and every one of us has power each and every one of us has power\nLet's just do things differently this election day you take it upon yourself to make sure that four five six or whatever the number of individuals in your circle family circle church or synagogue circle your employment circle\nFamily circle I think I said that they don't that's all\nAnd we will swamp them they won't know what the hell Hannah\nIt's very it's not complicated very simple not complicated at all Jay Bakersfield, California the great KF oh go\nYeah uh yeah I I on the whole ... thing and drop right I'm really just or just the surveys that uh you know Trump throughout it right has a ... ... ... it's an investigation number one number two it he repeatedly defended the Saudi rulers throughout it\nOkay hey buddy or leaning on our on our own intelligence you know it's\nLike a farce of all what you're saying is dishonest\nHe said over and over again he wants to know the facts this is a moving target that's the way it is he wants to know the information he wants to another thing you see unlike you and I'm like these cheap shot reporters and commentators on TV this president has a country to run and he has to figure out as best as he's able to\nWhat's in the best interest of the United states of America and the citizens of the United states of America\nSo he's not just going to call a talk show or or get on a cable show or or pop off about about this that and the other hand he's his he's been sort of adjusting his message is more information comes off a comes in and as he gets more advice on what to do\nPlus there are things going on in the middle East that he's involved in in his staff's involved in that you and I can't even imagine\nSo what do you want them to do well let's say the royal families guilty I Know they're guilty or cutting off all relations with them would that make you happy\nNow written a fruit or what you said but that last thing that you just set a second ago you're right it's an investigation by the big point is you know it's not over get information number one\nAnd then make some decisions right but he keeps defending those guys the Saudis in a nice guy either really bad guy they'd do a lot of bad stuff and why ... why do you get the ... and those guys\n... why does who keep defending those guys spies those guys\nHe did but I don't think he's sending those guys I mean again I I've been sort of observing this from afar over the last a period of time since uh since the Turks put out the information that he was murdered\n[noise] don't seem defending those guys if he's defending those guys why did the old man the king step in and take the power back from the sun to try and deal with this situation\nWhere ... you know have already come out several times where he came out with that role excuse early on that left so that's all wrong you know you have no evidence yep okay let me thought\nFor all why are we so focused on this\nBecause it's important it's the truth\nAbout honestly it's not that important it's a horrible thing that took place a horrible thing that took place but I hate to say this 'cause I Know it will be twisted in four thousand different ways but for the United states it's simply not that important\nI mean giving a hundred and fifty billion dollars to the Iranian regime which killed which was involved in killing thousands of American Soldiers that to me is a big damn deal\nBut you know the media and the lap supported that deal Obama supported that deal that is a terrorist\nRegime that is an enemy of the United states now I'm not making any excuses this man was loaded into her effect way great\nHorrible horrible horrible horrible but I don't know why are the coverage is is is so massive and neither do you\nI'm just looking for truth Harriet okay and I don't hear a great\nMan no matter what they say All right thank you sir the truth is the Saudis murder\nThat we know\nAnd do I believe the royal family was involved certainly part of it certainly the crown prince in my view how how would they do this without knowing some of them were his right hand one of them was his right hand man I Believe one of his intelligence guy centers pop forensic guy over there is a really any doubt about this\nNo there's no doubt about it\nBut we'll wait for the investigation will get all the facts you know what do you what the president to do he says they're going to be ... ... a severe ramifications but he's not cutting off the military so so what else do you want them to do I'm\nQuite serious about this I hear that criticism any suggestions what do you want them to do\n\nAnd uh I understand the Washington Post is all worked up about this and so or other media outlets I got I understand and I understand\nThat people are upset about I don't like it at all I think it's outrageous I'm no fan of the Saudi regime and I never have been\nBut I'm not talking about any of that talking about the reporting is over the top in the sense that it is nonstop\nAnd there's so many other things going on in this country in the world but at least deserves some attention\n\nI don't know that they'll ever get to the bottom is hopefully
