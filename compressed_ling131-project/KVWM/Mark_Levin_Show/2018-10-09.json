China where there was a mass hysteria against the middle class poll pots Cambodia mass hysteria against anyone with a glass as they were beaten to death or killed I Want to talk today about Columbus ohio\nHere as a city named for Columbus Christopher Columbus\nAnd they're sick group of individuals\nIn for Columbus Christopher Columbus and this sick group of individuals who have forced themselves upon the city\nHave eliminated any celebration of the namesake of their own city in your lifetime they've toned down the name of Columbus they want to go after all the founding fathers\nI Want to tell you that before we talk about Christopher Columbus per se before anyone talks about any explorer or scientists artist the politician we\nNeed to understand the subjects motivation background that environment again as a part time best selling novelist I can tell you that one of the greatest jokes in modern socio political propaganda\nIs that the kind of basic detail every reader demands in

and right in other words fiction has to be more real than reality\nAnd that's not surprising if the mainstream media had looked carefully and objectively at the back story of Iraq\nAnd Michelle Obama the Obamas never would have lived in the White House and if we give Columbus the courtesy do any historical subject it would not be possible to manipulate gullible social justice warriors into offending his statue or that a robbery or anyone else and I'm going to talk about that\nAnd I ran into now from page fifty to a stop mass hysteria which is the most important political slash historical book of our time\nAnd I'm going to continue to show you how insane that is that statues of Columbus or being torn down across America by the Maoists of our time and that Columbus ohio itself is not even celebrating the holiday\nAs anyone who went to school before the PC police started scrubbing the curriculum of anything that's some minority might find offensive\nThey wouldn't know the Columbus sale from Spain that nation has always been a hotbed of religious turmoil and the eleven century more than half of Spain the southern portion was on the Muslim control and known as the caliphate of Cordoba\nSpain's national hero Rodrigo the as the live are popularly known as el ... said\nThe lord participated in the ... the military retaking of those regions\nTaken by the Muslims the task took more than four hundred years that's why else it is known as the lord it took four hundred years\nBut was completed last in January of fourteen Ninety two and then Spain was once again a Catholic nation both holy and holy now here we get down into the Columbus thing\nFor march or fourteen Ninety two six months before Columbus reached the new world and event took place that was seemingly unrelated to the seeming but which clearly an offshoot of efforts to solidify the ... the\nSpain's king ... decreed that within four months all Jews had to leave Spain those who I converted to Catholicism the converse of could stay\nThe eight hundred thousand Jews or would not converted we're out of course an unknown number of the converse those were attending mass but still secretly practicing Judaism these people these human beings we're known as ... swine\nAnd I've used this word my rhinos to describe conservatives who continued to be conservative\nIn secret in this country you understand where that came from\nLet me continue there is good evidence that Columbus who Spanish name was Cristobal cologne was Jewish probably or possibly um around all the evidence is found in the will he signed on march Nineteen fifty no sex in it\nHe honored the Jewish customers leaving a portion of his wealth to the needy he's specifically named Elizabeth Drew as the beneficiary of a portion of as a state\nColumbus also earmarked part of his estate\nTo go to a group that was charged with retaking Jerusalem for me it's Muslim occupiers and finally he signed a document with a triangle of march that appeared on Jewish headstones those dots and characters were intended to represent the ... the Jewish prayer for the deceased\nI'm going to continue in a few minutes reading about the real history of Christopher Columbus one of the greatest explorers in the history of the world and the sadness that we should all feel today that we'd permitted the communists and the fascist of our time to the famed this great explorer and to rip down\nHis name across America and it's all found\nIn a book that you must have even if you've never bought a book\nBefore stop mass hysteria this is not a polemic this has required reading for anyone who wants to save America while it still can be salvaged\nThere's more to come on the Savage Nation I invite you to be here on this Columbus Day to

whatever you believe that the Native American was living in peace and harmony with each other and with nature nothing could be further from the truth\nI have studied this issue since Nineteen Seventy in the Nineteen seventies if you look at how tribes live with each other here in North America think of the crypts and the bloods because that's how the tribes live with each other before the Europeans arrived they will work constant war with each other fighting over things as simple as salt\nOr hunting grounds if they captured a warrior from another tribe they would sometimes skin them alive and throw them into the snow without skin\nDo after mentioned the rapes well you see history is a very important subject\nAnd it was lost in this country a long time ago is even last today with

J. Simpson were on those hardly Bruno Malley shoes and a Monday Night football game in Cincinnati and I said that bill ranking photographer built could you get a picture of me and the alarm strong and Neal said why do you want my picture [laughter] I said\nWell Neal you know you walk on the moon there were the first man to walk on the moon is that so I ... I got the picture and immediately hurried off\nAnd um that was it and other people came up their picture taken with him and he was uneasy didn't want it to happen seat Neil Armstrong was an engineer\nHe didn't see themselves as a pilot and the furthest thing from the truth was a hero he taught for seven years and University of Cincinnati in the school of engineering and every student had him said he was a wonderful teacher a great professor very bright but\nWhen you see the University of Cincinnati approached him do named the school of engineering that Neal a Armstrong school of engineering but that makes sense well that makes sense that the school of engineering after Cincinnati zone Neil Armstrong answer it but yes but\nNeal said absolutely not I don't want my name on buildings I don't want that and within a few months he left you see\nAnd what he did at that point was simply serve on boards of directors had a farm and Warren County which is a county north of Cincinnati\nAnd you ... I see I'm Out now and then it advance but nobody would ever know that that was Neil Armstrong that was the man who walked on the moon because he never carried himself away in any way that Neal was any special than anyone else\nSo in the movie comes out on friday you're going to see the actual real depiction of Neil Armstrong and how difficult it was to go to the moon and Nineteen sixty nine when there was less than a fifty fifty chance he would come back alive and in fact NASA drafted a two page statement\nTelling the American people that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin did not make it\nAnd that there forever lost in space because that was the probability of what was going to happen the odds are going there and coming back and being successful in living was less than fifty fifty but Neal took that risk in fact eleven other men\nTook it over the next three years and we're not going back to the moon since since then you were your call back to the topic that was a talk show hosts\nNumber to call his eight seven seven three one two three eight one one to\nSee that movie it is a fabulous movie movie reminded me of the ten commandments still counting on the great American [noise] ...
