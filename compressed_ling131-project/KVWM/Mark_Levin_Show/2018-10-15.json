I really do this on the air 'cause I'm up against the break you but I'll give you a second to Google and tell us who your representative is and what the district but go ahead do your thing\nMaybe we'll play the jeopardy south\nTo Manhattan then\nYou don't know do you you have no idea are you kidding me you think I don't know who that that wasn't that me and Washington who\n... who doesn't well me and watch it to happen anyway now\nRepresents a simple question what's the congressional district number you live in\nCabin we got the jeopardy sound during the ... have you figured out yet who your congressional representative [noise] come on liberals\nTo come through in the clutch you're making a strong argument here at the rich should pay a hundred percent attack were asking the question\nIs I don't know why does that make up\nFor them or make a lot of other copies congressman is Joey back a donor representative back about a cat is that it is it\nBack to haunt us the truth about the only people they represent\nCathy's is a prank call you for real seriously are you a conservative quietly calling conservative shows to act like a liberal who is what to make people go out and vote for concern is is this a ... I'm I'm seriously thinking is this a crank call\nBillionaires pay and then and said oh you think we ship\nIt to this phone call ever this is the ... can you please send me the paper this this may be I have to put this this is the greatest\nFrying pan why Kathy 'cause I got twenty second one more shot come through\nThe lives all across the country who is your congressional representative of what district come on here you go let's hear it\nHave [laughter]\nMissed the calls greater greatest tall and the history of substitutes with his back and [noise]\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations in one fell gasp or a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to Medicare for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for family is five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do that over time just\nDoing the math of six thousand dollars a year that\nThe significant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members and met a share and it's growing like crazy find out how much you could save and why men as serious so popular go to ... dot\nI'm not thinking about your stuff dude I don't care what liberals why he was so upset with other people's success why does it bother you so much why is it so off putting that you need to lay claim to other people's stuff constantly\n\nIt's a serious question why are you would title to other people's stuff why how much of it and why didn't the what Thomas ... who I I ... they'll probably know economists\nWhy I goods they'll probably know\nThe economists slashed philosopher he's both I admire more currently alive today than Thomas all wasn't at him and said at one point I I Can't remember putting conflict divisions and visited the annoyed and all this wonderful books I read is\nWhen a PHD report he did on saves lawless ... love Thomas all he put this thing was well how much of my stuff basically titled why or why\nI don't get it like why do we owe you anything anymore why\nWhy do we owe you\nCopies call could not have been more illuminating\nReally I Am thankful she called I usually don't take a to a lot of the first call in so much liberal use kind of a moderate guy a cat that was one of the greatest calls ever\nBecause that really sums up liberalism in a nutshell they have no idea what the numbers are they don't understand the facts they don't understand the economic\nData about tax policy they don't even know what marginal tax rates are they have no idea\nThere convince other people have taken their stuff but when you ask them how exactly they took their stuff they can't tell you how exactly to rich people take your stop talking well how what stuff that they take they took my money what really where where was it worth a billion dollars how did they get that money from you\nOr I don't know I don't just sounded good Bernie Sanders told me it was true\nThey're hypocrites\nThere total farce I remember\nRunning for office in Maryland I Can't tell the story it up I used to go there there's a the the Maryland in Montgomery County fair and I'd sit Montgomery County or a very very liberal County Maryland\n[noise] I Would sit there at the fair in front of the G O P booth and shake hands with people and one day the staffer for Chris Van Hollen it used to be represented now he's a senator from Maryland He stops and he's you know he knows who I Am so he's given me kind of the smart or in a smart guy attitude\nAnd he starts getting it to me about tax policy has no idea what he's talking about he doesn't have any grasp of the numbers at all he's completely clueless so I got tired of listening to it so I said listen I have a really simple question for you\nSince you believe government is is that good right and we should all transfer of wealth to a bunch of bow tie wearing bureaucrats in DC you don't give a crap about your money or anything else for that matter please explain to me that you think this is a net good for society and you should ask this of all you're liberal friends\nHow much money argued donating involuntarily higher tax payments to the government go how much\nThe answer I can almost a short with me or certainty is Ciro matter of fact not only are they not turning over extra money they are hiring accountants to avoid paying the money they owe themselves to the government\nConservatives this is not a problem we are not hypocrites we know that government is full of waste we know the government can't spend money with any degree of efficiency so we do everything in our power to legally avoid giving the government any more money that we need to liberals make the exact opposite argument\nNow the government it's such a force for good the rich people should get more money why why please explain to me how we have been paying into these anti poverty\nPrograms since the great society and sixty five in sixty six and a percentage of people not working in households with an eligible member of the work has gone up knocked down we have\nThe poverty rate in any significant way at all it was actually going down before the great society and government intervention Phil Gramm had a great piece of the wall Street Journal about this last week it is now almost completely stabilized\nWe are transferring on average something like thirty thousand dollars in equivalent transfer payments over to people in lower income categories and the number of people working that are eligible family members the number of percentage of people are working it's gone down in some of these households\nThe percentage of household with someone else would have worked that don't have anyone working has gone up dramatically what please explain to me how this is evidence of government compassion effectiveness and efficiency pleased with a straight face try not to laugh\nWhile you simultaneously hire accountants like John Kerry and Hillary Clinton remember our real estate thing where they hired accountants to avoid paying extra taxes to the government why did you do that\nWhy if the government is a source for net good things in society turn your money over to them dopey a phony but you can't if you're a liberal listening to the show doesn't that anger you that you're such a fake\nNo serious that you're fraud when you look in the mirror aren't you like wow I'm a real phony I Love the government yeah I Do everything in my power to pay accountants to avoid giving the government money doesn't that make you a fake how do you live like that serious I don't have that issue I look in the mirror\nGo yeah the government really sucks patch I don't want to give them any more my tax money I'm telling you outside of our military courts and the constitutional role of government where there's mass consensus they spent they waste money like none of our government is stakes it's a disaster I have\nNo issue with that\nI look in the mirror and yet I Do everything legally I Can't pay as you tax dollars as possible\nBut not you frauds you don't pay extra money to pay more you don't do anything to give you might say\nWell than a couple of people do voluntarily Patrick I read a report and if the numbers are wrong tweet me I'm happy to hear\nBut I read the report a few years ago that the record amount of money the government abroad in up until that time involuntary tax payments voluntary meeting people just donate extra money the government you're never going to believe it's number\nTwelve million dollars million\nBillion certainly not trillion twelve million dollars\nWe have three hundred and thirty million people in this country are you telling me if say let's be generous I'll play down the number for the sake of making it easy on the liberal say they were thirty million liberals there's probably more than that because in forty or fifty\nWho would classify themselves liberals hey there's twenty five minutes if each of those liberals just donated a dollar\nTo the government\nThe government they worship that they send you fly in front of that that they they almost consider an act of religion and say if you just donated a dollar they would double the amount that voluntarily paid to the government the poultry twelve million dollars that's it\nSo lives step up stop being such frauds stop being such inauthentic fakes and frauds wake up tomorrow morning call your account did and do the right thing\nAir quotes right thing because it's the wrong thing but you say it's the right thing right a big fat juicy check to the G go do it\nCall your account and come on five thousand ten thousand the government's a force for good baddie took things just to cut things take lots to change the\nGo had knock yourself out set an example for the conservatives out there you think are Neanderthals lookout slabs freaked out\nConservatives out there you think are Neanderthals lookout slabs we donated ... hundred billion dollars involuntary tax payments [noise] nice job liberals don't move but nice job at least you guys have a ... fine we she stood for something\nYour big frauds phony phony fakes look yourself in the mirror and say I'm a big fake\nBecause you are\nI don't want to pay extra kill everybody else does why why I give to charity I don't need someone else to do it\nI think that we we my wife and I give to charity we sell short\nShorts on our website we donate the money why I don't need anyone else to do it I don't look for other T shirt makers because we think we're helping someone I don't need you to do what you say the government is helping people out there not why do you need someone else to do it\nJust don't stop\nLike Spike Lee said to the right thing whips step up you won't want your fakes\nRight folks I'm Dan bunch you know from our venue when he was calling seven seven three one two three one but
