screaming for help the people are screaming out to the man we elected because he said he would do this now it's true we have a little time but you know there's going to take a lotta time to build that a barrier in Mexico we're not talking about a structure\nWe're talking about the Mexican government putting a patrol cars tanks whenever they need to do a and build a natural barrier and funneled uh people into that natural barrier and not let them go forward that's what has to happen\nBut Mexico doesn't want to do it for two reasons they don't want them there [noise] they have their own internal

words fake news more now because they don't like it\nThey're all complaining that it might cause violence they've already cause violence now they're screaming let's stop it before someone gets hurt a dummy isn't plenty of people's hard on our side\nSo you want to tamp down the rhetoric you want to stop hating Trump for a little while why don't you try that Mr sucker of CNN\nMr suckers should stop the hatred for a while but let's go back to your uh your point is that the only solution as a barbed wire barrier\nFor that's what I thought that was my theory but in the same token I can understand where you're coming from their CNN is getting a grant around with all the innocent people\nWere about the witches on MSNBC what are the which is that I missed him is he going to do with it the anti

won the Powerball mega millions sixty one point six billion dollars how much would you actually pay\nWell mostly if you don't know that we who make more than a certain amount of pay thirty seven percent of our income to the feds and then if we live in New York\nOr California we pay him a lot more New York has the highest state tax in the country and then California is running a close second about twelve to fourteen Fifteen Percent and stay on top of federal tax which used to be duck to both from federal income tax\nBut when Trump's tax plan in place we can no longer deduct our state income tax payments from a federal income and so therefore we're actually paying more taxes in California did you know that no no this is this is a terrible reality\nSo that's the top income tax rate for individuals is thirty seven percent\nAnd that rate applies to adjusted gross income uh five hundred thousand or more so if you hit the jackpot you'll pay at least thirty seven percent and then state taxes depending upon the state you live in after all the gangs have to take their cut to\nYou know the gangs that are run the states need to take their cut how else can they buy their new brownies suits and they're five hundred dollar ties how can you buy a breed only suit unless you're taking the money from the the ...\nSo how are we going to stop this this man these vandals from getting into the country how\nWell I guess I have to read a little history to you when you want a little tiny history about\nWhen Rome was broken into by the vandals and as a God's when the barbarians in other words broke through Roman broke the nation and half would you like the little little history now do you find that offensive that I'm calling illegal aliens like this these armies this army of young men\nBarbarians how do you know who they are why do you automatically defend them why do you automatically assume they're all coming here to work\nWhy do you assume that in a mob a Fifteen to twenty thousand there are no drug dealers no right but snow killers know gang members why would you assume that there'll be a logical so let's both agree let's all of us agree that amongst the Fifteen thousand a small percentage are bad people very bad people\nOf the type that we all know exist in all communities in an all races so why would you want to bring in people like that to your country when we already have a\nA crime wave in the country that's hardly controllable I Know we're not supposed to even talk about it but this terrible crime in this country especially if you were in the media and you read about these things\nThen you have the deranged walking the streets but I think it's important that your study for one second with me if you don't mind a little history I have a minute or two to do it with I Would do it and I'd say forty minutes if I had a podcast right now which is what you'll get come January I wouldn't cut it off but\nLet's go back to ancient Rome together and let's see what happened in the early history of Rome when the barbarians broke the umpire into and how did that happen\nHow did it happen that the Romans couldn't defend their their borders which will call their frontiers how did it happen that they broke through\nWell as I told you the whole story ready they broke through what more do you need to know or do the whole story that you'll get bored I Know you tuned out already in the age of Twitter and sound bites the minute I said history you went to sleep\nYou turned on either um the nail gun or\nSomething that's a little you know ... more somebody and so how did the barbarians break the Roman empire incident in the east and west whale as I describe and stop mass hysteria and as I described to you before on this program\nIt began and the third century of the Roman empire which was listening to very important for you to hear the ... the empire and the third century was already decaying socially\nAnd disintegrating Marley wow does that sound like doesn't the gym doesn't sound like today at that time in Rome was already decaying socially and disintegrating morally and then they face the barbarians on the borders and get us\nAnd then they face the barbarians on their borders\nAnd get a gift what happened next\nWell all along the imperial frontier\nWhich ran roughly along the Rhine and then you enemies will now pressing against the Roman borders the Franks and other German tribes have come up to the right\nIn North Hungary where the vandals in what was once ... and there's now remaining in\nThe ... behind those in South Russia where the east guts or ... and beyond those in the vulgar region where the ... and then with the Mongolian people's forcing the way towards Europe so history is repeating
