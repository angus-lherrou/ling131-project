N. N. K. DJ I\n[noise]\n[noise]\nIt is the Savage Nation so on the one hand we're talking about of the most serious\nIssue of our time which is the fact that the anchor baby population now exceeds the entire population of Los Angeles California and his roughly half the population of the New York city that's because of family chain migration\nFamily chain migration and that was greatly escalated with the use of a pen and the phone ... Hussein Obama who would not let any Europeans and biologic didn't want any people from Europe he wanted as many people from Africa and the middle east as he could get into this country\nIt's a sad fact of reality but if you look at it from the point of view a rather how liberals are looking at Trump right now if you look at what Obama did could you say he didn't do it for any reason other than the obvious\nSo Trump wants to end birthright citizenship\nAnd um of course it's going to go to the Supreme Court but the good news is our Supreme Court now and I'm taking a phrase that was used by liberal comedian when Obama was president and he looked up at the sky at the White House with all the other uh slippers from Hollywood as there was a fly over\nBy the U.S air force and one of the comedians looked up and said it's our air force now because these are anti military\nLeft these from Hollywood always hated the military so I wanted them nudge them and said what do you think it's our air force now so it's our Supreme Court now and trouble easily get at least two more\nRoof is going to soon get her reward because I got the woman's what Ninety something for how old is she isn't she older then I'm Dianne Feinstein she's almost old enough to be Dianne Feinstein says mother that's a joke she couldn't have had a when she was seven country\nI Know she wants to lower the day age of consent for sex to the age of fourteen but then when they were getting away from the topic here so I posted this on my Twitter feed which I don't use it to test stories from my radio show and I can pretty much tell what's going to work\nWithout Twitter I did it for years without shorter but now I test them on Twitter I Know you don't want to hear that\nAnd I put up should Trump an anchor baby loophole was written this fourteenth amendment only to give African slaves and us write the citizenship so someone writes it won't hold up in court and I wrote it's our Supreme Court now and then here's what I Want you to just listen to the kinds of stuff that comes up is fun sometimes it's like playing checkers\nWhen I no longer want to play mental chess and I need to slow down I go on Twitter what I Want to remember what it was like to be a young person seven or eight years old I treat\nWhen I Want to feel that I'm back in the sixth grade I treat\nSomeone writes them Michael usually are better at hiding the authoritarian tendencies good for you owning the complete lack of respect for the constitution\nSo I wrote well your criminal dictator Obama show like depend on the phone you sure like to sluggish this you lost we won get ready for the true America to reemerge the silent majority will be silence no longer than someone writes your court\nIt led by the guy who upheld Obamacare twice and I wrote we now have capital and two more likely\n[noise] and one really foolish individual wrote well didn't want a Democratic president gets in the second amendment is gone poorly thought out argument\nI should Dumbo Supreme Court appoint these a lifetime positions so you see when you want to feel like you're back in the fifth or sixth grade there's no better way to regret it and go on Twitter\nAnd then you'll meet people at your at your mental level seventh eighth sixth grade maybe I'd say eleven battle evidence well about the same level as those who still go to Hollywood movies\nNow there's another element to this like a baby a situation which is birth tourism oh that's a big one and you know which nationality is specializing in birth tourism that's right your friends from out say some land Chinese flock to USA to give birth to us citizens\nBusiness is booming here for companies that coach pregnant women on how to Deceive Us immigration authorities so they can enter the United states for the sole purpose of giving birth to American citizens at least five hundred companies offered birth tourism services in China the Shanghai newspaper national business daily reported\nThe cost of a trip including medical expenses runs from twenty thousand to eighty thousand dollars the business is legal in China but the tactics renting the u._s._a. or not\nThe women are coached to lie about the purpose of their visit by listening tourism which makes it easier to get a visa they also told to hide their pregnancies when going through your immigration and avoid declarations of they're traveling for medical treatment\nAnd so I could twenty Fifteen California authorities raided dozens of maternity hotels\nFor Chinese women in orange Los Angeles and San Bernardino county for legit immigration attacks or but that wasn't twenty fifth scene that was long before moving became even Mooney or\nSets long before moon being\nBecame even more Mooney joined the Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred seven eight bucks for four hundred seven to eight to [noise]\nAlso [laughter]\nBeautiful little puppy they walk around the block and neighbors say Harry heavier\nHealthy shiny and laughing and oh yeah I think\nAny assets omega threes and I made a Sixers are great for how the skin and soft shiny counts\nI Would really recommend people starting puppies are kind of ice or they get into what I Would call a misery index as bad air breath\nBecause if they're getting all their vitamins my current in France microbial from the gang hanging

dying to fight for life this is that Lucas Arabic\nUsed the phone and a pen with delight with ugly\nAnd so Trump is trying to lie to spark to hold onto the house\nAnd we'll see what happens whether this will get the ... out there I don't know if he'll go out and vote this time I I don't want to even speculate whether you're going to vote or not vote that's kind of second grade I don't know what you're going to do with your with your decision\nBut um I Want to go back to the issue of\nBirth tourism mainly the Chinese having five hundred companies the bring women here to to have a baby here\nBecause they're skirting the law and we're talking about anchor babies Trump at least is talking about it and they get in a challenge to the fourteenth amendment which is a good story to talk about and it's a very real story we know what the scholars are saying\nWhich is that um it will go to the to the courts and we know that the left wing courts will say no he's wrong and then it'll go to the Supreme and they will probably side with Trump\nEven at this court even this court right now would likely side with Trump you know now I think by the time it gets to the court I think there'll be at least one maybe two more and\nMiddle of the road conservatives in their what they did the cabin I don't even want the job right now I Can't imagine that would try to take after Dianne Feinstein got through with Kavanaugh I don't think there's a lawyer in America would want to go through that so who knows who knows who would take a take that chance\nBut you know I could really rile you up if I said we're only opening lines up to nurses and doctors who are listening to the show\nWhether it be in New York or California or Texas why don't you tell us what you see going on in your in your um emergency rooms tell us what they're doing to abuse the healthcare system or I could say if you're a teacher tell us what it's doing to the illiteracy rate in this country look let's be clear I'm a former teacher\nI'm the son of an immigrant very important points for you to remember the fact that the matter is the literacy rate of America has plummeted since Obama opened up the floodgates to a third world is who are illiterate in their own language\nThis is something I cannot emphasize enough we're not even bringing in people who are literate in their own language their illiterate in their home country they cannot read or write most of them cannot read or write in their own language do you know that\nAre you aware that we are calling from the bottom of all the societies on earth\nWere not seeking even moderately educated people from these countries to come here with some literacy we are getting people in who have no literacy now how does that benefit this nation you know I don't care if you're a progressive woman who runs runs a corporation\nOr a or whatever you may be I'm trying to imagine a very wide net of listeners and it's not that narrow it's not as narrow as you may think\nIs that benefit a nation now where is your argument on that I Know give me get tired your poor your hungry in those you're going to be free so repeated again that noble phrase written by Emma Goldman I Believe and on the stature Emma Lazarus always confuse the two I Wish Lazarus\nWas Goldman because Goldman was thrown out of the country\nGoldman was deported for being a real no good Nick\nThat's when people could still be deported Emma golden was thrown out of America for opposing the world war I think World War one\nThis was ... Emma Lazarus Lazarus okay Lazarus Lazarus lesser ... ... give us your tired your poor your hungry those you're going to be free now let's pause there for a moment before we all get so agitated that we lose our lunch\nI get I got to tell you this is so important to know\nBack three four years ago I was on a yacht more in the west side of New York on the Hudson River and the ... district\nAnd I gave a little party for people from my radio business and people from my publishing world about a hundred people came aboard for a cocktail party and I gave a little speech which I played on the show twice over the years 'cause I'm so proud of it\nAnd it just I think it's called an immigrant son\nArrived in New York against something like that and I stood on that yeah and I look\nAt the statue of liberty right down the Hudson River where ... years later would save those people on a plane you know the Hudson River name for all the Henry Hudson that evil white male who ah they named the river for maybe they can rename the Hudson River\nMaybe seal river or something like that because it may offend people now the Hudson River there's the statue of liberty and I pointed to it and I gave some remarks to the audience I Hope that they understood what I was saying that only in America\nCould the son of an immigrant meaning me\nBe here on this boat when my grandfather came here on the urge\nSteer edge steer its third class fourth class they came in no better than most animals and they were sick for most of the voyage and they got off the boat with very little in their pockets but\nThey had a skill or a trade that people to take care of them they will usually taking care of by relatives who were waiting for them in the city of their arrival there was no welfare waiting for them or they wouldn't have gotten in the country if they had no means of support you didn't get in here\nSo the rest is a story you open the little tailor shop you probably work for someone for a while and then he was so good in some skilled at what he was doing as I was told years later I never met him he died at thirty nine forty I don't know how old he died young you know\nKilling himself here in this country very set I Wish I had known him but he's the astronaut or the family Sam I call them the asteroid or the family and one of my books\nSo this guy\nOpens a tailor shop and to become so not well known in New York mainly amongst the wise guys I heard I don't know I heard the story they all had the suits made by a you know how they always like nice suits down there on the east side in those days the gangsters anyway he makes suits for them or you didn't give them away charged him\nAnd he made the suits and then he died of a heart attack God Bless them so what I'm saying to you is I have sympathy for\nDied of a heart attack God Bless them so what I'm saying to you is I have sympathy for those wanting to come here and make a better life for themselves I Know what it's like to want something that worked for it\nBut I also know what it's like to want something worked for it and then be destroyed in this country by social engineers member that phrase popular about five years ago remember the social engineering that we used to talk about five years ago on the radio while we have the social engineer still at work\nAnd if you ever have ever been attacked by the left wing social engineers because you're a white male you'll know what I'm Talking about\nAnd that means you had your birthright stolen from you buy the ACLU as I originally did but they didn't know what they were dealing with with me\nOh if they only knew who I really wasn't what I had inside of me they never would have stood my weight because all I Would have been with some nice professor at one of the university's law retired no one would have heard of me\nBut look what they created\nAnd look what happened as a result of the fact that you can't keep a good man down\nJoined the Savage Nation coal

Kansas where you have Kobach who was a terrific candidate you need to pay attention to this in a Wisconsin\nYou have a great governor in Wisconsin Walker\nAnd he's in the fight of his political career you're in the fight of your political career\n\nThis was very very important\n\nAt least I Know it is and you know it is to\nSay these are some of the ... and if I miss some that's perfectly fine I'm

there are other races in\nCalifornia about seven of them and the Democrats are hoping he went all seven so they can take the house and I can assure you that the media if it's close or they're going to be pushing these races all through the night\n\nTo try and influence the outcome and California a few Republican you live in one of these districts you must not give up your must vote\n\nYou must vote so a lot of important races in California [noise] they got a big race for governor in Oregon\nThey might actually get a Republican governor the first one in forty years can you imagine it but there's

keeps campaigning on the\nFact that she is a former CIA employee\n\nBecause the left is many of them trying to cover their trail they can try and cover what they really are and who they really are she will vote to impeach the president of the United states and Dave Brat as a member of the Freedom Caucus is crucially important that's an important race\nWe're Barbara Comstock in northern Virginia

rhinos in order to win this isn't what your clean out the rhinos you clean out the rhinos in Republican primaries but we have certain candidates in New York New Jersey\nAnd the Supreme Court a Pennsylvania controlled by the Democrats you know what they did these low down phony justice is\nNot too long ago a few months ago they completely ... district did the state to help but Democrats which may in fact\nIf you don't turn out all over the country including a Pennsylvania hand the house for the Democratic party this was what goes on with these Obama judges this is what goes on with

obviously must comply with the constitution and that's part of the problem with the Obama era or they went so far beyond the pale President Trump is doing it right\nAnd we know unfortunately Joe mansion his first vote in the U.S said it would have power\nUnfortunately Joe mansion his first vote and the U.S Senate would have power Schumer and that radical team that was on full display of obstruction and resistance during the judge Kavanaugh nomination\nAnd the people of West Virginia [noise] they need to understand that\nWhen Hillary Clinton and her bunch talked about deplorable they're talking about people hardworking men and women blue collar men and women like the wonderful citizens of West Virginia told me one of the Democrats done in the last forty years for coal miners I Can't think of a single thing other than trying to put them out of work\nA look I think the biggest thing is when you of a presidential nominee who says we'll put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work\nYou might be able to say oops and try to take it back but the people West Virginia dealt for cat that's one of the major reasons why Joe mansions going down that is true self through the factors that Joe mansion vice president Pence said it right there when you don't need him he's never going to lead a certainly not going to stand together with President Trump\nAnd that's why more and more people is they're examining the contrast between my campaign\nAnd Joe mansion coming over to our side that's why we're tied or maybe I'll buy one and the latest poll we feel very good but I have to tell you um are we have to get the word out because Chuck Schumer and the coastal elites Bloomberg and Soros and all these radicals they're coming in and they're spending\nUnbelievable money we think it's going to be over twenty five million West Virginia most expensive state in the country per capita in the Senate election\nA Patrick Morrisey if America wants to donate to your campaign of the people of West Virginia want to turn out and supported the grassroots level what is your website\nOr our website is Patrick Morsi dot com and that's to ours and want to ask since the folks consider donating twenty five dollars right now you'd make a difference we know that Schumer the other day just dumb seven hundred thousand more money in\nThe Democratic Senatorial Committee put a couple of hundred born today we're fighting like back in the arena and we're going to win but you know how we're going to win or you know went through these grassroots patriots that are listening to you mark\nUp people care about the constitution people care about the rule of law the separation of powers that's what I've been all about as the state attorney general West Virginia that's how I'm going to act in the U.S Senate buddy Patrick Morsi dot\nCom two hours one as and please twenty five dollars here twenty five dollars there the limits twenty seven hundred we need to fight that Schumer mansion Clinton team or because they've got the money but we've got the heart and we have a Trump Card\nAnd you know what if we can't get two Republican senators out of West Virginia to give him with the Democrats have done to your state it's going to be very very tough so uh I Hope the folks in West Virginia understand what man she comes home and he smiles and he shakes hands any\nAny kind of does Lincoln and not about the liberals in Congress and so when he votes with them Ninety eight percent of the time so I'm\nA and on these big votes you gotta sit recklessly on the edge of your chair and wonder if he's going to come through or not is he's trying to figure out what is best for his his political career I assume Patrick you're going to take a leading role defending your stay you're going to take a leading role as a conservative\nWe are mark and and I appreciate you saying that as attorney general we helped lead a lot of these national challenges we stood against illegal amnesty and we were very strong we took on that rock Obama UPA\nTime after time and look we say no to this PC nonsense that comes out of a laugh I mean what they did is absolutely outrageous and anyone who says that Joe measure ... only voted for Kavanaugh they have to look back at one point\nDo you know that all of the shenanigans and the obstruction resistant circus that we saw\nHave been avoided if Joe mansion it's stepped out earlier instead of taking a powder when they called whose name first so that he could wait for the state of Maine Susan Collins to test the deciding vote that's profiling cowardice and that's not going to be my approach I'm the exact opposite\n[noise] All right Patrick Morrisey I Wish you all the best I obviously support your effort very very strongly and give out your website against America can try and help you hear\nWell thank you it's Patrick Morsi dot com\nAnd that's two wars and want to ask and once again if you donate twenty five dollars or a hundred dollars or whatever you can do I'm fighting gets a machine\nBut I tell you what we're tied in the polls and I think we're going to get it done because I think people speak a lot louder than money but your money does help today doesn't eat enough money to beat back these liberals\nPatrick Morrisey attorney general of West Virginia I Hope the
