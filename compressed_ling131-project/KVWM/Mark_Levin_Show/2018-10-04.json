and Syria with the mafia family that's been there for hundreds of years that control an entire district and the you know they run the drugs that run the guns through the district and what I came to understand something\nUh watching these Arabic dramas first of all I Love the language I Love to watch it I like to see the subtitles\nThe none of these films have any sexuality in them and yet they're captivating none of the films TV shows made in Muslim countries show any sex and yet they're captivating\nThe women are stunningly beautiful\nThe men are very ... handsome and and testosterone driven filled with rage the way most real men are and yet there's no section is just a subtle sexuality and all of it through the appearance of the people but again no overt sexuality\nSuch as a side note of watching the drama of this a\nLebanese mafia family in the hills of Lebanon on the border with Syria that I got was almost all of the American mafia movies the ... the over the overly caught

when you see the Sicilian mafia type speaking in a court Lee manner which we came to think is highly theatrical\nAnd that is derived from the structure of the language and of the families a that was laid down\nBy the Arabic invaders of Sicily it's a long time ago I'm trying to explain something to you\nThat even watching TV drama you could put the pieces together and see the connections that doesn't have anything to do with the cabin or hearing I'm just giving you an observation the only observation as any relevance to this time today in what I'm discussing and in watching this drama in
