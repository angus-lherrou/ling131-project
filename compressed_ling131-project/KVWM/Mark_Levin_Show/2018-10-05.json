[noise]\nYou know one of my dearest friends\nOne of the smartest floors I Know one of the nicest\nPeople I Know as David Limbaugh he writes great books and he's got one out right now called Jesus risen\nNow this isn't exactly my area of expertise but it's become his area of expertise he's written a lot about politics and so forth but he now has written extensively about Christianity David Limbaugh how are you my friend\nMark how are you a thank you so much for having me on\nWell it's a great pleasure in the book as as I say Jesus risen first of all let me ask you this you are more and more a writing you're really you become a bit of a scholar in this era of Christianity and so forth how did you come to this point\nWhen I was a young adults I wasn't really a believer I I was always believe in God that I I didn't quite a branch of the Bible so I really started studying it and and I had to overcome some obstacles of ... overcome some doubt and\nWhen I finally became a believer I I thought OK I'm holding in my hand the word of God with the Bible and I was so in all of that so many ways that I wanted to inhale it and gobble it up and read as much as I could learn as much as I could about the Bible and theology and I I Wish that that time\nThat there were some short cut that there are some a guide some ... that would help me get a hold a ... a handle on the Bible more quickly though I did takes a lot of work if you do it on your own takes a lot of work anyway and and it's worth\nMore quickly than I did takes a lot of work if you do it on your own takes a lot of work anyway and and it's worthwhile work but as I\nStudy that I I I wanted to share what I learned because I was so excited about it so I Try to write a book on it and this was before I had any platform and written any columns and written any books and it didn't really go anywhere was premature but then I started writing a column and\n... and probably ten or Fifteen Years later I'd written all those columns two columns awake every week and I got five books on my belt and I thought well I now have a platform I've got a little more confidence\nUh and I might just a try this again so I wrote my first Christian themed book and again\n... explain my faith journey and why I Believe in Christianity and then for men I've just gone on to write other books in the last one was a book about the gospels are where I go through the gospels and explain what the text isn't a kind of paraphrase it in chronological order\nAnd then uh also interspersed commentary from some of the greatest Christian thinkers and some of my own inside and I wanted to continue with the New Testament after that because I ran out of space literally on that book so I started with the book of acts in this book and\nIt has a history of the early church and sticks of Paul's or Tina pistols his letters to the early church\nSo that's what this book is it's just a continuation of a my a trek through the New Testament a and I've got more to go and the next book of ... my publisher agrees to do it so what what the short answer the question is I was on fire but the Bible remain on fire\nThe Bible study that really pretty hard for a lay person or the last Twenty years on and off and I wanted to share that passion you help people where I was Hoover who were doubters and wanted to learn more\nAnd give them some kind of a primer and and a deep dive if they wanted to go further I Hope this book is both deep and accessible at the same time and will help people learn about the Bible and most of all inspire them to read the Bible for themselves and learn about it\n[noise] let me ask you this question and you look around the world\nYou see Christianity under attack even in our own country it's under attack in different ways to look in the middle east and same with Judaism you would think that the only religion that ever existed in the middle east was Islam yeah he is the third religion\nTo exist and Christians had been pushed out of most of the Arab countries obviously there are individuals who want to push the Jews have sort of Jerusalem in Israel but when you look at our own country talking about the Supreme Court and the courts generally there is a growing hostility\nTowards Christianity do you think your book will help people better understand that they don't have to be afraid of your face to face\nYou know that is such a good question I I really believe that the Judeo Christian tradition is at the bedrock of our constitutional principles and I realized there's and white and that influences and Judeo Christian principles a behind the constitution and our liberties\nAre and what our tradition stance for the day of Christian Church tradition stands for freedom we believe were made in God's image we believe where we have these innate rights ... writes that come from God that comes from our religious tradition and\n... as a result of really believing that from the core of our soul that we all men are entitled to that freedom we by definition do not want to suppress the freedom and liberty anyone else their religious or political liberty and that includes people\nWhose views are and that the U.S there for the last in response to your question has nothing to fear for it for much atheist have nothing to fear from that Islam as long as it doesn't attack us has nothing to fear from us\nAnd yet the the the suppressor the the totalitarian the authoritarians a suppressor of free speech and liberty\nCome from the left and we do have something to fear from them and so I don't like this notion that Christians should or Jews should sit idly by while the secular left destroys our liberties destroys our way of life destroys those sacred values that that\nUnderlying under guard all of our freedoms are and we can't just as some Christian some passionate Christian suggests we can't just pray and expect God to do it all of course we pray and we put it under his control but he put us here for a purpose we didn't just we we weren't just placed on earth that he passed it by standard\nWe need to be active and there's nothing incompatible between Christianity and political activism as long as we are acting in accordance\nWith our principles and that's what I think we try to do and I we have to fight the left as hard as they fight that we don't want to be as dirty as they are but we do have to be as relentless and his intense I and that's what we need to do and yes they have nothing to fear for much we have a lot to be concerned about in terms of what they would do to us if they had the power\nThe book is Jesus is reason it's by David Limbaugh or you can get at an Amazon dot com or you can go to my site secure they're already ... show Facebook ... Twitter we have a link to it is really a fascinating and um\nI went into the er the audience little interesting discussion you and I had when I said I don't want you to come on and discuss your book

possible tech settlement and\nOur nation or back to secularism and those kind of values that but because they distort what really it really was but we know for a fact what they want to transform\nUs back to something that's anathema to our founding principles and we watched the totalitarian tendencies all wrapped\nUp as Obama tried to bring on\nAnd he wanted to fundamentally transform the nation in the nothing like it appeared at the time nothing like it was founded and you've written eloquently about this and you know that his fundamental transformation was not a restoration of where we started about a radical transformation away from it and the completion of the destruction\nOf our founding principles in my view\nNow again not [laughter] I won't say I'm an expert on this subject won't even say I'm close to that but the way you're dividing your writings on this and you kind of touched on at the beginning\nIs how his house and then where do you go from here\n[noise] okay I Am\nA again wanting to complete my Journey Through the New Testament I'd already written some on the Old Testament and I want to help readers really understand the Bible so these\nThis and I want to give them the historical perspective and so the book of acts as the early church the history of the early church really happened in history these are real people\nAnd and I wrote and I and I included the book of acts as I say with the history of the early church and then six of the apostle Paul Thirteen of pills he writes each forms the Iraqis letters to the churches\nAfter he had planted these churches throughout the Roman empire and they're falling away from the religion they're falling prey to the secular influence is just like we see today the\nSecular influences up the pagan city of corn which was\nDominated by a sexual immorality and I'd call a train from the\nMainly feature of the the love God of African id and Paul would write to these churches in such a personal an intimate way saying look I've formed us up I Would birth a baby and I told you the truth gospel and here you are deviating listen to the listening to these\nPagan influences in following year last fall desires and he told them what they needed to do to get back on course not follow the false teachers but remember what he told them when he was there and then he gives them instruction on practice a Christian living at a live right\nHow to be good and moral people listen to the Holy Spirit of a bay the Holy Spirit and then\nThen continue to do what is right and he also expanded on the doctrine Christian doctor\nAnd what's interesting mark is this really happened in history and I want to give readers a sense of that history because when when they when they read it they will understand it really happened then although Paul wrote these letters to a particular churches\nHe didn't know that though they were inspired by God they would be a political to all of us for\nThe next two thousand or however many years the world exist\nSo they're of universal application to all churches and all the people who read these letters even though they were written to individual people edit that specific point in time in history we've still profit for men today as a Christian leave their holy scripture the New Testament they become part of the New Testament and God's word in our view\nSo it's just right miraculous how this has occurred and people can really profit from these from these words which we believe are God's work so I Want to help all my book is not\nA God's word it's a book about gods were trying to fill a take people's understanding advance their learning curve reduced or intimidation about the Bible and most of all it as I said again inspire them to read it in goblet up like I've tried to do the last Twenty years\nWell you're very much the renaissance man the subjects that you've written about over the years really are um [noise] a very\nWell they cover a lot of territory
