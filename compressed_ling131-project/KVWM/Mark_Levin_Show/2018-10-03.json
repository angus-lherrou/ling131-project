things and evil things and that should be an obvious thing to anyone but apparently the way the narratives being played out but the Democrats as a all women up to be believed in their innocence and pure and all men are evil so you have to destroy the patriarch\nWell again let's go back in history in ancient Rome did you know that they're women gladiators with justice bloodthirsty as male gladiators did you know that you didn't know that\nYou know any of that there were female gladiators what justice bloodthirsty as a male gladiators they love blood they love the blood sport and so that we see the gladiators in modern times sitting on a committee\nLike an ancient Rome destroying a man cutting them two ribbons in front of the public in the public sits like dummies and doesn't see the blood thirsty ness of these women are they more like Venus the goddess of love and beauty or like a Vulcan the God of fire\nNow who was Venus Venus you know that the first five planets in our solar system are named after Roman gods because Romans could see them without telescope did you know that first five planets named after Roman gods to show the influence of ancient Rome\nSo Venus was the goddess of love and beauty she was the daughter of a Jupiter and the on an ocean side them and Venus was desired as a wife by many of the gods\nAnd she was promised by Jupiter to her brother Vulcan and guess what happened unsatisfied with her marriage to the ugly God\nVenus took many lovers including our own half brother Mars the God of war with whom she got several children well okay that's nothing to do with what we're going through today but sometimes I have to look at history or science of poetry or art\nOr music to get away from the insanity of our times and that's why I'm bringing you a little history today to lighten the load of carrying the horror that as being inflicted upon the American people by the Feinstein\nGladiators core out to destroy who I think it's an

necks or sweating ex boyfriend who has a name Richard when that\nShe said that this accuser of cabinet is fundamentally crazy\nThat he she threatened to kill as unborn child and exaggerated everything so she goes on NBC at once this thing which network and she ... on some of our claims during the interview and NBC dozens apologize [noise]\nSo this is what's going on in America today you have a

women\nSo we go back to the Salem witch trials and the hysteria against which isn't the Salem region was fermented in an environment of economic uh socio political turmoil does it sound familiar\nWell it'll be familiar to you after you investigate this a little a little bit more [noise] so what was what were the Salem witch trials what happened\nWell the minister of Salem Village was the strict pious Reverend Samuel Paris and he had a son Thomas and two daughters ages eleven and nine in January of sixteen Ninety to the girls began having tantrums or fits as they were called at the time\nOf the girls through objects scream makes strange noises and twisted themselves into bizarre positions\nAs with John good wins children in Connecticut\nA doctor was called and once again unable to cure the girls the physician pronounced the element to be demonic in nature well then another local girl eleven year old and putting them began having in a similar fashion a pair of magistrates are demanded that the young lady's name the source of there'll be which meant\nOn February ... under pressure of the girls identified three women Sarah Osborne an elderly woman living in poverty Sarah Good a pregnant beg a woman and the Paracels Caribbean slave to the tuba\nConveniently unpredictably two of them were among the rabble into that authorities did not want in their town good an Osborn profess their innocence to no avail and so did the tuba at first\nThose slaves were rare in the region she had been with Reverend Paris for fourteen years and she loved the Paris children for whom she was largely responsible but Paris whipped er into confessing\nPromising to secure her released if she did show the poor woman admitted to the magistrates that quote the devil came to me and bid me serve him an added that she was not the only local which wanting to harm the Puritans she also inform them that she had in fact bake they which cake\nFrom rye and urine with which she gave the family dog just in case the pet was a familiar or help or of a local which what happened next [noise]\nThe three women worried prison the next day\nDespite his promise Paris vow to political expediency and allowed the slave to remain behind bars we late spring before the governor finally convened the special court order and permanent as soon as the women were in prison the Salem authorities undertook a program we know all too well the auto distraction pay attention Diane\nIf there were problems between the merchants and farmers if there were challenges to the local theocracy then leaders must create a diversion Diane an event that would dominate what passed for a new cycle it's sixteen Ninety two and that was which is right in their midst to to buy had said there were others the word spread that they had to be found\nUsing the tactics have Dianne Feinstein and the committee\nTactics have mass hysteria and paranoia Europe had purge itself of tens of thousands of undesirable that way Salem and it's on ... had to do the same\nAs with so many things one can hold the media partly responsible for this hysteria and I give you some examples of how the media was used in that time through books and publications\nAnd so the hysteria gather for throughout the early spring and the numbers of those accused continue to grow by the end of may more than sixty people were jailed awaiting trial for witchcraft\nThat was when the governor was finally forced to establish a special court of all your and Terminator and what happened then on June tenth that institution Dianne Feinstein hang its first victim Bridget Bishop a brash he would always late husband had run and then she was apparently accused of no crime in particular\nThan that she was a soft target the woman who was known for playing shuffle board and wearing red clothing which was considered to signify sexual yearning and prowess well it went on and on and on and what happened\nWell cotton mayor put his agenda ahead of justice he crafted the equivalent of fake news that contributed his own call to arms at the court riding the following\nWe cannot but humbly recommend onto the government the speedy and vigorous prosecution of such as we have rented themselves obnoxious according to the direction given in laws have gone and the wholesome statutes of the English nation for the detection of which crafts\nAnd so what happened was at the peak of the hysteria few citizens regardless of their standing were immune from accusation and they went on and they got one person after another under the Salem witch trials\nAnd so now we speak forward to today\nAnd I'm reading from a book that I'm sure will become a very popular book in America for many years to come stop mass hysteria\nI Want to make one important point and that's one that you're going to face today and for the next months and years ahead and that's the difference between mass hysteria unjustified concern\nIf for example the public had risen up against cutting them either and his cohorts that would not have been hysteria and twenty Eighteen this is something the mainstream media did not understand\nIf you look back through history history not agenda masquerading as history which is all you get from the media today you would learn that the following\nThat for the last one thousand four hundred years radical Islam has been at war with the world that is not a slam a phobia as the mainstream media would have you believe it is fact it is history and urge you to read this without the bias I mentioned earlier in this book indoctrination versus truth\nAnd I give you a list going back only forty years for a partial lifting of the atrocities going back to Nineteen Seventy nine and the U.S embassy in Iran was taken over by radical Muslim males and I bring this up because the mass hysteria in our society is running in the opposite direction as well and what do I mean by that\nNone in the media will dare call it by its proper name\nNot in the media will reference nine eleven it's proper context none in the media will recognize that we are still at war and had been at war because they have been at war with the west for fourteen hundred years and that is why I had you history has a great great teacher were going through a form of mass\nWhy I had you history has a great great teacher were going through a form of mass and easier which
