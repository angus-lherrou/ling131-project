attention to Mozart in the White House now [noise]\nBecause there aren't that many classical music lovers so therefore Mozart is irrelevant\nAnd that's the world we're living in so if I wake up in the morning and I\nPlay certain music it's not only classical don't get me wrong I mean I'm known for listening to jazz rock and roll you name it\nBut if I if I really can't if I don't really feel good I play classical music because it humbled me to the point where I Am a breakdown inside saying that's impossible at a human being could have lived on this Earth like Mozart\nAnd had a brain that was like that that could conceive music like that to me it's is as close as you're ever going to get to God and it goes back to the fact that there are differences between people and unfortunately for us we're living in a time where everyone thinks they're equal to everyone else because of social media that's the tragic truth\nIf you saw the kind of idiots who are on Twitter or on Facebook will comment on things they do nothing about but because they can fire off a one liner suddenly they're equal to the greatest scientist on earth in fact they're better\nAnd this is the problem with social media you could say it's very democratic and levels the playing field no the opposite is true they haven't qualified to comment at all it's like having a more on in the classroom let's say if you're a teacher and having an idiot in the back who keeps interrupting you\nAnd makes the clash pay attention to him because he's got a big mouth and interrupts the teacher so now would learn anything trust me I Know what it's like to be a teacher\nI notice like that really gets in the classroom will disrupt the class but because of the breakdown of our society and all standards and all forms in every aspect of our lives\nNo one knows what's right or wrong anymore very few people do anyway they don't know north from South east from west truth from fall so good from bad\nAnd so therefore if you go on the social media anymore on to take a picture of themselves and now they're more famous than the ... people probably know strip them more than they do Albert Einstein\nI Would say that um the stripper who's attacking Donald Trump is better known today than let's say Martha Washington or something like that you you see where I'm coming from so anyway to make a long story short so I'm I'm

don't care what he said\nHe's one of billions of people said said something about God why why is his statement I got more than the next guy isn't\nBut because he was a darling of the American left media suddenly because they said there is no God now all of a sudden that's a big deal\nNow I understand that that's not I don't understand anything that's all I Want to say so I Try to tell you something about cycads say go palm\nThe moral population the relationship to blue green algae and micro toxins that are filed an algae and lakes and ponds and rivers and things like that and how it might produce nerve toxins that are related to a less something like that but it's a long topic for another day maybe I'll do it on my part cast you know what I'm saying\nCome January this is a topic I could do for three days health I may do regular health segment where I don't have time to do it on TALK radio because you get you know you've got a different format\nIt's like the way this commercial radio you got it you got to interrupt in order to support your show you need advertisers let's be clear\nIt's a different story with a park as you get a chance to expound and a little more depth with a little more you know insight\nIf you get that chance but anyway I'm not complaining I'm just saying so here we are in the imperfect world try to bring some shots of perfection innocent perfect world and we're talking about topics that most people are not interested in\nBecause instead immediately shifted the word immigration immigration immigration immigration how Doris\nYou'd be interested more and you you might want to actually you should that\nBecause I said today\nWhat's going on in this country right now with immigration is a disaster it's a disaster that I've been writing about for twenty five years\nAnd I try to publish a book right after I got my doctorate in Nineteen Ninety Seventy nine eighty gold immigrants and epidemics\nIs after I had had six books published already and my co author was the dean of the school of public health brilliant man and nobody in New York with touched the book for political reasons that was then you understand how how much worse it's gotten here today\nIt's gotten worse here today than it was then\nIt's a miracle that I'm Still on the radio but I won't be here in January and some major stations even though my ratings for higher than anyone else in the station because of political reasons only make no mistake about it joined the Savage Nation\nCold feet by ...

sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to manage share for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family it's five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do that over time just\nDoing the math of six thousand dollars a year that\nThe significant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members of Medicare\nAnd it's growing like crazy find out how much you could save and why men and share is so popular ... eight five five eighty seven Bible that's eight five five eighty seven Bible menace year dot com or a five five eighty seven Bible\nBecause it's very serious it can lead to paralysis in death and children\nOn October fourth health officials in Minnesota now says six children contracted a FM acute flashing my light is which is ... polio like\nNow the CDC has been investigating this increase in a FM which begin twenty fourteen but they don't know why it's happening therefore I fired the head of the CDC\nI'd fire him yesterday when he doesn't know what kind of scientists doesn't know what do you mean paid for if you don't get out of there what you like to go to vacations in Thailand and study the sexual habits of horses so every every article says the causes of them are still unclear\nIt's unclear we don't do anything\nBut it's thought today if I may be a communicable disease really well as one link oh it may be a communicable disease\nAnd certain viruses including polio and Tara viruses that are viruses West Nile virus may even cause FM we're the west Nile virus come from the west dial it doesn't say New York virus doesn't\nMean the west Nile virus when it come from or where you can pretty much see where I'm going with this right\nWell you understand what I like to see which is close the borders do health screening like was done when your grandfather a grandmother came here a great grandfather when anyone with an illness was quarantine to prevent them from spreading it into the healthy population well those are antiquated ideas\nYou can quarantine anyone no matter what disease they have that would go against the uh the sensibilities of the American left\nAnd so the healthy population\nIs an increased risk of diseases like this from these third world countries in plain English common sense would dictate you know let a diseased parts and then your country and common sense if you have a house or apartment would you let someone with a communicable disease in your apartment unless you're a moron San Francisco\nAnd San Francisco probably sleep with the person with a communicable disease to show the good life just they were they ... a kiss them on the lips the show with good good people they are that's how sick they are\nBut if you have a say nation you say no I don't want to get sick\nSo what I'm saying to you there's a relationship\nBetween some immigrants from some countries on some diseases and if you're afraid to say it then you're not living in the Soviet Union member I told you run into a woman last week and then just walking around them all such from Hungary yes was shocking when she said this to me she said I come from the ex Soviet Union and she said\nPeople are more afraid to express themselves politically in America than they were in my country under the Soviet ... on the Soviet rule I was stunned by it you are more afraid to express yourself at home or at work than the Soviets were under under under Stalin\nAnd I put that on the radio two weeks ago and I woke up and it was an article just the other day exactly on that subject that people in America terrified to express themselves because of the insane communist left\nThey're afraid to say one word at work for free there'll be fired\nAfraid to say anything about anything so you're now a prisoner\nIn more fear then the the Soviet era in America today\nYeah okay well what can you do it's just one man one man against the world shoveling you know what I guess the tide\nIs very very difficult odds here I write the book stop mass hysteria America's a sadly from the sandwich rouse the Trump which on its it's doing well but not great it's not doing as good as the comic books and the comic books\nNot as good as the comic books on the left in the comic books on the right people one simple books and simple ideas they don't want to read they don't want to think they don't want history all they want a polemic ...\nI'm not complaining it's the marketplace let the marketplace determined there's nothing I can do about it\nI Try something new I went from politics to a history people were not really ... writing I don't know where the books going to be on the list if it's even on the list after week one I don't know whether you bought the book or you didn't buy the book all I Know is that went to my local bookstore Barnes and noble they said they sold it out\nSo whether that'll indicate the country is ready to read something serious instead of a comic book or a comic book I don't know what are the less you have a television show\nOn Fox News in particular\nAnd or you are lauded by the mainstream media as a genius and you have no television and radio show but you're on every show in the country books have a very very very hard\nChance to ever get into the public eye\nThose are the odds I like I Love it I've always like to swim against the tide I've always like loving love swimming up up river and I'm reaching a poor I don't know if I Want to do it anymore I Know this is an odd time to tell you about all this stuff but it's already almost November I launched the book\nI'm coming to the end of this cycle in radio and in the media I've told you I Would never do another political book although I'm being asked already please do one more on the president's you can't leave us because the presidential elections coming up uh twenty twenty police average just hang in there for one more cycle I'm not so sure I Want to do it\nAnd I don't want to talk much more about it right now because you're going to tell them I don't leave us you know that kind of I don't want to do the old Mike don't leave us I'm not trying to get you to do anything or say ... but truthfully\nMaybe it's time for me to do with Johnny Carson is what I'm thinking as you know here's the funny part about how I work once thought start to flood up in my brain for my subconscious I listen to them\nI can only repressed thoughts for so long\nAnd sometimes you got to listen to your inner inner right got to listen to the old dinner\nAnd I'm reaching that point well what is it really matter\nWhat is it really mad at the ... I have to do this until I drop dead on the radio I went to dinner last night with someone who wants to give me a television show actually I don't want to talk about it was real do so well you know there's someone in the media was eighty four years old who said he's never going to stop to lease until he dies I said well I don't know that's great is that in the oval\n... there's something no let's say you worked with you drop dead like a horse and I you know they shoe horses don't remember what do you dance at a dance will tell you drop dead\nOr is there more nobility and leaving at the height of your career at the top of your career I'm walking out and that's the end of it these are the questions that I really I'm thinking about it a but here's the problem\nThe end of it these are the questions that I really am thinking about it but here's the problem I'm drifting in from disease to this\nIs the problem with that thinking I don't have any hobbies not really I mean I collect old cars but I have two old jaguars I don't drive him that much like a sitter in the garage and touched the carburetors you know\nUh I don't do anything I really like outside of radio this is what I really love doing that's the problem I've given my heart and my soul to this for a quarter of a century I don't golf it's too slow for me\nI mean if you golf God Bless you I find it to slowest sport it just I Can't watch the ball and then walk and that's too slow tennis is too slow for me I don't do anything other than this is what I Love I Love ideas of thinking about politics Kenya transition to becoming a normal human being after a quarter of a century\nOf driving yourself to the top based on truth well tuned in to find out\n... joined the Savage Nation coal no eight by four Hubbard Savage eight by for number seven to eight to salvage\nSavage Nation is sponsored by Swiss America the only company I trust with my financial future coal eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or Swiss America dot com\nOnly two weeks left to get the Gen yourself sunspot correct or for free listen for free for sunspots eight spots and even rent inflamed patches I Love the Gen yourself sunspot director says Renee from Boulder, Colorado she says it's might go to product every day I have sun spots and eggs spots\nAnd can see a definite difference in my skin since using it Renee from Boulder has been raving about the brand new Gen yourself sunspot director and\nFor the next two weeks only you can still get the sunspot miracle for free time is running out though to try this wonderful special watch your sunspots vanish and your bags and puffing his well gone at the results in as little as twelve hours a genuine media effects is also yours for free so please go to Jen your cell dot com now work all eight hundred skin eight nine one\nStill thinking order this weekend receive Germany's luxury micro germ abrasion also free\nRejuvenate and on clogged porous for instantly radiant\nBaby soft skin and for these two weeks shipping is also free eight hundred skin eight nine one or go to Jen you sell dot com genius L. dot com that January ... dot com\nHello Americans I'm Todd Stearns with news and commentary next\nTo experience relief or muscle cramps and your legs and feed used their works relief this non greasy phone has proven to relieve muscle cramps fast and reduced muscles ... stare works relief can also prevent muscle cramps before they start so you can get a full night's sleep without having to worry about muscle cramps\nTheir works relief only takes minutes do apply absorbs quickly and it works there works relief as a life changing product and you don't even need a prescription get their works relief today and the pain relief file at Walmart CBS Rite Aid in Walgreens pharmacies or their works relief dot com\nJames Thomas is an associate professor at the University of Mississippi all this the other day he urged citizens to physically accosted lawmakers in restaurants the professor told people to steal their appetizers and put their fingers in their salads professor Thomas was not joking around he was absolutely serious\n... did not condemned the professor by name but the chancellor did references social media posts that did not reflect the values articulated by the university chancellor Jeffrey bitter went on to condemn statements that encourage acts of aggression and by acts of aggression I assume that means poking your finger and another person's garden salad", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Show Low", "day": "18"}
