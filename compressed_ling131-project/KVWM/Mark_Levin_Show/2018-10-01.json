cabinet or delay\nGoing to do report published in Politico Senator Jeff flake chose to peer pressure when in fact he masterminded the latest Kevin all delay his subsequent media statements about his motivations in his media parents has a lot of this report suggests flights true motivations are far less pure and he would have us believe\nFlights focus on optics on his raw ambition probably for twenty twenty and on the kind of swamp creature political man you're maneuvering some are surrounding this plan reversal paints for the American people a hideous and disturbing portrait of the Arizona senator\n\nOn friday flight told the Atlantic a left wing publication site that he insisted on the seventh FBI investigation and the judge Brett Kavanaugh because he was trying to save two institutions the Senate and the Supreme Court and I imagine that ladies and gentlemen\nHe's the Avraham Lincoln of our time\nDuring this interview he also explain that he was deeply moved by Chris Coons please that's the ... the Democrat from Delaware and decided that it was up to him Jeff like to bring a little unity that stop our country from coming apart quote unquote a move that apparently brought Coons the tears\nTo follow up on his preening media tour flight showed up on sixty minutes with Coons into CBS is revealing parts of this interview while you saw it\nOr if you're wise you didn't well here's part of the interview\nIn an interview with sixty minutes correspondent Scott telling that more on airing senators flaking tunes discuss what they thought of Kavanaugh's emotional testimony both senators were instrumental in delaying a floor vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for a week or the FBI conduct an investigation and the claims against him\nCoons said Kevin O's reaction of questions posed by Democratic senators Dianne Feinstein and Amy blow uh blow a club bitter\nAbout his drinking behavior in high school one over the line\nAre you kidding me you're not allowed to push back against the senator who's accusing you of of sexual acts\nBack against the senator who was accusing you of of sexual\nActs and drinking and all you're not allowed to push back you see how thin skin they are folks it was clearly belligerent aggressive angry and I thought there was a tough dynamic there and I watched him part of me thought this was a man who believes that he did nothing wrong and he's completely unjustly accused and he's being railroaded and he's furious\nAbout it said Coons Coons added that Kavanaugh's more partisan responses though made him question his fitness for the bench\nLet me just stop you there so the city it's like this is his buddy Chris Coons a bill of Delaware who sat the destroyed Kavanaugh and he positioned himself as ... you know I really thought this was a good guy someone tele actually started pushing\nBack you don't get that didn't you know where the United states senators yeah I Know and I know your clown you're still where boxer shorts just don't take a crack like everybody else we know you are and what you are you ... oh well the honorable your dishonorable\n\nThere were some lines he said that he delivered that were sharper more partisan more this is the Clintons paying me back this is a democratic smear campaign that I was surprised it is a dumb [laughter] he was surprised\nThe lawyers or left wing well known activists that Democrats\nFactor for other accuser ...\nOh look at it can't be a Democrat\nOr that whatever flake said he didn't like Kevin O's mention of the Clintons and what not quote unquote but at at I had to put myself in that spot I think you give a little leeway there\nNot flakes positioning of himself has some sort of unifying force whose sole mission is to save the Senate and the Supreme Court because he's driven by patriotic desires for national unity is unraveling\nThe plot the further stalled a cabin on nomination was hatched Thursday night and Senator Susan Collins is or isn't that nice ladies and gentleman that she's been in the witness protection program I suspect she's the maestro behind the whole damn thing wow ... ... ...\n... ... ... anyway also allegedly in attendance where senators Lisa Murkowski and Joe Manchin\nThe foreign put their heads together and came up with a seven I you know I said that the foreign put their heads together and realize\nThat as only flake serves on the Judiciary Committee they couldn't pull off their devious plot without the assistance of another senator serving on the committee\nThey somehow landed on Senator Chris Coons in his noted above flight has been putting him to good use as a political prop in general useful idiots\nAs the Political Report goes in Susan Collins has third floor office in the capital she and her Republican colleagues flake and Murkowski joined by Joe Manchin well agreed they had the power to make or break Kavanaugh\nAnd without settling on precise details they decided to use their leverage to insist on a confirmation process\nThat allow him to retake comfort level with covering all of a situation rather than to kill the Supreme Court nomination outright\nWhat resulted on friday afternoon through Washington and the chaos and guaranteed another week of uncertainty and says ...

just somewhat disturbing\nRevelation and the remaining Political Report quote Collins asked that Susan Collins that Kavanaugh's friend mark judge I'm Dr Ford alleges was in the room during the alleged assault sign a letter and send it to the committee rather than let his lawyer\nAssault sign a letter and sent it to the committee rather than let his lawyer do it according to two Republican senators
