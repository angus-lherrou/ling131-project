white and he was a police officer for Thirty years and his ready to fit with all of this going on he's\nProtected people he has friends of every nationality creed and he has no thank goodness in his phone's all he wants to deal with people that work\nAnd do what they need to do but he is he's almost ten breaking point\nSo you're way I Want to hear I think I understand what you're saying you're saying you're agreeing with me that in this case is your husband is or the breaking point from the hatred towards white people\nYes yes and he doesn't understand it it's like why do you want to blast that'd be a white person and again you can say he's bi racial he's half Hispanic and half white but he doesn't understand this all he wants his people to do what they're supposed to do\nAnd do when you can't tell me on the air what your husband's says but I think you're implying he's reaching a point of exploding isn't that what you're saying\nYes he is and he's he's in his retirement years he teaches firearms training and people are becoming are getting to the point where they're feeling that there there has to be defended just to go I Want to go onto the street anymore he's feeling that he's becoming a target when he\nHas well I I understand that very well and here I understand I've lived like that for twenty five years is a talk show hosts has received death threats for the day I started on chaos I vote you think it's easy now what you're saying now it's it's now gotten so generic it's against all white males now\nAbsolutely and and thank goodness there's apply if there's a platform for people to a release their their anger and and again you get the point what are you going to do about it I mean what what can we do I appreciate you telling us we're going to boycott everybody and their brother were trying to vote\nNo no that doesn't work they wouldn't do anything unless it's targeted at a conservative these um these companies will not do a thing they only target conservatives I\nAgree uh I I've seen this my entire career but um can you tell us some of the things your husband's says without incriminating him\nYes absolutely um he he doesn't go anywhere without carrying a firearm with cheese he's able to do legally that our our house we live in a very rural area he um he he he\n... himself and it sounds kind of armed to the teeth and he [noise] he just doesn't understand he doesn't understand why why people are taking the view that white white men are prejudice white men are only out for themselves he um he's just add a lot for this and he he doesn't\nFeel ... water as he said to you in the privacy of your home that you can share with us\nThat you feel is\nIs a violence ... violence prone\nWell and and like like with with my husband have basically everybody he knows he wants them to be proficient firearms he just feels he feel are going to get into a war or not a race war but we're going to get into a liberal versus conservative war\nSo he fears a political civil war yes yeah yeah but it's it's breaking down on racial lines because of CNN\nYet it absolutely is that again that in in the broad picture my my husband my husband that's that's the bad thing about it my husband has and myself we have friends of all nationality\nSo it's it's almost it at that point are conservative friends that are black Hispanic Asian they feel the same way he does so he feels almost\nAs if they feel powerless when they let a raping maniac racist like this on CNN stoke the flames of hatred\n\nYes and there's there's no way to stop them how do we shut them up\nWell first let me tell you this I Am the most often the most frequently um ignored person in the media and that's a funny statement I'm the most published in the least discussed
