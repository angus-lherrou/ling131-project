justice Brett Kavanaugh after three weeks of historic hysteria embarrassed our country internationally\nI spoke with Savage and he said the left is not just take President Trump they hate this nation it's nothing new but it's at its worst\nAnd then she says Savage delves into American history history of mass hysteria to prove it from Christopher Columbus the Salem witch trials and then he or she she quotes me and she says that these are being set in motion by cynics the politicians without Syria motives\nSavage provides vital contacts for the common elements of dozens of outbreaks of mass hysteria their causes they're short and long term effects and the tactics of the puppet masters who duped gullible masses interfering threats both real and imagine\nShe then went into the issue of Jews because she writes for the times they're Israel she's very Jewish\nAnd she asked me a key question which was funny which was is this good or bad for the Jews what is being done to Capitol at that time\nAnd Savage said quote when Jews are good they are great but when they're bad they're very dangerous\nSavage pointed out adding quote the smartest yet most dangerous person today is Bernie Sanders he is so smart he knows exactly what he is doing he models this platform from the power madness of the Bolshevik Revolution he is energizing this frenzy among the young ...\nOf course we

Blumenthal Blumenthal Schumer affects Jews long term\nWe compared how Jews were treated during the alpha Dreyfuss are Leo Frank cases\nSavage also related how Jewish laws and ethics are the exact opposite of what took place during the process of confirming capital I thought that was the most salient point of our interview Savage related how the Jewish laws an ethics are the exact opposite of what took place\nDuring the process of governing Kavanaugh and what was sad about it was that they were Jewish people\nViolating the ethics of their fathers Blumenthal amongst them Blumenthal in others amongst them using the exact opposite of the teaching of the Jewish people\nSavage a Trump supporter agrees that while he doesn't agree with Trump one hundred percent he thanks got every day

it's worth reading by people who are interested in the deeper ramifications of what happened and how the effects of going to be seen for years and years to come but\nLet's get back to the news of the day and my opinion on it and I don't know whether you agree or disagree with me I said that Haley resign suddenly because she failed to ignite a war with Russia and failed to get Trump to bomb Syria\nNow on one of my base my opinion she was bellicose from the beginning\nShe was bombastic and bellicose at the same time and very threatening she was the exact opposite of what an ... supposed to be and the ... supposed to make peace not war Haley went in there with one mission which was to cause dissension with Russia\nThrough Syria and by bombing Syria again based on the false flag of a chemical attack\nWhich I kept pointing out over and over again it's a false flag false flag false flag false flag or about to release gas and say that I saw that it I pointed out over and over again Assad would be an insane individualized would put in to do this when they're\nWhen they've got ISIS backed in a corner in one city they wouldn't do it and somehow\nPeople within the Trump Administration\nHeard this viewpoint and decided not to unleash another Tomahawk missile attack on the Syrians even though they were ready to do so they were on the verge four weeks ago I don't know if you remember and who was beating the drum for the launch of Tomahawk against Syria\nWell it was missed the ... himself\nThe man who gave us the Iraq War the most dangerous man in the administration

Harris and we're looking at Chuck Schumer\nAnd they're playing hardball with our federal government and positions that demand to be filled not today not tomorrow last year\nAnd this is the resistance party and this is how it plays out in the United States Senate you wondered jeez why isn't the government functioning as well as the quarter ...

that common that\nPeople put it the power they start taking away right and that's what people are afraid to say the Democrats\nTaking away right and that's what people are afraid to say the Democrats and low long if Democrats majority of a communist we'd better wake up America are\nPaid was that the second point you wanted to make yes I did excellent Pete and Long Island thanks for the call good to hear your voice on the market live and show how about Tom Green Bay Wisconsin where my red skins really handed your your Packers a tough one a couple of weeks ago Tom you W excuse me you're on the mark Levin show\nYes I was at a picture and old western you've seen in the past with an angry mob with torches marching toward a jail cell demanding to hang a man who's actually innocent inside\nThat man inside was justice cabin on the person that prevented it was sheriff Trump this outraged\nIt's a beautiful image time because that's exactly how it came to you know do you think there's any other Republican maybe Ted Cruz maybe take his butt of the of the sixteen Seventeen Republicans running for president\nI think maybe Trump and crews were the only ones who have the fortitude and the I don't give a crap attitude about the media and the left and the Democrats to stood by justice Kevin uh do you have any doubt that any of those other Republicans would have folded like a a a cheap tent\nI Would have faith in a Tom Cotton as well but\nI wouldn't do he just he just wasn't running last time I was talking about the the ones who were up\nYeah I Know the ones that are out but you know\nWhat can we do about this angry mob and that and that's my job is led by Chuck Schumer and make no mistake about it and nobody could have made this decision accept him because he had a big choice yet either it takes the chance and roll the dice and makes an outrageous claiming and slaughters and innocence man's reputation\nOr does the reasonable thing and gets five senators where Democrats to vote with the judge\nHe gamble and lost and what's the consequence for Chuck Schumer\nKevin McCarthy is going to roll out legislation to to for the house rep stuff on the wall and all the Republican senators need to support that by going up to the microphone saying if we win this election we support passing it in the Senate by simple majority that should be the consequences for Chuck Schumer\nDoing this filthy nasty evil thing that he did a cabin are because our core jealousy\nWhat the Democrats as completely gone now there's no reason to have the stupid filibuster and Chuck Schumer needs to have a deal with it completely taken away\nWell said Tom well said you can drop the Mike on that one except for one last question is your great Governor Scott Walker gonna pull this one out that he got a pretty good pull the other day but it's still looking pretty close what are you hearing on the streets\nAh [noise] it's hard to gauge the state the state has psycho because if if\nWe had when we had our great Governor Tommy Thompson we had horrible Democrat fan of hers and now we finally have a Republican I'm assembly and a Republican Senate and our CIA and Republican governor but there's this tidal wave\nOf Madison and Milwaukee and its counterbalance by the other people at work and the rural area I Know urban areas but it's it's I think he's gonna do it I I don't think I Hope I don't think the polls are accurate because people shy away from\nAdmitting that Republicans because right we are ... you know just going to get the last\nWell yeah listen I Know what the cultures like up there Tom and Green Bay Wisconsin thank you for the call I Know I I think that's that's pretty I think that's the same pretty much everywhere in this country right now where people are Republicans conservatives with Trump supporters they just keep their head down they're not taking a call from a poll street or who's on the other end of that line\nYou don't have time you're busy you have a job that's why the polls were so wrong almost every time that's why they've been so wrong about Scott Walker in Wisconsin from his first election to the recall election to the reelection but Wisconsin's economy is finally booming\nBecause of the conservative policies economic poses a Walker and the Republicans and medicine to put forth I sure hope he wins is a good man\nI promise you another article to show you how the resistance in it's insidious way is a is is stopping and impeding the regular functions of our government and this one in real clear investigations this article which are also share on my Twitter Larry O'Connor\nUh this one tells you how the hidden hand of Mike Bloomberg is behind it all the headline is how Bloomberg embed green warriors in blue state governments it's by Jeff patch it real clear investigations the very well researched\nInvestigation is a long article I'll give you the synopsis of it though in New York University school of law program funded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg\nWho by the way he wants to be president he's officially heat will be running for the Democrats are going to be like twenty twenty five nominees running for the Democrats their first debate\nIs like in six months it's going to be in spring of twenty Nineteen I Can't wait is going to be phenomenal to see them all ... each other alive and tried to be a ... as socialist as possible to win the nomination it's going to be a complete disaster for them and I can't wait and popping the popcorn now\nA Michael Bloomberg is placing lawyers in the offices of democratic state attorneys general and paying them to prosecute\nEnergy companies and challenged Trump Administration policies on energy and the environment you understand what the opening something said\nThis is the program at the NYU school of law it's funded by Bloomberg and they place lawyers in the offices of the state's attorney general\nAnd and their job they're getting money from the NYU law program not from the state but they're working in the state attorneys general office\nTo sue the Trump Administration and energy companies\nNine states continuing down the article nine states and Washington DC including New York Illinois in Pennsylvania are participating in a multi million dollar program funded by the media magnate\nAn ex New York city mayor who re registered as a Democrat this week amid expectations of a run for president in twenty twenty the fourteen current fellows in the program report to the attorneys general\nBut they are paid by NYU's Bloomberg funded state energy and environmental impact center where these these these socialist groups all have these insidious names\nThe state energy and environmental impact center it's just a big slush fund to pay lawyers to disrupt the Trump Administration\nAnd to make life miserable for energy companies state AG offices hire these trained lawyers not students but season professionals with years of experience as special assistant attorney general do you see how would city assistance\nThey're special assistant attorney general they don't work for the state but the answer to the state attorney general\nUnder terms of the arrangement the fellows works solely to advance progressive environmental policy at a time when democratic state attorneys general have investigated ensued Exxon Mobil and other energy companies over alleged damage due to climate change\nAlthough many government agencies have employees funded by outside sources critics say using special interest money for targeting government action is inappropriate yeah I'm One critic who would say that\nSince outrageous New York Pennsylvania are you happy with this\n\nHorner a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute who wrote a report on the NYU center\nChristopher Horner a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute who wrote a report on the NYU center said the fellowships come with specific strings attached quoting him now the age you offices must agree to use prosecutors to advance progressive clean energy climate change and environmental legal positions ownership\nThey but hey is the center's executive director did not respond to multiple requests for comment I'm sure he didn't because we got it\nWe got 'em dead the rights we got um red handed\nBloomberg throws millions of dollars at this NYU program NYU than hires attorneys hired guns places them in the offices of the attorney general the attorney general doesn't come out of his budget doesn't come out of the state budget\nThe answer to the attorney general be you know who's bidding they're doing they're not doing the bidding of you the voter you the people in those states they're doing the bidding of where the money's coming from\nThis program at NYU funded by Bloomberg that specifically that ensues Exxon Mobil Chesapeake why what whatever oil company in this country\nOr sues the PTA and the Trump Administration trying to shut down progress trying to shut down our economy trying to shut down fracking oil drilling\nSo that they can do the bidding of the well funded environmental wackos\nAnd this is going on in your state\nAnd it's disrupting the progress of our federal government and the EPA that President Trump is in charge of\nAnd why because they can't win at the ballot box they can't win in the elections and so they just throw a bunch of money at lawyers and they tried to sue everybody to try to get their way and try to push their agenda\n\nI'm Larry O'Connor that this is the market living show [noise]",
