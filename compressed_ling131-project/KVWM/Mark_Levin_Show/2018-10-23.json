talk nine Seventy have un show oh it was awesome\nSeventies caves J I\nHome [noise]\nBut we need to understand ladies and gentlemen is that the media as a collective supports the illegal immigration\nThat the media as a collective support socialism that the media as a collective supports the eviscerate for the United states military that the media as a collective supports the Democrat Party that the media as a collective supports activist judges\nThat the media as a collective supports the attack on American history\nWhat else do you take from this\nAnd they go on and on about freedom of the press like you and I are somehow threatening freedom of the press like Donald Trump is somehow threatening of the freedom of the press was John Adams one of our truly great founders and his party\nThe waves that passed the alien and sedition acts\nWith emphasis on this edition park\nWho locked up reporters so call or threaten them\nIt was Woodrow Wilson and Nineteen Eighteen I bet you didn't know that he and his party pushed through another addiction at in Nineteen eighty because we know the left and the Democrats are such supporters of a liberty in individual lives amend the constitution\nPlus a truck\nAnd we could go on it was Brock Obama who's sick the FBI on the a P and Fox News and the New York times\nJames rising and James Rosen\n\nOh yes ... merely calls them out for what they are and he calls them out by name\nNobody can seriously concluded that Don Lemon is any kind of journalist a reporter he's a buffoon nobody can seriously argue that Brian stopped there is any kind of reporter or journalist he's a buffoon and you go right down the list\n\nRight down the list nine things you need to know about illegal immigration and crime this is two years ago the daily wire Byron band learn number one federal state local governments keep data involving illegal immigration and crime out of the public purview\nFox News reported in twenty Fifteen that a source from immigration and Customs Enforcement ice and I love ice\nI've said that quote that comprehensive statistics on illegal immigrants crime are not available from the federal government had suggested contacting county state and federal jail and prison systems individually to compose a tally a process that would encompass thousands of local government so in other words\nIt's the official position of the federal government not to provide you with the crime statistics\nNot to track it they track everything except that\nNumber two available evidence suggests that illegals are in fact more likely to commit crimes and the rest of the population Fox News sorted through merit local state and federal statistics and found that illegal immigrants are three times\nPut it through mirrored local state and federal statistics and found that illegal immigrants are three times as likely to be convicted of murder as members of the general population and account for far more crimes than the three point five percent sure the u._s. population would suggest now why isn't this information reported today\n\nOn good morning America on the today show\nBy ... by well let's hear what\nThe percentage of illegals committing the number of crimes are as follows according to Fox Thirteen points six percent of those sentences for all committed crimes of the country ... percent of murders sentences sixty percent of trafficking ...\nNumber three this is a deli wire almost fifty percent of federal crimes are committed near the Mexico border\nA report from the department of justice in twenty fourteen found the following via judicial watch\nAnd it gives the specific statistics\nNumber for illegal immigrants account for nearly Seventy five percent of federal drug sentences and twenty four again this is according to the United states sentencing commission which also found that illegals were involved in nearly Seventy percent of drug trafficking sensors and over thirty three percent of federal sentences overall\n\nAren't how do you know these people are committing crimes while I don't know about specific individuals but these are the statistics I thought big government leftist like statistics\n\nNumber five a disproportionate amount of illegals are in state prisons Peter\nPersonnel in remember the U.S commission on civil rights lawyer reviewed statistics from the government Accountability Office and the research center and compared the number of illegals and not illegal in prison for murder related offenses any twenty Fifteen National Review piece some of the findings\nThey're almost Seventy thousand illegal aliens in prison for every one hundred\nThousand illegals in Arizona\nLet me correct that there were sixty eight point five seven uh illegal aliens in prison for every one hundred thousand illegals in Arizona compared to fifty four point oh six citizens and legal non citizens and he goes on but you can imagine what the statistics are\nPersonal knowledge that while comparing\nMurder incarceration rates isn't a perfect measurement it's difficult to contend that illegal aliens or more are law abiding\nThat legal residence at least when it comes to major crimes but the more disturbing fact was the approximately two thousand four hundred and thirty illegal aliens who are in prison just for homicide related offenses in California alone\n\nNumber six tens of thousands of criminal illegals have been released by ice and our large in the country in twenty Fifteen ice released almost twenty thousand illegals that committed sixty four thousand crimes\nThat evolved over twelve thousand drunken driving convictions Seventeen hundred and twenty eight cases of assault two hundred and sixteen kidnappings and more than\nTwo hundred homicide or manslaughter convictions and this is why when you have a fool like the mayor of Tallahassee Gillum who says that they will not turn over\nConvicted\nIncarcerated and then fried illegal aliens to be deported by ice they will not turn them over to I Do understand that Florida you understand what I'm Talking about you've got a radical\nWho wants to be your governor I've got more when I return [noise]\nSwing\nNot to mention the shedding I went back in the car that three times a week credit with scratching all night long bouncing on the side of the bag keeping me awake whole entire night from all the scratching and chewing kind of makes you never\nDoes your dog it's scratch sticker Shibley crazy\nNoun count for all over the place come to a dynamite for help and I'll be I think if you want to talk now you gotta pay the ... diner fight is Tricia pie amazes me that he I think\nOur vitamins and enzymes replaced the nutrients cooked out most commercial dark moods\nHe gobbled up all night scratching his shutting isn't animal and it is such a pleasure to have my calm relaxed non shedding I'll be back and I had to think dynamite for that\nRight sanctuary cities have hampered law enforcement of cracking down on gangs the great Heather McDonald documented the frustrations of Los Angeles law enforcement officers all the way back in two thousand for when they couldn't touch known gang members because of their status as well eagles\nWe can't even talk about it says are frustrated LAPD captain people are afraid of a backlash from Hispanics and other LAPD commander in a predominantly Hispanic gang infested district size I Would get a firestorm of criticism\nMentally Hispanic gang infested district size I Would get a firestorm of criticism if I talked about enforcing the immigration law against illegals\nThe issue is that these gang members tended to sneak back\nInto the country even after they were deported for heinous crimes of police officers couldn't enforce immigration laws against them would have to resort to surveilling these gang members until they committed a crime\nNumber nine\nClimate was also increased among major cities that are immigration hubs\nDeli wire editor in chief Ben Shapiro's written quote David from the Atlantic no hard core to immigration opponent and a kind of a coup but anyway wrote in twenty Fifteen that as a twenty eleven there were twenty five thousand illegal immigrants serving\nMurder senses and nearly three million offenses committed by illegal immigrants between two thousand three and two thousand nine including Seventy thousand sex crimes and hundreds of thousands of other violent crimes\nAfter years of welcome declined from pointed out crime rates are rising in immigration hops including Houston Milwaukee Phoenix San Diego you got that Gloria border\nYou idiot\nAnd New York it was thirty four percent Arizona seventeenth birthday present during those years criminal aliens accounted for thirty eight percent of all murder convictions and the five states of California Texas Arizona Florida and New York well\nIllegal aliens constituted only five point six percent of the total population in those states now there's no denying the fact is\n\nYou've got a guy running for governor Gillum in Florida but doesn't that problem with this\nWas a criminal illegal alien is released from prison rather than having a detain or the hold on for the feds to deport them Gillum says abolish ice and now we're not gonna work to get a painter now think about that Florida\n[noise] think about that ladies and gentlemen this is the official position of the United states the ... at Democratic Party the Democratic party it's the official position to abolish ice it's the official position that localities in states local and state law enforcement should not work with us\nThey've smeared ice\nIce isn't even the border patrol ice protects\nThe interior of the United states\n\nFrom a legal and criminal immigrants and you're supposed to hate them\nNow you know actual facts if you're watching cable TV is the news parts of cable TV so called\nYou didn't hear any of this instead\nAll your herd all day today and yesterday was trashing\nTrump that's what you've heard\nYou've heard reportage yell at the ... do you know for sure there are terrorists among the seven thousand what kind of a stupid question is that my response to the reporter is do you know that every one of the seven thousand haven't committed crimes that none of them are\nTerrorists the whole point is there a legal allies are not going through the vetting process well the president said they're criminals among them they're terrorists among them well I have no doubt they're all\n\nCriminals know what they're doing terrorists know what they're doing what we have to wait for them to do something\nBut that's not even the point\nThey're not allowed in our country as a matter of federal law\n\nThe media do not have the same compassion for American citizens who violate federal law they don't have that same passion for American citizens who may get their taxes Robert maybe violate Obamacare and so forth and so on\n\nWhat's happened in this country is the Democratic party in the media have romanticized illegal immigration\nThey romanticized illegal aliens that's the propaganda that's going on in this country\nThat the illegal immigrant is noble or better more hardworking\nThan the American citizen and these fools in the Democratic party and some of the Republican Party but let's be honest really the Democrat Party is a near monopoly on this little legal immigration these fools in the Democratic party these fools in the media these fools in Ireland\n\nWhat they're doing to this country it's unparalleled it's unparalleled\n\nWe have a president who caused it like it is we have a president who's trying to address his hands are tied by ridiculous laws his hands are tied by the Democrat Party the media try to beat him down even though they fail\nThe media desperately wants the Democrats the win this election\n\nAll the free media the Democrats get incredible they desperately want the Democrats win this election they reject the results of the twenty sixteen elections through the media\n\nEven heard this Gloria Bolger on CNN it's twenty sixteen all over again [laughter]\nShut up you idiot\n\nWe know the vast majority of these people are Democrats and liberals poll after poll has shown and they can no longer conceal their ideology\n\nWell what kind of people what kind of citizens\nRoot for illegal aliens that come into your country and they don't know if there's any terrorists and they don't know if there's any criminals\nWhat kind of journalists do this sort of thing for us and phony that would do this sort of thing I'll be right back [noise] [noise]\n[noise] ... addiction shuttered too many lives than broken the hearts of too many families it's time for toughness
