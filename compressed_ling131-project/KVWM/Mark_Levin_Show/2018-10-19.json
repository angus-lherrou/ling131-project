numerology mean and we have Gary the numbers guy hope he's right this time Gary on W. N. T. W. in Virginia Line to what does this mean seven eleven\nAnd you hope on right this time last time I was their program I told you Donald Trump become an expert in that state's\nSo let's start with that but let's go on to your eleventh thing\nNumber one there's two ways to look at number eleven number one that way that we use the number two the way it pops up now let's go to the first\nNine eleven happened on the love at first plane hit the world Trade Center it's quite a weapon nine eleven happened two hundred and fifty fourth day of the year two by four equals eleven the twin towers looked like an ... number eleven ... standing side by side they both have a hundred and ten stories Oklahoma City happened for Nineteen Nineteen Ninety five\nFor one nine one nine Ninety five to thirty eight or eight at the ... eleven first bomb went off at nine o to do the math again eleven and they executed Timothy McVeigh for on the eleventh so basically what is going on here because obviously that's not a coincidence\nYou have to understand that number has five ... energy that people more power are very aware of very aware of this now if you think I'm lying ask yourself why World War one and then at eleven eleven at exactly\nEleven o'clock that in fact by her shots that'd be fine they waited till eleven\nOr hold on what to seven cycles of eleven plus two of my last book sitting number Lebanon the New York times list and your mind mean for me\nIt's not what it means to my mind is what it is and basically what it is that you were having an emotional impact on people with a lot\nThat's what it basically breaks down to\nYou have to understand that when average you see the number eleven whether it be a weather Charlottesville when they made sure that that have not no weapon or they have to say the figures or it doesn't matter where you go with this number eleven is going to touch people emotionally I'll give you an example how this works\nUm about lying\nLet me interject for a minute my friend Vernon Mohammed ... who is a promised\nSaid this he said Dr Savage the number eleven is considered a master number is the most powerful neurological vibration\nRemember you said vibration he said simply stated the double one is the number of awakening\nWhen it shows up at the notes that the catalytic the message is being relayed which will serve to inspire eliminate motivate additionally seven as the number of wisdom knowledge in the inner reflection therefore seven cycles of eleven only magnifies that concept of awareness which sets in motion a change of or a breakthrough for you my best Vern what do you think about that\nWell I I Would agree with a lot of that and the way you can show again the way you verify this as you look at the way they we do not what average everyday people do what they do there's a store called seven eleven all around the world that is that it's so obviously those two numbers go very well together\nThat may no but that's generic that's a generic statement what does it mean with regard to my my numbers eleven coming up all the time\nNot generic at all because the only way to verify this stuff actually work it's a look at the people at the top of the game and see how they're actually doing things so yes they are doing things under eleven energy but see what's your friend told you was only the positive side there's necklace that that number eleven to\nThat's why al ... was form on August eleventh that's why it hit New York on nine eleven that's why they hit Madrid, Spain after eleven that's why they moved from India after eleven so there's two sides of the coin Savage hanging energy\nSo what are you saying what I'm saying is this you are touching people's all live with your words you have a gift for writing and that's exactly why your books are reaching number eleven it's our New York times manipulating lift up the number that's coming out because you're having the most emotional\nWell wait a minute the book before Trump's uh before I got paid the reason was number one on the New York times list that's another one a one in Lebanon eleven so white Vernon says Savage first of all I predict stunning results for the podcast venture he says you'll get more or less\nThis rather age groups of demographics it's going to be huge and it goes on from there well I'm Gary you don't want to make any predictions do you\nI Will make I Will make you a protection that when it comes down to this bitcoin will be proved to be a fraud\nThank you very much for saying something I Know nothing about\nNor I Know why even put that in there but that diminished everything you said before it joined the Savage Nation coal know eat bugs or Hubbard seven eight bucks or more of a seven

overpaying open enrollment is now and it's the best time to maximize your savings you may be able to save as much as forty percent\nLike John ... fifty two year old in Florida was being two Ninety a

available is zero co pays or zero deductibles\nTop quality health insurance at the lowest prices anywhere call now and ask about dental plans under a hundred dollars a year for the entire family\nThat's that's another watch more deliberate left disadvantaged what is it actually mean\nWhat does it mean disadvantage tell me what does it mean\nIt ... it means that they don't have as many resources that parents are not as education\nAlso in other words a kid who comes from a family with the parents killed themselves to be educated and to keep the kittens school they should be punished now\nNo I'm saying this is\nWhere you are you saying yes you're saying automatically because if a kid comes from a household where let's say there's no father which by the way it's not even a racial thing anymore let's say there's no father at home it's a single parent and let's say a ... he's poor and he lives in a terrible neighborhood\nHow do you explain all of the poor whites who came out of tremendous poverty\nAnd yet excelled in school how do you explain that\nNo I I I think that's half except for I realize that\nThe you know that there was a time at Harvard that Jews were not permitted into Harvard or you know that\n...\nNot let let me just explain it I've studied this in great detail that was a time the Jews were prohibited\nFrom entering Harvard did you know that\nI flew into that yet\nAnd yet some kids will let them because they were so brilliant their scores were so high there was a genius was they finally let him in okay now we've turned it around where you're at the stupid or you are the higher your chances of getting in that\nYou know my friends stop with the words like homelessness to me to me homelessness has no meaning that's a left wing phrased to make you feel guilty and the other word is disadvantaged what do you think every person in this country was white has an advantage you believe in white privilege\nNo that's why that's why this would help for like ... and ... you know in other words if you're thinking you're increasing the way that your kids for their relative achievement in school but they grow up\nYou're making a good point but how fair is that\nI think it's fair\nNo that's like saying being a big fish in a little pond as opposed to being a small fish in a big pawn\nRight so you're saying take the big fish from the small pond and then when that kid who thinks he's great from Appalachia because he got straight days in a high school of a underperforming or poor performing kids winds up an elite college so called they're on those ... such things anymore unless they're in the hard science as the rest of us all trash\nUnless you're a hard science is no such thing as an institution that's better than the other all of the other is a mishmash of direct\nIn plain English but let's say you take the kid who was number one in the Appalachian high school and you put them into a so called Ivy League school and then he ... he faces kids who've been studying since they're one year old how's it going to do\nHealth hills coal improvement self at a young age rather than trying to get social justice what his forty years old and ... and he doesn't\nYou're assuming you will is you're making an assumption that because you let him into that elite school is going to become a fair minded person\nI've seen the opposite I think the people who were given an unfair advantage has become worse because then they expected their whole life and then he gets out of a Princeton and Harvard yeah whatever and then when he goes for a job then he goes into the corporate world and then what does he demand you hire me routes what I'll show you\nKnow no that was his\nYou ask anybody in the corporate world what they have to put up with with kids would come out of the schools who use the very same tactics they used to get into the schools in the corporation they will sue you at the drop of a hat everybody knows this\nThe thing is people listening to me and saying how does he there even say it I Know what goes on in this country what should I hide what's real\nWell we disagree on this one I say no don't give any won a special\nAdvantage either it's equal to every one or it's not equal at all is that simple you know there's no such thing as a reverse racism\nThose words don't have any meaning either it's racism or it isn't racism so you exclude Asians are whites because they're doing too well that's racism and you know I thank God the Asians finally sued this has been going on since Nineteen\nSeventy eight that's all [noise] but no one who's Asian listen to the show they're too busy working a four and five forty seven to eight to now before I take a break\nI Can't wait for the podcast come January\nCan I tell you a bit about it we had a big part cast meeting this morning of a team of sixteen people it's so it's going to be amazing here's how it's going to work the show is going to be live this first hour on the stations that carry me\nNow some stations will not carry me not because of the ratings are an eye abnormal ratings but because we're going to be going into the cycle of the election and liberals are running some of these stations that taking me off of the year that's the way it is I don't care what they tell you that's what's happening\nOkay but the rest of your we'll we'll hear the radio show for an hour and then anybody can hear the podcast for free there's no charge for it anywhere in the world at any time and I expected it will be one of the largest broadcaster in the world and so all predictors indicate that it will become one of the most important part cash on the planet\nAnd if you don't believe me wait until January you wait and see what's gonna happen so one way or the other the gatekeepers are going to go whether it's at Harvard or in the radio business is that simple they can try all they want they can destroy any station in the world and get away with it but you know what
