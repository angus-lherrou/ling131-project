I think I think that whole performance was really\nBeneficial for me I mean you know when you're running for governor mark obviously you know voters are going to look to see you know do they agree to it or not and so I'm somebody who is running on keeping Florida low tax aid he wants to map the pac\n... force meant he's running saying\nWe should abolish ice and so there are different obviously huge policy differences but and the governor's race of instead of like a Senate or house race it's more than just about your position because about leadership and who could actually do the job and I think his antics\nJust showed that he's not somebody that would be a good governor even apart from his radical left wing ideology\nSo I think his whole performance backfired I think a lot of people that been looked at me uh and they obviously now get a sense of my biography my service of the country um and I just think that they said the easy decision that I'm just a better leader than go on\nOne of the things that's very very troubling to me knowing you now for several years\nYou lead the fight in the house of representatives to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nWhen nobody thought it would go anywhere you lead the fight in the house of representatives pressing for moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem you succeeded along with the president along with are are wonderful ambassador Freeman and so forth\nAnd then for him and his party to suggest that you supported by neo Nazis when in fact you are the biggest voice for the state of Israel and the United States House of representatives my jaw hit the floor\nWhile I I think it was so ridiculous that I think voters just just slapped that off\nI mean give me a break and this was from a guy who actually opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and he's been endorsed by this radical left wing group dream defenders he actually signed a pledge to the group\nSaying he would support this radical manifesto they ah I'm In this group dream defenders one of their main ah things is boycotting Israel bbs\nThey say Israel a genocidal apartheid states that's the group stance with he will not this of Elvis group that is who he is and I'm actually just today there was a group of we're thirty eight sheriffs in Florida right give them a letter\nAsking him to get the valley dream to from those because uh the pledge that give them sign\nA said that police and prisons have no place in justice they want to abolish\nAre basically traditional law enforcement ... and then spend the money on welfare programs with very radical stuff it's dripping with hatred for men and women are in law enforcement and it's just totally unacceptable and go I'm he will not budge may be sticking by that and and that's just unacceptable cross or yeah for him to\nSay that I I think it was um I think it was a total farce and I think voters are sicker people on the left or just lashing out like that folks and I think it really backfired big car\n[noise] you know ... when you sign a petition you know you're putting your signature to it so there's no confusion and he signed a petition in favor of boycotting Israel he signed a petition in favor of moving police officers outta prisons and more than that\nAs you pointed out but I don't think the moderator quite comprehended what you were saying\nYou're talking about he says abolish ice and move it under the Justice Department I don't know how that changes anything moving ice from one a building to another building as somebody who served as chief of staff to the attorney general his problem is he rejects law enforcement\nAnd your point was this once a criminal alien served time in a state prison in Florida\nThe doors open and they're either turned over to the feds who deport them or they come into your neighborhood and he supports that person going into your neighborhood and not being\nDeported isn't that basically has position yeah\nI asked them on Sunday night's debate of CNN will you honor a good ... they're called ... when the federal government wants to make a criminal illegals coming out of prison\nWell you want to detain requests from Donald Trump's ice agency he would not say he would do that and so if you get to say oh I don't want some of those on the street from the south but not quite a lot to cooperate with I\nMean this idea that always wants to do is move it under the Justice Department mark you know about him trying to backtrack office position you know when he was running ads in the primary thing abolish I because they want open borders got to look for one\nAnd he was playing to the base so the idea that all he wants to do with like administrative tweak or he's lying when he says that he wants to abolish the aging eight because he doesn't want immigration enforcement\n[noise] now when we come back after the bottom of

listeners like Nathaniel whoever the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the Irish they didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual

basically says\nNo use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here optimal kept finding on Nathaniel by half until the IRS agreed to a deal\nThat saved them thousands to resolve this tax that for good optimal knows that behind every tax problems are honest hard working Americans with families homes savings in paychecks that need protection they resolved over half a billion dollars in tax that for their clients now fuel back taxes to the IRS call my friends would opt them a tax relief\n[noise] Enron descent as he immediately tried to racialized this issue that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nNow last time I checked it has nothing to do with somebody's race when there's an undercover agent giving somebody I'm a value to try and see if they'll take it any Chuck it has nothing to do with race and I notice he's tried to do this over and over and over again in this campaign let me ask you a question your running mate who is your running mate\nOh her name is Jeanette noon yeah she's a state representative from Miami\nShe's a Cuban American\nCuban American in and when we get elected she'll be the highest ranking a female Hispanic I'm a history of Florida government\nMhm I noticed the media doesn't talk much about that\nNow of course not but I'll tell you with Andrew lashing out like this I mean when you start talking about corruption people understand about black or white it's about right versus wrong and if you're using this office to feather your own us like games or did\nThey matched the problem it's interesting mark there wasn't just the the illegal stuff that he died when he was on the Tallahassee city commission or he did vote to raise property taxes on people but he also voted to increase his own retirement benefits\nBy tens of thousands of dollars basically doubling it's hay and so he wanted a people Tallahassee to pay more and he wanted somebody to go directly into his pocket so he's always been a self dealing politician or whether ... whether it's legal votes like that which are corrupt anyway\nOr illegal activity like accepting him listen ticket and turning around and giving these guys the deal they want it\nAnd he worked for this group people for American way is that correct\nYeah here's the thing about that that's a very ultra liberal groups so if you look at people for the American way filing they say they pay Andrew Gillum this is while he was mayor a hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year to work forty hours a week\nWell the mayor Tallahassee is a fulltime job so how how was he working forty hours a week for people\nFor the American way so one of two things are true either he is actually doing that in which case he than collecting the people of Tallahassee which\nMay explain why they had the highest number of murders and the history of the city last year and have one of the most uh uh they have the highest crime rate in Florida\nOr he ain't working forty hours a week and that's all just a fraud and he's basically accepting money without performing services so what are the other uh is problematic no matter which way you\nKnow I'm a little confused when I put the nation is in the Floridians are too you can be mayor and have a side job with a group like people for the American way founded by Norman Lear at a Hollywood entered a hundred and forty thousand dollars on the side\nWell yeah I think the big question is they are\nPeople who are in the American way said that was in exchange for him working forty hours a week I think he probably wasn't doing forty hours a week I think they were just trying to funnel money to them but if he was working forty hours a week to them\nHow does that make the people tell me feel you know they have the just out of control crime problem he's raising taxes he's doing all these gangs\nAnd yet he's working for the left wing group so it's a problem either right but it's interesting even though those documents are out there um journalists do not pursue that at all\nMean if I if I Walk on the wrong side of the sidewalk you know they tried to do a do different stories on me so it's definitely a double standard I mean it's an obvious question that would really that should be investigated by the press\nOne hit to other things before you go and then is health care and Texas\nHe ah has talked about Medicare for all this is the big left wing push Medicare for all and it's been pointed out Medicare for all means everyone on Medicare loses Medicare everyone when they don't employ your private employer health care plan loses their private employer health care plan\nEvery union member who's union is negotiated a health care plan they will lose their health care plan\nEverybody will lose the health care that they have now with some theories some ... some concoction they'll create were Washington DC will have the scientists to system whether you like it or not whenever you have today disappears\nAnd what does this response to this and he would eliminate all existing health care plans for everybody that's on them including Medicare\nLittle correction market it eliminates I think that for about three hundred million people\nThe two things that Bernie has built keeps or the VA in the Indian Health service so now I guess that means that all that Elizabeth Warren has a one one thousand percent her health care if they do this but bottom line is right so his response is when I called them out on this was basically to act like\nYou know what I was talking about he was running commercials saying single payer health Medicare for all two months ago but he realizes that that is toxic and Florida because we have senior citizens who have their arrangements they'd been and then the Medicare Medicare Advantage program\nWe have obviously millions of people who earn their health benefits through their employer um through their employment\nAnd he would take all of that way you have no choice you get dumped just as you said dumped on a single payer which we know\nWill cause tax increases it will bankrupt us it'll hemorrhage money and so they'll have to ration and so yeah you may have the right to have all this great stuff but you're not going to find a doctor it's got to be able to perform that there'll be waiting lines and we ...\nAll this great stuff that you're not going to find a doctor is going to be able to perform that there'll be waiting lines and we know the drill and all that so that is not popular once people know what it is and so basically he just tried to run away from it as much as you can\nUm even go in the primary he would gang that got the way that you're wearing where in Florida so we're going to keep her by the gators\nTalk about let me talk about the taxes now I mean one one of the reasons a lot of people come to Florida from these blue states as you don't have an income tax\nAnd that's also one of the reason you have such a dynamic economy and such a diverse economy in Florida and I have a home in Florida so I've seen I've seen the difference between a no tax income tax state and I have a home and I my primary residence in Virginia and an income tax state\nI cannot believe with all the proposals he's making it says I've never supported a state income tax\nThat's what these guys do I saw it in Connecticut years ago and so forth so I'm not an favorite and then they push and push the spending and the debt and then either they push for an income tax or some court orders and income taxes supports an income tax and in truth Disney\nSo there was a study done a nonpartisan study that analyzes all spending proposals and the conclusion that this study was\nHere in order to make it work he would either need to do one or two things have a state wide sales tax of thirty eight percent\nOr impose a state income tax which could reach as high as thirty five percent so those are the only two realistic routes\nWhere he would be able to pay for because you know he wants to pay for single payer health care he wants to pay for free college he wants to do all this other stuff and that's what it would cost you go down that road a Florida is done economically I mean they were totally critical our economy and critical our state and we obviously can't let that happen all that all\nFifteen dollar minimum wage Seattle tried it it's been a complete failure\nAll the cities are trying a what they wind up doing is that the the people who are earning minimum wage or low wages they're the ones who were punished\nBecause what happens is people get fired small restaurants can't afford it even chains can't afford it and so the price of food goes up less people go into these outlets and go into these places and people lose jobs they lose temps\nI mean this doesn't help people actually mandating a Fifteen dollar minimum wage when it has this consequences doesn't\nSo mark I started off blue collar kid I had to work forty hours a week before I got to college I worked all these jobs for six bucks an hour\nThrough college I wouldn't have been able to get through without that and it Illinois policies were in place I Would not have made Fifteen an hour I Would have made zero because I Would not have had the opportunity for any of those jobs\nAnd so what he will do is he will put hundreds of thousands of people out of work he will cause businesses to shut down businesses to leave the state um but here's the thing markets Seattle thing you mentioned a lot of the people who who kept their jobs and they get a pay increase the Fifteen\nThey still ended up with less take home pay because their hours got reduce by the ...\nSo it's really been counterproductive and all the evidence points that way but yet he's off when ... says he doesn't care and that's what he's running\nIt's particularly a harmful to young people are trying to get their first job particularly harmful in minority communities people trying to get their first job\nSame with his open borders policies that particularly harms no skilled or low skilled the unskilled or low skilled individuals but uh he claims to represent these people but his policies crush these people\nRun dissent is once again what is your site America we have a love in search let's give all the support we can to Ron
