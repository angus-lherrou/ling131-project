what else is in the news that you might be interested in San Francisco to vote on taxing rich businesses to help homeless [laughter]\nSo okay let's take some callers here you know what I'm Talking about here many idea I Know it's not the norm\nBut are we living through of madness a time of total man this because there's no history is like a mass I called the mass hysteria but this mass amnesia actually the countries involved in a mass them in the ... they don't have no idea of their own history little letter on the history of human suffering the history of the world the history of survival nothing zero\nSo that way a Bernie Sanders the most dangerous man in American history was mobilizing the idiotic used to ride in the streets\nAnd then you got a this that CBS debate with Trump predictable I'm supposed to sit here and Trump got the best of or I didn't watch it so I Can't say that I Do know that he missed one particular point that he should have given what she brought up the global warming issue\nAnd uh he said something because he didn't have the facts you should have had me as an expert there because I've tried to give them books and apparently as and read them yet because I'm not on Fox News he apparently only a reads and listens to things from people on Fox News so they're debating the global warming thing\nAnd he says well I don't know it's not caused by man and and blah blah blah and millions of years ago he didn't know what\nNot caused by man and and blah blah blah and millions of years ago he didn't know was facts very well this was embarrassing because he could've nailed to across when she said to me but what about the scientists say there is global warming caused by man\nIf he had only listen to me and read government zero which I gave them in person and Trump's war dry gave him in person and I sent copies of stop mass hysteria which went to the dead letter box because only those on Fox News get to the inner circle now he would have read\nAbout the Vostok ice core samples and he would have had the information the trap Lesley Stahl with logic and with science but you can't just keep be asking people and when begging them because it's not selling oh short sales to the ... people in the ... folk\nBut does it sell to the great mass of middle ground that we need in order to hold on to Congress that's all we need to be talking to the educated people who say undecided I'm not a Republican I'm not a Democrat that's the audience that I represent that's the audience I talked to\nSo if you research the Vostok ice core samples in thirty seconds or less what did they show now those of you who read government zero all know the answer\nThe answer is very simple\nA team of five five nation scientist from five nations you went to sleep already I Know they drill down five miles into the coldest place that are\nIn foster talk in the Antarctic coldest place of the earth\nThey drill down five miles into the ice core why they pulled up the sample from five miles below the earth or the ice and then they analyze that ice core sample and what did they find\nThey found that the earth was warmer millennia ago and there was more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere millennia go that tends to disprove the entire theory\nThat manage destroying the earth through global warming\nNow having said that I've worked all of my adult life

hold\n\nHe walked into that building and there was no video of him walking out so either he still in there somewhere or he's dead\nOn that's really the only explanation for it and there was a video of him and leaving the facility I think common sense tells you the Saudis were the producer who did it how they did it I think we have to assume the worst and we'll see\nThey are pretty straightforward Marco Rubio\nOut [noise] so ah\nWaldo or a friend formerly known as a jumble cause soggy alright so as the situation plays out I laid the groundwork by saying probably the greatest accomplishments\nThey laid the groundwork by saying probably the greatest accomplishment of all of the Trump Administration is actually the one we think about the least day to day because we're not dealing with the problems you every day we see the benefit of the economy we got in front of us\nBut we can't forget that yeah you know what we didn't used to have all those domestic radicalized terrorists all the time we haven't had this problem simply\nBy the way I'm not superstitious so I'm not trying to jinx anybody here but guess what that doesn't mean that they don't happen around the world referenced ... we got some problems here there was a real education that I undertook after we went into Iraq\nDie a I went along with the narrative that hey you know uh yeah I mean Afghanistan's to target the outcome of bin Laden but hey we we know that ah\nWe know that we've got problems there Saddam Hussein bad dude if he goes down I mean yeah that that that makes sense in the people if they could be free they're gonna want to be free not understanding of the complications\nSo once things didn't work out exactly the way that we all hope to and we're kind of led to believe that they would I decided I was going to go straight to the stores and read the karate\nStarts out by the way and they'll give you the Reader's Digest if you're not familiar starts out kinda like sunshine law Bob didn't by the end it's kinda like hey if you don't see the world the way we do a you die and by whatever means\nNecessary the groundwork ultimately the groundwork ... now you have is our practice obviously many different sects some of which are positive\nBush really is not true law in all forms is evil\nAnd by the way if you want to argue that three laws not evil again I I guess you can but then you have to make the case that women are subservient to ... to men that if a woman is rights for example she should still be stoned to death because she had sex with the rapist\nI mean just details you know that if you're a homosexual it's why I always liked about the left are you still like to come out and don't understand Israel for for ...\nIf you are a homosexual against what he gets don't because you are homosexual or you know\nThese days they they they just got a ... sometimes they don't\nGet the whole formal stoning thing together they they just talk show buildings or whatever to support the problem in us being somewhat immune from the realities of Islamic terror\nWe can take for granted the safety that we have day to day that is not present elsewhere in the world a little detail for you that you probably were not aware of how many Islamic terror attacks do you think of happened that have been documented around the world so far in twenty Eighteen say about it for a second got number\n... probably one thousand five hundred and eighty nine\n[laughter] probably not a bit higher than what you thought the just today for example in Mali you had a terror attack a woman writing her donkey blown up by Islamic terrorists\nEarlier today in Afghanistan us for citizen citizens that were bombs by Taliban\nYou probably didn't even know that yesterday in France you had a man attack somebody with a chisel raising all probably didn't know about that the even sometimes in\nCountries like France it doesn't get reported over here there's a lot more to that story three is that the root\nAnd guess what they are still tend to do that in Saudi Arabia toward the situation becomes that much more complicated we'll get to the conversation still just getting going on by mud and for

[noise] if you if you saw on happy I'd look the currents park\nWell Colin Kaepernick is wait making way too much money being a the the role the victim who who sacrifice everything making what about asked me to a hundred million dollars\nOh just a little bit more they would have made as a backup quarterback in the NFL so yeah I mean he he fully has a capitalized on his victims status and Isaac I appreciate the the calling the\nPerspective you know it's interesting I'm Aaron ... filling in for more close in by the way and in in South Florida\nHispanic means about thirty different things\nAnd people always over simplify it in part of the reason why the way you have a lot of folks that get for the elections won because you'll have some of these ah pollsters oriental is out there who will say you know hey nationally Hispanics break X percent for Democrats and they see that hey we have a very large\nHispanic contingent in Florida\nAnd then you go all those people are going to break for Democrats at this present\nWell hold on hold on\nFor just a minute [laughter] you have to figure out all the different interest in all the various different groups that are here all the Caribbean islands that are represented Mexico yes you do have south and Central America but it's also represented\nOne of the things that I found to be most interesting kind of like a Isaac was indicating there you're on DACA\nFor many on the right there are stereotypes and assumptions for example if someone's ear on DACA ... they probably are and Obama type a Democrat is they don't like Donald Trump ...\nWell not not necessarily a big misconception that white kind of like hey you know X number of Hispanics will break this way regardless of where they're from or what their interests are you've got to get to know the people\nAnd I found far more often than not\nThat people who really sought out the United states true immigrants they'll wanted a better life overwhelmingly overwhelmingly are more conservative than not certainly socially more conservative than they the Democrats have been in a very long time\nBut even in terms of economics I mentioned earlier this hour\nYou have a lot of the younger folks you have millennials for example are starting to have their eyes open to what this economy can do what the United States economy is capable of they didn't know before because they became adults during the recession and then\nThe Obama economy so now they're just starting to go wow you know things can be different\nI've seen it even around radio you were with some folks that have been here over the years like wow you know really can't get better yeah get you can same deal with a lot of Hispanics\nA lot of different backgrounds\nLot of folks that want a better life if they can obtain that they're going to want more of that and so what we've actually been seen increasingly ... is a trend towards them\nTwo of the most watched districts in the country did a a BBC special on the mid term elections they wanted to highlight six different regions of the country and the talk of elections\nAs the case may be in South Florida here we have the two most heavily democratic districts currently represented by Republicans in the United States House their\nDistricts twenty six and twenty seven in Florida and district twenty six you had Hillary Clinton win in that district in twenty sixteen my sixteen points but you had Carlos Curbelo the curtain representative who's a Republican win by five or six points\nYou know how does that happen\nThat wouldn't happen in other parts of the country right\nI mean the the there are too many people will just both the ticket if you're a ... for Hillary Clinton how could you vote for any Republican\nCongressionally again when I was just mentioning not as a\nConventional as the not so ... a conventional wisdom or or why use thought ... would have you think there's a lot more to the store and we started talking about Hispanics and immigrants do want a better life\nAnd district twenty seven you have\nHillary Clinton had been one that district by twenty points when he points and you had the retiring early in the Ross lightened when that district by ten\n... that's the difference here and that's why it's important\nTo break the odds with these stereotypes to really understand some of the dynamics many votes do not support the left in what they've been doing from the immigration stance or in in many folks that are here on DACA got a disproportionate number ... southward I've talked to a lot of them over the years\nThey might surprise you politically so anyway you just a little food for thought as we're three weeks away from election day let's go to Ryan who wants to take me to task Brian in San Francisco go\n... a a a you you mentioned that you know ... people who smoke\nPot or all down or whatever or\nNot or are not educated or not ... ... you kind of\nAcross that I made a stereotype about it yes but you're you're here to tell me that's not the case you and your ball on are are are on the right to\nUh I work my ass off I actually got a good uh you know I got my crumbs\nBack from there [laughter] [laughter] are they are the land and nasty boys do you ... ... exactly right and I'm going to vote read up and down ticket amen brother I'm actually going to look\nInto all night city council people now and me and asked them 'cause I only got Twenty one days west so I got to get going\nGod Bless you brother and a duly noted duly noted I did make kind of a a nasty stereotype about that do smoke and folks and and maybe ah how they would vote so I have\nThis is a really interesting show we're having here because managers have a twenty two year old biology student last hour from Washington DC
