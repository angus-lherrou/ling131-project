here\nIs to Supreme Court justices that the only one that they stood up for it that's what they want everything else they stood against strong because listen if it was a real ... and he was training at real there wouldn't be as many Republicans are facing looking at it but it was Democrats\nThere's only a handful of Republicans that are conservative and on his agenda they don't want him to

conservative I Am a registered Republican but I'm a conservative and when the GOP abandons our principles\nIt is you are absolutely right it is time for us to go get out there and get our activists friends and no post on their Facebook pages and call their offices and say Feliz ladies like on Obamacare remember\nIt was McCain God rest of the man so but it was McCain sunk Obamacare we had the

really I'm a libertarian in my soul and I'd love the party and I love that they fight but right now it is a binary choice and your binary choice is real\nYour binary choice is this a party of police state tyrants right now what Palmdale I'm Talking about the hill Democrats I'm not talking about the rank and file voters out there I'm Talking about the hill Democrats you're talking about a bunch of police state tyrants\nWho did this Spygate disaster who spied on the president who tried to take down cabinet are really trying to take your money take your business take your health care take your kids' education your choice right now is between that\nAnd Republicans who\nMay be sixty percent of the time with you that choice to me is an obvious one but having said that\nYou find a good independent of libertarian out there who we think can win hey man let's get behind them let's keep these people honest in a primary I have I wrote entire pieces about this who knows maybe there will be part time for a third party in the future if they don't get their act together I'm just saying gym the options here are between\nBad an absolutely cataclysmic ally constantly horrific with a Democrat [laughter]\nDoes that make sense and that's why it is so important for us to go out there and vote we cannot be other option is terrible it's like someone saying gave us the man I'm\nYou're going to die in a heart attack of eighty years I'm going to cut your head off with a chainsaw right now you're going to die either way so what do you think the answer is obvious that Democrats are

those you don't know what I mean you know tens of your friends all ten of your friends Facebook and and tweet to tell your friends and make sure they get the heck out there and they vote that's ... that's your job you have to go out and do that but Jim just remember this\nThe more Republicans we can get elected I again I Know they're not the answer to all our problems but I Know our problem is the Democrats right\nIf the more we get elected we can afford to lose a few rhinos and still hold the conservative majority of the problem with a slim lead we have now in the Senate is we have to collectively kicks kiss the butts of unreliable people\nAnd we can't do that in the Senate we have to be able to let a few rhinos go and still hold on to a concert at great cost him a unfortunately going to take a break 'em run up against time but folks as important as a pivotal let you get out and vote bring ten friends again it's not always a choice between good and bad sometimes it's a choice
