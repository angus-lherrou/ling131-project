of the flag\nOn the back and had his name like a Jersey what habit says Trump forty five was the number for him being a forty fifth president now the reason why he was wearing the shirt to the

I Would caution everyone listening to the following I'm a very smart woman said to me once that you want to know that person for the rest of your life in other words do you want to be writing do you want to be smart you can be right and wind up in court for ten years\nOr you could be smart and and try to get away in any way you can I think that's what we're talking about here as well then isn't it\nWell I [noise] you know that in a fight even if you're trained martial artist you will sometimes lose so even if you're right and even if you think you can win if you can be safe and not have to hurt somebody that's better\nUm but at the same time I don't like the idea that you have to stand out and ... you know this is a whole history I mean I was reading stop mass hysteria\nAnd you're talking about the fifties and the communist attacks and the U.S against them and if you don't stand up to this type of fascism you know whether it's Maxine Waters which is the person inside it at the beginning of the book or these groups on the streets masked mimicking terror groups or\nAs you said the past what what's going to happen at some point people have to stand up\nThat's the that's the bottom line if we don't stand up we'll all fall down right\nMothers don't keep going they'll keep going until they take over every institution in the country as they almost have already done the universities are gone most police departments have been infiltrated and taken over by left wing fanatics as you know and cops who want to do the right thing are afraid to do the right thing\nFor example in Portland we saw a police officer sitting on his motorcycle doing nothing why do you think that was\nA I think he to me he looked angry I bet his superiors instructed him to stand\nDown unless something actually erupted and I think he was just sitting there going this really stinks because the problem with that approach is that these attackers these rioters cut it anytime\nLosing and attack somebody or somebody getting out of their car or in their car can lose their temper or be scared and then the violence has already happened and then the officers respond it's too late preemption is the key to preventing violence we know that\nMm\nWell Dan what's the bottom line urine let's note Dan Horowitz you're in a restaurant\nAnd you're actually a guy who's very fair minded in politically I think just somewhat liberal by the way which is your business or no it's okay you know you don't have to disguise yourself in any way I Know where you are in some ways I also know that I Know that you come from a family of of heroes that I Know for a fact\nI can I say anything about that or not\nYou can you can talk about I thought about that today how would my\nBus so proud of his father who's in his nineties who fought his way from the beaches in Normandy to to um to um I think Berlin in World War two you also lost your uncle did new\nI yes he took himself out of a hospital bed to fight in the battle of the boat and died\nSo damn comes from fighters Dan does night not like to retreat when people threatened him\nI've seen them in action in the courts\nSo Dan I'm going to ask you a ... you're in a restaurant with me now okay I'm with you and they recognize me and I had my book out stop mass hysteria and we're reading from it and some waiter sees us doing it and he checked his friends to come and harassed us they come to the table and start yelling screaming what do we do\nI mean I thought about that because you were talking about that earlier and I was actually thinking of a particular restaurant where we were at where we worried about something like that happening\nI Would pick up a knife and disguise it in my hand [laughter] end up because I'm not going to get hit\nSitting down and I would politely ask them to leave and if we had to I Would suggest we leave although going out on the street is dangerous I Would look to other people in in the restaurant to join in and protect us including\nThey won't go no nobody will do that they'll look the other way I Know that for a fact\nProbably but if need be that nice kind of go where it needs to go to protect me I'm not going to take any physical violence from somebody who was attacking me ...\nWell now you know why that is my attorney\n\nAnd he was in Africa and he brings the napkins when I fight then brings in that into a knife fight\n[laughter] [laughter]\nWell dead hold on I'm going to take a couple of calls because this is not a joke in question I have a number of people calling on this issue by the way including defense attorneys are\nCalling on this issue by the way including defense attorneys are on this stuff actually can I grab this call right now while Dan is on the line is
