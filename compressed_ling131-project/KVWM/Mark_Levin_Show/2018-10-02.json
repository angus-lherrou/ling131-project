say before I make my comment I Love life liberty and ... and I was mesmerized\nWith your interview with John calling and I thought he was going to stumble a little bit but I could not tear myself away from that interview because it it's so refreshing that you ask a question and the person actually has an opportunity to answer the whole question you\nKnow you know let me let me tell you this my friend\nExcuse me my microphone ... let me tell you this I've tried to develop something unique here which is a long form interview program where you have one or two guests said most and you ask a question you actually sit there and listen to the answer\nAnd I listen to the person across from me and I looked him in the eyes and I'm listening to every word they have to say the next question isn't written down ready to pounce the next question may well be a question based on what they just said\nAnd these are people that I'm bringing on the program who in many ways are unique or the heavy side to them you haven't seen a we had a wonderful guests on Sunday unfortunately it was eleven pm eastern against my wishes and it is a it is a program it as a format\nThat some a broadcast folks executive folks and other folks are just they have trouble wrapping their mind around and yet when you look at it\nNot this Sunday the Sunday before we had the highest ratings of any show\nSunday the Sunday before we had the highest ratings of any show\nOn the weekend on Fox CNN and MSNBC this isn't to brag this was to make a point that this model works that the audience is smarter than you think that the audience wants to hear people speak\nAnd you don't have to just keep doing over and over and over again the same format the same model and just may get louder and louder as if that's going to make a difference anyway go right ahead\nWell you just touched on the comment I was going to make I think the ... the the problem only quibble in this country is\nThey have it in their mind that they're morally and intellectually superior to the rest of us and you see these debates on\nUh those other stations that I don't watch and they'll have ten sometimes twelve people and then other people standing behind them and they're stealing all their knowledge and you know that the American people are just too stupid to get it and if it wasn't for bomb\nOr we would be bumping into each other on the street but I have news for them and say I I I Believe this with all my heart the American people are not dumb we're not stupid were able to take\nWell some of them are I mean after all has halted Schumer wind up in the Senate but I get your point most of us or not\nOr Menendez in New Jersey but um we we we can think on our own we can see what's going on and with every one that I speak with everyone is so fed up with is\nNobody even bothered to listen to it any more so let them put out their hatred and their anger I I I Believe in the American spirit I Believe in in their ability to discern right from wrong\nWell I'm all in favor of believing but we'd better get off our butts and vote otherwise none of this matters\nWell in two thousand sixteen they have Hillary Clinton that by sixteen points on election guy I'm well aware\nI understand that but um I Am saying that we need to vote and we cannot rely on what happened in twenty sixteen rely on what happened in twenty ten of these people are more fired up them before and we need to be more fired up than them that's the bottom line\nWe are into your listeners to go out and vote and I have a ... at this very\nGreat sense of calm I was getting aggravated I was getting to a point where I couldn't even watch the news anymore because I I just couldn't deal with it anymore but the more people I talked to
