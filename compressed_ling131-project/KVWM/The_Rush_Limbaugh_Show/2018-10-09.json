she was a way [noise] um [noise] she's admitted that she shows up in states of the union speeches having sort of a little more in line\nTo get through the night why she is seen falling asleep at of course there's nothing wrong with that uh\nI'm Elena Kagan was there the Harvard law school dean way back when hired Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard you lay the Kagan who now says I don't think he should be on the corner I I'm not sure that this is going to do the court any good\nA Justice Thomas was there a whole bunch of people Anthony Kennedy who is a Kavanaugh's replacing and here is the president of the United states will start to hear an audio soundbites seven he has apologized and be Kavanaugh on behalf of the nation\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who stepped forward to serve our country deserves a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nJust calling them out this Trump is right this is not done what normally when you get to the ceremonial swearing in you follow the script and all of that is in the past it's not to be referenced again the fight is over\nEverybody acknowledges that the result is the result we're moving forward except that's not the way it is anymore the Democrats are not stopping what part's not over to them\nThe Democrats are openly promising to impeach Kevin all their openly promising to continue investigate Kevin on\nThey are openly talking about packing the court if they win the house of representatives to nullify the or the power capital has as the fifth so call conservative justice on the court they're not pulling back at all this isn't anywhere over\nAnd so Trump is calling them out and I told you folks this is crucial we don't I Can't think of any former president what would ever do anything like this in defense of his nominee in defense of his principles I Can't think of one who would do it\nAnd it's just as important the Trump do this and it was important when Trump at a rally explained to the American people what the American media has not told them\nWhen he resigned it the essence of her testimony with a drive by that\nThat he was mocking Dr balls need for he wasn't mocking he was simply in forming the American people what the media was holding from them that she couldn't tell anybody where it happened she couldn't tell them when it happened she wasn't sure where about house was\nShe didn't know how she got home and she didn't know who took her and she didn't know what she said after the event that the only thing she remembered is that she had one beer\nThat the four people she said were there in the house all the night at the press and told nobody that\nThe American people that own Lincoln's do what we call mainstream media had no idea of all of these holes in her testimony until Donald Trump\nIf you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nThen that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court\nThe rest of it the history onyx the child like wailing and immature the is the result of the liberal socialist mindset on people young people immature children that don't get their way already suffering psychological disorders of one way one kind or another\nThat video and video of these kids\nOn Saturday afternoon literally calling at the door is that the Supreme Court they get in\nTo try to stop a real swearing in they were literally calling at the doors\nThere wasn't any humanity and miss this was just raw hatred and fear\nCoupled with massive site disorders all of it promoted\nNot denounced all of it promoted and encouraged by the powers that be and the media and the Democrat Party and the ...\nOf the left\nAs I've been saying what a decent people do in response to the peace and people are we're we're not going to become them\nThey have as an objective a real one nation and total human destruction of their opponents that's us\nDo not doubt me on this that may sound a little extreme to those of you that are here on the periphery but do not doubt me that is their objective total destruction and ruin nation\nWell how do we find that these people are not going to try to ruin their political opponents going to try to beat them but we're not going to be come who they are we don't have it again is to become who they are so given that how are they stopped\nIt's a serious question\nIf they are willing to do anything including ... facto career and life political murder\nTo stop things they don't want to stop people\nThat they don't want how do you how do you opposed that how do you beat that back\nDo you do it with decency to do it with politeness do you do it with manners I'm\nSorry I'm going to cut it sorry never Trump or his bought the right manners and ... and so forth isn't going to cut it some people might say Russia the ... the church is rock solid the churches where in during the ... [noise]\nUh not anymore the churches are like every other institutions sucking up the people they hold power everybody needs money\nChurches need money all kinds of people need money and if the people are going to give you money demand that you be a certain way and be open to certain things and you're going to do it this is half a take a look at\nYour papa and what's even happening to the Catholic Church in places serious serious problem when talking about the preservation of what I call our way of life underneath the umbrella of decency\nSo we're very lucky we have somebody willing to push back against it from the highest\nLevels of power in the country Donald Trump fear loosely pushes back on it are caused amount identifies them\nThey're not used to this they don't know how to react to it media is the greatest illustration of that not knowing how to react to being called out for what you really are I mean everybody's accused\nThe media being biased over the years but nobody accuses them of fake making it\nUp\nParticipating in the open and want to ruin nation of people nobody ever accuses them of that and I'm not I mean we may hear but at the highest levels of governance never happened before there's Donald Trump doing it and from the East Room of the White House here is more Trump last night\nThis really triggered him when he declared Kavanaugh innocent\nWhat happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty [noise]\nAnd\nWith that I must say that use are under historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank\nYou [laughter] [noise]\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness encourage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens\nYou know what that is I'm Sorry never Trump or his but that's just pure class to take the\nTo look at those two little girls and tell them that their father is a great man in the midst of all of this\nThose two little girls and tell them that their father is a great man in the midst of all of this the president of the United states taking time out to tell those two young daughters\nOf breath and Ashley Kavanaugh your father is a great man every father wants to hear that every father loves having his children told that is a great man few ever are afforded that\nOpportunity but Trump did it last night\nThen proclaiming Kavanaugh's innocence I mean that is akin to taking all the poison the arrows at every Democrat launched it Kevin all the past two weeks and firing them back\nAt once right down the throats of every Democrat Senator on the Judiciary Committee in every member of the media tried to ruin Kavanaugh\nTo openly proclaiming him innocent\nHe can't do that that was in a corner law he doesn't know but they had him guilty didn't say\nHe was guilty simply on the basis of the allegation\n\nI Want to say one more time I don't believe anything that we went through the past two weeks starting with the realization that Christine Blasey Ford had written a letter to die on science I don't think any of it was spontaneous\nAnd I don't think any of it was happenstance I think every bit of it was an orchestrated campaign just like every other October surprise in politics is\nI think the Democrats were in on it I don't know whether ... privacy was violated I don't know if she was in on it or if she was also a storage\n\nBut somebody suggested she write that letter Monica McLean her\nBuddy who has FBI connections to Preet Bharara who hates Trump the yesterday and why the United states attorney as well as all these FBI people trying to prove Trump Russia collusion\n\nI don't think they ever expected it to get as far as it did they thought Trump would pull back withdraw the nomination or the Kavanaugh would pull out\nAnd they would never get as far as soon as it got here it was clearly illustrated she had no evidence no cooperation no nothing in their strategizing of this advance I never thought I Would go that far\nOne of the reasons is there used to Republican presidents caving nominee gets in big trouble pull the nomination presidents don't want the grief starts reflect\nPoorly on them they go to the nomination look [noise]\nWon't work nominate we can't sustain this you got to pull out nominees inside damn it's my one sorry nominee up pulling my support nominee president get together for the good of the country blah blah blah blah nominee pulls out didn't happen here Trump refused pullout withdraw

I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what would the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival and safety\nBecause I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like our bodies preparing for the Republicans to hold the Senate maybe even expand it or hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house\nIn numbers we haven't seen and who knows how like since Nineteen Ninety four and I've been wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ...\nMedia and and and pulling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen that we're not very many polls in two thousand sixteen got even close to being right Rasmussen was won by the way Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump is forty one\nOr the ... the polling data that Dr ... trust shows them jobs even now after the cabin on hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here to Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back\n\nThe Republican the I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it a buck the Republican governor California is is closer than is running its Gavin Newsom than anybody would ever have a leap possible\nIf the Democrats do not retake the house\nI think\nWashington may be on the inhabitable for a while I I think we haven't seen the meltdown\nThat is going to happen among many elected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again or anything they can come they are ... so certain they're going to win this\nWhere it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informants smarter but\nThat's gone we have replaced\nPeople educated people learn people with Adam so load block cab idiots\n\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nTrump in fact wrote an executive order to end it\nWhich was beaten back on the basis that it was unconstitutional lift the statute in America today says families will be separated\nAnd it's to protect the kids the reason for the reason for the separation is the parents are shoveled off in the holding cells while their cases are adjudicated\nSo I'm watching this stupid show and I see a guy who any under normal season will be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement converted into a queen size zero because he is rounding up kids that Trump is separating from their parents and saving them\nSo I went to the DVR and I cancelled law and order and you're SUV I get rid of that\n... been out there long enough twenty some odd years anyway so and they're all dropping like flies they all feature stuff like this in it\nSo you really you think that\nTwo hundred nine Republican House seats can be up for grabs be cause people all over this country are fed up with Trump and the Republicans separating families [noise]\n\nWell\nUh\nBut that wasn't explained to hundred night services it's really a lot of Republican retirements what yeah committee chairman are retiring cause their term limited\n\nForty three members are retiring some are committee chairmen and the reason they're quitting is because they don't want to go back to being average ordinary members when you're a committee chairman you got perks you got a ten chicken TV Time\nYou know you matter but when your term limited out of your chairmanship then you quit and you'll parlay your time they're into big bucks in the private sector\nYou know there are some Republican retirements but there are two hundred nine of them\nBut my my only point is for there to be this kind of blue wave forty four forty seven retirements does not explain it\nNot with the Democrats think they've got two hundred nine seats leaning in their favor\nOr you don't think it's policy well ... ... people if this is all true there has to be something or a series of things\nThat the American public is just to be tied over and want to take it all out of the Republicans was again the media to Democrats will tell you it's Trump the people in this country hate Trump they're embarrassed of Trump but that's what they think\n\nThe evidence that the country hates Trump to it isn't there in any even even if you look at the leftist opinion polls at forty one percent approval that's not in the twenties where George W.

normal Fifteen states is not enough they need to pick for there'll be a blue way they've got to pick up twenty six thirty they need twenty six to gain control\nAnd are twenty seven I mean it depends on how you know you do the math on on control now this piece in Politico is written the headline is written in such a way to hundred nine seats leaning Democrat leaning or what Democrats\nAn average ordinary person as opposed to conclude from that that the Democrats are going to pick up two hundred nine seats\nThe magic number for the house and control shorter than eight teams and so they go on to say that this means that Democrats are only nine feet short majority so they want you to believe the Democrats have zero seats but they're going to pick up two hundred nine that's how much hatred for Republicans there is the blue wave\nPulled out there say the Republicans are going to lose anywhere from\nTwenty six fifty maybe up to sixty feet I\nMean that's those are the the hard numbers at

Sandra Bernard was threatening Sarah feeling that if she ever came to New York city she would be gang raped by my big black brothers\nQuote unquote remember the outrage on that one from the Democratic

professional lonely looking the maids senators look look\nThey may be paid but the I ... that does not diminish what they're doing they would be there anyway I don't ... the fact that they're being

day and I mentioned a moment ago that I've run across some things that that happened to coincidentally sometimes I Wonder you know how do they run across the as as a divine intervention because they they helped me formulate the things I Wish to say to you about this\n\nAnd he has a piece here about the Kavanaugh aftermath\nAnd here is the relevant part of it for me\nThe general democratic view that has harden since the Nineteen sixties is the one expressed on many occasions by Iraq who say oh\nThe United states is not by the way this is very important this is no this is called well I you nailed this this is a description of how the left sees America\n\nAnd that view of America is one expressed frequently by Obama it is this the United states is not a country bound by a common history or a common ethnicity\nAmerica is a set of values now think back to all the times you can hear Obama you remember Obama's speaking about 'em to vent that it happens or something that he had planned in legislation he was famous\nThose are not ... this is not who we are we must be about ... or ... or ... and every time you get it\nWhile his values are never mind and I'm looking at what he was talking about I Can't remember specifics here but just the idea that he wouldn't sit at ... stadium presumed to be the are richer\nAnd the person who defines\nOf a\nIn sufficiency inadequacy the values of being mistreated forgotten\nAnd the value of voting Democrat never forget that but this\nExplains what is to many people in the political divide why would so many American leftists attach virtue to people in the country illegally and\nTalk about the separation of families in these kittens and have no concern no concern about the future of cans\nAlive and born in America and it's all based on this that will use basis on which they organize the country so illegal immigrants\nChildren separated from their mommies by the Trump Administration has much more in common with the American left which has been discriminated in similar ways by the white majority since the days of the founding\nIllegal immigrants are partners in the struggle illegal immigrants and criminals in general are partners in the struggle against this ...\n\nMajority which has denied fun and liberty and freedom to anybody but themselves\nLook at look at Kavanaugh himself\nThe first why they went after Kavanaugh was sexual assault then it was on the evidence for that\nThere was no evidence there was no cooperation so then it became that he wouldn't be fair\nHe wouldn't be fair because of this whole experience because they're angry because of his extreme statements while he testified it would prove that he was only interested in revenge and therefore he became temperamental late on acceptable\nAnd then it became amplified ridge judicial temperament was just not\nPermitted he doesn't have the values that we want on the Supreme Court\n\nSo he was accused of partisanship he was accused of judicial in temper but he was accused of sexual harassment none of those things stuck so it basically boils down to the fact that he's not one of them and when you get right down to it that's what\nWas all about the irony is that Kavanaugh was chosen because he is an establishment guy and it was thought that he would sail through much easier than say an Amy Coney Barrett who is demonstrably conservative has written of her opposition to roe versus Wade\nNow there is another piece that I encountered Andy McCarthy pointed me to it\nA member of the board at National Review has his own website David bong son

I I just I look at them with puzzlement like I cannot describe you really think that's what all this is a yes we've got to stop talking about abortion\nI said when did you stop paying attention to politics Twenty years ago where do you mean we're so far beyond that you don't even see it\nBut\nAt the heart of it is if we just change who we are then they will stop being so mean and that is not true and it is not the answer and it is not the solution\nBecause they have no desire to co exist\nThey are not energized by the intellectual feast of debate like our intellectuals are they don't want any part is debating anything there's nothing\nTo debate we're not legitimate to them\nAnd so they want to just wipe us out we don't share their values we never will there is no reason to pay us any attention\nWhatsoever [noise] they do not value the so called liberal order of society what we are living for right now is an unprecedented level of hate this honesty distrust and mistreatment\nThere is an amazingly strong disdain for the the allergy of conservatism but not just that there is em on President a disdain and hatred of the social norms that they don't fit in them\nThey know it they don't they're out to change what is normal and it's going to be them and whatever they clam a\nNormal is they want no part a constitutional government ... government's part of that which is discriminated against them from the get go\nThey don't want to be part of western civilization western civilization is all part of the discrimination that racism is out today that they suffer with\nDaily but the logical divide is not just that it's it's it's not\nThree sixty two to eight eight three sixty two to eight eight\n\nOr listening to talk of giant nine Seventy WM show ...

busy last week with the cabinet issue but the bigger bomb that come out\nOf the testimony of James Baker memories the top of legal counsel at the FBI has to do with the issue that we discussed three weeks ago which was Rod Rosenstein saying that he wanted a surreptitiously\nRecord Donald Trump and maybe we can get some cabinet officials in both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nAnyway it turns out that not long after that twenty Seventeen meeting where Rod Rosenstein reportedly discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with President Trump remember this was this was chronicled by both\nThe deputy director Andrew McCabe in and his lawyer Lisa Page That's Peter strokes boyfriend\nThey went into the office of a third of the eye official a girlfriend rather sorry Lisa Page was\nIt was she was his boyfriend\nHe was her she was his girlfriend alright enough you're interrupting me anyway went to the office of a third of official general counsel Baker\nThey told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said so now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump\nAfter Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word through intermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it the thing that struck me the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source close to the investigation of of bakers\nHouse interview he was conveying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously because he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force along the outer banks and forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moves north it's going to accelerate through there\nWhere we are looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City\nThat is ground zero for the worst part of this storm and\nCity that is ground zero for the worst part of this storm and you folks over there you ... you got you got remembered the way that northeast or at fly to Florida shape\nEven though to the east Appalachia cola or do we won't be as bad you're still going to get tremendous storm surge in there because all that water that's to the east of the storm is piling up\nAnd heading in there and do that by to Florida I think Tallahassee probably won't get wind gust eighty Ninety miles an hour and they're not the power out in Tallahassee during hurricane Kate which went very close to the Ninety percent\nOf the power was knocked out in Tallahassee and I think you're going to see Ninety a hundred percent power outage or with this there I'm now I'm just saying the when should be higher in Tallahassee at least the Gus with this\nAnd we'll have severe weather breaking out later tomorrow afternoon demonic possibilities tornadoes are from Florida and then prove southern Georgia coastal South Carolina North Carolina or during the day Thursday as this moves up rapidly northeast\nIt's a scary All right so when do we get landfall and ah what would you recommend that people I Know a lot of people live on that coast I've been down there a number of times it's actually it's so beautiful um and it's but there are a lot of homes right on the water\nSo how between four three nine PM tomorrow I think one way to go and have landfall\nAnd I think things are really going to deteriorate very very rapidly um it appears tomorrow morning midday an afternoon in there you just got to get out I mean well you know again with sports you know we had a hundred hundred and ten mile an hour winds it was a bad storm it was spread out\nThis is this is much more of a hey make or other kind of thing work at it it's a knockout punch it with a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty mile an hour winds and a lot of folks\nYou can see what's going on with this you saw with foreign Saturday I kept trying to organize couldn't quite do it you see it on the clock photograph the eyes getting tighter and tighter and tighter and that means that this storm is intensifying as it comes to the coast there's well\nThere's nothing magical about it and I we I wrote\nI wrote on this week I'm ... I Know that sounds pop it but you've got people say we've never seen anything like this is already starting with the climate ambulance chasing this has been telegraph so far in advance\nAnd even from late last week you could see that was going to be a major problem coming up into the Gulf of Mexico and if it was going to be what we call rapid rapid development feedback we see that happen every now and then\nAnd we are fortunate with uh Florence said it was you know it was off its peak this is going the opposite way and that's what hurricanes do and given the ideal situation that's what this is so\nIt really hits landfall I Would say if I'm looking at the my own but your website actually so you have it hitting land it's really going to start getting rough about noon tomorrow we'll a little before right\nAnd that and then the the landfall I think sometime between three and nine PM Panama City will get that down in ... I Believe maybe on with the on TV Tonight we will be honing in on this we get a lot of people in that area of course you know and as you've been harping about what twenty eight days away\nAnd we'll we want to know people that listen\nYou know I I appreciate let me beyond here want to take care you're down there but we want you to listen and get the heck out of there if you order it out of there because it's a bad storm\nAlright Joe ... started the official weatherman of the Sean Hannity show please you know whatever your local officials tell you I'm what I'm hearing from Joe is if you're a coastal person you're going to want to move inland probably a little bit more\nUh westward rather than eastward because it's going to make a right turn ... looks like it's headed right through the Atlanta area\nRight into the coastal areas of the Carolinas and uh and then straight out to see maybe getting is upward as northern as a Virginia but look at whatever your local officials tell you if they tell you got to evacuate don't be pride full just suck it up take the day or to\nMake sure you're safe and secure put put that as a top priority\nUh All right thanks so much for being with us job authority whether bell dot com thank you uh eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program president now even he saying what I'm suggesting is that is that the U.S would end up ah like Venezuela if if the Democrats win the midterms\nThere's some truth to that was a little bit of payback I see for Senator Lisa Murkowski the geo ... Alaska\nApparently is going to either reprimand or totally disappeared now Lisa Murkowski I Would assume a primary\nPart of the one person I'd love in Alaska to run against or it would be Sarah Palin maybe Governor Palin could make a a political comeback I think the people there would like like that a lot um\nWas a guy out this was a fascinating race cars you wouldn't think anything in California would be in play although there are very important especially in Southern California\nThere are very important congressional seats in play and that would be from say just south of Los Angeles Orange County down and through San Diego and I know they've had massive population shifts down there but you wouldn't think state wide that you'd have\nA gubernatorial race that is now is closed as it is\nIt's a five point race between Gavin Newsom and the Republican businessman guy by the name of John Cox\nWe've got to get John Cox on the program and I'm going to tell you why it's happening\nBecause the people in California are fundamentally understanding what Gavin Newsom is proposing is an economic disaster for that state went oh free health care for everybody it doesn't matter if you're in California legally or not\nAnd also the cost of it being not only a sanctuary city like San Francisco but the sanctuary state\nWell that means that that includes health care that's the criminal justice system that the educational system and if people are not paying taxes are in the state illegally and maybe some illegal immigrants do but they're certainly\nTo use services under what Gavin Newsom is proposing for everybody it's basically putting a sign out that would say hey free health care in California just make it here and we'll take care of you\nAnd you know people are going to do they're going to make it there and use the California health system and remember California already has a state income tax uh Thirteen and a half percent\nYou know add that to a federal income tax and the fact that you can no longer the duck after the tax cut plan passed you could no longer caught or deduct rather your state income taxes on your tax return means that if you do make money in California you're paying that much more in taxes\nSo the people of California are hit harder than any other state in the United states and New York is where I Am is right behind them\nIt's just ridiculous the amount of the burdens that they're putting on the people of California and Dianne Feinstein is up for reelection it's gonna be interesting to see if ah Gavin Newsom will pull her down in terms of the polls but anyway we'll we'll have to watch that race a little more closely and see what happens all the way we do have\nAn attempt by the them Democrats and now threatening to impeach and continue the investigations into judge Kavanaugh and um they want to now begin the process of teaching them to the house Judiciary Committee Jerrold Nadler\nWho's a strongly implied impeachment would be on the table of Democrats take over the lower chamber in the midterms\nStrongly implied impeachment would be on the table of Democrats take over the lower chamber in the midterms is there anybody in the Democratic party that's running on any agenda item that would make\nMake America great for the people in the country or they offering anything to make for better America for anybody\nMorgan Stanley said the belief in American exceptionalism among global investors has never been higher organs daily guy by the name of Mr sharp ...
