shooting and killing two African Americans at a grocery store\nAnd do we barely had time to work very hard time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in

ban\nWell there you have it on my friends' there's there's Don eleven um we need a white guy ban to go along with the travel ban and the Muslim ban because the biggest terror threat in this country right now is white\nMen this of course ignore is\nAll of the people of color protest marches antifa who inflict damage and harm other people of course the black lives matter\nA group but you see a\nWhat's interesting about this are noteworthy about it is this is what is really thought of Don Lemon is not alone here he just happened to be the guy that said it\nBut that happens to be the driving impetus behind\nMuch of extreme liberalism they certainly that is what's driving militant feminism angry women they think white men of the problem white Christian men are the problem in virtually every instance so that dates back to the founding of America and this was the organizing\nEnergy force behind much of radical liberalism today\nThat white men are the problem from the establishment of the American government is a capitalistic economy\nUh to the United states in general just setting themselves up as the majority and they now wreak havoc and they get unfair benefits

had been pedaled or the metal and here's the opinion of David ...\nWe ought to go back and think about you know how Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma say I'm Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd ... he doesn't go after the terrorists he doesn't sort of make a beat the drums or to go out and stop the terrorists all around the country tried to heal and it was a turning point in his presidency he was embattled wondering what the Oklahoma City that turns his person say around the very positive direction\nThis is how history revision has works there David Ronald Reagan's saying that Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma City in Nineteen Ninety five and he'll he didn't go after\nThe terrorists\nHe didn't start in America you know beat the drums didn't go out and stop the terrorists\nWill\nLet's go back and listen to what Gergen thanks was Bill Clinton's finest moment April twenty fourth Nineteen Ninety five in Minneapolis\nHere so many loud and angry voices in America today whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up an upset with each other they spread hey\nThey leave the impression that by their very words that violence is acceptable you oughta see I'm sure you are now saying the reports are some things that are regularly send\nOver the airwaves in America today it is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless speech\nRight now who couldn't even talking about this Nineteen Ninety five there is no Fox News the Blago surrounds me some of the airwaves or this is where he attempted to blame me everybody you know what at the time and it was even applauded by some not everybody\nAt the White House felt some have had the issue of correctional say no we were talking about the Michigan Militia short wave radio network that's where we met by angry voices on the right\nThe Michigan Militia was a media creation I mean there might have been some guys hiking around in the woods with some guns were in camel gear and the media had video of it but the Michigan Militia was a non factor in any of this\nYou get right up but there's Clinton's zeroing in on it when it's attempt to blame me\nBombed out somebody said Clinton you didn't do that you know he was trying to heal he didn't go after anybody he didn't go after the terrorist he didn't sort of beat the drums and start to tell us all on he tried to heal it was a turning this is\nAgain history revision is an extraordinary one more bite this is Wolf Blitzer asked\nAnd judge Jeffrey children\nLast night on a Wolf Blitzer show on CNN\nI was the White House correspondent proceeding in Nineteen Ninety five are in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing or Clinton was president he went to Oklahoma City was deliberate a beautiful speech who was very very warmly received there were no protesters going on for you remember those days\nAnd how about you know President Obama who unfortunately had all these mass shootings on his watch in South Carolina in Connecticut and you know he led the grieving and all those\nOf Carolina in Connecticut and you know he led the grieving and all those places frankly wouldn't even occur to me that there would have been protests see\nSo now there were no protest for a bomb and there's no protests when Clinton went out but there's all kinds of protests when Trump goes up meaning what\nThat Trump's guilty But Trump's at fault that the protesters are right why weren't there any protests back in those days we'll take a look at who the victims were number one but what why we're there no protests\n\nPrecisely because the left very rarely protest its own people they protest for no reason at all other than a simple excuse for it\nBut it also was a different time we're talking about it over twenty five years ago twenty two twenty three years ago and it it it was a much quieter and different time it was\nJust getting ratcheted up to where we're headed in any way I got to take a break

they live they breathe it they rank Bridget tainted sales lemonade it they absorb it it's news\nThey think everybody does it to a certain extent\nAnd so they get all have to try to about things and they see the caravan might be helping Trump and they like it or don't like it doesn't matter and then they say that Kavanaugh situation the Democrats blew that sky high it\nAs a whole man this is really gonna help but then the pipe bomb in the Senate guy shouldn't come along and they feel like their motivation or energy level\nFocus on those two things is interrupted by it and they think everybody else's\nHas well\nI don't know that it works like that with with with the people who are not in the news business\nBut I'm going to tell you it's been conventional wisdom and washing then

getting justice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold malign in Seoul abused in Seoul raped by Kevin ... is the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why is justice not

the big things was hard of hearing but it's not as he couldn't\nHere to radio easily one of the big things being discussed on your program say immigration we call the pop pop you would not\nBelieve it I mean I I I'm dealing with people who are just so anti immigration wouldn't run this was\nThis was folks this was all them back in Nineteen Ninety it wasn't just strictly southern border immigration and he said you know I remember those debates all the way back in the early Nineteen hundreds back in the days Ellis Island you immigration has been\n\nA polarizing subject to this country for as long as we have been doing it and he started telling me stories of the\nUh efforts to impugn new arrivals from western in Eastern Europe\nAnd he was telling me that there were so many people who didn't want any of those people from Eastern Europe Western Europe average people as his point was the arguments haven't changed the issue has been something that is Constance\nBut the one thing that has changed he was talking about even back in Nineteen Ninety when we were talking about he was talking about legal immigration\nHe was saying but back in the early Nineteen hundreds late Eighteen hundreds of controversy then was about legal immigration and even with the legal immigration there were people opposed to opening up Ellis Island then preventing masses of humanity that come in\nAnd for reasons similar to what her stuff today\nThe differentiating thing today is that legal immigration is seldom even discussed\nAnd we have both political parties in predominantly one of them now advocating for the last one is advocating for illegal immigration and then using opponents of illegal immigration as examples of racism and bigotry\nSo forth so while the issue has always been around and it's always been a controversial thing\nImmigration and how we manage it\nThe idea that illegal aliens should be automatically granted citizenship or amnesty upon their arrival\nThat is what's new to this debate and that is what the uh the Democrats or the American left today are are advocating and they're doing so on the premise that America is responsible for the economic\nPlight of these people that we\nAs a superpower have taken an unfair portion of the world's resources\nWe've gone around the world and taking what we want and we have not compensated people privately we've tried to impose our way of life and so in liberalism economics is a zero sum game if the American people are wealthier than somebody has to be\nPoor out there and so therefore the American people are guilty of something there was an unequal distribution\nOf wealth elapsed as in all of these countries in Central America and South America so poor compared to us and it's not a coincidence got to be our fault somehow so it's only fair that these people are fleeing rotten economy is in war torn strife\nThat the United states allow them in as a means of apology\nAnd it becomes a definition of compassion\nAnd the real purpose behind it is to transform America and to kind of nation it was never intended are found it to be and that's the difference is legal and illegal immigration subject has been around it's been controversial for as long as it has been happening but\nThe idea that illegal immigrants have legal claim on whatever they want in this country that's that is what's new and the education

years\nThe Republicans only endorsed Republicans for US Senate but now they've endorsed kissed in cinema yeah\nThe republic says anyone tired of how toxic Washington is should support cinema because

Missouri voters to believe her when she says I support President Trump a hundred percent on securing the\nBorder well that's odd because I don't think I've ever heard Claire McCaskill ever chat or talk about building a wall even once\nBut anyway she told the big news CNN that she supports the president a hundred percent to do what it takes to secure the border quote the impression he's given Missourians there's ... ... ... I'm from Missouri Missouri what does what people say Missouri others say Missouri Laura\nI well you don't count because you have a language all of your own which is called the ... which is called ... street talk you know with an added flavor of New York and welcome 'em I support the hundred percent\nOh that desperation that's really desperation I'm I'm I Can't wait to see what the what you might play tomorrow the president's right on everything I just happened to both the wrong way every single time but the last two years\nAh we have some new polls out of Florida finding the Senate and governor's races they are statistically tied\nA Florida is the one state I'm worried about in terms of both the Senate and I don't understand this obsession with Gillum or the way he stuck taxpayers apparently with travel causes a fundraising\nNobody's acted to cut back and then lying about their they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we have those protections for layers of it in our Republican health care bill\nYeah a lot of pent listen lying is is the part of it the playbook of the Democrats is always the same I even think it's gotten worse you know look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and\nWhat is the media but I don't they're blaming Donald Trump port and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his strong support\nFor Israel including moving the capital to Jerusalem wearable along so well it's interesting I was so what is your take I mean how are people reacting and I assume you're getting a fortune of negative ads thrown at you and how are the people of Iowa reacting to it\nOh yeah I'm getting out and about four to one from my opponent and Nancy Pelosi and the superPACs out there so it's message versus money my opponent all her money is coming from from the east and the left the and the west coast a message over money and results right\nResults look what we have done with this economy\nOn the national international stages well with the president when it comes of sitting down with North Korea heading for nuclear as Asian or we would help\nOr making sure that yeah we did move that embassy from Tel Aviv Israel promises kept and being a shining light on the hill or were there was a lot of darkness for a long time still is for the shining brighter we lead in the world others will follow\nA more prosperity and peace uh you'd want to go backwards that's how important this election is right now\nI think it's not a lot of things to get our voter look I think a vote for any Democrat and any district for four hundred and thirty five house seats up for grabs is vote proposed because your opponent will vote for Nancy Pelosi boat with her I'm sure Ninety eight percent of the time just like in the Senate if you vote for any Democrat you're voting for sure\nUm to me a lot of it is you know look at the limitation of due process presumption of innocence during the Kavanaugh hearings\nA look at the the agenda of Democrats\nIs it's it's out there they want their crumbs back because they want the taxes the tax cuts that are putting a lot of money in the pockets of middle class Americans they want it back they want to limit their eyes open borders they want to keep Obamacare and how they're running on health care is just\nThe definition of just or death city considering they look how many there are counties I read in Iowa that is seen two hundred percent increases in their premiums people lost their doctors in plans and they have one health care option that's it one provider that's\nIt yeah and and those that\nAre paying in or paying twenty to thirty thousand dollars a year or their premiums their deductibles are so high they can't even though they just risk and don't even go to a doctor but you're exactly right\nMy opponent we have three opportunities to distance herself from Nancy Pelosi and she said she couldn't think of a an issue that could be separated so what's that mean she's a rubber stamp for hopefully not Speaker Pelosi but increasing taxes open borders doubling down on government run health care\nAnd of course what they've tried to keep under the rug Sean and you do this and are blisters and all this impeachment\nMhm now that an endless investigation but not into the deep state\nUm which of course you know we've seen massive abuses of power not rank and file FBI agents not rank and file a Justice Department and intelligence people but\nThey do their job every day but just a few abusing power at the highest levels the upper echelon well listen this is an important race it's on our top thirty we have the top Seventy races if you want to go to our interactive map at ... dot com and the most important house races that will tip the balance of power six days from now\nAnd one week from today we'll be talking about those results certainly David Young Iowa's third district is one of those important races we wish you the best in this race\nWe can't take anything for granted go to David Young for Iowa dot com to volunteer and help us make sure we keep the majority thank you Sean for all you do you\nBet welcome a ball the best to you and six days a it's tough out there nobody can predict with certainty but I Will tell you you know I I just there's something about um some things not clicking with me and I never you never really have a feel\nFor how the house is going to go twenty ten might be an exception\nWhere I mean it was a massive landslide and you could see it coming same thing I Would argue when Bill Clinton became president Nineteen Ninety four remember Republicans had been out of power for forty years that Newt Gingrich became the speaker of the house\nAnd also if you look at history and this is what Republicans are up against their forty five retirement and a headwind of history that usually the the party in power loses a lot of seats in the first midterm\nBut then like in the case of Bill Clinton it was Newt Gingrich in many ways Newt saving of Clinton because things got better because Newt Gingrich force Clinton into what led to balance budgets and and serious reforms in Washington\nAnd I think the same thing you know you go to a bomb on me and it was just a white powder and twenty ten am specially after Obamacare and ... you know the fact that Democrats are that's their main talking point now\nI'm this is really fascinating to me there's a brash museum poll out today I had to go back in double check it showing that African American support for the president has now hit an all time high of forty percent\nI mean that's a five hundred percent improvement\nIf you go back to election day twenty sixteen when he got eight percent of the African American vote in the country in the same survey\nTrump's approval rating stays at its highest at this point in the fifty percent plus range and I think the highest level of support for any Republican going back to at least Dwight Eisenhower if not\nBefore and and all the media likes to go after arrest me is I don't know why he's a great guy in a smart poster but you know they say oh he's a right wing polling operation but I Do remind you that rats museum was the most accurate polling twenty sixteen\nSo if that is even close to forty percent that could have a profound impact on the midterm elections but again it's all out there now interesting developments as relates to the issue of the caravan\nUm and I think some people have been over the top and what they've been saying about it it's a lot of distance between here and where they started at the southern border of Mexico and are\nNow you have and I look there's only see most people that come into this country illegally I think that most people come here because we are a land of milk and honey hoping opportunity and the American dream\nAnd when you live in poverty and countries that have little to zero opportunity and freedom is very appealing to come to America now we're only asking that\nAnd freedom it's very appealing to come to America now we're only asking that you do it legally only asking that you respect our laws are sovereignty our borders and I'd venture a guess that Ninety nine point eight percent of the people in that curve and want a better life\nAnd that they've been told that they're going to be able to get into America that's not going to happen the president's been very clear\nUm the left this meteor pushing a narrative that the thousands of of migrants from Central America and elsewhere are fleeing violence in their homeland but in an interview with National Public radio on Monday\nThe Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some of the people some probably a tiny tiny percentage they'd be clip point two percent\nOr less source our quarter reporting that she identified him as Thirteen members because of their tattoos that would give that'd be a give away um but actually the Mexican ambassador the U. S. describes some onshore tiny percentage is very violent now nobody can vouch for any one person that wants to cross the border\nWe're asking that people come here legally if we had a border wall we wouldn't have a risk of thousands of people at once coming across the border the president has sent fifty two hundred troops down there\nAnd he's not going to let them in ... he because there'll be thousands and thousands behind them we don't have room to take it everybody we have a right as a country we have sovereignty or nation built on a on a constitutional republic system the rule of law\nAnd we have border laws and we asked the people respect our borders and our sovereignty and just come in legally and we have an opportunity to vet them and make sure that they are coming for the right reasons they can sustain themselves and they don't want to bring harm to our citizens that are already here\nI'm nearly according to one border officials telling the Washington Examiner three quarters of the caravan\nA that is traveling through Mexico to the u._s. or adult man according to a senior border patrol officer telling the examiner\nFamilies and unaccompanied children make up about twenty percent twenty to thirty percent of the caravan Roy of Hillary ill is the deputy chief patrol agent for the border patrol San Diego sector arrested that a single adult males he goes on to say\nUh Mexico now is shut down a lot of their public transportation so the people in the caravan went up to walk with you know literally weeks away and they've also offered temporary work permits to the migrants to register for asylum", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Show Low", "day": "31"}
