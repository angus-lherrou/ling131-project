it might be\nBut did you hear her say that the chunks of ice forming into the ocean or raising sea levels\nI remember one time on this program way way back in the nineties discussing this in fact there are two things\nThe first I pointed out because I read it and the Heritage Foundation or action to report that this was during the spotted owl earth first a natural forest station controversy that was all part of a global warming craze\nIn the early nineties and I pointed out that there were more acreage there was a more acreage of trees are more trees in America then in Nineteen Ninety ... at our founding the left\nWe're fatty they said I was insane that couldn't possibly be true that we had come along and we and chopped down trees and we haven't replaced them and make things out of the trees and they thought I was just insane I\nPointed out you people misunderstand something yeah we cut down a lot of trees but you know what we plant for trees this is\nThe wood industry they need what right how do you get what you have to grow trees\nIt's not a finite resource and for every tree to cut down for new ones are planted it's part of the policy warehouse there is one of the big companies that was doing this they wouldn't they wouldn't listen to it that didn't compute they couldn't begin to fathom that\nThey couldn't understand anybody seriously claim more trees more forest\nMore forested acreage in Nineteen Ninety two then there was in the Seventeen hundreds\nDidn't make sense to them because they don't understand capitalism or economics everything's in zero sum game if a company came along and dropped out a bunch of trees to build a bunch of houses or whatever and and that's that was trees that were gone forever it's why they don't want your cutting down the redwoods never come back you know\nI'm the same token I remember saying one but it's still true today there was another report just last week there are more trees forested\nAcres in America today than there were even fifty years ago\nThe second one was when when I um when I pointed out that's a falling ice\nFrom a glacier or light green them is going to raise sea level I sent its like ice in a glass melting I said it's not going to raise the sea levels I said those ice cubes being jumped into the ocean and not going to raise ...\nYou're crazy it's crazy it's you know what you're talking about of course it's going to raise ...\nNo it doesn't get a glass eyes and pour some water in it filled up Philip Glass in ice\nPut as much ice in there as you can and filling up with water ice is going to melt you tell me what the glass overflow\n... well not the volume\nAll of that not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this because they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything but distract\nFrom the mid term elections which are three weeks from tomorrow\nA away and so there are some people who are on the left are claiming that she selfish and and trying to haul good what is a lot of light being shined on politics right now because of the because the elections I I think a lot of his is rooted in they have Trump either as many of them do\nAnd they live and breathe\nTo expose Trump for whatever they think he is to the point that people abandoning anyway I'm Glad you waited\nA Scott

and then the the credit start rolling in the music playing and you see people they they start getting up and filing out of the theater and they're talking to each other and stuff but this did not happen at the end of the movie guys now\nAfter the after the movie was over the the credits began to roll and the music played and and after after a while all all the credits finished and the music stopped and everybody was still seated\nThey're okay I Need to ask you this because there's one thing about this I'm I'm I made a calculation when\nI was talking about this on friday to not mentioned something about this movie because I did not want to frighten people or deter them from going to see it\nOh we got what but but what I'm not asking you know identify that but what if anything surprise you that you didn't know or just just surprised you period even if you think you didn't know what about the movie what did you learn you didn't know [noise]\nWell I I didn't know about who Mr guys now was on my ... I was not familiar with the case or anything like that um but that wasn't that wasn't really the the the powerful peace about it but I guess the\nThe\nWhat what made it what made everybody if they were all feeling like me and all sitting down and not moving after the movie was over ... was it was it was about an abortion doctor yes but this this was a movie about a murder trial\nAnd but during the murder trial the um there there were two there were there were two things that were portrayed in one was just the ... of what happens in those clinics but even more than that\nWhat was that the why what was the barbarian and what happened in the clinics\nOh the bar verity of what happens in an abortion clinic when\nNo no and God's nails in God's nails clinic what happened what was the\nOh that uh\nThat he was he was allowing babies to be born and then after they were born then he would kill him\nExactly that is the vast majority this is why he's called the biggest serial killer in American history God's now killed most of the babies after they were born alive\nAnd he did it by snooping there spinal cords with scissors now I didn't say this on friday\nI didn't say this on friday

watching the way he's right it is about primarily a trial\nI made the point of saying that Nick Searcy who's the director lets the story tell itself there aren't any exaggerating computer generated graphics there there's\nNot a lot of a special effect a\nReal or computer generated in order to shock because of the story tells itself the numbers\nOf children born alive killed by this man is stunning and shocking then you realize that the mainstream media never even covered the trial much less whether you're done they've always done their best to suppress it\nIt was nearly impossible to get this movie made precisely because of what yet revealed\nHollywood doesn't want this movie made the actors in this movie were risking their future careers by taking roles people like Nick Searcy who um a is a ... and across the board actor he can take the lead it can take a supporting role he can take or\nWhatever you want he chose to direct this movie and all of these people in one way or another we're risking something major by tackling it and doing it they couldn't find funding people that run the Gulf funding pages would not allow\nAny kind of public funding for the production costs a Facebook Twitter I don't know specifically which one did they wouldn't allow any\nWas Facebook would not allow any kind of a a promotion reference or fundraising for this at all is actually kind of a lot of was the amazing miraculous buddy of it was it was a lot of hard work and a lot of time\nTo get this movie made but\nAnd it was a real challenge for him I how how difficult is it\nTo focus on\nFact that this abortion as did his murderous work outside the\nThe fact that this abortion is did his murderous work outside the home he did his share of of uh of abortions in the world but the numbers of born alive that this man murdered\nIt's just stunning everybody thinks late term abortion is bad and by the way this kind of abortion and it's called an abortion if\nYou if it's got a term I'm having a mental block and with the term of this is ... in Illinois and so forth when when the procedure came up a bill was sponsored to stop this I think it was but rock Obama who refused to support it\nThe left will not support any limits whatsoever on whatever it's called and abortion and the the the the the thing that left just tried to do\nIn countering this movie is to say well well if you want more God's nails then you go hunting overturn roe versus Wade they tried to say God's now was doing what he was doing\nBecause women had no other choice they couldn't go anywhere to get that's a flat out why by the way ... clinic if you will none of the none of the year was sterilized people that\nWere getting sick and infected with it just it was a big stars in Philadelphia\nBut I did lose focus on that on purpose because I didn't want to I don't want to eat it because you don't see it\nThat's my point they don't graphically try to make their points they focus on a murder trial but good going\nOut there John I'm sure he was he was getting sweating I'm nervous out there what does Russia want to hear what it what about him but he got it's not that I wanted to hear anything but
