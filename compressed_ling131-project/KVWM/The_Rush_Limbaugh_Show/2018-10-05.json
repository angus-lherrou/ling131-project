to tears guardian crying\nAnd then this book load\nKevin O's tears made a kind of sense\nFrom a single phrase by Thomas Jefferson but public life is about life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the fulfillment of the all white American man's Adam ... desires\nAssumed that for some of the odds and became the ultimate purpose of this country society if a white man didn't get what he wanted it was nothing short of a constitutional crisis\nThis is what this clown saw in the Kavanaugh hearings but you know the references here a single phrase my Thomas Jefferson the public life is about life liberty pursuit of happiness the fulfillment of the white American man's\nDesires assumed the force of the meetings and automatic\nAnd became the ultimate purpose of this country society if a white man didn't get what he wanted it was nothing short of a constitutional crisis bingo these people proved me ride each and every time I go analyzing them\nSo the trouble with America is it it was a stab Bush by white men for white man and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd life and liberty was only intended for white man and if any white man was instructed in the pursuit then there was something wrong with America\nDo not minimize this I'm telling you this belief is animating the last two generations informing the last two generations of kids going to high school and college this is the kind of drivel\nThat they are being taught that America is corrupt from its founding days that it was founded for an exclusive group of people white man nobody else need apply\n\nAnd when they don't get their way in other words when minorities start taking over\nWhat Tina's lesbians gay and transgender you name it when those people start taking over that\nJustice when white men have their lungs handed to

merely chronicling what's happening out there it is on the night of all I just shared with you one of the countless examples like inside this guy Michael list uh\nIn the New Yorker suggesting that Kavanaugh's crying because he's a white man targeted singled out Britain management in America by other white men and when it's not going his way breaks down and cries\nThis piece\nJustifies the attack on the white men it says it's about time the whole country and the assault on the whole country is validated because it's actually an assault on a white male majority which has caused tyranny

out now in the country the majority of which white Christian man that's the targeting you can't deny that white Christian matter just white men period are the target of modern feminism\nModern

today\n[noise] uh see what it was really the river [noise] that I just put at the bottom of the book it's about somebody I very rarely comment on 'cause I don't care phony folk conservatives his name is Jennifer Rubin [noise]\nUh yeah it is Jennifer Rubin it's amazing transformation this woman has made the Washington Post hired her as a conservative blogger\nDuring the Obama years during the Obama years for the most part she came across as a conservative blogger when Trump gets elected she became I think what she's always been just a died the cast in the wool liberal\nAnd now she has a this do they can\nThe cast in the wool liberal and now she has a this though the conservative columnist or blogger at the post but she's not conservative and MSNBC reversed or that way but that's not the point I couldn't tell the story without mentioning her name\nShe says that GOP senators are behaving as if it's their time of the month\nNow\nThat to me he goes a little deeper than what it just sounds like here on the surface\n\nImagine a conservative saying on MSNBC the female Democrat senators were being so emotional almost hysterical behaving as if it's their time in the months does anybody think that would fly\nThere is no way\nA male commentator anywhere can say that about women senators are women witnesses or any of us sort but here's Jennifer Ruben\nAnd by using this this this analogy these Republican senators behaving is if it's their time in the month is that not acknowledging that there is such a thing as their time of the month\nSo who is it here that's being shamed and discriminatory and furthermore pointing out one of the big differences between men and women because men except those who are\nAfter a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand six thing\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populist coalition that elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms\nIn other words in her study of things just continuing to vote for a Party Republicans to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get them out there don't know why\nI Would think it would be but she says it's not Kavanaugh however has provided the catalyst\nBecause of how Trump voters that per se and specifically the conservative populists coalition perceive the way he's been treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\nThat the Trump conservative populists coalition is tired and worn out\nThe way they and things they believe in are treated by Democrats the media and Hollywood\nAnd her point is that the targets of range had somewhat diminished until cabinet came along and re awaken these people and fired them back up\nSo she says this is what I see in a nutshell what happened to Kavanaugh has served as a reminder Anna highlights to the people that voted for Trump why he's successful that it's\nAll about being strong it help remind voters why they supported him\nAnd the other Republican president would have walked away from cabin all by now\nEnergy would have been lost but it's not energy is high now that's again that Salinas Ito and her analysis of the electorate today\nHeading into the two thousand sixteen or to the ... midterms now where I Will she knows what she's talking about I find it strange that people who I think that people who voted for Trump are deeply involved with things\nNow maybe there are some exceptions and you have some people who voted for Trump to just fed up with Republicans and Democrats and found Trump interesting but for the most part I Am of the opinion that Trump voters did so for a very very very specific reasons related to Trump's agenda which he\nHounded every day multiple times a day Donald Trump told everybody what he was going to do trade deals the wall immigration rebuild a military bring back the economy\nI Would think people have voted for Trump knew that that's what he's going to do and I would also think that people who voted for Trump would realize that he needs more than two years to do it\n\nBut is her insistent know that kind of stuff it evaporates in wanes you know people's lives go on the news changes but the this Kavanaugh circus has re ignited the coalition that electing Trump and this is to the detriment of the Democrats or don't see this happening\n\nShe says the Senate couldn't did see a red wave the house\nShe says the Senate could indeed see a red wave the house she's not so sure of\nI found it interesting analysis and I wanted to share it with you she points out that Democrats

honor to speak with you today\nUm would like to discuss this Murkowski briefly with you um I Believe it was during the bail Gorsuch earrings that Murkowski went to the administration I Trump\nAnd bargain her votes or exploration writes in Anwar\nAnd I worked up and Trudeau I Know what that's like the revenue that that feel brings to the state\nThis is correct that's correct you're right I remember that you're exactly right and well I I think I Know where you're going this was a hell of a pay back\nYeah well you know it's that was done resistance is ... is is there a way to get the got you back on trial or why hasn't that are in flight back to her to say what the stroke of this thing panic at all go away\nUm you know just something that makes you go the other\nWay way way way way

for going against capital Yes sir it wouldn't do it\nOh okay I'm too many people be hurt too many people be hurt by your right but that that means a lot for her and her state\nSo I don't know uh the other quick question that I have for you as you mentioned earlier that if the Democrats regained the house that almost immediately if H hearings which started against Trump\nBut it would most likely include Kavanaugh what does that did it for Neil Gorsuch does that put him back and play again\nThat can play you mean to be impeached is well\nAbsolutely sir no\nNo no that ... they wouldn't buy that much off or if you get rid of cabin on getting back off the bench or install Trump's next nominees when the White House and twenty twenty\nNow I I in fact I think my guess is that they would go after cabin on first\nIn terms of impeachment proceedings\nIf fresh in everybody's minds go after him on perjury and sexual harassment\nNot I mean serious serious things for which a conviction could ruin his life as well and then after they get Kavanaugh then they go after Trump as the guy knowingly who nominated capital and they add all the other things\n[laughter] is that the elevator joke yeah yeah yeah yeah [laughter]\n[laughter] right [laughter]\nNow you got me in the central everybody wants to hear the joke that you brought a I'll think about it go ahead I don't want to encroach on your time what was it that you called about\nI get you know the ... fully aware that there's things behind the scenes that the public will never know I mean that's there we call it the deep state but that's their standard operating procedure\nFigured you were talking earlier about ah you know things we wouldn't know that the American citizens wouldn't know behind the scenes that had the Democrats stone faced yesterday and and why they know the cabinet was going to be confirmed up you know our only hope that my family's only hope is that their hatred of cabin on me if he really is that good\nOh he is in that sense ... there's there's a rap on Kavanaugh to you know what the rap on Capitol is that he's a he's a Bush establishment guy I mean he is the staff secretary\nFor George W. Bush in the first time that the rap on ... is is a not a deep state or but that he is a swamp dweller\nA and there are some people who think that there could have been a more conservative choice Amy Coney Barrett but he he he is good don't don't believe any of that this guy threatens the Democrats as much as if Antonin Scalia\nOr back alive and were up for re confirmation\nGood you know as much as they try and thrown at this guy I really think that there are only purpose behind the continued FBI investigation was to try to make like ... you know dig for everything until you find something\nOh there's no question delayed delayed the way and get lucky and find something that you can meet people believe or something really existed but\nNo you're absolutely right about everything there so far\n[laughter] well ... they take advantage of the fact like people like me you know I've been listening since Ninety three you know I work every day every guy got seven kids ... what we do every day we don't have time to tune in every little more so so what happens unfortunately for the rest of the country that doesn't listen to Rush Limbaugh there's not that many of the ones that don't\nThey get these hit bits on the evening news from the drive by media they have no clue what what ... what the real news of the day or the news of the week\nOh tell me what\nTell me about it I look if it's like they're too big developments that the people that only watch drive by media do not know they do not know that ...
