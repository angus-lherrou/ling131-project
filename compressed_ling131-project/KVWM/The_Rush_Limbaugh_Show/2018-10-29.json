what it says that you want to talk about if we make sure that you have this right to you you're Jewish correct\nI Am and you're all of this liberalism that is that his creep in anti Semitism on the left or something you want to talk about right ... that's ... that's fascinating to me\nYeah it's been there and they were all on it require why it is in fact religion but anti Semitism is a very big part of that communism and it's a touching require atheism\nGet where is the anti Semitism on the left in your view who has what who's harboring\nAh it's everywhere you look at a ... you can look over the years it's it's very obvious from carbon labor party but even here uh the all the anti Israel Israel is an apartheid state all of those things are are just I mean I\nEven wait a minute but the reason the reason is just fascinating to me is that most people associate of anti Semitism with the rights with\nUnfairly don't misunderstand it gets valid at all but it just most people think that that anti Semitism relies on the ... lives on the right 'cause everybody thinks that what Hitler was Hitler was a leftist Hitler was a a national was but that's where it stems from yeah\nBut you'll be

to ah when maybe one day have my own organization for military families who have had servicemen um killed in action but a journalism because I just I Want to\nGet my voice out there and change 'cause I don't like the way I mean Trump is making America great you know I Believe that but what about\nIf someone gets in office after him and then I go in there Twenty years later it's maybe going to be a huge mess because of the way America's millennials are going like my sister\nAnd I just want to be one of those who gets up there and says\nI'm done with this I Want to change it\nOr good for you uh there are a lot of people a lot of parents who have kids your age and younger\nWho are really scared about the future of the country has always been the case I my whole life I have heard people say throughout my life but they don't want to have kids who wouldn't dare want to bring kids into this world that some I remember hearing that when I was Fifteen myself so it's nothing really\nReally knew but I'm sensing today when people say there is a people who have kids not so much Dolgen are thinking about it people who have kids are really really worried about their futures because\nOf the way the west\nHas become more radical and more anti the general concepts of America it's scaring people what kind the country or their kids\nGoing to grow into I mean there's always going to be an American but what's going to be are they going to be free are they gonna have to conform to some of this extreme wacko left ism in order to not be hassled build up their lives there's some genuine fear about is if you want to tackle that\nMore power to you and journalism needs people like you in it\nWell and I don't that's like what you're saying I don't want my kids are my younger sister to grow up in America\nWhere there's just a bunch of people that don't even belong in this country hurting even citizens going around trying to do that stuff to you I don't want to grow up in a country where you can't even have a gun to protect yourself or to hunt with for a\nCountry where veterans are put behind illegals I mean I just I that's the one that makes me so angry as the\nWhy do you think that's happening why do you think so much attention is being lavish on of the\nPeople you referred to as the illegals coming here who are not\nCitizens but yet being uh granted access to so many things given so much why do you think it's happening\nA will there's a lot of reasons for one thing Obama made it all just come hallway and you know um but I think just because they think they see what we're going to go there and nobody's gonna stop us you know well maybe the military is going to stop this Tylenol\nI understand why there ... why do you think there is so much a tolerance for it why\nWhy are they are ... why do you think there is so much a tolerance for it why do you think so many people are wanting them here and and and want to do nothing to stop them from from getting in why do you think there's so much tolerance for the illegal well aspect of this\nI don't well a lot of the people who are voting they don't know anything about why [laughter] I don't know where is that why would they ah\nI don't know why the people are wanting to give away their money to them if I think that they're saying oh well poor people you know their country's war stricken\nWell you know America has to help their people to they can't just give away money to these illegals coming and they're like well that they may bring jobs here how are they bringing jobs here when they're going to go work at\nI mean they're going to go work in agriculture agriculture or something 'cause I Know there's a lot of illegals that live in California and there's a lot around where I live but\nI don't know the answer is that they work cheap number one for the people don't want the river cheap labor cheap labor is to answer\nThe other side of it are you you're talking about people don't want to give the money the people who are behind these policies are damn wells making sure that you and others are going to give your money they're not going to be giving bears but the\nAnswer the answer to the question is because the left wants power and power to them\nIs more and more people in capable of self reliance\nMore and more people in capable of helping themselves and the best most concentrated group of people that fit that bill are a bunch of poor ill educated or uneducated people don't even speak the language\nFlooding the southern border you get 'em in\nTheir human beings we're a compassionate country they have to be fed they have to be taking care of the Democrats want the credit for doing all that they want to get these people registered to vote as quickly as they can they looking at him purely and simply as voters it's not about compassion and it's not about giving them a good life\nIt's not about any of the things that they want you to think it is it strictly about creating let me put it this way rarely\nThe Democratic party and do not doubt me on this and you wouldn't you do do research or journalism career you will find that this is the case of the Democratic party needs a permanent underclass\nOf\nUneducated or poorly educated people who are not capable of economic sulfur lives because they can't speak the language\nBecause they don't have any education those are prime democratic voters\nThose are the exact kind of people the Democrats want to build a majority around because they will be for ever grateful I eat dependence on Democrats and will constantly be voting for Democrats no matter what else happens that's\nThat's the reason behind it nobody will ever own up to it nobody will ever admit it\nBut what they are really is just on documented Democrats it's not their undocumented citizens or aliens undocumented Democrats that their status right now and the objective is to get them documented to get them registered and to take care of them\nGive them health care make their track here make their trip you're worth it\nBy giving them exactly what they're coming for now some of them are going to be able to take care of themselves some are going to get here and they're going to run rings around people some in any group of people that large are going to have a wide disparity in some of them are going to be quite confident\nBut those are going to be the self starters and those are not that people Democrats are interested in I just really hideous I guess I guess it gets really hideous ... Democrats what people need people who are\nIncapable of self reliance and that's not helping those people at all\nThat is not compassion Democrats want you to think that's all they are and they are none of it it's the exact about they're using these people and hoping that they never amount to much\nThey don't have much faith in them any way but they are great voters great dependent voters and thereby so that's what this is about look I'm I'm Glad you called rally or exceptionally well spoken your home schooling is working and you're I I Hope that you hope you do get into journalism is journalism needs people that are interested in the truth\nI also want to thank you for the book the route on I've read and I've read on than they are ... happened down in my little sister so I left

the ABC News reporting on the synagogue shootings yes now I I normally watch Fox News but I always try to watch a network program every day just like it legitimately compare the two\nSo I'm the ACC news reporting they quoted a study showing a rise in anti Semitism in this country now when they set this neither my wife and rocket remember there ever recording this before even after\nThe Farrah Khan turned my comments I'm also during the report when addressing the issue of armed security for places like the synagogue\nMore than one person commented that if we started this went with it and\nI couldn't help but think what a classic liberal response to think we can't do anything that might make sense because of their fears about what might happen on my own thoughts were um about armed security for these\nYou know they never have that fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more interesting they never worry about where is this\nGoing to end but if you were if you do things that give people more safety more control if you give people a greater feeling of security that liberals can't lay claim to that all of a sudden they fear where is it leading to where does it it's absurd where where's that hadn't\nMy thought is people are getting killed armed security if you think about that issue my thought is where can we START I mean if it's true that anti Semitism is on the rise maybe synagogues or a great place maybe in our school since that's obviously a very common targets\nRight well maybe in our schools and that's obviously a very common target these days\nWell except the ... the ... we we have gun free zones schools now you can't put guns in there the only people to get in with guns or the bad guys you people up\n[noise] um

think it only makes sense to be\nSuspicious and demanding of proof for whatever we're we're going to be tall\n\nBut it's I mean because everything's been so politicized everything now is being

high\nHigh rests pleasure speaking with you today you bet great to have you here\nThank you I wanted to refresh listeners memories of back in two thousand six to in Philadelphia at the Democratic

day long dinner for ever ignored or not even referenced at all\nIt is is a a a clear one way street\nAnd if there are every extreme is on the left the ... the media makes a great effort to disassociate them from the main stream of the Democratic party\nWhich they ah they aren't but see we can we can spend the whole day recounting instances from the past that point out the hypocrisy of all that's being said about Republicans and tromp over these two ends of the the the fact remains here that despite\nEverything the media is hell bent on politicizing this or anything that will assist them in creating an anti Trump sentiment heading into the midterms and that's how they first report these things like I say that this tragedy hit the synagogue and scroll hill\nSection of Pittsburgh I

we've lost eleven people six still fighting for their lives we can't forget them and and our thoughts and prayers\nIt on your watch some of these people out there pulling out all the stops all weekend long too high Saturday Saturdays anti Semitic massacre that Trump\nIs too big facts getting in the way all the Republican Party reject anti Semitism out of hand it's it's the Democratic party leaders I never get in a rural Louis Farrakhan unless I was going to get into the grill and drill him about his anti Semitism and his racism\nThe shooter this guy Bowers despised President Trump because he thought Trump was quote controlled by Jews and not only that part of Trump's family is Jewish\nAnd and so on and so forth you know apparently a you know as Ron Gerber rightfully said oh this weekend on Fox News that you know these burial an anti Semite can come from any side of the political spectrum\nAnd if you look at the persecution that is taking place in this was something that the president raised the Jews have endured terrible persecution over the years\nWe've read it we've studied it they've gone through it all and we still see so much of it it is growing by leaps and bounds sadly all across Europe it's getting scary\nAll these countries that seek Israel's destruction radical Islam is Iranian mullahs chanting death to Israel\nOr president said we will see their destruction which is standing holy behind in the right way Israel as so many people\nHave been you know victims of anti Semitism\nIn oh Sarah Sanders pointing out is there any tragedy the Washington Post won't exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because the president is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nWe haven't had a president in modern history that has stood by our closest friends and allies Israel in the middle east ever\nAnd what an act of courage it was apparently but there's other presidents have promised that never did it\nAnd making Jerusalem the rightful capital of Israel [noise]\nAnyway we're going to get to all of that at Fox News similarly under attack I've got all the latest numbers on the election um I'm also going to tell you if right now I Would say the Republicans and eight days my prediction is today I'll give me one every day there's any updates they pick up seats in the Senate\nLocal county Republican headquarters police at a worker arrived Monday morning saw the damage called authorities we have another threat of a man who's accused the guy's been arrested by threatening to kill Florida congressman Carlos Curbelo\nThat story came out this week it\nHe's been threatened there was a campaign rally would Lindsey Graham and Marsha Blackburn and you had an angry leftist mob disrupt disrupting that and a half a dozen angry liberal protestors they had to be removed\nAnd you'd think of the language or we can't be civil with Republicans and kick them and\nAll the other comments that have been made and then the other silence when it happens to a\nConservative really shouldn't be something that's political and calling somebody fake news I mean it is so disgusting overt CNN somebody sent me a transcript I guess was on news busters of Home Depot dumped the\nOh I understand that CNN doesn't like fake news and they don't like being called fake news but they are fake news and other news organization anymore\nThey have gone fulltime destroyed Trump every second of every minute pretty much of every day\nThat's what they do so they have this panel I guess if they put together\nAnd they're talking about what happened in the synagogue shooting and we have to look closely at the poison being spread sometimes on television sometimes out of the mouths of political leaders and oftentimes on ugly dark corners of social media\nYeah it can be pretty ugly and it goes on the first panelist as Bill Kristol or never Trump or he attacks Fox News\nI'm like hello what we can't have conservatives in my I support mainstream conservatism bill\nI don't know what happened to you I support original is on the Supreme Court I support lower taxes less government burdensome regulation I support energy independence\nI support legal immigration I support border security I support peace through strength and the tough national security posture with a strong military to defend the values that we all believe in\nAnd I support\nYou know a free press even to be wrong even criticize the media for being wrong at a Washington Post columnist comes out some woman I've never heard of Margaret Sullivan\nYou know her praising or analysis and the Democratic threats et cetera et cetera reads like a list of Sean Hannity is free broad ... broadcast crib notes\nAnd that is asked point blank if she blame people on the right like Kennedy for the violence\nAs a martyr you about this this week uh with regards to the bomb attacks or the suspicious packages you said you know looking all his targets it and it's like a list of Sean Hannity's pre broadcast crib notes that was the way you put it in your washingtonpostcom gathering blaming the hands of the world\nI think they have a share of I'm sort of the wrapping up of hatred um without regard for a wedding effect my feet and without much regard for the truth I mean the way things are being patch on Fox and and\nA pro Trump right wing media is dangerous and destructive so I think we need to call it what it is\n... Lewis was on from the Daily Beast of all players and\nHe actually was the only one that made even a little sense he said the only thing I Would add is tomorrow it could be Hannity's targeted\n... perverse incentives to Gen off their base for elections I think a cable news has incentives to a jet up anger and anxiety and passion for ratings same thing with websites with clicks and tweets\nAh I agree with everything that we've set so far today the only thing I Would add is\nTomorrow it could be Sean Hannity who was targeted for a Republican congressman who was targeted and why agree with the condemnation of what Fox has done in terms of getting off this anger over the caravan I think that this is a much more widespread problem\nWell it is more widespread than I have had far more instances and I'm willing to talk about a real credible threats towards me and my family including the one that I didn't share last week with white powder purported\nTo be anthrax sent to a my office and one of my employees having to spend an entire day in isolation scared out of her mind\nAnd it's been worse but obviously these people not listening to what I'm saying\nBecause I have been saying we've got to know what what do I advocate I'm like okay I Want I Want these principles stood up for I fight for the American forgotten men and women I fight for lower taxes\nPure bureaucratic regulation energy independence Supreme Court nominees that believe in the constitution\nI Believe we should secure our borders legal immigration these are things I I believed in my entire life and career a strong military security for the American people a strong stand against evil in our time\nNot that complicated\nKnow what the democratic agenda is if they win it's gonna be okay we want to impeach Trump endless investigations they said they want their crumbs back we know they support sanctuary cities open borders and the eliminate\nDid they want their crumbs back\nWe know they support sanctuary cities open borders and the elimination of ice and they think Obamacare works and it doesn't\nYou know you had an MSNBC you know literally pressing the Israeli ambassador termer the blame Trump for the synagogue attack that's how sick it's gotten you know ABC Trump is at the center of all the political violence no he's not\nBut I guess it's an easy blame game so now we've\nTaken the predictable every two four years Republicans are racist and sexist a massage therapist and Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic and they weren't dirty air and water and they want children to die and they want granny thrown over the cliff and now it's that they are somehow inciting violence in the country no they're not\nIt's not true it's never been true\nAnd it's not any conservative I Would ever support and then the case of this guy that shot up the synagogue it was a very ill an anti Semite who also hated Donald Trump but that doesn't stop them from saying and literally advancing\nThat narrative\nYou know this is you know watch watching the Washington Post alone is unbelievable Fox does it their headlights Fox News and the rest of the right wing media can escape responsibility oh I've been the biggest supporter of Israel that I Know in the mainstream media have been my entire career\nFriends with Bebe Netanyahu going back decades men there during the war and been there at other times reporting\nShowing people the tunnels that nobody else in the media would show them friends who they who Brock formally Shimon Peres\nLet's name names according to the Washington Post Trump's hate analyze our inciting extremist well this extreme as in the synagogue hated Trump those are the Washington Post headlines that you got\nFrom the G O P defiant amid allegations that incendiary rhetoric these are the same people on CNN fake news they couldn't identify 'em up for who they are these phony hypocrites\nTrump blames it and you know something when the media lives twenty four seven and they get called up that's too bad that is not a call for violence\nUnbelievable the times that we're living in now here is um where we are the Senate is interesting 'cause there's two races you can add maybe to the let's watch call\nAnd I would say that would be West Virginia where Joe Manchin is down by two in the latest poll and Menendez is barely hanging on to a lead in New Jersey by three now do I think both of those races are going to be won by Republicans\nAh maybe West Virginia New Jersey's hard but possible people in New Jersey clearly fed\nUp with Menendez then I think it's too close to call on either the gubernatorial race I have no idea why\nFloridians are flirting with Gil almost got a radical agenda in Florida Rick Scott's done a fantastic job as governor and\nIt'd be a perfect complement for the Republican majority in the Senate I think Marsha Blackburn hangs on we got Josh Hawley now in the lead in Missouri we gotta Dean Heller holding on to his lot hopefully that's an important race in Nevada\nI don't know why Christ in ... cinema well we've got new tape on cinema tonight that will blow that case wide open\nI don't see how somebody who supported Americans joining the Taliban could win in Arizona and calling her own state crazy in the meth lab of democracy and inviting radical lawyers for the blind shake I don't know how she survives\nHeidi Heitkamp I don't think she's going to win in North Dakota that'll be a pickup as long as the people of Indiana don't vote for a libertarian and split the ticket\nThe Republican their bronze should be able to win that race and that would be a pickup for Republicans\nI think Montana's a little bit and play but I'd say favoring pastor at this moment but tester can be beaten there", "show_name": "The
