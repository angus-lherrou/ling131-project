any\n... you and making a really important point that I don't want to gloss over I Want to return back to be\nA primary point you've made that you are in your mid forties I'm for the first time in your life your living through a growing positive economy that prior to now\nYour entire life has been lived in a either a flat line for a shrinking economy\nYeah part and you know let's not forget something for most about time in the last eight years prior to Trump\nPeople like you were also told that this was as good as it going to get that you had to work\nAnd acknowledge that there was a new normal now and that America's great days of the past may not have been totally legitimate and and that this this was more like the way it's going to be now so you were also told not only were you in a flat lining economy you were told don't have any lofty\nExpectations here right\n... exactly how high\nOutlet to jump forward to this growing economy my next question are you actually there's no wrong answer here it's not a trick are you actually aware of the growing economy because you're living and experiencing it are only are you aware of it because you see economic numbers reported that say it's good\nI I'm In a small economy in Asheville North Carolina that is its own separate\nEconomy so I'm aware of it the ah information but I can I can feel it I can sense that I can I I'm I Know that is true\nThat it said that if I mean it's hard to build your life\nIf you if you're coming if you're coming from nothing and don't have anything and you're trying to build a life and and\nI literally feel like the finances in America there's been this ... hold on to this depletion of it I mean I'm old enough to remember sitting around the table and my parents and you have to finish your dinner there's children starving in China when I was growing up everyone knew that China was a core poor poor poor place and has done\nIn a span and just the you know Twenty years it's boomed and happy for the for the people of China absolutely we don't want to see anyone in the world\nStruggling and and and not have what they need to survive on the other side of it\nIt's because of poor management I'm not in our government that has leaked all of this money out of our country and and people here are suffering and you've talked about the opioid epidemic and and and all of these you know these the fruit the fruit of having no work\nWhich he used to be just standard knowledge you knew that if there was a population of people that didn't have work they were going to have other Pablo\nRight but the point is you're you're you're living economy\nYou have work they were going to have other problems exactly right but the point is you're you're you're living economy you're you're not just saying and thinking it's good because people are telling you you're actually experiencing it well\nI Am experiencing it and I feel blessed and I feel grateful to the president because people want to act like a well he was just given money well lots of people win money on lottery and it's gone a year later oh hey real yeah\nOh that's a whole nother you're absolutely right that is a whole other subject watery lottery winners what becomes of um [noise]\nYou're absolutely right I'm just I'm Glad to hear you say you're living it you're experiencing it then it's real did you that it's not just the result of me or people like me telling you that things are good that matters\nJust one thing my mom also told me Christine to eat everything on my plate because there were people starving in China but I was a smart ass I was a smart alec and I turned I tried to use logic on every\nExample of parental discipline I could\nSo when my mom said that to me after a number of times and I got tired of hearing I said mom you telling me that if I eat everything on my plate a bunch of people in China argument rubbing their stomachs who say boy it feels good to be full\nAnd she called me a smart alec and told me the stops asking her but she never told me the China starving story again eat [noise]\n\nRussia leaky I miss for\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a
