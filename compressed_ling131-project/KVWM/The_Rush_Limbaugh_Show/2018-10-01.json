they said he\nOr even beyond that\n\nNext they said he he may have committed perjury if he lied about the people on the calendar Andrea he lied about what those terms mean if he is committed perjury\nHe is gone winning the FBI to look into that we need the FBI look into whether or not he beat people up on jails campus and we need to we need to really track down this judicial temperament of his why you see the way he acted on our committee hearing on friday he was yelling and screaming and that's not the kind of temper we want from a judge\nOr my buddy Andy McCarthy and makes a great point if you want to test if you want to see cabinet those judicial temperament there's a place you go\nAnd it is called the DC circuit court of appeals where Kavanaugh has been serving for years and

we'll glad you called or what's happening\n[noise] I grew up with the here um I work at your thoughts on on the ethical issues because of the good part of the page if you recall\nDuring the doctor for testimony the prosecutor asked her how to think for her legal fees and her security on if you met through her go find me page and those three pages of ... billion dollars\nAnd I happen to be some kind of ethical issue what you can just accuse somebody without any kind of corporate evidence and then go public with that\nAnd raise you know that that amount of money as it is a very very properly thought it was a lot of weird offensive there for people to make accusations that they think they could raise your a lot of money or if you're crowding crowdsource\nLook this is a toughie uh in in a strict capitals sense she has identified a market\nAnd that is there are arranged lunatics who want her to be right to\nHope she's telling the truth they want her to continue to speak and tell them if they want her lawyers to continue to strategize and screw cabinet they're happy to pay for it this\nIs how they can be involved in politics beyond voting there are more than happy to pay it doesn't matter to them that she can afford her lawyers are self it doesn't matter to them that her lawyers are working pro bono because this is a political case\nSo she's identified a market there are people that want to support her with money so she starts in the Gulf on me page I actually think somebody sent\nMe a note today that uh go fund me you'll find me is not new money laundering is essentially money laundering operations for the Democrats much like the unions were\nA because there's a lot of this money going to go a lot of this money is going to go to these two lawyers who are then going to

you well I mean there's there's I\nDon't think there's anything immediate that can be done to stop it and I don't think that you can join the conclusions\nAbout her from it um in terms of whether she's being truthful or not or if you wanted to draw a conclusion that the goal fund me pages I'm I'm\nA way to get Democrats soccer's I eat voters\nTo pay for this other doesn't cost people who already have a lot of money anything than you could try to make that point that the Democrats are using these poor people but I don't think you're going to be able to find a way to stop this too widely you jump in Sarasota, Florida Hi great to have you here saw what's up\nHigh Russia just wanted to make a suggestion or an idea kind of a fantasy I don't think it would ever work but\nYou know the left as always behave like bullies and they'll do anything and they've never had real pushback from our representatives on the right in Washington so you know when you know ethics and your dirty tactics I often they have benefits for you coupled with the fact that\nYou know you never have to suffer the consequences yourself like a bully there's no reason to stop when your tactics work there's no reason to stop ... ever stopped until they get punched in the mouth that maybe it maybe it's time that you know we don't want to become them but maybe let's say for a year\nYeah maybe it's time that you know we don't want to become them but maybe let's say for a year that's become them let's let's show them that anything destructive they can do to other human beings it cannot\nWait a minute you know one thing I reject this whole are but I don't disagree with you I reject this argument we don't want to become the we have to be coming Hitler to be Hitler if we have to become the emperor to beat the job no\nWe can be decency can be these people it's just a decent people are not conditioned and primed for it every day\nJeff flakes to me that the FBI\nThey allowed to do one way to get their fight mellow fine senator Graham's point and he even went along with with like\nYou can't do these things as one offs if you're going to tell people who the Democrats are if you're going to try to inform the country what's really going on here you have to do it every day and you're going to have to do it multiple times a day it's going to have to become the central focus of your strategy on a day to day basis\nBut it never does we've had plenty of occasions in the past where some Republicans done a one off like that and it's been great and we have celebrated in we shared it with the way to go and it dies except for here on TALK radio or maybe on Fox News but it dies\n\nWell Lindsey Graham didn't have to become them to do what he did he just had to be honest and he was\nLindsey Graham didn't have to\nWorry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people and by the when did you notice not one of them on the Democrats I cared aware about what Graham said none of even got mad at it\nNot a single one of them even wanted to refute if they didn't care when they get a rise out of them was winning Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter\nSo she turned around and asked her staff did you guys you know they said they didn't Lincoln Mr general we didn't Lincoln I just asked my staff they said they did oh what about an investigation ha well Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein ever going to invest in some of these other things that needs to be followed up on\nTheir needs to be follow through but I for one I Know investigations are innocent but I'm getting tired because all they are for the way\n\nHow hard is it the stand up and say Brett Kavanaugh is credible and there's denial\nHow why is that is so hard she didn't have any evidence that she made a credible witness how well she was really suffering and in may so\n\nNone of that stabbed Bush's credibility\n\nAn attitude doesn't give us credit bubble the pain and suffering doesn't equal credibility Democrats are always in pain and suffering or something\nNow want to go back to my production [noise]\nMy original prediction was that if the Republicans do not vote on this\nIf they don't vote out cabin on that committee him he doesn't get voted on he's if he's not confirmed Republicans are going to have held up pay\nBecause voters are going to be fit to be tied up being let down again than the Democrats kept pulling stunts and it became\nConventional wisdom this keeps up Republican voters are going to get so kicked off Republican women and mothers are going to get so mad because they've got sons they hate seeing what's happening to Kevin all they don't want to management happening there on Ken they're going to show up in droves or I Want to take you into the future and I want you to think about something\n\nIf Brett Kavanaugh just think about this is a hypothetical I'm not predicting if Brett Kavanaugh is not sworn in early next week\n\nIf you can hypothetically envisions a day where Kavanaugh he has not confirmed not sworn in\nAre you going to be ... are you going to\nBe so mad that you can't wait to vote are you going to be so mad that you feel betrayed\nBecause if that happens take that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he has not confirmed in the Senate\n\nYou think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say you see what happened to Kevin off we're in the majority and we couldn't get confirmed you'll need to come out and vote for us how does that work\n\nThat's going to be pretty difficult asking Republicans that come out and vote to keep the majority\nWhen Kavanaugh was not sworn in as everybody thinks\nThat what voters are going to remember in November is this the unfairness that Kavanaugh the dirty tricks Democrats are playing\nThe unfairness to Kavanaugh the dirty tricks that Democrats are playing\nBut stop\nAnd think Kavanaugh is not sworn in\nAnd the Republicans think wow we're set up now man they're still mad out there were guaranteed to get their votes work at it and there's going to be a Republican away because of what happened to Canada and then a Republican start campaigning\n\nAnd they start asking people to vote for them based on what happened to Canada oh you mean that he's not there you mean you didn't get sworn in\nYour that majority we know it's a very small majority but you know the majority and he's not sworn in as you want us to how does this work folks\n\nMy point is it's very easy to sit here and say in the midst of all the Democrats trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side of going to be so ticked off in Seoul man they're gonna show up and vote like they've never voted before\nBut if that's going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in\n\nRepublicans have been asking for the majority for a long time\n\nThey keep working and voting mostly because of Trump voters do they keep showing up because of Trump Trump alone will be able to make the case Trump alone\nWill be able to turn that Kavanaugh defeat and the turnout but the Republicans in the Senate and house I don't know how they do it\nVote for us Kavanaugh was defeated vote for us so it doesn't happen to the next nominee is that really effective I just don't I don't\nI hear too many people talking about it seems like every time you want a big turnout we have to do something\nSo that people get fired up I've been hearing this since I've been doing this show back in Nineteen Ninety two people call here instead of rush Clinton needs to win\nThen people will see how bad the Democrats really are people see house don't stay really are you kidding we lose and then tell ourselves we're going to win and we're still doing it here with Kevin also Kevin out doesn't make it this is going to really fire people up why do we have to do was to fire up\nThe base that doesn't make any sense to me you ought to be the other way around\nThis is another trick I think he gets played on Republicans your base is going to be really fired up if Kavanaugh doesn't make wait a minute the Republicans are the majority how the hell\nYeah is is that advocacy for reelection or election that the guy doesn't make it\nWell rush voters are going to be so mad yeah yeah what\nThe guy got railroad railroaded and our guys couldn't stop it and and we're supposed to say we'll caveman were really loaded now that's going to cause that turn up the ... sorry folks that I don't think it works that way\n\nWhat people in in the hypothetical I just gave you what's going to happen is\nThat voters are going to be out there saying even when we voted Republican Democrat still run down\n\nAnd it doesn't equal show up keep elected re it's got to be the other way that the way this\nWe have got to be the Democrats not lose to them\nAnd by the way I've had a lot of emails from a lot of uh people who think their expert political analyst and they all well not all but I mean a whole bunch of them have this theory that the way they get the base all fired we want to let them destroy\nA great life a great patriot a great American his whole career his future maybe his family in order to win

it's relevant with voters as to whether or not they hear that the people that were supposed to corroborate professor Ford story whether or not they do or not which seems it seems like a a fairly simple task for the FBI would you you would talk to these poor people\nAnd if they offered anyone else that they can get in touch with\nYou know I've read James ... piece today and I'm like or last night and I I ... there's something really off with James called me now I Love the FBI I think the world or the FBI I have friends in the FBI or family in the FBI family all over law enforcement\nAnd he was up they FBI back in the middle of it when we were handed the Hillary Clinton email investigation the director said to me you know you're totally screwed right well maybe you shouldn't have written the exoneration before the investigation\nMaybe you know it'd be understood what the Espionage Act said maybe if he if he understood what obstruction of justice was he wouldn't have taken lightly thirty three thousand deleted emails and bleach bed and breaking up\nThe vices with cameras and so on and so forth and he goes oh those were the good old days that it goes on to trash the president on every front believing every left wing narrative about\nWhat the ... about what ... what is that about Trump and he goes on to the FBI agents are experts at interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world will follow up with additional interviews and was limited in some way by the Trump Administration although the Democrats that said they wanted limited scope\nThey wanted a one week timetable delight that was it it will come from people with testimony and other accounts testing them pushing them in a professional way agents have a\nMuch better than nonsense detector the partisans because they aren't starting with a conclusion you mean like he did and then he actually said that you know and then there are people that\nAnd he said well that speaks volumes refusal to do so is its own kind of statement\nWhy would anybody after Michael Flynn\nIt's great for American manufacturers it's great for our auto industry you know a lot of my conservative friends they don't say the same thing I don't like his position on trade and I'm telling you I said to them all you don't know I'm like I Do everything in Donald Trump's life as an association\nIf you don't say that Canada and Mexico that you're pulling out if you don't take a strong stand to make them believe it\nYou know they walked prime minister Trudeau to the final our last night grabbing concessions so that America got much better deal than we had with NAFTA\nAnd the state nobody thought it would happen with the new president of Mexico and nobody thought that we can get NATO to step up and pay more considering we pay over Seventy cents of every dollar for defending NATO or the NATO alliance and nobody thought that our Western European allies that we're talking and complaining and having an hauling that\nDonald Trump ones better trade deals with our partners nobody thought that can happen\nIf you don't say you're going to start at the start of a trade war if you don't say it and act like you mean you're not going to get concessions and the fact is no American president prior to him even dared broach the subject\nAnd meanwhile we see manufacturing jobs leaving states like Michigan Ohio Wisconsin Pennsylvania\nAnd for all the talking hatred of Donald Trump style the fact that he breaks a lot of dishes to get things done and he says a lot of things to negotiate\nAre we better off than we weren't two years ago are Hispanic Americans better off African Americans women in the workforce better off youth unemployment fourteen states unemployment low unemployment records his own records\nConsumer confidence Wall Street fight every objective discernible measure with doing better\nEnd result shouldn't matter but in thirty six days Democrats are hoping that they've created enough smoking enough mirrors what did they do in eight years when Obama was president their policies failed on a spectacular level and if I had time I get back into it\nLet me tell you it was never going to be limited in scope this investigation ever\nIt was never going to be you know just a week or so no that's not what they want\nAnd when the FBI comes back and all they do is real from what under penalty of of a felony the four people and the professor Ford case it said either they don't remember or it didn't happen like the case of the one I witnessed she said was in the room when the alleged incident happened\nThey're not going to be happy and they're going to try and stretch out even further and ask for more investigations they're going to find one little nugget that says because the FBI doesn't get recommendations\nThe ... the FBI is is not gonna give they're just going to give okay this is what they said\nBecause they don't have any authority in this particular case\nYou know and now we've got to look in all three claims even the ... you know you wouldn't believe thirty six years ago routinely on weekends the boys were drug in girls and and then lining up in the halls waiting to you know rape gang rape these young women\nBecause that's what the woman said\nAnd that's what they want to investigate now\nUm it is seemingly having an impact according to the Remington research group forty eight percent in Missouri likely voters planning to vote for the Republican candidate Josh Hawley\nForty six percent said they plan to vote for McCaskill but then the question of McCaskill's opposition to Kavanaugh whether it's impacting their vote forty nine percent said it made them less likely to vote for McCaskill I think Democrats are going to be watching those kind of numbers very closely\nLook their hope is is they they hope they've created enough smoke and fire over Russia still no evidence whatsoever\nThey hope that they create enough smoke and fire here that they can make this all about election day and that you'll forget how awful it was under Obama\nAnd that you won't get up and he voted for Trump but most people don't go out and midterms mid term elections are about those people that show up motivating your base to get out there\nIf you want Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Chuck Schumer as your majority leader you'll get the government you deserve if you if you want to tune in on election night in thirty six days\nFive weeks from tomorrow and hear Nancy Pelosi the speaker and Chuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader\nIf by the way Mitch McConnell's railing\nAbout Ford was not told of the chairman's offers\nThat's interesting why did they keep that from her that was an interesting side bar\nThere is I Know that Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham on to investigate Dianne Feinstein now why did she holders for six weeks would have plenty of time by the way it was six extra weeks to investigate why did they hold it because they wanted to create this crisis at this time\nBut no there's a lot at stake in in this upcoming election\n[noise] now we did have um the case\nWhat what is the woman's name Rachel Mitchell was the one that was asking questions for the Republicans in the Senate a professor for it and she did a very strong analysis of the case you said in the legal context here is my bottom line and he said she said case\nIs incredibly difficult to prove but this cases even weaker than that she said Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either a few that her allegations or failed to corroborate up\nFor the reasons discuss below I Do not think of reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that the evidence is sufficient dissatisfied a preponderance of evidence standard even and you know I that's a pretty powerful statement\nNow we have what else do we have here so we got some other blue state numbers that are really interesting to watch um\nThere's a lot of reasons why in New Jersey this was surprising to me Democratic Sen Robert Menendez is having a tough time getting re elected this is not a state anybody's been paying a lot of attention to 'em it didn't help him this weekend when a used professor Ford's allegations to bash Brett Kavanaugh and he tweeted out Sunday\nOr Saturday the details of professor Ford's testimony or heart wrenching to hear I Hope every single senator not only watch his butt listens and two days later the political had a headline shock poll shows a dead heat in Menendez Senate race in New Jersey\nAnd by the way you know think Christie Todd Whitman and\nUm what's the what's the name of the past governor a Christie Christie himself Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman Christie a lot of Christie's in in New Jersey um but anyway it was forty five forty three within the margin of error in New Jersey\nGrassley is urging the Justice Department announced prosecute in the case of ah the man who falsely accused Brett Kavanaugh raping an acquaintance after summer Senate Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse helped publicize that bogus allegation\nYou've got in the case of Michael ... client it was\nShouldn't you got in the case of Michael ... client there was a CBS News report that\nThe woman sweat neck has an extensive history these or CBS his words not mine of involvement and legal disputes including a lawsuit in which an ex employer accused or falsifying or college in work history and a job application\nUh we have Jerrold Nadler previewing coming attractions we ever give these guys back power and he's saying that he'd likely be the house Judiciary Committee chairman if in fact the Democrats get control of the house and he wants lawmakers to investigate any credible allegations\nYou want to give him the power want to give back to the waters that power Lindsey Graham is now vowed to conduct a full scale investigation into Dianne Feinstein which I think is the right thing to do it why would she said on this", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Show Low", "day": "01"}
