bit improved after the conventional wisdom about like the effects Kevin I Will have I think are governed by that\nA lot in our forecast you now see a clear split between the house in the Senate where the G ... summit chances continue to improve but the Democrats house chances actually are back on the upswing now kind of since the Kavanaugh nomination\nA ... it's it's kind of not like it's kind of just the Kavanaugh fight has energized Republicans far more than Democrats and all of these house races the Democrats are showing their voters are locks\nThey're too close to call right now there's a whole bunch of 'em that are too close to call this isn't in the bag for them but they're voters need to be told that it is they've set that up\nThey've been on this blue wave business for so long that if they come off of them even a bit that causes a crisis of confidence among the Democrat voting base and they can't do that but folks I'm telling you I'm maybe I'm even asking for your input here\nVery briefly again starting in two thousand ten rock Obama being done the destruction of the Democratic party as an electoral apparatus they lost twelve hundred seats between two thousand ten and two thousand sixteen\nThey continue to lose seats in the two thousand sixteen race which Trump one which they thought was a walk landslide win for them\nThe last elections that approach what's coming up where the two thousand fourteen midterms Obama won\nWell didn't even get when he wasn't on the ballot or the the um the midterms in in that year\nWe're not the grand sweep for Obama that they were they were said to be Obama presided over the systematic loss of seats by the Democratic party in two thousand sixteen comes along and Trump wins the presidency\nAnd the Democrats have the least amount of electrical power in Washington since the Nineteen twenties\nAnd from that we're supposed to believe that Donald Trump alone\n\nHas provided the energy and the emphasis in the ... and the Democrats\nThe comeback show up and re take everything they lost all the problem with that is\nThe Democrats lost because Republicans won the Republican voters showed up in droves in every one of those men terms and the presidential race two thousand twelve in two thousand twelve presidential race Democrats continue to lose seats even though Obama won his reelection nobody else the Democrat Party\nThat much worse bragging about some of the Republicans\nCame alive first it was the Tea Party Obamacare and all of the standing to\nEnergize but then it was Lois Lerner the IRS and all the other scandals that came along ... there was nothing that Obama was doing the economy was a flat line if it wasn't if it wasn't deteriorating there wasn't anything Obama was giving away nuclear weapons to the Iranians\nHe was giving away guns to Mexican drug cartels in a back door way\nTo do damage to the second amendment people want to know partner when Obama was doing every chance they had to vote against it they did except they didn't have the guts to vote against them because of the racial component to that was on twelfth now we're supposed to believe\nThat that trend that sees the Democrats holding the fewest number of electoral seats they've ever had since two thousand to the Nineteen twenties has suddenly overwhelmingly changed simply because there's so much hatred for Donald Trump\nAnd a hatred for who Trump visits hatred for his tweets it's hatred for his personality it's hatred for his manners or lack there of if hatred for the way he behaves it's hatred for each hairstyle it's hatred because it'd be mean spirited and what that\nAnd that alone is what the media and Nate Silver are telling us all gr this massive Democrat blue wave\nShow snowflake and Springer

think that we don't have a nation of enterprising people are going to try to take advantage of this because Elizabeth Warren has now established that to be true\nSo by by helping her in this I think they're going to be regretting and this is what I mean by\nThey are self emulating they are doing great harm to themselves in it's hard to describe I think even though I Know it\nI Know what to AT T I Know the psychological state they're in and I I Know they're just all of the party as a whole is teetering on the brink of what you and I wouldn't call rational sanity\nThey have been losing ground to

watch as long as the tour in range\nThe phone determines everything that watch those when they are separated when the watches out of range and the phone that's when you have to know how the watch can

have had to have been why fight when it hadn't been why find that we're going to ... and it would have had to have a password entered on that what\nI'm saying the odds of this\nI don't think most people with a watch nowhere to go to the password nor how to do it you can't dictate it you have to you have to use the rebel app and use your finger to draw individually every character that send the password\nAnd if you try to make AT T\nAnd it comes out as a plus sign you have to know to back it up but you did it wrong it's not an easy thing to do and I just I don't I I I'm a long way of saying I Would be really really shocked if Jamal ... watch recorded\nWith the with an audio ... just press record or the voice memos that comes with with a watch I'd be shocked if it was record and then I'm further more I'd be shocked if the Saudis didn't stop on that watching destroy it\nIf they saw that he was wearing it so I don't think there's going to be video or audio and sort of whatever happened to them all to show me a Casey in sand point Idaho welcome great to have you here Hi\nHey thanks for your walk or\nI was a one to touch on\nWhy I think there might be a red wave instead of a blue wave and that's because for years and years we've been told that we find in the media and establishment and whoever else that we needed to go with mark and a moderate candidates like John McCain and Mitt Romney\nYeah yeah exactly right look where that got us yeah in two thousand so national if I\nCan see that in ... when Donald Trump come down an escalator and we were fed the same talking points of light couldn't win\nAnd with our backs against the law on election night we all showed up to the polls for the greater good of things and recruit the media and everybody else rock\nAnd I believe that that gave the conservatives a confidence and I think that they're going to show up and a greater force because we've been told that it has got to be a wave and we're going to prove wrong country to have an ...\nWell that's what a lot of people are hoping that there is a sophistication sophistication level among two thousand sixteen voters that tells them how necessary it is to go out and vote in whatever way but we'll continue to support Trump because that's really what this is about\n...\nMaybe I'm going to do this to Marla Thursday I don't know which yet but I it it's it's it's about time to go through the list the and the Republicans have this list but it would have made their own of what to expect that the Democrats win the house and it is brutal and I don't have any doubt\nThat everything on the Republican list is true they're going to every committee in the house is going to be used to investigate something Trump has done or some body in his administration it is going to be\nUnlike anything we've ever seen every day of the Trump Administration is going to be investigated and subpoenaed that's all the Congress is going to be doing is investigating and indicting that's all they're going to be doing that's all that's going to happen\nThe Senate\nRepublicans hold it so legislation is going to get ... there's going to be total gridlock nothing's going to get done none of Trump's judges will get past his lips\nAfter he nominates them\nSo yeah it's going to require a lot of voters to understand this but you said conservatives the Trump coalition is not\nJust conservatives there are a lot of Democrats who voted for Trump there are a lot of independents that voted for Trump there are a lot of moderates that voted for Trump there he got he got people from every demographic spread\nAnd some of the Trump people were not ardent Trump supporters they were frustrated didn't like anybody at all and fought they would go for the biggest change they could\nBut not every Trump voter was a make America great again advocate\nSo how many of those are still happy with their votes how many of those realize that for what they voted for the continued Trump has to remain free of investigation I mean look what the deep statesman able to do when they don't even run the show\nThe deep state the executive branch which Trump runs look what they've been doing just imagine the Democrats' controlling every house committee agriculture intelligence foreign affairs foreign this morning whenever a judiciary\nThey're not going to stop it jumped they're going to try to get cabin off thrown off the Supreme Court they're going to bring back Woolsey poured that whole thing\nAnd I I haven't even remembered ten percent of what they're going to do that's what I'm going to make the list but it's a it's easily predictable it's a no brainer but I'm I'm I'm here to tell you that the objective is going to be\nThe force Trump out of Washington DC as soon as they can they

unemployment\nAnd fourteen states that I mentioned since Trump spent elected record low unemployment for for Hispanic Americans African Americans Asian Americans vets women in the workplace youth unemployment that I mentioned in any of that\nBecause the media is not mentioning it they just want to hate Trump every day\nThat I mentioned that oh the marketwatch printed today that the number of job openings in the U.S rose to a record seven point one for a million in August reflecting strong growth in the economy and the best labor market in decades\nThat would be CBS is marketwatch not Hannity's marketwatch\nJob openings topping seven million for the first time ever\nIn July and figures show they increased again in August we have two records in a row\nOf us ... job openings mean\nThat means that you might be able to finally change jobs and get on the career path you been dreaming about\nWhat the eight years of democratic failure know what that means that may be a change jobs and get paid that much more per hour or a year that just puts you in a whole new economic category for yourself your family your lifestyle the house you can live in a car you can buy\nThe made the dinners you might be able to afford to go to the the trips that does any of that you want to take your kids on you've been dreaming about that's what that means or the new job maybe means another

house\nDistricts now this is the most important part of the poll\nIf you look at it they quote ABC News is recline took a look at the current generic ballot polling which favors the Democrats but\nYou know what it always favors the Democrats although we have other polls that have shown that that that gap has narrowed significantly what he's pointing out is the core concerns now with three weeks to go three weeks from tonight you're going to get the results\nIs that Democrats worry a whole lot that mid term enthusiasm is going to wind up wasted in places they don't need it\nIn other words but they're really finding is let me translate that oh they have the generic ballot wrapped up in New York Chicago\nNew Jersey Trenton you know San Francisco everywhere in between they have a wrapped up in Los Angeles probably\nBut not in red state America and what this analysis shows is inside the districts that will result in the balance of power in the house of representatives put it another way that will decide if Nancy Pelosi once again gets the gambling become speaker\nIt is a dead heat\nForty six forty seven Democrats versus Republicans very similar dynamic driven by democratic strengthen cities their weaknesses in rural areas that is driving house and Senate forecast in opposite directions in other words the Senate is looking good\nMarsha Blackburn after the tape my project Bertha

with that race at this point same thing with ... you know Heidi Heitkamp was the only way these Democrats can win is to lie to you not talk about what they really want to do\nNew York times is now concerned that Democrats could be in for disappointment on November sick a column their headlined what could\nDemocrats could be in for disappointment on November sick a column their headlined what could ruin a big blue wave two prominent New York Times columnist some of the problem with these words quote Donald Trump seems to elevated Hispanics voter Rath\nWhat ... what does that mean anyway you mean the fact that we have the lowest level of unemployment for Hispanic Americans and African Americans and women in the workforce look I I get that some people don't like Donald Trump style\nBut you can't argue with the results and you can't argue with the fact that he made promises and he's kept the kind of refreshing\nAnyway goes on to point out Hispanic voters despite all Trump's Porter cruelty\nWell he's always talked about some people to commit crimes and I've been down to the border more than anybody at the New York times\nAnd I've seen it myself maybe they should go to the drug warehouses and should ride horseback all terrain vehicles and helicopters boats\nLike I haven't stand by the border walls and and you know look at the tunnels that have been built and look at the drug trafficking in the human trafficking that has occurred and maybe sit through security briefing and the Rio Grande in the Texas border like I did with Rick Perry to see that at a seven year period six hundred and forty two thousand crimes committed against Texans alone\nI mean it's another important race Ted Cruz with all the hype about NATO wouldn't know Rourke\nIs up by eight points a ... a nine
