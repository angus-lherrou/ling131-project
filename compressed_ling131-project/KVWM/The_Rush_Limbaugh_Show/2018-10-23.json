they gave us was NBC News\nSo the question here ... hard to apply this to actual election outcomes too much we don't know but one thing we do know this is not this is not according to mention was a conventional wisdom is and conventional wisdom has been the Republican enthusiasm is kind of suppressed\nThat Democrat enthusiasm is off the charts that the Democrats have been so motivated ever since they got screwed in two thousand six yeah ever since Trump and the Russians stole that election from the Democrats have been motivated or like you can't believe they get out there and make this right\nAnd correct it and fix it they have been inspired they'd been energized they'd been motivated\nThey been donating they cannot wait and yet\nIn eight key Republican state key key

it even if it means they're lying to themselves about it like for example if they if they get it in their heads the everybody hates Trump\nAnd that hatred for Trump has brought in and magnified over two years that therefore there's going to be this massive\nTurnout among Democrats can't wait to vote energized and they get that in their heads and they believe it and then the exact opposite happens
