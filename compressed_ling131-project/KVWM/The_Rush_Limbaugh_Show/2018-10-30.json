to test whether they were being emotional or whether they actually and fought it out\nSo I ran a ... it's got to be a red wave and it's gonna be big it's going to shock everybody people are going to be starting just like they weren't two years ago I said okay well I Hope you're right but let me let me give you some facts on the ground\nForty oh yeah we're going to get to the birthright citizenship is it just a second here but I Want to set it up with this 'cause man this is great what Trump is doing on birth for all this is exactly why Trump was elected as my good friend McCarthy any recording said you got to have somebody that's willing to break the furniture\nYou have to have somebody willing to turn things upside down if you're actually going to get things done and the left is the site itself the day the NBC is headlined Trump Trump's attack on birthright citizenship is is the latest attempt to rile up the G O P base\nEverybody's saying he can't do that that's the fourteenth amendment he can't universally with an executive order reverse the fourteenth amendment we want to discuss how maybe he can he's going to run into activist judges that'll that'll turned him down here but the point is\nThat you need somebody like Donald Trump gets the fourteenth amendment is what grants citizenship to anybody born in America and it was intended it goes back to the Eighteen hundreds it was intended to grant citizenship to slaves and their descendants\nNow how many\nHow do you think modern African Americans they would feel if the fourteenth amendment which was used to grant citizenship to this slams and their descendants now being used a grant citizenship to anybody that gets into the country just for the purposes of giving birth here\nAnd so this is something it's long been fought to be untouchable Trump is saying I look I think I can fix this one of the executive order and the reason he thinks so it is because the constitution is the final word folks the constitution will actually Trump\nActs of Congress statutory legislative acts of Congress if they pass something unconstitutionally constitutional survives\nIf it can be if the case can be made and\nBut the conclusion is that there has been no blue way there's not even been a blue\nRipple back you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip some blue bubbles are bursting recall the blue bubbles are areas of blue support last time blue congressional districts and major coastal\nCities so this guy is of the firm\nBelief that a conservative red wave or Republican a red wave is coming and is on the way\nMany other people are either I've\nI've heard some people that were rush look if you got to be very very careful those forty five Republican retirements that's that's such a toss up\n... don't know how to factor all of that that's more retirements in a single year than we're ever used to having to factor in\n\nHere and the power of incumbency and those forty five seats has been has been lost I think by the way the political professionals\nAre going to be hyping the fact that as things stand I this is probably what you're going to hear from a lot of places things stand now looks like the Democrats might win the house by two maybe for\nThe and that's going to be designed to get you to not get lazy and overconfidence don't don't be dispirited by any of that you hear the evidence that there is no blue wave is the is the\nEvidence of panic\nThat is prevalent throughout the drive by maybe because their efforts to derail Trump have failed\nEvery one of them including the big one\nForcing Trump out of office because he supposedly co loaded with the Russians Robert Mueller was supposed to have it delivered to go to\nThe special counsel buying now all was supposed to have cook Trump Trump was supposed to be on the way out by now do not doubt me that's what everybody on the left held out in great hope\nFor the special counsel investigation\nBarring an actual report they had been hoping and praying for a week\nThat would be indicative that the report does say that Mahler found hard evidence that Trump important cheated and stole the election from the clutches of the hill to be ... but there\nAren't even any such weeks that's the big one that has blown up do not doubt me on this by now\nMueller was supposed to have delivered the guards drive by media was supposed to have delivered the leaks\nSo now it's off to plan B and plans see\nSo now it's off the plan B and plans see and so forth and that's why I say that kind of it's obvious panic also argues against the fact that they feel confident\nIn a in a blue wave let's take a brief time out will come back we'll delve into will get started delving into the Trump claimed that he can defy the constitution and and birthright citizenship whether the executive order it would not be defined in the constitution\nThat's out CNN headlines of the story would not be defy the constitution and that's

there were a lot of never Trump or is it in there and that's one of the reasons they retired I Would be remiss if I didn't mention is there were a lot of them I don't know about the total number forty five but a lot of them quip because they were just fed up\nThat Trump won and that Trump was leading the Republican Party and they don't want anything to do with it some of them are committee chairmen and decided they wouldn't go back just being regular house bozos because it's such a calm down you know to have been a committee chairman then go back to being just a regular venture or back venture\nIn their place and this this offers well in their place many of the Republicans who got the primary nominations to replace the never Trump hers were retiring are Trump supporters\nThere Trump

seventies as a an offshoot of radicalism in the sixties is where\nThe changing premise of education for America's kids actually began but I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here in the details of the story Donald Trump\nAnd let me just give you the New York times version they're headline Trump claims he can defy constitution and the end birthright citizenship\nPresident Trump property dramatic if legally dubious promise in a new interviewed ... unilaterally and birthright citizenship ratcheting up his hard line immigration rhetoric with a weeks ago before the critical mid term elections\nTrump's vow to enter the rights of citizenship for children of non citizens alum authorized immigrants born in America\nCame in an interview with ... was released yesterday Trump did not say when he would sign the order and some of his past promises using executive action have gone unfulfilled but whether he follows through on his threat or not the issue and joins a string of actions intended to thrust the matter\nOf immigration into the front of voters' minds as they have the polls next week folks as I said throughout the first year of Trump's presidency this is what pushing back looks like it was never going to be clean and it was never going to be quiet\nPushing back against the liberal order of the day was always going to be noisy and it was going to be potentially violent and dangerous\nAfter all these are people who do not accept election results anymore\nAnd you know what that means you don't want to help this country together all these years is the\nHonoring of a lecture results yeah have a heated campaign you may have political parties and how long has it really don't like each other but whoever won the election decided who\nHad a chance at running the country and both sides acknowledge that and it wasn't that long ago you can go back to two thousand two when the Democrats lost those mid term elections in shock George W Bush's first\nMidterm elections after winning in two thousand a drive by and the left work and events that they were going to sweep the house the way they were going to ... we the senator waivers people were fed up with the Florida recount remember all that\nAl Gore got job the Democrats got cheated and Democrats were loaded for bear out what happened the Republicans won an avid seats in an off year election\nWhat the Democrats they accepted it for the most part and they started talking about how well we're gonna have to modify some of what we believe a lot of values a basis because exit poll showed that values were a large factor in why people voted Republican\nWell fast forward it two thousand six than there is no knowledge with the Trump won they do not accept\n\nThe election results that's what these past two years have been about and are going to remain about\nThey don't accept Trump's election as legitimate because they didn't want it\nWe've gotten to a point where the radical left simply because it doesn't feel good about this is willing to overthrow an election and its results and the way this happened\nTop levels of the Obama the O. J.\nWe're used to overthrow run a silent cool to try to throw Donald Trump back out of office and reverse those election results it's unprecedented\nPat Buchanan has peace out today that uh reminds people Nineteen sixty eight featured even more violent unrest that we haven't yet seen this year but we're getting close\nYou can always go back in time and find period where it was worse than it is at present you can always go back inside the civil war but it is a seminal moment when a political party\nAs its official position refuses to accept election results\nAnd that's where we are and that's why we're where we are they refused to accept it for whatever reason they hate Trump they don't feel good about it they disagree whatever doesn't matter why just the fact that they refused to accept the results\nIs a horribly dangerous thing\nBecause what if it keeps up what if the only time there is peace in America is when they win elections\nYou know I I predicted some time ago that they're going to figure this out at some point and the natural conclusion to figuring this out as well let's just eliminate elections elections or what's holding us back let's find a way that will lemonade them\nPeople laugh to combine rice it's never going to ... do not ever say the left isn't capable of anything ever\nSo now Trump rather than being intimidated by their refusal to accept this election or rather the feelings hurt Trump doubles down triples down every time they hit him he hits back\nWith additional energy and verve and I'm telling you this promise with an executive order to end birthright citizenship is huge and it's why he was elected\nRight citizenship is huge and it's why he was elected\nWhen things are going terribly wrong and they are in our country right now when things are terribly wrong and out of control\nYou have to have somebody willing to go outside the so called boundaries and Trump's doing it every day and willing to do so because this is what pushing back\nThis is what defiance this is what changing the left as do it looks like it was never going to be pretty it was never going to be why it was never going to be clean\n\nIt requires a strong stomach and strong fortitude and there's I don't think any elected Republican other than Trump even if they had made the promises Trump made I think all of them would have caved by now\nBut Trump hasn't it doubles down All right I'm going to just I'm a physician executive order I'm going to end the birthright citizenship let me read the the fourteenth amendment how it begins\nAll persons now the fourteenth amendment goes back to Eighteen ... I think it was ratified by Congress and agents sixty six\nOh it was passed by Congress ratified by the state's two years later so agents sixty six it was passed by Congress ratified but the state's Eighteen sixty eight and its original intent was to grant citizenship just slaves\nAnd their descendants\nAnd it was part and parcel of post civil war era of America fixing itself it was a good thing or our constitution was written so that mistakes\nAt the sound that could be corrected vast majority of people do slavery of the founding was was tenable but they needed the union in order to fight\nThe revolutionary war they needed the southern states they needed unity to do that so they had to accept slavery but they built in safeguards to wipe it out in the habit an agent sixty eight the fourteenth amendment begins this way all persons born or naturalized in the United states\nAnd subject to the jurisdiction there of our citizens of the U.S end up the state\nWhere in they reside it was clearly intended to be referring to slaves and their descendants the parts that birthright citizenship a freaks half to delete\nArt naturalized and subject to the jurisdiction that rub\nYou are not naturalized and you are not subject to the U.S jurisdiction if you're here illegally\nYou cannot be you're under some other countries jurisdiction if you're here illegal you cannot possibly be naturalized\nWell the birthright citizenship crowd which wants to water down American culture and destroy western civilization conveniently leaves out naturalized and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\n\nSo your born here or child absolutely is not a citizen and this is what Trump is saying Trump is finally pushing back against them some shouldn't that has been made because it was the least half of resistance if you will but now it's it's make or break time\n\nAs my friend McCarthy says you need somebody to break the furniture [noise] sometimes you got to remodel house I got a quick\nTime out a little long haired next segments going to be sort of Amish Limbaugh going the way home to eat I met were\nRescued on Rush Limbaugh and\nThe backyard looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding a deck to no one could contractors why don't you just ask ... advice on what home advisor dot com you just tell them about your project and they match you with local pros that can do the job nice now how much does it cost\nA home advisors totally free to use plus you can read customer reviews check pricing and book avoiding for free\nWhat's the website again home advisor dot com or just download the bring home advisor at [noise]\nYou're listening to the top giant nine Seventy Katie WM shallow twelve Seventy Katie J I hold broadcast service a metric um [noise]\nStirs more debate on immigration me ...

it'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that the Senate uh [noise] look we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen\nThere there there needs to be a pretty big re education of the American population in general on the whole subject of immigration\nAnd so Trump and his ... the roots of an executive order is good but there's you know there's going to be a judge\nThat's going to bring it to a screeching halt everybody knows that I mean that'll happen within hours of Trump signing the executive order everybody involved no it was that's going to happen that then begins the process\nAnd it probably will end up at this report unless Congress does right legislation in dealing with a constitutional amendment\nOr it may take more of a justice statutory act\nAnd the left\nAnd they've got plenty of judges out there are going to be using every damn one of them to try to shut down every effort

this conversation starter on the fourteenth amendment and ending birthright to make them stand up and make polo sea and Schumer and whoever else saw them make the case that in a buddy born in the

politics forcing the left out this way and as it happens the media goes more and more bonkers because they know what's going on\n\nAnd it's it's forcing everybody to see that the media is in the media the media is the Democratic party\nAnd all of these things are why the people I talked to who think that there's not going to be a blue wave think they think more and more Americans because of Trump are finally seeing liberalism and action as opposed to having been told what liberalism is and who liberals are they are now seeing it\nAnd once that happens it's it's harder for the left to win\nI

Silver five thirty eight said this year's Senate election is closed for Republicans have the clear path to a majority but it is a treacherous one\nRepublicans are favored in Iowa Colorado for example but not by much of Democrats eked out victories in those states\nAnd picked up the seat and Kansas they can control fifty feet and keep their majority Democrats also pick up seats from the G O P in Georgia Kentucky Republican gains in Arkansas Louisiana or probable but barred from certain relatively modest there is in the right states would do tricks for the Democrats anyway that Republicans picked up nine\nDonald Trump didn't want a single state according to the polls John Kerry was going to be president because of the polls no I don't have a crystal ball\nAnd I just know when we're in the fight and I just you know I have a natural gut instinct to always wanna play like I'm behind play hard and the way you play hard in this case is you make a decision now\nThat you're going to vote for the Republican congressmen in your district check out my website the if you're in one of those key pivotal\nTip the balance of power districts they're the most important but every seat is important\nAnd when you vote no that would be a vote for a Democrat you're voting for below sea it'd be a vote for a Republican maybe you're you're voting to keep the status quo of economic growth and prosperity in a strong national defense to build a border wall\nAnd there'll be a boat for any democratic senator you're just voting for Schumer it'd be a vote for Bredesen McCaskill Nelson\nI mean how pastors in ... and\nYou know people the cloth are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just dying inside I don't know\nIt takes a very special anointed person to be that kind of person Donald Trump's my president the president of the United states is always welcome to visit\nYou know my friend David showed on this program has been to the tree of life says rabbi Myers is an amazing\nAnd um\nLife says rabbi Myers is an amazing man\nAnd um why wouldn't you want the president to come and comfort your congregation there's never been a more pro Israel president in my lifetime than this one\nIt's just it's just the fact all the president's promise that Jerusalem which is the rightful capital of Israel owe that to move it from Tel Aviv Israel then they never do because they never have the courage to do it\nOne of Donald Trump is getting all these calls from other countries in the region and they said no I'm doing it I made a promise I'm keeping my word\nOh why don't we have a little bit more of that\nThat is one thing that Donald Trump if he gives his word he's gonna he's fighting for it we see it now happening on the immigration fight\nOr the president and Lindsey Graham of teamed up to and birthright citizenship in other words if you enter the country illegally and you happen to give birth to a child a child instantly\nEven though you're in the country illegally interest in it initially is just automatically a U.S citizen doesn't matter that your parents are here illegally well that is only to encouraging other illegal behavior we're asking people we support immigration legal immigration\nWe now see caravan organizers loading in ... illegal migrants on the buses headed for the U.S although some of the people now have been turning back\nUm the Pentagon now is deployed over fifty two hundred troops they're putting up barriers barb barb wire and other things because we can't have what happened on\nThe southern border with Guatemala Mexico Mexico southern border where people just rush across and rush over the police you know we had apparently a confrontation yesterday one dead dozens injured as a caravan was clashing with Mexican authorities we don't want that here\nWe are saying if you want to come then come legally don't come illegally respect America First thing to getting into America has to be respect America the sovereignty respect our borders respect to America is\nUm\nThis is getting interesting about Robert mall I don't really know what to think about it I'm a little torn about even talking about it but\nApparently Mike Allen let's see if I can pull this story up here is a tweeting out that special counsel former FBI Director Mueller is accused of\nSome type of sexual impropriety against women and the FBI now is looking into it that it's a false stories so I Want to give you both sides of it daily news as of a very different take on it\nAnd they're headline is FBI asked to investigate allegations that women were offered cash to accuse Robert Mueller\nOf sexual assault I Know for a fact that a tape exists\nA where there is a very prominent person on the tape on about Mueller very prominent person on the tape\nOffering money to somebody to make allegations against Donald Trump why this tape has never been made public I don't know\nBut it does exist\nAnd I'm not going to go any further than that at this point so this type of thing does happen and I think like every other case I mean I'm not a fan of the team that Robert Mueller put together I you know I'm always torn goes I never want to credit I I'm I'm very fond of law enforcement\nI just hate the people that he hired in this witch hunt how we ever got off into things like you know bank loan applications when I was supposed to be about Trump Russia collusion you know we're at a point in history where this is how phony Democrats they only care about Russia collusion and interference if it's Donald Trump\nBut when you have real evidence 'cause there's no evidence of Trump Russia collusion when there's real evidence of Hillary paying for a phony Russian dot CA disseminated by top intelligence officials\nAnd FBI officials to lie to the American people before an election is used to commit fraud on Pfizer court judges four times to get into the Trump campaign visa v a Trump campaign associate\nAnd then is part of a media elites strategy that we've now learned about it's taken Eighteen months\nThat passed the age used in leaked all over the media to create the impression oh there's smoke here about Trump Russia collusion\nBut the leaks for about the phony ... Russian does save and Hillary paid for on top of of course Hillary committed multiple felonies and having a rigged investigation\nAnd this week strategy leading to the appointment of Mahler which we now know to be the insurance policy just in case Trump wins because Trump shouldn't lose a hundred million to one according to Peter Struck even Peter Struck said there's no there there\nUsed to pay that ... just prior to the appointment of Mahler they had no evidence of any type of type of collusion none\nIt's outrageous you know you watch this this vile anti Semitic racist Trump heater murdering eleven innocent people injuring six others I mean you see it's basically the face of evil evil exists\nIt exist in society exist all around the world why we need to spend the money we spend on a strong national defense that's why we need to be tough with oh Kim Jong un and the mullahs in Iran\nYou know it's we had the deadliest attack against the Jewish community on American soil in our history\nPresident said no will destroy you if you attack them which was the right answer is no place in this country for evil racist anti Semite none\nAnd I don't think there's been a president in modern history that has demonstrated his support for our number one ally in the middle east and frankly between Great Britain in Israel but this is the closest alliance we half\nAs America founded on Judeo Christian principles it's a personal connection in his own family with his daughter and son in law is grandchildren you know as um you know he's the one that deported the Nazi death camp guard Obama didn't do it could have but he didn't\nHe's been the most pro Israeli president rightly so since Nineteen forty seven moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem has presidents never had the courage to do it Israeli prime minister or\nI've often said it was the only adult on the world stage finally has a partner that understands the evils and the threats of radical\nAnd especially Iran\nAnd the mainstream media Democrats speaking with one voice blame Trump but this horrific attack Dana Milbank writing Trump's America is not a safe place for Jews what a lie\nWhat a slanderous disgusting despicable why\nAlso in the Washington Post an editor writing you know Trump is stoked the fears of those like power one columnist the New York times Trump is flirted with the deepest racist and Nazis and it is not gone unnoticed\nTrump is flirted with the deepest races the Nazis and it is not gone unnoticed the least of all by them\nBlaming the president now not only is Trump historically since forty eight the most supportive president of Israel and the Jewish community the monster that committed this evil atrocity in the synagogue a\nHappened say Trump why because Trump is so close with our friends and allies of Israel\nAnd Bowers posting online is hatred in contempt for Trump because of its support for Israel but yet the mainstream media coverage that doesn't matter at one you know CNN and\n... you know GQ correspondent saying that the president is worse than ISIS I think you know that's passing out\nOne of the things that he really launched his presidential run on his talking about Islamic radical radicalization and this president has radicalized so many more people than ISIS her dad is I think the president has found more supporters to espouse an equally hateful ideology and CNN\nAnd it's unbelievable she says well my comments or is that that's all we've heard all weekend and then you've got\nFake news president Jeff Zucker lecturing the president on rhetoric in the village this is his network every second minute hour of every day it's anti Trump\nThen that idiot hump the dump the you know who is basically the\nYou know spokesmen for soccer ... soccer over the weekend as a guest we played some of those yesterday saying oh Hannity's responsible for\nThe violent actions arranged individual when in fact we have on this program we have for the last month and warning", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Show Low", "day": "30"}
