beach which is what I think the closest [noise] populated\nLandfall area could be but that's just my wild guess one thing about these storms are reporting a wins in a hundred and fifty miles an hour\nAnd they just showed a neighboring cities and what the wind gusts ... the highest wind gust right now around sixty four sixty five miles an hour in the Panama City Panama City beach area these one hundred and fifty miles an hour winds\nAre in the ... they are not the entire storm\nA I have not tried to to to minimize the impact here it's just that the reporting on these storms and the education on these storms in general is I think one thing it's lacking\nSuch as the way they colorized the graphics of these storms to make it look like hell on earth when any any hurricane the strongest wins are in the eye wall and a little\nYou know extended from it but there's not too many\nPlaces are going to get a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds today where am I wall hits and maybe twenty miles depending on the size of the I Will not from there it'll fall off nothing nothing\nI mean a hundred and twenty five is no slouch if you think that you've experienced Seventy five mile an hour winds well that's not bad like and it's the effect of a hundred and fifty versus other Seventy five months just not twice\nWhen you're in it if there is a multiplier effect\nOf massive wind speed so that if if the fastest the highest winds you've been an is Seventy five miles an hour and you think OK a cat for its gonna doubled his it won't it on the ground miles per hour it is but the impact of\nA hundred and fifty mile an hour winds versus Seventy five the just the destructive capability alone is a factor of three or four\nOr five hundred and fifty miles an hour is dead serious that that's where the storm surge will be or the worst of it\nThe further you get from the high of depending on the structure the the more the wind speed decreases the rainfall pretty consistent throughout a much larger area of the storm but the devastating the worst when the storm\n\nAre only in the eye wall area and people can look at these storms and the graphics wow hundred and fifty miles an hour winds all that's all I met a whole return it now it is not trying to downplay the or the damage I've just I've learned all this uh we live in hurricane alley here\nAnd every time one of these things I moved here in Nineteen Ninety seven and I quickly became a consumer hurricane expert I became an expert in how to interpret and watch the media I became an expert in how to analyze the graphics that they use\nAnd I became an expert in where the actual worst damage of a hurricane is you do not want to get a direct hit\nEverybody well yeah of course Russia everybody knows that yeah but but outside the direct hit the damage or the strength of the of the hurricane diminishes quite a bit\n\nIt's always the direct hit that that is the most destructive and then it it starts to decline as you get away from me I depending upon the strength of the storm is going to have a wide destructive swat as a as a category for\nA here's Governor Scott of Florida this was this morning a press conference

on the force of wind versus when the speed remember the force of the when it does not double as wind speeds do the forests increases and a much greater rate and there was a formula that the scientists have developed\nThe force of wins goes up as\nA square of speed so two times if you if you've got thirty mile an hour wins that all of a sudden becomes sixty the force of that is is um\n... would be

these tornados as as a storm winds down in the lower levels still very strong in the upper levels so what happens is that discrepancy creates these border see these\nOnes that twos and so you get these higher costs with that and you have tornadoes it wouldn't be surprised if there are a couple of dozen ... NATO's tonight into tomorrow in the area south east and and so so the rainfall I'm Sorry I'm I'm you know just found this information now it's like there's so much coming in like you\nCan't get it out here are the rainfall three to six locally wealth inches off from a from where we are in Georgia as far in Georgia now but through South Carolina to North Carolina and a lot of that area that was devastated by Florence or the coastal areas\nProbably aren't going to get it as bad they are going to get pretty strong wind gust in there but this is just the inland until we get to Elizabeth City and you folks in tide waters\nVery like tomorrow night and on the friday morning you're going to get north winds coming in their sixty Seventy miles an hour right now in Chesapeake Bay because it's just reaches the coast\nAnd those same professional affects them talking about overland diminish the storm all wrapped back up again and then go out to sea and stay ... there'll be a nor'easter from a deep sea to Boston\nTell me because I really what ... what are the areas that that may have a tornado activity exactly so people can make preparations and be ready\nWell south in in the south and east of a path let's say from Columbus, Georgia or to Greenville Spartanburg I think ah to Raleigh Durham to the top quarter of Virginia you live south of needs to that path and the further south east to go\nThe more the more you have to watch out for that you're going to see tornado watches and warnings be put into effect in those areas and\nAh over the next several hours I Believe they'll start putting that out of putting that out there if they haven't already I'm sure this tornado watches up now I'm just trying to look at the forecast map going forward to tomorrow and on into fought it\nYeah All right now I Want to just go through this very very slowly it's about thirty miles inland now as it is it pounded hard the the panhandle of Florida and it's now moving northeast\nAnd as it moves north east it's going to burst hit Macon Georgia hundred hundred and twenty mile an hour winds possible for their uh through a gun on\nA hundred mile a hundred a hundred and twenty southwest

in the sense is two thousand and two all over again except lily\nLily which was the big hurricane in the Gulf it a little bit earlier in Louisiana and October but we had all the warm weather in September and October\nThis is pointing the way believe it or not\nThis is the pattern recognition toward the winter season which I think it's going to be a big winter for much of the United states this year there's certain types of patterns is set up so it's going to get much much cooler across the eastern part of the United states in the wake of this storm\nThat will then establish it we may see something that tries to develop but stay or most likely stay offshore before it's all said and done but impacts dorms on the United states\nThis is the last one in my opinion\nJob to start a

to stay or go a thank you for being with us we really appreciate it will go back to you later Oh thank you for having me showing\nAll right eight hundred nine pool when Sean if you want to be a part of the program there is a really disturbing piece on the law and crime website it's Dan Abrams website That's a sister website the media I ate\nAnd ate chronicled the FBI Director who's testifying today on Capitol Hill and he was asked by Senator Rand Paul whether President Trump was still being wiretapped by any government intelligence agency\nNow you would think the answer is Oh absolutely not but that's not the answer his answer was not exactly reassuring\nNow the FBI Director Chris Wray declined to actually answer that question as to whether or not the FBI the national Security Agency is currently collecting phone conversations with President Trump\nAnd during a Senate committee hearing on national security issues Senator Paul asked do you think it's possible that the president's conversations with international leaders remember when he was first in office they were leaking conversations with the president of Mexico the prime minister of Australia I mean that's never happened before\nAnyway he was asking whether it was possible to ... the president's conversations with international leaders are\nYou know in the foreign intelligence surveillance a Surveillance Act database\nAnd raise response was well I'm not sure there's anything I can speak to in this setting\nWell then Senator Paul continued do you think it's possible that Congress members of Congress or in the ... the database of we talked to international leaders\nAnd then re deflected again is that most senator I'm quite confident that we're conducting ourselves in a manner consistent with the law in the constitution a that's a subject to extend civil oversight\nI don't know that I can speak to every hypothetical about whether there have been such situations and then Rand Paul as director re whether journalists conversations were being possibly scooped up\nBy the intelligence communities vast spying apparatus simply because they write stories about people with\nSay a terrorist naming them and re declined the answer again I Can't speak to specific hypothetical\nOr that point Rand Paul cut the FBI Director often said the answer is yes\nAnd as this time with ray was drawing to a close he spoke about the potential abuse within the Pfizer system and Rand Paul is absolutely right he said you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is as James Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that is why we asked you to get a warrant the information you gathered in foreign database is not\nConstitutional and the sense that had gathered with no bar there is no warrant there is no constitutional matter to that data and yet you're going to use it\nOn a domestic crime that has been our complaint for years and years and years and I got to admit after nine eleven\nAnd our complaint for years and years and years and I got to admit\nAfter nine eleven I thought there was a great idea\nNever having any any belief that it was possible as naive as I guess I was that we would have government officials at the top upper echelons within the intel community the FBI and the de OJ\nThat would literally be weaponized thing the powerful tools of intelligence that we give them to protect we the people\nAnd I never in my lifetime thought that a political candidate him put together a flimsy ...\nWith Russian sources and it becomes the basis for Pfizer Warren application but not one for\nThe original application in three subsequent applications and that the bulk of the information was bought and paid for by one political candidate to use against another candidate and that it was never verified a corroborated but still present it to a ... court and they purposely don't tell the ... the court judges\nThat the other candidate paid for this and that they never verified it bites wearing you know we'll get into this you know with chairman Mark Meadows the Freedom Caucus and Jim Jordan later I mean think about that\nThis is what we do we have a constitution for reason there's a reason why you need a warrant there's a reason why you have to present credible evidence to a court to get a warrant the bar is even higher when it comes to a fight the surveillance warrant\nAnd what has happened here is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal ever\nNow we've got three people on record saying that Rod Rosenstein well he has a plan hatched to surreptitiously record the president the hopes that they can invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment",
