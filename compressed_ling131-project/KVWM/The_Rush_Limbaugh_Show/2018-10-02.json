their problem it's their issue let them handle it but now the New York times and the Washington Post the rest of the drive by claiming but White House is calling the shots behind the scenes and expanding\nThe scope of the FBI's inquiry\nMade this point yesterday New York times could not wait to run the story White House expanding inquiry it came the same day we had a leak from Fox News that the FBI said they're ready to wrap up today a lot of people reacting to that by the way now I have an article here at the hill dot com\nThat says the White House's denying everything that they're denying that they're calling the shots of their denying expanding the scope and Trump did not expand the sculpture simply reacted at a rally to what the media is saying\n\nYou got a little suckered in by NBC News reporting a bunch of fake news the White House was limiting the scope drums I'm not limiting anything that became White House expands scope which is what the Democrats\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and hasn't found any but he's still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if\nSomebody doesn't stand up and stop this somebody\nOn the Senate Judiciary committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start\nBashing for the investigation that's taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh somebody needs to speak up for somebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they have been thorough and they haven't found anything or he wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals but that's not happening\nWell but it is now late yesterday afternoon in the Senate floor here is the turtle\nOn top of the six ... investigation of judge Kevin all Democrats demanded a supplemental investigation\nIf you listen carefully Mr President you can practically hear the sound of the Democrats moving the goalposts\nWhat their goal I've moved on to I don't know the old run the same all the time for adults to land on structure has come to a close cabinet nominations out of committee were considering it here on the floor and Mr President will be voting\nThis way late yesterday afternoon Mitch McConnell on the floor in the Senate and he got so much support for what he did yesterday amazing\nHow that happens isn't he heard from so many people what a great thing he went out and he did it again he went out there again and he recycle the old Bill Clinton aligned to boot here's McConnell's from just a couple of hours ago\nWhen judge Kavanaugh demonstrated is widely acknowledged really an open minded enough in college ... confirmation hearings some chose a darker rode the politics of personal destruction were willfully only\nAfter the FBI shares what they found centers will have the opportunity to vote will have the opportunity to vote no on the politics of personal destruction will have the opportunity to vote yes on this foreign nominate\nThat doesn't even touch what he did he went out there and he he didn't call these guys up by name but he quoted\nSome of the most outrageous why is that Democrats have been telling including members of the Judiciary Committee he pointed out their hypocrisy he pointed out their prevent like Keisha does he pointed out their straight up and not live it was so good that it forced chunk you assume or to go to the Florida we bought it\nAnd choke you went out there and tried to make chicken salad at when it was it was it was incredible listening to Chuck you I Believe Christine she was eminently credible judge Kavanaugh is not in the other way around\nWe have a life time of investigation of Brett Kavanaugh folks\nThere have been six now seven FBI investigations background checks\nWe have had more people looking into every nook and cranny and Brett Kavanaugh is life and we haven't even began to look at hers\n\nWere just assuming she's credible because that's the Democrats position on\nThis\nThat they can go back and they can look at the anything Kevin ... done but she is off limits for something we can go and find out what she did it although beach parties we can't go out and find out what she did when she was out there skiing\nAnd surfing and flying around and do we [laughter] none of that's been done and yet she is credible and he isn't\nAnd now die by

his\nAge Tuesday not the tank and ah [noise] it's what everybody agreed to\nOh by the way you don't look like us I'm not saying this guy flake\nThere is a part of me to think that he was in on this from the get go I there's a part of me thinks that he was not scared to death when he got harassed in protest that an elevator there's part of me thinks he because he hates Trump and that's what all this really is all of this is aimed at people eating Trump and Kevin ... and the way\nIn order to get Trump they gotta get Kevin on the lake is out there saying you know what I um I I\nAm Kevin lost two part is with me I don't think we need other like wait a minute you said you were going to vote for him friday morning flake\nAnd then you did\nSlager voted for Capitol after claiming was going to vote for him now he's on the east to part isn't for me I I don't but I don't want that on the court I don't think we can do that\n\nFlake is demonstrating that his name is actually an apt to an apt description of his personality and now here's\nFeinstein he wanted a week and one of the week everybody agreed to all week as predicted by me and many others within hours of agreeing to one week the Democrats not long enough and here's die if I take this from the top again senator died five what a floor vote friday beat to ...\nI Believe it is I Believe it's just\nIt's Tuesday and um we used to put all the facts together yeah we have and this is\nI guess it's fine tense Supreme Court\nTax together yeah we have and this is\nA I guess it's by tense Supreme Court hearing that I sat on and

Obama people are still monitoring this program and I'm just going to tell you I I\nI'm not surprised I'm I I did not predict this but I wondered if somebody was going to notice what I did yesterday here's Craig Melvin host setting up Britain with the question\nLet me ask you really quickly here Mr burglar about his Washington Post article today the writer has come alive with the passion differences\nOf covered on raising base talk radio host Rush Limbaugh has at least a torrent of criticism over the years which is his roof last week on militant feminism these women are angry Limbaugh said something has happened to them in their lives\nAnd rage and anger they pick it up now on the country or all men or men and the powerful majority which\nHe could out now in the country all all men or men in a powerful majority which is white\nChristian man and so forth again that's a quote from Rush Limbaugh thoughts broke I was sort of some Rush Limbaugh yesterday and what I noticed about his show is that he actually started with a half an hour about trade before getting into the Kavanaugh stuff and it made me feel like maybe the some of the energy was gone I\nAm so happy somebody noticed that\nNow if you were listening yesterday you know why I did it because I told your why I did it I told your why I opened with NAFTA\nAnd I'll repeat myself again we started out by pointing out Trump it down to thirty to forty five minutes ceremony announcing NAFTA in the rose garden any at all the people that have helped make it happen there\nAnd I pointed out that this is something that the press is going to I mean they're they're in attendance but all they want to ask Trump about his cabinet they're not asking about NAFTA they're going to look past it because to them it isn't any big deal it's trade did what they're missing it again this is a seminal Trump campaign issue\nSomething that he promised something that he committed to doing and came through in then and he got rid of NAFTA\nAnd I knew that if I did not opened the program talking about it we wouldn't talk about it because it would be swept away by the Kavanaugh stuff so I as I told you yesterday opened with it to make sure that we discussed it here and to make sure you in this audience heard the discussion and realize the importance on it\nShe tweeted look after this this chorus of entitled white men
