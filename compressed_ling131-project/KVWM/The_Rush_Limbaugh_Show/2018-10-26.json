Ken this is what is being reported\nIn a number of different publications now I just I just want to caution you that since this is what's being reported first impressions are now being registered by people as they hear all of this I Am reporting it to you\nUnder guidance telling you I I just tell you what I'm finding in uh in various publications that are that are floating around there has been a a mad kept desire to id who ever was sending these bombs as a Trump supporter\nA all week long and they have not waited they are they're\nMoving at light speed to make this association such as in this headlines suspected make America great again bomber ID as Native American Trump supporters things are ... or say oc\nA fifty six [noise] so [noise]\nThere is and they still have this this one I'm Still trying to figure out somebody sent me this screen shot of a website that list is party as the Green Party which doesn't jibe with any of this\nI mean the Green Party would be all in on CNN the Green Party would be all in on a a bunch of things that are anti Trump so some of this that we are being sent and seeing doesn't make\nA whole lot of sense so we're still in the process of trying to track it all down\nNow in the midst of this there continues to be news reported about the mid term elections and there's some other news that was reported to discuss about the bombs before today when people were told the identity of the bomber in showing pictures of the bombers a van\nA down in in uh in plantation Florida and one of the\nThings that I had intended to share with you today is Chuck Todd was on the MSNBC yesterday we every audio I lifted the ban on MSNBC to report this that Chuck Todd said that he was afraid the Russians were behind this scare\n\nChuck Todd said that he theory the Russians couldn't be responsible for the mail bomb scare of that has targeted top officials in the Democratic party as well as CNN and Robert De Niro quote I have this fear it could be some Russian operation out there are designed to do what's happening now and\nThat is so all of this\nConfusion Chuck\nTodd added that we shouldn't rule out the possibility the Russians are behind this and the mail bomb scare is dividing the country\nAnd that's what its purpose is this was on his show called meet the press daily\nNow I the reason that I [laughter] the Russians what is not worry about that is that here you have the moderator of meet the press ap Chuck Todd\nWho believes despite the fact that we haven't seen any evidence despite the fact that there isn't any evidence Chuck Todd still operating under the belief the Russians stole the two thousand sixty election\nSomebody whose mind may be closed and made up about something that did not happen and and and in fact the exact opposite is what happens is we all know Hillary and her team\nWere doing the ... with Russia but that doesn't matter the director of the moderator of meet the press\nLike the Russians could be behind it because it\nThe deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation\nDesigned to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and hates the left\nIn fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years\nI mean I like I said rush three years ago I would've said I'm Crazy I mean I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't I mean you're talking about some very high profile people being in a lot of trouble\nTheoretical actual events eventually the gears of justice Ryan slowly but you'd like to believe that actually\nSome of these people are going to pay for what they've done\nWell wait a minute but why why isn't that happening now the Republicans around the house of representatives now why do why do they have to win it again in order to conduct these investigations\nThat Jim Jordan says are coming up\nI think Trump will have more to do with pushing it forward once these elections are over I think there are deep state people on the Republican side who helps slow robust thing I really do\nI think Trump will be the one ram routing it once he's a lecturer over if he gets the big win because this will be a mandate about him if they really\nSort of just a moment we'll let's discuss it you'd think Trump is essentially on the ballot\nIn in this election there is no wrong answer who don't don't miss don't misunderstand my tone I'm trying to learn what you think you you'd think that Trump is essentially on the ballot that this these midterm elections in part or maybe ... close in Toto are a referendum on Trump\nNo doubt about it and look at the effect he's having when he goes in and campaigns for people in the states that was supposed to be such trouble for the Republicans I think he's definitely I think these people on the left think this is going to be their big moment where they finally jam it to this guy and get all their investigation started I think they think this is the beginning of the African I\nWill do something with that I was I was reading a a tech blogs yesterday and folks I really appreciate you indulge me talking about this it's my hobby not keeping up with the blonde or has been keeping up with the\nTech and to keep up with the tech yeah have to read the stuff and it's\nAll written by a bunch of young millennial journalist\nAnd they have ever since election day two thousand sixteen they haven't been in various stages of panic and I I'm a ...\nThere was a reference in one of the tech blogs to a poll showing the red wave of the blue wave was not going to happen and it was not nearly as big and this particular blogger was in a mild to panic about it\nWriting about you know what we all have been thinking that what happened in two thousand sixty and was an odd confluence of events that that gave us a one off result it's not really representative of America that Donald Trump and these Republicans is not who we are\nAnd then the guy says\nBut if the Republicans hold the house of representatives we're gonna have to come to grips with this is who we are and that we are not running the show in truth\nAnd it was it was um it was like I wouldn't say there was panic and ended up reading the written word but it's slowly dawning on some people ... the last two years they have live with the belief\nThat what happened in two thousand sixteen was unusual irregular a one off that it shouldn't have happened it was an odd confluence of events of bad candidate with\nHillary Clinton and so forth over confidence by people on the left but that um people have been waiting every day for these two years to fix this mistake and the Democrats are going to storm the ballot boxes on Tuesday\nIn November and correct dismissing now they're starting\nTo begin to quite maybe this is not an oddity maybe maybe we're not the majority and it kind of dovetails with what you're saying here do you believe for example that a Trump voters and Republican voters right now are actually losing momentum to vote because of his mom's\nNow go rush can I share something with you here I went yeah Trump rally I went out a Trump rally two weeks ago it was an I was in Council Bluffs right across the river and I think the uh mid America center seats for this event was seeding like twelve thousand\nI'm not exaggerating there had to have been twenty five thousand people outside there in that line\nThere were more women than there were men and women working Americans and they were nice people but I'm telling you there were a lot of these protesters\nAnd my instinct was I Want to say something to these protesters one I got down there\nLike me and many other people we don't want to start trouble with that and it's like we don't have the inclination to getting their faces an act like they do and so many of these Trump supporters are not the kinds of people that are wearing it on their sleeves right now they're just going to go in and phone how how could you vote against the guy is doing such wonderful things for the country I mean he really is\nAnd I think a lot of those people are just going to go in there and they're going to vote because they now realize that they got the momentum on their side but they're not the kinds of people that are out there wearing it on their sleeves like these crazy radical leftists are all doing\nWell it is it is a ... it's it's standard old conventional wisdom thinking that people voting impulses\nOld conventional wisdom thinking that people voting impulses or energy or desires ebb and flow like this\nI mean the idea that uh this week a bomb scare stories can dampen in ... I I I don't I don't think that describes the average Trump voter I think the average Trump voter is immune\nTo all of that and more made I think more than the average Trump voter I I I don't think they have to be told how important the election is I don't think they have to be reminded to vote I don't think they need to be told the stakes\nAnd yet there are people that\nContinued you got to drive turnout Russia got to tell people how important is because I think they already know I I'm I'm\nI don't sense that there is a usual lessening of enthusiasm or a gaming of enthusiasm based on the ebb and flow of news I think people understand how important it is it was it's as important now is it wasn't too thousand sixteen\nIn fact it may even be more important now that Trump is in office and policies have been in that in the idea of this stuff needs to continue or maybe more important like Trump said at one of his rallies I can ... the rally in Houston\nHe was talking about how he he produced he's got he's got a track record now is it\nTwo years ago on the campaign I was saying we're going to do this we're going to be great again and we're going to stop this are going to make a trade deals better but back\nThen it was just words he said was just words but now two years later I produced meeting is not just words it's real now and I think Trump's supporters understand this I I just think they're immune to the um uh attempts\nThat are made elsewhere to just spirit them a or to somehow weaken their enthusiasm so we'll see a it won't be long haired Jimmy I'm Glad you called thanks for the extended time we'll be back after that he doesn't olfactory\nWe do know Russia I be myth were\nYour brain is an amazing thing as you get older naturally begin to change and causing a lack of ... or even trouble with recall thankfully\nThe breakthrough in private and helps your brain and actually improve memory the secret is an ingredient originally discovered in jellyfish in clinical trials Savage and has been shown to improve short term memory\nCriminal Jim healthier brain better life right now they live on stories everywhere\nStatement has not been evaluated by the FDA this product is not intended to treat children or prevent any disease\nWas this comment by fed chairman Jerome Powell where he said interest rates were still accommodate if the fed will gradually move them to neutral and then he said quote they may go past neutral\n... thesis has been that the fed would be careful to slow down the program of rising rates if the economy starts to react negatively while we still believe this is the case is comment about going past neutral has market participants wondering if in fact the because the economy to slow down or even turned to a recession\nAny other drivers worth noting\nEarlier this year markets have been supportive but what are called animal spirits and that's really about positive sentiment with increased volatility that impacts animal spirits ... were actively engaged with clients as we work with them through this volatility\nThanks Michael your path through investment advice starts with your steeple financial advisor by yours at ... dot com that's S C I F ... dot com steeple Nicholas in company incorporated ...
