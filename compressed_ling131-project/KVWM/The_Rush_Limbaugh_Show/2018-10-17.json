he's damaging the media because he used to be unable\nYou ever heard of a drive by is worrying about too much access ... actually you know what they don't have that well they do have access Trump stops in talks to them wherever he sees a pack of them gathered\nNow he may not accept every interview request which they would define as as access but they cannot say that Trump is hiding from them like Obama did an Obama wasn't hiding he just thought the media wasn't much pack rats that he didn't he didn't want it to send to their level I mean he knew they were on his side\nBut he knew that they were fools he knew that he owns them he knew that he had the media wrapped around his little finger they thought Obama loved them\nMany many races and I will say that we have a very big impact I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact that I'm having they would say that in the old days and if you got the support of a president or if you got the support or somebody it would be nice to have but it meant nothing zero like literally zero\nWell some of the people live indoors to have gone up forty and fifty points just on the endorsement in nowhere in that statement does Donald

believe you better responses but no\nI think I'm helping people that becomes a headline Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame of GOP loses house now the eight people tell you what oh that's

pay\nHe thinks he's helping people he thinks he is helping secure victory but it's not even in his mind that they're going to lose and somebody's going to blame him\nThis is why Trump never\nMisses an

of\nMedia uh anybody complaining\nDuring too much media deal like it\nLike it I like getting the point across I've heard you say many times that the economy isn't covered properly and it's not that the economy's not covered properly by these so called mainstream media and it isn't ah we went up almost six hundred points yesterday and they didn't even have it on the major news you couldn't find it anywhere in\nThe economy is doing probably better than it's ever done in history and they don't even talk about it and that's because they have their opinion and they'd like to keep their opinion going the way they have it they do not treat us fairly and therefore if I Do the news they all want me on the news so I can talk about myself\nAnd what about the your tweets and so for these people say we don't want any more tweets anybody ever tried to tell you stopped waiting oh\nAnd I don't think I'd be talking to you if I did that that's a way of getting out the message look we're fake news

being reported\nOr you go it's that simple he's the only way to get his message out he's not going to stop the loves it and the fact that they're getting frustrated than it is CNN's media\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waiting to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end\nThis because his report goal is to Rosenstein\nWho is technically is boss the department of justice and to Congress and there is deciding whether or not\nThat it is made public so if the Democrats do when the house\nThey're going to insist that Muller not conclude the investigate particularly if he hasn't found any collusion of the Democrats win the house they're going to tell them that we got time\nMan we can all the time in the world keep Yangon\nWe don't need to report right now we already won the house and we didn't mean your report so you keep digging\nHint hint you keep dig until you find that proof ...\nMeaning since we're on the show you're not going to need any proof all you need to do is highly speculate that had happened we'll take care of the rest that's going to be the Democratic message if they win the house if the Republicans when the house\nWhile

there's no reason for Mahler to say for anybody to leak that he's ready to deliver a key findings\nNo reason to do that other than to have been used as a change agent in the upcoming midterms\n\nSpecifically Muller is close around during judgment on it to the most explosive aspects of his inquiry\nWhether they ever clear incidence of collusion between Russia and ... [laughter] believe me that one of ... long ago there isn't any of that and the second thing is whether the president took any action as it comes to the obstruction of justice\nAnd Bloomberg goes on to say some things that make it look like they're pretending that there's even more being investigated besides collusion an obstruction but there isn't [noise] then they say there's the question of timing is critical mothers work won't be concluded a head of the midterm elections when Democrats hope to take control the house\nAnd and Trump's one party hold on watching it but this time line raises questions about the future of the pro it sells ... single he may replace Jeff Sessions after the election a move that could bring in a new boss for Muller Rosenstein might also resign or be fired by the time up after the election but you notice here\nMueller's work won't be included a head on November six mid term elections when Democrats hope to take control that nobody\nEvery news story is written from the perspective of its impact on the Democrats\nOther words his work won't be concluded ahead of them November six mid term elections when Republicans corn maintain control about no we never think of writing that\nThis is out there to create the illusion that Mueller has been gardens\nAnd it's only a matter of time before the world is officially told at Trump loaded that's what they hope to create with this\nAnd the media will be helping and it will all the impact votes and again if there was gonna be this gigantic blue wave that was not in doubt why would any of this would be necessary let me take a break what's what's next in the ...

they're wearing says I'm confident not over confident\nYou asked me today well but I Do differently in terms of Democrats would target Latinos I Would talk to millennials\nOkay so what would she do differently\nShe's saying here that Democrats are dropping the ball with Latinos why is she saying that\nWell because she has the freedom to say it she's not at the moment in the in the hierarchy of the apparatus and it turns out the Latino Z are far more supportive of Trump at Republicans than anybody know according to recent polling data\nThat Democrats are done at the number of Latino those that are signing on with Republicans and Trump the reason they're stunned just because they believe that all Latino is\nShould despise anybody who is anti illegal immigration or wants to build a wall the millennial thing I think what that's about as voter turnout and she mentions it here everybody talks about the millennials and young people and young people that it just it never ceases\nTo be the case that election day they don't show up\nThey don't show up in the numbers everybody thinks they're going to show up in\nAn every cycle this plays out every cycle we're told the youth vote is fired up this time Mr Limbaugh the youth vote their energetic they're energized they are motivated this is a new day they can't wait and then\nSame old thing happens they don't show up in the numbers that everybody expects them to she's suggesting that that may be the case here the Democrats available light a fire\nUnder the Latino thing bothered them and what the Latino thing what that actually stands

registering voters in prison they've been registering voters at the DMV they've been registering voters at the at the at the at the medical marijuana places they've been registering voters everywhere how in the world is it possible\nThat democratic voter registration levels at the same as past cycles the Democrats have been telling us that there's so much energy there is so much excitement there are so much motivation there's so much inspiration that nothing can hold them back and\nYet and yet the generic ballot once again is showing that this massive Democrat blue wave is not as big as once

there's anything in it on obstruction because folks in one of the week they're sixteen never Trump anti Trump hate mongers on Mueller's team if they had the guns yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to get one T a blue wave\nIf mother doesn't have any of that there is no way they want this released before the midterms that's why\nThey're linking the mall or has it ready they're going to try to take advantage of what they can make\nPeople think the report says every member they have two years no more than that and a two and a half years of any reporting that Trump and Russia colluded\nSo in their minds they're probably thinking a sizable number of American voters believe the Trump Russia collusion happens so Mueller's report is ready\nTo be released soon create the impression that it's only a matter of time no before Trump is tied to the Russians were collusion and use that way to impact\nVoting in turn out prior to the midterms I'm just going to

doesn't have this evidence and will not lead President Trump being indicted on that basis what does that do to turn out\n\nNow don't misunderstand I think Mueller's report whatever it is released is going to really be targeted at\nTrump as an incompetent as a boob who are in danger to the United states electoral system\nWith his hires and with some of the people on the staff like Carter Page I think they're going to fire both barrels at Trump as an incompetent who nearly brought the world to nuclear Armageddon\nBecause of his incompetence and stupidity\nBut I don't think there's gonna be

ah ah sixteen years\nWell I don't think that the media is right now focused on separating Trump from his voters I think they they know that's too late I don't think that's what their objective here in the midterms is\nUm I think they're very frustrated they haven't been able to and if they could they would the icing on the cake I think their primary objective now is to flood the zone with anti Trump voters\nDemocrats made up of every disparate coalition group you can find they are trying to assemble this gigantic Democrat Party and then there's like\nCombination coalition of minority here minority that just constant Adam altogether and get a big majority party and that's that's where they're trying to generate the turnout\nUm\nBecause they know they're not going to distance Trump from uh from his voters\nSo the the focus I think is on ... up a\nFirst time participation\nUm and that's why this this is Suzie as the thing is so important and the inspiration stuff in the anger is so that's why I think\nThat they have strategic may become the party of anger I think they are using this anger and they are exploiting it to generate turnout\nBased on what they think is the majority of Americans don't hate ...\nI I think they they move past the idea that there's a bunch of Trump voters that regret it and can be inspired to show up and vote Democrat as I say if they can make that happen to be icing on the cake I think you can see the frustration in them every day you can see the frustration in\nPerusing the news as I Do more and more stories that are starting to raise red flags about the blue wave and\nThere are some big brush them ... during this on purpose they're sucking you when they're making you think you're given up they're making you think they're trying to despair or you know trying to make you think you got it in a bag\nNo they're not going to ever pull that off not here not with me\nBut I don't think that's the case either I I don't think that they are when they have that much discipline to be able to have media wide threw out the entire left wing media universe\nA disciplined approach to runs fake stories about the blue wave not happening I think it's a legit I've never I've never believed there was gonna be a blue wave\nI never have\nI'm willing to put that out there and that if if I end up being wrong so be it\nI'm not afraid of being wrong it doesn't happen enough times for me to be worried about it but it's this I have never thought because common sense does not suggest that like I said yesterday where is the evidence that Democrats\nHave been able to put together a winning coalitions and flooded the elections in when outside of areas they dominate like New York Los Angeles San Francisco Chicago they had been losing elections they had been losing seats left and right starting in two thousand ten that hasn't reversed\nThey didn't win with the cabinet thing they haven't won with anything trying to get rid of Trump they haven't been able to stop Trump on even they're stupid travel uh order the layers using the judge is Trump is succeeding implementing his agenda there's some things he hasn't been able to do like the total repeal of Obamacare\nBut they have not been able if you you would think if all of the things were true of nine people hate Trump regret their votes a wish it had never happened regret that Trump is ... ... ... ... wouldn't be getting anywhere near done what he's getting done there'd be universal opposition to it if the Democrats are right about all\nThis but they're not write about it I I I the evidence on the ground isn't there that there is a blue wave waiting to happen there is evidence all over the place the Democrats are Ross didn't fit to be tied over the fact that they're
