[noise]\nAnyway telephone number is eight hundred to eight two to eight eight to ... I've been reminded here one thing to keep\nIn mind folks when when you hear any leftist talking about whiteness are white privilege what that translates to his power remember what the Americans left is and it really serves to understand this\nThe American left today despise us America as founded and this may be a bit of a simplification but I Do this in order to communicate and be understood\n\nAnd it's very s in the modern day American Left as taught and educated over the past two generations through middle school high school and college has been taught to hate America because America is unjust from our founding days because it was founded by white men\nAnd white\nMen found a place for themselves and exploded everybody else and everybody else has been getting the short end of the stick for over two hundred plus years\nAnd only now\nIs the awareness insensitivity to this day and realized only now are the victims of this white privilege of this white power only now are they standing up and demanded to be hurt only now are there are rising up in a righteous indignation and demanding fairness and redress\nAnd the only way that can happen is for the white power structure white privilege\nTo be destroyed and replaced by a coalition of all of those who have been victimized\nSegregated punished\nMistreated abused or what have you Byron them reclaiming or not reclaiming but claiming what his just lay there\nAnd that is America and its political systems and that's what young people have been taught and now as as evidenced by that column I wrote by read by Alexis Grinnell or any other of these militant feminists militant leftist\nIt is essentially the product of\nThe classroom and the campus which is now grown up and move toward and become the quote unquote main stream of the Democratic party\nThis angry agitated\nBase of people that spans the sum total of every day in a permanent state of range and anger\nIt has to be forced and of course for that to work for the use of force to be at work you have to have to it\nYou have to camp to the bullying which has happened on gay marriage it's happened on transgender bathroom issues it's happened not\nEvery oddball leftist cultural demand out there they count on everybody taping they count on everybody's suing for peace until Donald Trump came along\nDonald Trump doesn't cave doesn't sue for peace and he doesn't power to them he calls them out\nIt makes perfect sense they would despise Donald Trump would make perfect sense if they feared Donald Trump it makes perfect sense that they have him\nHe refuses to play ball\n\n[noise] look at what they've attempted to force while I'm On the country this whole Russian collusion thing Trump Russia collusion that's a classic almost ration of the left attempting to force\nWhat they want people to thing happen on the American people using everything in their arsenal they have the media they have the deep state\n\nThey had never Trump or his on the Republican side they had all kinds of allies and a special counsel with an unlimited\nBudget sixteen or Seventeen Trump hazing lawyers slash investigators and still nothing\nBecause there has been pushed back when there is push back on the left they will fail they can fail they have gotten the costs\nBack on the left they will fail they can fail\nThey have gotten accustomed to there being no pushback they've gotten accustomed to Republicans being afraid of them and afraid of the media\n\nAnd it's this push back Trump having the audacity to run the audacity to win then the audacity to actually do what he said he was going to do in order defiance of all these people\n\nIt's rendering them on balanced and insane by the way Paul ... who writes columns at the New York post and other

that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sun is in a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this you wouldn't miss\nWhat is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the allegation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there's no evidence\nAdds to the fact that the allegation is likely to what happened\nBecause that's what men do be cause\nMan can\nAnd men can because they have the genitalia necessary\nTo do it I don't know if you're an average ordinary decent woman watching this stuff how in the world you want to sign onto that well you don't\nAnd so now these leftist women are in raised when they have discovered that they failed to persuade\nA bunch of average ordinary white women to join their cause anti Kevin Ball so now these women are sellouts\nAnd their ... says are sellouts and their rooms are cello and they're selling out to the patriarchy and as such they become worthless and even the liability to the point now that here we have a soundbite with two women experts in gender studies saying\nDo we need white women it's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask let me remind you in November of two thousand eleven the Obama presidential campaign this was written about by a Thomas and so all in the Washington Post\nMight have been in New York Times on nouns\nThat they were for going the white working class as a voting bloc and instead we're going to put together a winning coalition of us sum total of every\nMinority group they can find they were going to combine all these minority groups and make that the Democrat base\nBecause white working class voters were becoming less and less dependable because they weren't buying Obama an Obamacare and
