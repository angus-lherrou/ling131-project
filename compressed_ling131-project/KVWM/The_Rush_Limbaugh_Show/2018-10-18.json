that there's an entire political party\nTo whom the news you just mentioned is bad\nIt makes them and they're angry about it they're trying to suppress this they they're not\nHappy with good economic

not happy\nThat more people are working there they're not happy the economy is growing to the point of absorbing all the new people that want jobs so why your fans who in the world could be unhappy by this who could be made unhappy\nBy this the answer is very clear\nI don't want to give it all the way but I told him that I think whatever arguments we're having here they are still all circling and focused on the age old argument between conservative and liberalism and that is the role of government and people's lives\nAnd the answer to why people on the left are unhappy at great economic news is because they can't claim credit for it and it threatens their whole existence where in people are not capable of this and need to vote Democrat to basically live\nThey need to vote Democrat need to continue to vote Democrat because only the government can provide for people only the government can protect people against injustice discrimination and so\nAs as looney tunes isn't as the Democratic

themselves get jobs improve their lives\nJust the fact that Democrat Party gets mad is that is all anybody on the need to know but at the same token new instances of polio and the Democratic party's not upset about it new instances of diseases breaking out we've already cured and they're not concerned about it\nBecause it is harmful if anybody makes the connection\nHow anybody can say the
