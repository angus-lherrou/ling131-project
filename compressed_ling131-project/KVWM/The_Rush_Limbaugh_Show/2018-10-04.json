{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KVWM", "content": "Numerous other say that President Trump mock Dr Ford in his rally south haven Mississippi earlier this week and then you suggested that the Trump knows what he's doing despite all the criticism he gets\nThat he is doing this it's who he is he can't help it\nIs just asked I think it's the other way round I think Trump knows exactly what he's doing I think Trump\nHas a behavioral patterns of strategic ... it's called pacing and really briefly explaining it again in setting up what's to come next\nWhen President Trump originally spoke about Dr Ford what did he say compelling testimony riveting he couldn't turn away from it if she's telling the truth Kavanaugh's gone he's got no prayer if Kavanaugh's wide and it's definitely gone Trump said all of this and everybody so wow this is really unusual for\n... no it's not unusual Trump gets himself on record\nNot every time but in many issues he gets himself on record in the approve the Washington establishment way and every time he does it do not some of you panic maybe you don't have any more\nBut when he first started doing this light Paris climate accord yeah yeah there may be something here we're going to look at it you don't always going to have oh no it doesn't matter you can remember countless times where the president's initial statement on an issue of seemed to dubbed tail with what the swamp things\nBut then a few days or are we go by him and the president's becomes who he is and he starts speaking out against it after he's put himself on the record he does this for credibility and he does it it's something called pacing\nAnd it relaxes the opposition\nIn any number of ways he's doing the same thing here with Dr Ford he knew right off the bat that she was saying things that nobody could corroborate that nobody can prove that she couldn't prove and what he did on Monday Night was not marker\n\nHe explained it to everybody\nThe truth about her\nEverybody because of what Trump did at that rally everybody was forced to look and listen to that little riff\nOn Dr forge shaky uncorroborated provable test them on the drive by us we're never gonna\nTell the truth about Dr Ford the drive buys were not able to ignore the rally they tried not even Fox televised Trump's rally but because\nHe said what he said about her he forced the drive biased to cover what he said in the process the drive buys reported what he said and people like Ben Sasse another started giving me the vapors gave me the neighbor who am I got Trump is always uses horrible visiting humane he's not fit what Donald Trump did\nRick counting the absurd inconsistencies in her testimony Donald Trump calling her out on everything has been play now on all media when all day yesterday\nReporters are now asking senators and the press secretary questions about it in the press briefing yesterday the fact is the drive by media did\n\nThe fact is the drive by media did not report the inaccuracies of Dr forge testimony that drive by media did not report on on the none of the cooperation being possible\nThey did not tell their audience is that the foreign people foreign place in the room when her incident happened claim they weren't there nobody knew that folks\nOther than you but people don't watch the mainstream media had no idea that Dr Ford couldn't backup what she was saying that people watch the mainstream media had no idea\nThat the four witnesses foreign claims were there all deny it and don't remember being there and one of them was one of our good friends Dr ... we're not reporting any of that the\nDrive buys were reporting what the Democrats senators I Believe her she is a credible witness as far as the American people who watch only mainstream media is concerned a woman was telling the truth the head back up she had cooperation and capital was guilty\nSo Trump goes out tells the truth about her\nShe doesn't know what she doesn't know when she doesn't know where she doesn't she got home she gets it on the record the drive by half to report it and for the first time in our lives people who watch mainstream media actually heard look at it this way sync up with the millions of people who had never heard\nThe trouble is about Dr\nChristine's Ford and her for the whole testimony think of a million just never heard it until\nTrump went out and characterize that for everybody think of it this way think of the thousands of voters in Missouri in Arizona\nIn Michigan and Maine and West Virginia North Dakota Alaska who now know the truth who never would've known the truth had Trump not\n\nDetailed it for people in his rally\n\nCollins mansion Heitkamp McCaskill flake Murkowski they knew\nThat there was no collaboration they know that there couldn't have been any truth to what she was saying by virtue of witnesses this is why Trump did it this is why Trump does what he does if we had an honest mediate millions of people will do what do you know that Dr Ford story doesn't add up\nIf the media everyone told the truth about this there wouldn't be any protests today are not nearly as large envelope in voluminous\nThe people these protests thinks she's telling the God's truth they think it's gospel they don't know that her story can't be backed up their media hasn't told him the Democratic senators haven't told them only Trump did another reason why they hate him\nBut we don't have an honest media and sold millions of people had no idea\nOf all the holes in the Christine balls the foreign story\nNow they do and here's a little cherry on top since Trump did that and the whole media reported on it and Democrats senators and the like we're asked about it what comes three days later today's f._b._i. report saying\nNo corroboration for what Dr Ford\nSaid so Trump says that\nPeople like Ben Sasse another never Trump has go literally insane but if Trump had in the Senate nobody would know what the Trump did say at millions now do know and here comes the cherry on the top the FBI report we couldn't find any cooperation for her story end of the week Trump was right\nDrive by media wrong Democrat senators wrong Ben Sasse wrong\n\nAnd Trump doesn't do this accidentally it's not like he's lucky and stumbles into this stuff this is Trump strategy and it's all related to the pacing\nOf how he originally or initially eventually I should say gets to his real thoughts on any issue brief time out now back with more\nThan we humans rush [laughter]\nNot Rush Limbaugh on TV

I don't think there's ever been a generic ballot poll ever that shows the Republicans\nI had I could be wrong I doubt it I don't recall ever having seen one\nWrong I doubt it I don't recall ever having seen one\nBut now we're seeing voter enthusiasm shifts\nTo the Republicans Democrats are are losing some and believe me if this all Israel at this polling data is accurate if it's the same stuff that Democrats are saying it's affecting\nThem then there's this from the Atlantic now the Atlantic is a left wing publication as is most us\nMedium\nThey headline but this story conservative women are angry about Kavanaugh and they think other voters are to\n\nHere's a quote in the two weeks since it claims against capital of first emerged many feminist groups\nHave called on senators and the American public to believe women who come forward with allegations Kamala Harris the progressive Democrats enter from California captured the sediment when she questioned for during the hearing I Believe you and I believe many Americans across the country believe you\nBut the writer of this story whose name is Anna Greenberg and they\nSaid the women I interviewed however raises them ten the notion that people's accusations should be believed on the basis of their identity alone\nThis makes me furious because I think that's taking advantage for the worst purposes of something that's real in our culture a woman said women are not a monolithic blocked most of us are not going to take to the streets with pitchforks and torches\nThat said there's a large large percentage of us who feel very very strongly about the way this process has played out conservative women are angry about Kavanaugh they think other voters are too\nConservative women living suburbs\nThe reason I ask that is because Democrats claimed to have a hold on college educated suburban women\nWell they may be losing that hold too if some of this polling data is correct let me just say this\nIf everything were just and it isn't and I know it but if everything were saying the Democrats would be destroying themselves right now\nAs they did back in two thousand two when they did the ... the Democrat Party\nIs in a same world the Democrat Party is engaging in self immolation right now\n\nWith the treatment of Kavanaugh\nThe backing of a woman who's got no evidence hasn't had a you have a corroborated and thanks that Donald Trump now more Americans than ever know the truth of her story\nAnd the truth of her story is that it's full of holes\nIf Trump had went on his rant going on his ran on Monday Night the dried buys would've never reported that because they had not reported\n\nThe Democrats are not the majority they did not win the Senate that when the house the advice and consent role does not give them the right to determine who goes on the court and who doesn't that's for the winters\nBut the the behavior to Democrats engaged in here the public political murder\nOf a highly achieved brilliant guy\nWho never did anything that anybody anywhere near the way he's been described\n\nPeople bringing forth B. S. allegations like this would be asked why isn't there no evidence to back it up\nIn a same world would be paying a price so so high they wouldn't even engage in this kind of behavior but the Democrats think they speak for a majority of Americans because they have the media on their side and they think\n\nThat they have succeeded in making the majority of Americans hate right Kavanaugh and hates conservatives and Republicans\nAs a as well where we don't live in a saying world you know we don't live at the same country right now but uh it's still possible for the Democrats to pay a huge huge price for this given the standard time tested American moral code\nAnd are sent and set of values the Democrats\nShould be halfway finished with their self destruction in the middle of this I take a break we'll be back in a minute don't go\nAnywhere with simply really tell me ER Mitt work you\nHave you been dreaming of that new kitchen bathroom or home edition but not sure how you can afford it I'm here with Gabby Maldonado one newsmakers she's cofounder of American\nFinancing so Gary how can American financing help homeowners pay for home renovations\nTo enter it simple it's by letting whom he you\nThink of it this way we're living in a red hot housing market and home equity if I was like Thirteen percent nationwide so now really is a great thing to make it home look at it and feel better about increasing your home's value\nAre listening to talk of giant nine Seventy show Seventy eighty ... service\nEnough or nothing to see here on the ...
