let's see if something else that by the way this is not a caravan folks this is this this is it's an invasion it is an invasion just like that which occurs every day and has been at the southern border for many many decades\n\nI mean it's it's an invasion that has so far lead to a minimum twelve million illegal aliens with the\nCountry and these incessant calls for amnesty for all of them but let's see what happens when they are supposedly a week out let's see if the organizers of this thing\nBegan to deny the members food and water let's see if the people behind this creating a

didn't do something\n\nThere is a hurricane coming that might oh well it's a perfect storm that couldn't be coming to fruition here\nThis is the ultimate October surprise that we're still trying to figure out who's behind this here's lonely Gohmert from Texas He was on today with Sandra Smith on Fox question what can you tell us what you're seeing the way the president's responding to this what are your thoughts as this mob makes its way of the water\nThe president made no bones about it and uh actually he can take his lead from the Democrats a Democrat and I'm Woodrow Wilson not one of my favorite presidents but and I think sixteen after ... gangs came across the border and New Mexico and killed a bunch of people\nNot only did he put Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's are going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and it needs to stop\nAnd Louis continued to\nClose the border you got to stop bogus asylum claims and basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from\nAnd also we need to remember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not married and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so ... El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim\nAnd Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps the they do I talk to the lawyer he'll talk about Jeff he's talking to Jeff and I won't even know who is part of who you're talking about\nJeff Sessions with Jeff Sessions of big buddies that means he's talked this actions about this but these are all great points they already qualified\nFor asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in afterwards gaping\nTheir own country\nAnd if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted\nAnd what leads me to believe that the primary mover is behind this\nAre the left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprises it's adventure waiting but I think this was the left behind it\nIt defies common sense to support this and frankly I don't\nThink they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nIs that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking them for generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point advantage that the American people realize their mistake electing trumpeter Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argued against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason\nThe two thousands actually midterms the American people were all of a sudden literate than all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't believe it but we got media narratives that a gigantic blue way of what's going to happen\nAnd we had that media narrative go on from December last year all the way through September of this year and then and then the generic ballot started tightening and then it began\nTo look maybe it won't be as big a blue wave\nAnd Republicans look like they might actually gain seats in the Senate\nAnd all known now the president's approval numbers is higher than it's ever been CNN's own poll forty four percent Rasmussen has trumpet fifty one there is nothing happening\nThat suggests say blue wave is happening I frankly don't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth I\nEat election day people have to start reeling in these Madden cat for addictions projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they can for the sake of their business\nThere in the polling business they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all of that's the case who hired him\nSo now we're told well there's been a shift a little bit and it may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways the Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republicans can hold the house foreign ways they could lose the house\nWith a month ago there was no way the Republicans were going to hold out now all of a sudden we're starting to see that it's a blue wave may not\nI don't think he'd ever did I don't think he ever did exist I think it made up\nManufactured you'll get the poll result you want depending on when you take the pole and who you decide to put in your sample\n\nThere is no way\nThere is simply no way that a political party openly promoting this invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive landslide\nWhen the American people are not angry that we have not\n\nStopped this the American people in mass are not wanting more illegal immigration\nThe American people in a majority no matter how you slice it or not asking for a political party\nTo stop paying attention to the border and let everybody who wants to him in the American people are not there the American people never have been there the Democratic party is there and the Democratic party wants you to think a lot of Americans are there but they aren't\n\nGoing through your own poll wherever you hang around do you think we ought to basically eliminate the border let anybody wants to come in and\nI can guarantee you less than ten percent of the people going to say yes and yet\nThey look at a drive by news media every day and you would get the impression is a lot of Americans in a lot of people that support this idea of these are\nSo poor people there there's the hungry we we we have so much they have so little we mark what the\nThat's not a position it's going to win elections if it were or we would have had amnesty back in two thousand two\n\nIf that was the position of a majority American people Donald Trump would never gotten the Republican nomination\nIf the people of this country wanted mobs of seven thousand or eight thousand to be admitted into the country no questions asked to be granted asylum truck with an never gotten the nomination he certainly would not have been elected president so you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think we got stuck\nYou know what Trump was wrong we don't need a wall this proves we just need to let these people in that's the way to stop the chaos they won and let them yet and we should feed them we should house than they have nothing there port are coming from ... countries let them that's not\nA majority opinion of the United states the beat it is going to try to make people who think that way I look like they're mean spirited cold hearted heartless and all this but it's not the case\nThat's not an accurate description of the American people\nSo I I none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever that Trump is in trouble because he wants to build a wall that he's in trouble and the Republicans are because they want to secure the border\n\nAnd yet the media reliably very suddenly at this point sympathizing with\nLes very subtly at this point sympathizing with the people on the quote unquote caravan trying to find a way to make Trump look like the bad guy here\nAnd that's just not where the American people out one other thing about this [noise]\nNow don't get to the final looming over by a second look at it this is a CNBC story from just this morning the headline growing caravan of migrants headed to the U.S pushes deeper into Mexico let me give you pull court for this story Mexican president elect\nOn British Manuel Lopez Obrador suggested yesterday at the United

chilies\nRemember her she was the um [noise] what was she she's in the Clinton Administration and she was best buds out there with Janet El Nino\nAnd she is running to fill the seat currently held by

he's going to charge fingerprint make money off this they're clearly picking back piggy backing off what Trump's doing and they want to get in on the action and they want to prove to themselves and the Democrats they can draw crowds too\nAnd they aren't going to pay all there are not going to be Seventy five thousand people waiting to get into here the Clintons\nUnless they're paid and that could entirely happened\nI'm telling you there aren't going to be anywhere near the kind of crowds to hear or see the Clintons as there are Trump but they want to get in on it but there's something about this it doesn't jibe with\nMe [noise] Washington Post has the story far right hecklers confront below sea call her a communist that Florida campaign of in\nTheir recall mayor communist the

not building a movement it may be set to satisfy the already existing lunatics that make up a Democrat base but it's not\nGrowing it and so I think I wouldn't be surprised if the Democrats staged this whole thing to try to get sympathy for polo see\nMuch like all these attacks on the turtle and his wife and Ted Cruz and all these other Republicans would have been forced out like cures to Nielsen it just reeks of copycat to me\n\nIt just reek like Bill and Hillary want to get in on the action of Trump's stadium chores [laughter]\n[noise] the Clintons I was [noise] I I just [noise]\nAnd I saw

just spoke out about it would have play some of what he said at the bottom of this half hour\nOut if those reports are all accurate it's a whole lot bigger than previously reported and growing\nAnd what you have is members of the caravan chanting guess we could as they're making their way through Mexico all day to day I've been defied the will of one country vowing to test the spine of another\nMexican police who failed to stop them at the country's border with Guatemala now service escorted appearance for the care of on as they're now battling north\nAs members clear that they have no intention of staying in Mexico Leah buys for the U.S new estimates cited by L. universal which is a Mexican newspaper say the Caribbean now has fourteen thousand people many of them are already in Mexico while others do wait\nOh that would put them in the category of illegal immigrants not an asylum seekers because you're seeking asylum you have to seek it in the country that you first appearance they appear confident that this confrontation is gonna come\nDown to this is this is extraordinarily dangerous for the country here but I Am telling you\nPolitically the American people fundamental is white Kavanaugh matter they believe in the in the core values that this country was built on a due process and presumption of innocence they also believe that we are a nation of laws otherwise why have the\nAnd Americans instinctively don't like the idea that people think they can march right across the border into our country we don't know who they are we don't know where they came from in some cases most cases we don't know what their intentions are\nOf the president has already said we're going to begin cutting off substantially or substantially reducing foreign aid or Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nAnd he says every time you see people illegally coming are attempting to come into the country blame the Democrats were not giving us the boats to change our pathetic laws and that would mean building the wall that he wanted to build that we can get done\nUh I've been at the drug warehouses which I played it many times I've seen the tunnels that of that had been dug\nThis is not just I mean this is the biggest rushed we've had\nBut on top of it and maybe they think the Gavin Newsom is gonna win and they can all go to the sanctuary state of California and there'll be safe and get the free health care the Gavin Newsom as promising every Californian legal not legal wherever you come from free health care free free free good luck for the people of California when that\nWhere you come from free health care free free free good luck for the people of California when that disaster happens but you know you you watch this and there's not one Democrat thing one thing about this because they've always supported open borders\nNow did they not know that by priests precipitating this confrontation that there could be innocent people that end up getting hurt here I guess for them they would use that as just another reason to hate and blamed Donald Trump\nYou know or maybe they're hoping the Trump won't do anything and that it's all talk no action they don't have any legitimate claim for asylum in America because you that would be the first country they go to the way they have so we can send them back immediately if we have to\nBut if you have five seven fourteen thousand people\nConfronting our troops along the border what good is going to come out of this\nYou know it's um you know while they're breaking the law they're criminals there not respecting our laws and our sovereignty and at the end of the day\nIf you let in ten fourteen thousand what's gonna happen next week and what's going to happen in the week after I think you know the Democrats have always believed that the change in ... in you know allowing illegal immigrants in the country of somehow helps him politically in the long term\nBut I don't think the American people want to open borders the American people fundamentally believe in the rule of law the American people believe in immigration but they want legal immigration\nAnd when they see the magnitude in just one crossing and then recognize that this was happening every single day at our borders to me this is going to energize the more to want to go out and elect Republicans that will fund fully the wall\nPresidents only had three and a half billion dollars so far to build the wall he's trying to get the Congress to give them twenty five billion gets the twenty five billion you'll have enough to fully completely secure our southern border\nDoes that mean nobody ever gets it not at all we just want legal immigration want to make sure who you are when you come here can you take care of yourself and do you come here and share our values and do you want your piece of the American dream then fine\nSo you've got a Democratic Party now that is ... ... believes that nothing is relates to due process cabin all know presumption of innocence cabin all\nNow they're supporting lawlessness mobs all over the place now they're not speaking out against the the confrontation your leaders in the Democratic party encouraging the kick up we can't be civil with people we disagree with unless we win the election\nYou know get a crowd confront them tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore Maxine Waters follow them into department stores and gas stations in grocery stores and you see what's happening it happened again even this weekend\nAnd the other issue that should be on everybody's minds in Fifteen days is after eight years of Obama we had Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty\nThe only president never to hit three percent GDP Growth in his entire presidency for one year\nWe had the a guy accumulate more debt than all forty three other presidents before him combined that's the track record of Obama\nThat's what he left us the lowest labor participation rates in the seventies lowest homeownership brightened fifty one years what do we have now for a million new jobs including four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs he told us we're never coming back\nWe have eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps for a million Americans now getting jobs we have more than a million jobs available to people who are on unemployment\nWe've never had consumer confidence this high\nLowest unemployment rates in Nineteen sixty nine\nOn the world stage little rocket man is not firing rockets every other day over Japan

about all of this and he's now measuring what the proper response is going to be properly and follow some of what\nThe western European allies did when we found out was poisoning you know some of his citizens\nBut by the way just moments ago the president who's headed to a campaign rally for Ted Cruz down in Texas that over a hundred and what Fifteen thousand people wanting to go to this thing they don't have enough room they already I think they increase the venue twice anyway this was the president before he jumped on ...\nIt's a horrible thing and it's a lot bigger than five thousand
