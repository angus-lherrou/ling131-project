if it's really at\nThis point I felt this trucking in the ... I wouldn't put it past and they pay somebody off ... so distressing and the Democrats um so anyway we have a lot of like ten days let's see what else they put out there next\nWell exactly exactly this is why I was telling people back in June and July to polls here really don't matter a hill of beans I think however the polls now do\nNot so much in accurately without any doubt predicting a winter but the polls today can be highly influential\nAnd decisions and action taken by political people now I just I I Love Tonya thank you very much for uh for calling a ... and again for mentioning Bob foreign it really is one of the finest guys anybody could ever meet [noise] ah\nI look at the psychology of people and I'm not a trained psychologist but I Am fairly experienced here at analyzing predicting understanding\nThe left and I know their mind set on many things one of their mindsets on power is that it's there's that that they are entitled to it\nAnd whatever it is denied them by way of elections they really really resented and they resent the people who made it happen which are the voters\nSo today's American Left as angry as it can be at people who voted for Trump the hatred for Trump is actually directed at hatred for people who elected him and the compounding hatred when those people will not abandon them the left is making every every effort it\nCan to distance Trump voters from Trump they've tried everything they know how to use to damage Trump to force him out of office to force cabin all out of the nomination to try to convince Trump voters they made a mistake none of it's worked the degree of frustration they are feeling is something you and I cannot relate to\n\nWe can try but the degree of frustration they're feeling and having lost that election in two thousand sixteen when they thought it was a landslide victory\nAnd subsequently everything they've had the most powerful influential people in their movement all coordinated working together to destroy Donald Trump\nAnd it's been like ... you know spit\nGather to destroy Donald Trump\nAnd it's been like you know spit balls at a at a at a battleship they haven't Denton Trump I cannot tell you\nHow frustrated they are it is easy for them to take out Republicans when ever they want they are able to do it and if not take them out damage them tremendously but they haven't been able to even score on Trump\nSalt they began this movement of promoting\nIn the media that there was going to be a blue wave they created this movement based on the fact they ... they created a whole cloth something it did not exist a national attitude of hatred for Donald Trump\nThey simply took their own attitude and they transferred it to a majority of Americans for all intents and purposes and they began reporting the news that way\nEverybody hates Trump that now that they've seen trumping action they hate him to despising they regret voting for him they wish they could get their vote back that became a narrative that's been the narrative for two years that narrative is what led them the hyping this blue wave\nIt was the only commonsense view and a half now that now that people have seen trumping action I've seen is bad manners they've seen whatever is about in the left tape now everybody's seen it now they regret it now they can't wait to get rid of Trump every special election every Democrat was going to win it because why everybody hated trumpet everybody hated themselves were voting for him\n[noise] well it isn't coming to pass\nThe blue wave they said the existed maybe never has the blue wave based on people who hate Trump now they've seen him in action can't wait to vote against them now we're learning much of that was made up much of that with soap operas scripted media narrative\nNow we're getting down to the nitty gritty now or two weeks away from the election and there isn't a blue wave of Republicans look like they're going to gain seats in the Senate even in Democrat pools and the blue wave in the house it's looking iffy iffy and now with Republican turnout\nDwarfing Democrat turn out in early voting early voting is where the Democrats get to run their frauds schemes folks early voting is where the illegals vote and the debt vote and all these other things it's purposely set up and the Republicans\nWhy it appears there are more sophisticated than the Democrats ever considered the Republicans are not letting the Democrats get away with what they usually get away with\nThe Republicans are showing up in droves they're out performing at political rallies Trump won twenty thousand people Fifteen thousand people another twenty five thousand people outside block Obama can't even draw one thousand Joe Biden Hillary Clinton can't draw flies there is ab jet panic\nSetting and now you got this caravan coming up and the Democrats have missed played this caravan even the creepy porn star lawyer Michael ... is tweeting that the Democrats are

politics we do not condemned the use of bombs in war such as declared hostilities but we declare and clearly condemn the use of bombs\nAnd clearly condemn the use of bombs\nIn American politics or any other domestic circumstance but clearly America has become a very dangerous place for Democrats\nWhat can we do to protect our Democrats what can we do to help ensure the safety of our democratic

well in the midterms but this cycle present some unusual risks\nFor pollsters not ... the mainstream media does this every election cycle where it was all this\nOut for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats doing massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by\nTrump and that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys shoring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's gotta be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans\nNow polls could be missing a GOP surge late surge and guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys could miss late change the story written before the bombs\nCould it happen again it probably won't don't worry about it Bloomberg's but according to court in ... and it could go either direction Democrats could still win big or they could lose big it go either ... what does all this and decision all of a sudden\nVersus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\n\nHolds couldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months you name it then when the polls have to be shown to be correct\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats the step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as weak and then lose [noise]\nThere's a translation for this in addition to what are you saying here you Democrats have got to stop opposing Trump's just do opposed Trump\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we've we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela sponsored and pay for it is if that if that's true\nThen Venezuela also means Iran and the ... folks\nA lot of people on our side of jumped St George Soros yeah maybe\nBut if Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying is Venezuela if it's Venezuela it's also Iran and the ... regardless\nWe had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates didn't let those people and for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not where the American people are right now\nThe only commonsense fickle thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore ... he is saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security that's doesn't help us\nA mob of seven thousand ten thousand people starving to gauge demanding to be let in that doesn't help us whatever not say all this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickled kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\n[noise] my point is [noise] none of this is panning out the way it was planned no blue wave\nI look don't misunderstand I don't know what's gonna I'm not saying that the Democrats may not when the house but I\nI don't think they're going to [noise] I I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it\nBecause I never fall for left wing media conventional wisdom or the standard ordinary group think narrative of the moment whatever it is\nBut it's more than that there is nothing happening in America right now than argues electing Democrats not in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in mass\nThere's no reason to vote Democrat even giving people reasons to vote for the all they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump because Trump's what he's aboard he tweet says ah the bad guy is whatever whatever is\nThe stunts the Democrats are pulling destroying Kevin on his family sending rice in what looked like rice and the Susan Collins all these monsters last thing the Democrats are doing\nThat's the kind of thing you do to build a movement in a decent society and I still believe that we have one I Believe are decent society is under siege everyday are decent society\nStandard good old normalcy is under assault every day led by pop culture and leftist in Hollywood\nIn Silicon valley and the drive by media we're under assault every day but they have not overturned it yet they have not gotten to the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced normal there's just nothing out there to me\nThat would have people excited about voting for Democrats because the the even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people to vote against Trump against Republicans\nAh I just I don't see it we'll find out if my instincts are off the charts or not in less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters they're the ones panicking so you flip this scenario what sense\nDoes it make for a conservative Republican the gum up the works here by sending a bunch of bombs that are not going

that sense I Am absolutely and that says that uh\nYou know I this is this is so easy\nThis is so not a controversy this is such a microcosm this is is such a teachable moment this is exactly why the American left and the media have no idea who Donald Trump is\nAnd they can't even relate to it here's a guy who does nothing but love America and that is something they can't\nRelate to loving America to them is old fashioned it's a bygone era right in this era of globalism loving your company's fine but but it seems so old fashion and it's it's it's just pass\nSay it so it's so far and that these people they just there really isn't even a common ground with them on that\nDonald Trump\nLet me share with the way my brother David tweeted on this yesterday and there's probably a good way to say and he said Trump believes in a strong exceptional America he's not a political scientist\nHe doesn't speak in code he doesn't offer dog whistles you don't even know what the stuff is when he says I'm a nationalist he's not winking\nAt neo Nazis he's not winking at white supremacists and saying we're patriots and UPC people that he's just a guy who loves America he's a nationalist versus global is\nHe's going to make America great again he believes American deserves to be great he believes in America weeds in the world when it's great\nBut these people are but they're supposedly the intellectuals\nThere the broad minded ... they're so small minded and tiny minded that they can't get past\nTheir hatred rooted in partisanship and all they had his knee jerk reactions on Trump says it's a nationalist they immediately hear a dog whistle yeah Trump's talking to the people in Charlottesville that's what they're thinking that Trump is winking at the people in Charlottesville and not to say you go guys you go that's but they honestly think\nAnd if they don't honestly think that they're doing a double disturb us because they're trying to make people to follow them believe they do think that if they do think that they're the ones that have an electrical problems if they do think if they cannot understand the simplicity\nOf I Love America I Want America to be the best it can be America the best it can be makes the world the best it can be if they don't understand that if that doesn't compute with them than they have no business being positions of power in this country because they are not going to accurately represent us or destinations interest\nBecause this is not complicated it is such a\nCheap lazy reaction to say\nSee the Trump Hitler nationalist dog whistle\nThere's no basis in fact for it there's still\nEngaged in trying to convince Trump or an addict convince people to hate Trump the way they do\nI'm just going to tell people\nYou you're ... if you don't learn to understand this you're going to ever be ... at the guy's ankles\nLoves America\nThinks America is great and can be greater and a great America is great for everybody in it and a great America is made great great citizens\nAnd that there's nothing wrong with loving America there's nothing wrong with thinking America is exceptional and exceptional America solve the problems of

coverage now in the case of any of this there were lunatics I'm going to prove that we get back that I'd been consistent I'm also going to prove what you're hearing today are liberal politicians about civility is they're just words because their silence\nOver a decade when he just said Fox News and talk radio did it I mean this this rush the job we don't know who did it\nWe have no nobody has a clue who did this\nWhat I can tell you it's no sane rational conservative or Republican that I Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with but it's just so typical the rush to judgment they want to believe\nBut it's just so typical the rush to judgment they want to believe what they want to believe but if they want the political narrative what's so hypocritical the same people that had been tone deaf in silent to what has been unfolding now in this country for a month\nHow many women have been confronted in restaurants movie theaters how many times as this happened with you know the chanting in the restaurants with with politicians in their wives even this weekend with McConnell happened twice the Ted Cruz\nOver a conspiracy TV MSNBC that just despicable insinuating this suspicious packages can be tied back to the Trump himself and at the intended recipient of all been criticized by the president\nYou've gotta be kidding me is this how twisted let's just take\nThe rhetoric of of who they are every day ... just last night alone I played a bunch of tapes of you know lower thirds of the president he's a liar he said this he's a lawyer fraud this\nI'm Sorry the president flat out by saying Congress is working on a plan and they were coming back before the election he gets caught the lie he changes his story again it's ever going to get sort of actually\nThe president thinks you're stupid the president thinks people are stupid where efficiently and parents and in fact ...\nPresident Trump tries to play to his base with outright false\nNot even trying to hide his life in the mornings is putting all out there he's spreading a lot of lines about non why is this all you hear\nEvery single day from the mainstream media lies about why\n... ... look this is every election season you get it\nAnd we did have an incident if you recall when Steve school lease another's the shooting took place on the ball field\nAnd I actually I remember saying and I asked my step to go back and find out what did I say when we found out that the gunman or the person responsible for the shooting that nearly killed Steve school lease was Bernie Sanders supporters is what I said\nNow I I'm not going to do with the left does here Bernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not\nOut there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie Sanders was sick and by the entire you know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him so it's Ryan McCarthy\nAnd ... right and this individual this assailant that we are now getting the information on that you just shared by his own and Bernie Sanders took to the floor of the Senate to condemn it because he was a Sanders supporter suppose\nWhat they want but you know what that they do it I don't blink Bernie Sanders of course not they would they would blame us yes of course I have to do what I Want to say you know Rush Limbaugh and the radio in the in Oklahoma City bombing and you know you got out there where in ...\nWell this is because these guys are convinced the left that by ratcheting up their rhetoric that they can get away with it and they get a free pass nobody doesn't matter if they do it so here's what you have today right here in Washington DC\nAnd attempted assassination I Hope it's not and I'm praying that you know he's in as we know Sean he's in a very serious very very critical recorded earlier that he was upgraded a critical condition knock great it from critical that good but he's been critical what\nThey said well he was in stable yeah stable condition you get\nThem into what I did back I ... you can't blame Bernie for that\nNor can you blame any conservative but we don't know what the motivation is just it's all conjecture and now it's being used as a political weapon to\nBludgeon talk radio Fox and Trump it's just outrageous\n'cause that's not who we are what what did I say yesterday about George Soros I won't play it again now but I said hey not this has to stop George Soros spends millions of dollars paying groups to get me off the air\nWe that's not how we settled political differences you know when the sun is out there apparently blaming Donald Trump Donald Trump does not responsible for packages that might have bombs and anthrax or rice in in it it's ridiculous\nYou don't see why you know let me play Hillary Clinton today and Hillary Clinton just what a week ago let's put this compare\nIt to her not liberal with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about the only thing that the Republican clinging to recognize and respect strength\nIt's a time of\nDeep divisions and we have to have to do everything we everything we can bring our country to get together\nTo thought we were supposed to be several ... a week later\nUnless it an Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York you know we must be civil where Americans All right that's not what he was saying in a while back when he talked about conservatives that live in New York people like me listen\nTo talk on this not me they ... themselves or are they streaming or right\nUp where it is that there are because that's who they are the extreme conservative stations so this was not when you're\nAt the end of the day we may have political differences\nBut this is one country we're all Americans e pluribus unum out of many one\nKeeping the debate and the dialogue civil\nLaw is very very important and for elected leaders\nWho in many ways set the tone\nIs especially important\nOh they're not New Yorkers there's no place in the state of the New York if you're pro life pro Second Amendment I happen to be libertarian on issues involving sexuality so it's not my issue\nYou know I just very different tone isn't it\nTell you a little story so I had this ... and and window lived through this and window you know we're still very great friends with police who worked for me for a long time and she went on to bigger and better things will really proud of her and happy for her and she was a friend of our program we just saw her in Washington when we were last there right yep we just dollar\nUm it was like nine hours when we had what we thought was potentially anthrax into my office of Fox right\nUh yeah it was it was actually a little bit more between how long they held her over\nAnd the sad thing is and she was an isolation she was alone we couldn't talk to her even though it was just horrible for her and she was cordoned\nOff we went to the hospital they wouldn't let us and we couldn't see her because they didn't know for the anthrax right than what was that if it was ...\nI mean as with all my heart I Can't stand CNN is reporting I think it's fake news but I I feel sorry for the people over CNN Today I've lived through this\nI and Linda on a scale of one to ten the anthrax incident being a one how many tens of we had in the course of my career that you know about I mean you know we got ten death threats today be a letter yeah I mean and it's just a horrible thing there was one particular person at another network I won't say who\nAnd it's just a horrible thing there was one particular person at another network I won't say who\nWho's going through a very bad time and going through a lot of threats I picked up the phone don't agree with this person at all I explained everything that I've been through and tried to give my best advice\nI mean this person was upset had to leave their house they had young kids this person you know how to family and you know it's it's hard\nIt's unfortunately part of the environment we live in and that's why I don't understand why there's been so much silence about chasing people at restaurants and attacking people in restaurants you know somebody bangs on your table in a restaurant that's what assault\nThat guy should have been arrested or\nShows up at your house or spent on you or threaten you or follow you know I have had all the above\nAnd it's just very very very difficult and how many times if I said keep Obama said when he was president we got to keep our for our politicians have whoever did this\nIs not a conservative in the sense that maybe they think they are but they're not anybody I Want anything to do with her any conservative once anything to do it\nBut this rush to judgment we don't know one thing yet who's responsible by immediate the trying to exploit it for political gain when it is a serious significant threat as I said well the president says fake news\nAre they are fake news no truth is ... ... words are very different than actions\nJust like Bernie Sanders says incendiary things to that that was incendiary to me I just but you know he's not responsible because not that supports him\nSo unbelievable the hip hop or see how many of you know how many reported that three weeks ago rice and letters was sent to
