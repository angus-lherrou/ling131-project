my call Russian my coming loud and clear you are sir here you just fine\nThanks it's a sixty dollar Samsung so you know whatever but uh yeah you know\nWe all have our obstacles to bear in life and your your overcoming as pretty well I hear you pretty well\nThank you uh you know I'm a ... I voted for Trump Madden Trump voter and America First and most historic sense and I'm an American patriot so take that in contact with my question your\n... how can the United states the allies with countries and you mentioned this in the first part of your monologue we're allies with a Saudi Arabia and Israel\nHow can we be allies with Saudi Arabia when the Pentagon papers released and twenty six team showed that they funded nine eleven also Israel has attacked is in the past like a used his liberty with all of unfair can\nYou clear that are forming well on the Saudis side yeah the uh the the Israeli spy on us to everybody spies on everybody you know Jonathan Pollard it was an Israeli spider got caught and the Israelis wanted him back\nOn harmed we said screw you you know where your benefactor old spy on us and I said yes we do and we're going to continue the spike us we can't trust anybody where Israel\nAnd particularly when Democrats are in the White House and that's a factor now when it comes to the Saudis I Want to share with you because your question here\nIs really good\nI remember after nine eleven happened when when I learned that he was either all Nineteen\nOr white Ninety percent eighty percent of the Nineteen hijackers were Saudi\nI remember I was talking to William Buckley junior about number thing not just this and I brought that up\nAnd I remember him getting frustrated with me about it he said what does it ever doing anything I ... I don't understand the Saudi Government supposedly is an ally and yet\nThese hijackers come from Saudi Arabia are you saying the Saudi royal family is behind this I said how can we say that they're not\nThat is when I began to try to learn about\nThe relationship to the Saudi up the Saudi royal family to\nIslam and that's what I started asking experts\nAre at at one of the people I talked to was Andy McCarthy again because he has tried\nAs a United States attorney assist the United states attorney southern district of Manhattan he was the lead prosecutor on the blind shake case\nAnd it was Andy who said that he fought the blind check was just acting out to being a radical uh inventor of various aspects of Islam\nAs part of his technique to mobilize and create even more membership and his group and then he\nHe started reading the things that the blind shake believes and he found out none of this is made up this this this call for terrorism dealing with infidels it's right there in the car on if you read it right this\nIs exactly what what is in the book and he was stunned when he he told me was so when you then\nRealized that the Saudi royal family is in charge of world wide Islam because the holy sites are in their mecca and Medina Medina\nI found that it is absolutely true that the Saudi royal family\n\nIs essentially the the shield and the impetus behind worldwide Islam well in Saudi Arabia\nThe branch of Islam that is I for just to make it easier here and being understood terrorist Islam comes from ... for those you heard me say this yesterday beg your indulgence\nWow how'd the Islam is aware of the really radical clerics and the moms are who are welcoming\nAnybody they can into their in their mosques and just literally converting them\nInto suicide bombers terrorists and what have you under the auspices of Islam and the Saudi royal family stood\nBy and let it all happened whether they were instrumental in advocating it don't know but Saudi funded charities all over the world promoted while hobby\nIsn't and that's what I mean went back to Mr Buckley is I I don't I don't see how the Saudi royal family the Saudi Government can be separated from these Nineteen hijackers\nWell that's why it's interesting to tell the story of the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\nMohammed bin ... wants to if we don't believe him he wants to reform the Saudi Arabian peninsula the whole country and its relationship to Islam\nThe Saudi Arabian peninsula the whole country and its relationship to Islam\nAll because of money economics primarily he doesn't like the fact that Saudi Arabia is solely dependent on the sale of oil for all of its wealth he wants to branch out\nHe wants other people investing other industries individuals' investing in Saudi Arabia for things unrelated dollars of federal dollars oil\nSo he sought out the interest in Hollywood Silicon Valley and the typical places and other countries as well and part and parcel of his reform is the\nI don't know what word abandonment or the distance thing for more ...\n\nAccording to been selmont Saudi Arabia cannot modernize and cannot achieve his reform goals if ... is still\n\nThe branch of Islam associated with the Saudi royal family\nWell\nThis brings us to show gay again and the Muslim Brotherhood they don't want any of these reforms they don't want any western influences in any Islamic country much less Saudi Arabia where mecca Medina they do not want while habits of watered down they do not\nThey want the Arab Spring they don't want secularism anywhere and Mohammed bin ... represents a bit of that that's fascinating that he has been brought to a screeching halt on these reforms\nWith the death of his Yogi this has brought to a screeching halt and now there's a story today that the royal family they they have a council you might I often wonder well who determines these kings have countless ... they've got Fifteen different wives they've got kids with every one of their wives so a Saudi king can have twenty sons\nHow's he determine which one's the crown prince how does he determined which one's going to be is air it's not just first in line they had a council they have an inter family council a royal family council that\nDetermines\nThe winning edge of the crown prince the heirs and in what order then solve mom Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of the current king\nSolomon\nHe was chosen largely because of his reform ideas but now a story out today says it they went off his true or not the royal family is having a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammad bin ... as clown friends\nNow many people think that this is up to the king the king determining what your his sons is gonna be the next king but it's not the case\nSo all of these plans for modernization if they were true I have to throw that I was like heavy up all these plans for reform\n\nHave been brought to a screeching halt by the murder of job market show in Turkey which is also very unhappy with Saudi Arabia\nBecause the clown roast turkey Recep pay up here to why he is not one of these guys that wants western influence as we look I'm way
