I was expecting something British uh but he said exactly the same thing and apparently it's a it's a an English thing it's popular in Australia and so\nThat's one of the recipes in the in the cookbook if in fact it's on the back cover the darn thing\nBeautiful you've got a lot of very cool recipes in here at ... by you and your wife too which is a which is really something worth a look you know let me ask you a question here is a\nNew York times comes up with his long article and I now read most of it really trashing the president trashing his father tracking making these these these brought statements about how they're essentially tax cheats going back twenty more than Twenty years\nAnd um\nAnd they and they basically blowing the IRS and they said well the Internal Revenue service basically you know look the other way and so for now the Internal Revenue service doesn't look the other way right\nAnd this is a huge ah you know family business a privately held business I don't know how they got access to all this stuff I don't know if it was in the\nIn the filings with the state or or whatever it was but they are trashing Trump is he's not a self made man and look at all the money he got when he was a kid and and on and on and on this is really a set up isn't it for the Democrats will keep saying we want Trump's taxes and they're kind of handing love working with each other here in a political way\nBut that's their playbook that's all they've got I mean they're still litigating the twenty sixteen election they cannot believe they lost to this guy and why did they lose him because he cheated and he didn't just cheat at you know colluding with the Russians he cheated his entire business career and his family cheated his\nDad cheated they screwed people in the welfare system so that they would get rich and you know the allegation is you know he had said that he started Donald Trump did with just a million of his father's dollars but you know this story says oh what are they talking about I think I think I read four\nHundred and Fifteen million dollars is what his dad gave him so he wasn't a self made guy he was a bold into his father who was a cheater as well crazy but you know let's let's see what the facts are right now it's just one of these allegations that it's been linked to a major\nBut isn't that isn't basically the problem isn't this the problem is a huge article yes one allegation after another and what are we going to spend the next six weeks on this right through the mid term elections it's all time though\nI don't ever remember anything like this when the Kennedy family or had LBJ became a multi millionaire just up poor man that that got elected to the Senate he died a multi multi millionaire I mean so much and and Trump makes all this money before even enters the presidency\nAnd they just can't wait to get their hands around his neck\nHow many times mark have we seen in the last year because it's been very effective that are members of the left and the Democrats in particular have or\nHave worked with politicians you what you want to talk about a collusion look at the link between the press and some are liberal Democrats for instance uh I was watching the special report program on Fox News\nAnd a a young correspondent who used to live in my house uh Peter do see the who you were talking about a minute ago you know he's out in Montana and he was covering the story about other reelection campaign of John tester and Jon Tester's got a problem right now because\nA lot of Montanans are veterans and they don't like what he did to Dr Ronny Jackson who is the president's picked to run the VA\nBecause if you remember Jon Tester leaked these are allegations unfounded allegations are I think he first started out on the floor of the Senate or it was in a committee hearing\nHe had these pages of stuff about how Ronny Jackson was a drunk and he crashed the car someplace and he did these inappropriate things that he was given people bills and all that stuff and\nYou know what then it got into the bloodstream of the media and everybody was talking about it and the White House came out uh like within a day and said look we've done to an investigation we can't find anywhere that he crashed the car or these other allegations but the damage was done\nAnd he was dead it was a kill shot and it all started with unfounded allegations and that brings us right to where we are today how many times have we seen these things\nAnd it's just they keep doing it because it's\nWe see these things and it's just they keep doing it because it's working\nWell I wanted to recommend that people have a little diversion here this is a really wonderful a cookbook and uh it's a wonderful thing to put on your cocktail table to you and your wife are on the cover that happy cookbooks steam and Cathy do see I Want to wish you all the best would this\nThank you great one ...
