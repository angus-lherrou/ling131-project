ways that are far beyond our our comprehension and understanding [noise] um so theoretically we could be surrounded by other dimensions of reality that we're not able to perceive due to limitations in

and and understand it\nBut that doesn't mean that there can't be other dimensions ah all around us you know\nAll right so that's one possibility the more checks the portal the wormhole let's talk about these UFO sightings in that area can because there are a lot of them so is it possible people are being abducted by the tourist drills\nWell you know that's a great segue George because you know one theory holds that if if we are in fact being visited by extraterrestrial intelligence is that perhaps they're using these actual for Texas or wormholes to get here from wherever they're from um\nThat said uh Alaska it does have a a high\nConcentration of UFO activity um the apparently the American military to quite an interest in that you know I just mentioned the case of the missing the fifty four aircraft back in Nineteen fifty where there are allegations and rumors that just weeks before that crap disappeared\nThat there were sightings of UFOs over ... air force base where that particular plane took off from\nA but moreover going into recent ah times are there's a very famous craft I'm sure you've talked about in your show the uh the November Nineteen eighty six there was a Japanese airlines flight sixteen twenty eight\nAh this was this a cargo seven forty seven loaded with wine and headed for France to Japan and as it flew over Alaska they actually the pilots\nOr discern three objects or that subsequently chase their craft according to them\nUh one of the craft or that they spotted they claimed was twice as big as an aircraft carrier and this and counter was corroborated from the ground by a by radar a workers down there to I'm a I'm a door base\nUm so you know that's one particular case there was a allegedly a kind of a cover up um when this a radar information was analyzed by different government agencies and they kind of swept under the rug but this may have been the first real definitive radar evidence\nOr that our government our military had it been actually a ... with you know that's just one example uh within weeks after that incident there were other UFO sightings around Alaska\n'em and you know up until she just last year we were up in a a location a mouth have which is up in a Dali national park where there'd been a lot of UFOs sightings\nAllegations of an underground UFO base there under undermanned haze that date back to the seventies and uh there was a pretty notable UFO citing just weeks before we arrived there\nAnd in these particular cases can these people are gone they're not brought back there not steel here right\nThat's true\nUm there are thousands of people that have that have never been found um now there are some people I think some of the cases probably haven't solved through the years but uh the you know a good portion of good a percentage of those cases are our unsolved\nAnd uh we got to kind of a first hand a taste of that ourselves and we were up there filming a in the city of Juno there was actually a tourist that went missing or the week that we were up there and there was a massive manhunt that ensued\nOr so it's it's just a it's an amazing proposition that so many people ... up there without a trace center never found\nWere with research or an author can your heart of course who is also doing a series on the History Channel called the missing in Alaska how did you folks all hone in on Alaska\n[noise] well um what kind of interesting George is that uh one of my cast mates\nOr his name is Tommy Joseph and he's a a a clean get is a Native American bringing a his father actually is a missing person or when he was a young boy his father went out on a fishing trip um a in a boat by himself and never return\nOh boy so Tommy's kind of grown up with that and um so you know as a kind of a tragic story but I'm a he was driven to sort of looking at some of these other missing persons cases to see if he could find some answers find some closure and\nUh subsequently uh he I guess got in touch with them a production company that was working with the History Channel and uh they were looking for other investigators to kind of help him out and I was a one person they reached out to an addition to another guy\nA jak that well who's a private investigator and he kind of work skeptics\nA jak that well who's a private investigator he kind of work a skeptic so he was going to kind of bring his law enforcement background and of course I'm more of a crypto zoology just but I'm always been fascinated with other a novelist phenomenon so the three of us joined forces and that was kind of how the show was conceived\nCan in the movie the fourth kind of course they talk a lot about Nome, Alaska for these disappearances is Nome, Alaska in this triangle\nKnown is not in the trying not in the right now it's on the far western side of the state um and unfortunately we did not have an opportunity to to uh visit no that was one of the places we were attempting to investigate but um we stayed primarily in the uh within the boundaries of what is known as the Alaska triangle\nWell I you know I've seen this movie twice I still can't figure out if it's Hollywood or if these are real stories I don't know\nYeah I I don't know either I think it's one of those things they they they certainly made it look like kind of found footage a kind of documentary\nUm but you know I have heard allegations that perhaps some of that was the station allies yeah so I really don't know\nNow there have been a number of big foot cases in that region as well in Alaska\nNow we don't hear a lot of stories of big foot abducted people taking them away but what do you hear out there yeah\nWell I'm actually I'm as we investigated ... version of the foot a which is known locally by a number of native names a rule attack regularly equal to or\nA ... and so forth but all of those translated means basically Harry manner Bush man so essentially the legend speak of a hairy men like figure a giant hairy man like figure very similar to the north American big for their sauce watch\nAnd as we did our investigations what we found is there actually have been um\nClaims that eight foot type creatures have abducted humans on occasion bringing up in the far Pacific Northwest\nAre now would example of that is a young lady uh in rampart Alaska or back in the Nineteen eighties claim that she was actually kidnapped by one of these big foot creatures the Bush man and that she was taken back to a cave\nA where this thing was essentially living or dwelling with other big foot type creatures and that she was held their captive for a number of days\nBefore she managed to escape I'm and she felt that she had been brought there in order to care for one of their infants which appear to her to her\nTo be sort of sickly and and she got the impression that they felt that somehow she would be able to help this\nA juvenile creature um that you know that's just one example um there was a very famous story throughout Alaska that's a\nA known or from an area called Thomas bay which is on the far south eastern part of the tribal and from a book this kind of well known in Alaska called uh the strangest story ever told\nA back in Nineteen hundred a number of prospectors went up to this area um to you know do some prospecting and they had my counters with these what they refer to as Harry doubles which if you read the descriptions it sounds like kind of a big foot creatures spot on\nAnd in fact uh they were chased out of this area they claimed by these highly aggressive Harry man like creatures\nUm so you know those are some of the Alaskan stories and then you have a in in the bigger part of the ... or you have\nA the famous abduction of a man named Albert off it was a Swedish prospect or who claimed that he was adopted by a family of sauce watches back in Nineteen twenty four this is very well known in the big foot field um so you do find these stories he's accounts of people being kidnapped or abducted by ...\nLet's talk a little bit more about this big foot because I Want you to describe Porsche what it looks like we'll be back in a moment Ken Guerra hard with us all his information linked up the coast to coast stadium dot com\nCoast insiders the new version of the coast to coast am happy is now available for ... and now Android for Don own above listen libre on demand anywhere any time to go to ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nFortunate to hook up with a lot of a pre I'm an expert on big but many gee Robert alley and he's click it a number of sightings and the state of Alaska can actually told me that he has\nSome descriptions that actually characterize these creatures is standing anywhere from twelve to Fifteen feet oh wow which is oh yeah so I was pretty blown away by that no you don't really hear about\nOh yeah so I was pretty blown away by that now you don't really hear about that here in the lower\n... is that\nThey put her sauce watched that big and it's it's really hard to kind of wrap your mind around that that something a hominid form could stand twelve to Fifteen feet tall but there are apparently you know multiple descriptions that that state that they're they're literally that big or some of them are that\nBig eyes that would be eerie to see I think I can I can handle a seven foot big for it but man you see one Fifteen feet tall that's that's eerie\nYes absolutely and you know that a lot of crypto zoology is based on the allergy and folklore so when you hear these descriptions of man like creatures that stand Fifteen feet tall well the obvious thing is to look at the the worldwide mythology and folklore and obviously you have these enduring legends of giants\nI mean let's let's be real that's what they call them giants dating back you know hundreds or thousands of years in different cultures all over the world\nSo let's put big put aside is another possibility there are other legendary creatures that you looked at there's a strange one that I'm not too familiar with the shapes shift or called who's taco what is that\nYes the ...\n... is a clean it legit I mentioned my friend Tommy earlier is cleaning it that that's kind of the southeastern part of Alaska the ... is known as the land Autor man and according to the ... people this ... is a shape shift or a that essentially lives deep in the wilderness\nIt bears the characteristics physical characteristics that both humans and auditors which are very common animals in Alaska other two species of honor's there are of course marine auditors and then you have the land of the river otters\nBut according to cling legends these ... because they're very conniving and ultimately what they're what they're trying to do is to lure people out into the wilderness\nAnd essentially to assimilate them by getting people lost in the wilderness or causing people to drown or die that you know various death or what it means wilderness areas\nAnd if that were to happen to you as a ... warrior are brave for example then you would become ... so essentially it it's a it's an ongoing cycle where these these shapes shifting creatures a will essentially lure unsuspecting humans are the wilderness and then assimilate them\nAnd turn them into ... costs themselves now one of the really creepy aspects of this legend is that these ... creatures will sort of trick you by I'm\nTaking ... former the shape of somebody that is familiar to you or for example a friend or relative and that is one of the ways that they will lure you into the wilderness\nOr another part of the legends states that they will make a sound like a baby crying or what's your what's your instinct as a person if you're out in the woods and hear a baby cry and where you would think well there you know there's a baby and distress\nThat's right you need to go to an end to the parents you gotta find I Can't\nFind the kid and then that that that's the ... you out into the wilderness and I'm Mike half made Tommy claims that he actually did encounter one of these ... are creatures at one point or in his town of Sitka, Alaska and that he said that this thing looked very much like an auditor accepted it had kind of a strange looking its eyes\nAre almost like a it was possessed or something and that he ultimately against is better judgment he did begin to follow this thing kind of out into the woods while it seemed to be leading him away from his home and then\nHe kind of came to at one point realize what was going on in and was able to sort of break the spell but many of the people that I spoke to they were very adamant that this is not a Memphis is not a fable these ... creatures are very very real to them\nThat's creepy that this creature use creepy\nYeah it's pretty it's pretty creepy and uh you know there's that little ... here\nFew years ago Charlie Sheen are actually uh I guess it was kind of more of a publicity stunt than anything else but he's stage steak ... expedition of his own up in the state of Alaska\nSo it wasn't too successful with that one I guess not know\n[laughter] you've looked at under burns these these creatures are intriguing to me because they could be prehistoric but whatever they are we get sightings of huge birds as big assessments what are we here in Alaska\n[noise] yeah well I'm as you know George I've been investigating the thunderbirds phenomenon for many many years now Idaho elected accounts eyewitness accounts from all over North America but Alaska despite its very small population definitely seems to be a very\nActive area real hot spot for these Thunderbird accounts\nNow of course you have to acknowledge that you have the many native Thunderbird legends and in fact if you go to Alaska you'll actually see five hundred birds are being portrayed on different ... and and native artwork and so forth so they believe in thunderbirds indifferent native cultures their dates back many centuries\nBut in terms of modern sightings back in two thousand and two there were a number of sightings of thunderbirds over last good actually made a international news because many of the witnesses were experienced pilots and so forth it solve these enormous bird\nThat had like a fourteen foot wingspan basically the size of a small airplane and through the years\nUh and partially thanks to you for for having me on a coast to coast in prior years to talk about ... I've had people reach out to me from the state of Alaska that have also seen these uh thunderbirds and they describe them as essentially looking like giant raptor types of birds very much like an ego with a hook to be\nKind of a predatory bird a dark colored\nFeathers or but again the thing that really stands out as we're talking about a wing span that ranges anywhere from Fifteen to twenty or twenty five feet across which is about five times bigger than any known bird species\nAre so we we really couldn't be dealing with I Believe something prehistoric in nature or if you go back and look at the ice age or the place to see any talk\nTen twelve thousand years ago North America actually was populated by these enormous birds noticed territory ends\nAnd they did have wing spans anywhere from twelve to Eighteen feet across a and they were somewhat related to modern contours of vultures so they may have had that kind of raptor like appearance of ... in essence what we can be dealing with here\nIs a surviving population perhaps a very small population of these enormous prehistoric birds\nAnd what better place for these birds to remain hidden in the great state of Alaska\nYou know I'll always remember this incredible story and I believe it was an Illinois can the woman who came outside to see a bird with the Palins stuck into its her son a little boy was lifting him up and she had to knock him down with a broom\nYep absolutely that's a the lawn Dale incident you nailed it July twenty fifth Nineteen Seventy seven ten year old Marvin low was picked up by one of two giant blackbirds right in front of his his mother and several other eyewitnesses carry for several feed him tell they were able to basically\nConvinced as birds to let go of him and are are there are other accounts in history Georgia of of giant Thunderbird type creatures are carrying away small children for example um I don't know if he documented cases\nUh carrying away small children for example um I don't know that he documented cases of the parents you know carrying away adults\nAre but theoretically if you were talking about a bird with a twenty five foot wingspan way perhaps\nA couple of hundred pounds or more and you know it is it is a possibility so that is something we explored for the for this particular episode that perhaps some of these missing people in Alaska God Forbid maybe carried away by these giant thunderbirds to some remote craggy peak\nInstead to baby birds or something\n[laughter] ... it's hard to envision isn't it but a definitely a chill is running down my spine right now like God about is how\nBig do you think the eggs will be twelve inches tall two feet tall how big\n[laughter] they'd be big ... I mean a ... you get a badge and an ostrich egg and maybe a several times larger than that if you've ever seen an ostrich egg uh they're they're pretty big so\nYou know but that is one of the uh from a skeptical point of view that is one of the frustrating things as we don't have any physical evidence of these thunderbirds no one has found a giant egg or a giant master anything yet but it certainly doesn't preclude that or the possibility that they exist because I've interviewed as I've\nSaid many dozens of people very credible people from\nAll walks of life who have testified that they've seen these things and I believe them\nSo this is all geared to people disappearing in Alaska so are we talking about all the bald one or two which which theory do you think might be the one\nWell each episode we explore a different theory and um you know what was really remarkable is that is we delved into each ledge in each each possibility\nThe reality of them you know kind of slap in the face a you know it's one thing when you're sitting there and you're reading a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Show Low", "day": "22"}
