toast\nThe United states is going to be defeated but the American people will survive and following the defeat of the United states which is described in Bible prophecy in is he killed chapter thirty eight we are told and I'll I'll read the scripture let me just\nTurn the not too long because I don't get into scripture oh you don't me to read it just give us a paraphrase\nOkay paraphrase at the at the time of the end a great power from the north along with many nations will attack Israel which would have been re gathered back to its land and they will also attack another nation\nThat is also a nation of immigrants a nation of great wealth who citizens dwell securely with no defense is no walls around any of their city's no wall on their border with Mexico\nAnd that nation to will also be attack at the same time Israel's attacks the communist and Arab allies is going to attack Israel\nAnd they're going to attack the United states and they're going to take out the U.S has a superpower\nAnd they're going to occupy the middle east they're going to grab the oil they're going to grab control the oil reserves and they're going to eliminate the United states is a balance against their power and there'll be in a position to dictate terms to the Europeans who will stand in their way they want to see it at the table to run the new world order George\nAnd they're going to make their move most likely within the next three years\nAnd then what happens to Israel\nCourting the scripture Israel will be protected they no doubt we'll use their nuclear arsenal and\nThe Israelis have a Web surprising people there are very bold militarily they are not afraid to use their capabilities and I mean once they realize World War is underway Israel will forget about the political correctness\nOf measured response in Israel execute The Simpsons strategy which is basically they will eliminate their enemies\nIsrael is also a nuclear power\nAnd they will prevail then there'll be substantial loss of life the Arab major Arab city is no doubt will be hit the United states will be hit Russia will be hit\nThe world will suffer population loss of possibly one point five billion people would be my estimate and out of the ashes of this war a one world government will rise in power\nAnd the anti Christ which is the figure who will head up the final world government he will come to power and the earth will go into the final period of human history which Bible indicates will last for seven years\n\nThis is skin on the world war three\nAnd this cannot be changed\nNo sir but what can be changes what happens in in my life and in your life and in the lives of our family\nWhat happens to the American people can be change what's going to happen in human history cannot so there is good news well I mean we are facing a World War one world wars have happened before there were people living in Europe that we're facing the Nazis some of them survived some didn't\nBut wars happen we the history of our planet has a history of warfare that era of peace and prosperity which the world has witnessed in the last two hundred years particularly the peace and prosperity of the United states of America is and then now I'm only\nIf you look at the six thousand years of recorded history tyranny\nAnd and the absolute I mean the mayhem of ... of the violence of humanity has been the norm\n\nAnd so we're going back to a period of time you know the seasons of of our of our earth very much parallel the seasons of history and we're entering into a time of winter\nAnd we're entering into a time or you know it's a return of the dark ages if you will Elton John\nCaptured it perfectly in a in a recent hit song that he wrote where he said turn around and said good morning to the night there is a new day coming on this day will be called the night edited snuck up behind all of us\nAnd we're about to turn around and say good morning to the new day that is coming into the darkness but there is hope there is hope for the people\nWhat kind of non life so we will be mentioned in people pardon me what kind of life would be for people who are less\nWell for the Americans to survive there's going to be according to scripture there's going to be a great\nI I guess you'd call it a renaissance that the American people that they survive the war are going to ... turned to the cultural roots so far country people are going to become um religious they're going to become Christian they're going to\nBecome um religious they're going to become Christian they're going to stop all of this materialism there's going to be a return to family there's going to be a return to God there's going to be a return to the truth\nAnd for the rest of the world they're going to be given over to the darkness of the anti Christ so in many ways this war that's coming on our soil is\nIn effect a blessing because the world is turned over to the dark horse of the apocalypse the survivors in America are going to have a renaissance of righteousness\nIt's actually going to work out better for the United states than any other country on the earth accept Israel\nBut he's hunted it's a very high price\nWell you know what we are approaching you know seven plus billion people on the planet maybe nine in another ten years losing the billion to them is nothing\nTo these global puppet master it is nothing and you know when you take all of the variables into consideration George and there's a lot of variables this is a complex analysis 'cause we're talking about the\nDirection of human history what are the variables is really it often ignored is a scarcity of resources and they do the price of oil is down at present because of supply and demand\nImbalances in the market and because of the recession the global depression is continuing to weaken demand\nAnd we've had a bit of a surge of oil production out of the the Bach and region for example but the truth of the matter is we're running out of an expensive oil reserves\nAnd more important than that we're running out of all water if you look at the main aqua fires underneath the our our agricultural production regions in this country\nEvery year we we think the pumps deeper\nThings happening in China we are running out of fresh water we're running out of\nThe available resources to\nSatisfy the demand for growth the world's economic system George is built on evaluation metric that requires continued growth if we don't keep growing we have a recession which throws the whole system into chaos\nAnd the ability to continue to grow the economic system the population in the standard of living is predicated on\nA never ending supply of cheap raw materials available resources but the resources of our planet their fix their that incident and so if you look at the projection for economic growth in China and India and the other third world countries that are in dust realizing\nThey're talking about adding two hundred million more vehicles to the road and the next Twenty years that would take aggregate petroleum demand from eighty five million barrels a day which is roughly today's production and demand levels to a hundred and twenty million barrels per day\nWhere is that production coming from and when you look at the production data on the super oil field in Saudi Arabia the ... being the largest which produces about six million barrels per day which is you know roughly eight percent of the world's petroleum production go why has been produced the Nineteen fifties\nAt first they just put a straw in the ground and the oil came up without even any need to pump it because of the\nInherent pressure in the underground reservoir but by the early Nineteen sixties\nThey began to experience problems with the pressure within the field they began natural gas re injections\nBy the early seventies that stopped working they went to injection of salt water and they lined the work field with injection well it began to pump eight million barrels of salt water into the reservoir every day in the Nineteen Seventy this is going on for over forty years and the underground\nGeology has been changing the field is watering and all the perimeter wells are being shot in because the water recovery rates are\nSo high that the well is no longer economical and as a result they real more and more wells in the center of the real well beginning a couple of years ago George\nHad to go to complex lateral completion hold on Benjamin whereas the break we'll be back\nNever missed a detail must show

will go down that won't work how will be out and it's not going to come back on for several days that your final warning people\nAt the ICBM they're ready to fly get ready but back in ... Georgia it's such a huge topic and you know men have been writing and talking and you know\nIt's such a huge topic can you know men have been writing and talking and you know giving their best guess about Bible prophecy ever since the first prophetic books were written\nAnd yet the prophecies were sealed until the end of time was told that in the book of Daniel so how would you ever ... of the book it has to be revealed\nIn order for the true answer to be unsealed and how would you know the scripture says at the time at the end met him when he when we come forth out of the wilderness to give understanding to the many how would you know how would you discern the people who got\nThe true insight into these matters from the seven thousand counterfeiters who are court gestures and the palaces of Babylon well they will be authenticated there'll be evidence let me share one little story of authentication after the book came out I spoke all over the country\nAnd in one instance I went up myself without the help of God and the crowd was laughing at me and it was mostly young people in their twenties and the girls were giggling and\nI'm from building around George because this is a big subject sure a lot of elements to what's coming upon our country and after a few minutes to basically losing the audience\nThat spoke to me and said I'll take the conversation from here and the subject changed now I began to speak with authority\nAnd I told this crowd the first before judgments are ready to begin and they're ready to come forth upon you even now and I walked into the audience George and grab this young man by the upper arm\nAnd I said in the Fort judgments are going to come forth just like on your arm and I'm poking him in the arm pretty hard to while I'm saying this\nHe stands up and runs out of there and someone chased after him I just kept talking the man who chased him comes running back in five minutes interrupts me how did you know about his arm\nI said I don't even know what you're talking about I couldn't remember saying this he said well you said it would be just like his arm and that point I remember they said well I did say that but I don't know anything about his arm will be sitting in his car so scared can't drive\nThat's when he ran I said listen I don't know anything well he had a cat two of the Fort horsemen revelation on his arm or what was the first four judgments at that point that crowd that have been laughing at me suddenly stop laughing\nThey talk to him during the in times yes have these sounded\nA no not in my opinion but we have the seals are opening the rider on the white horse the first horsemen ... been writing for some time and he wears a crown anywhere is all white and yet it goes forth to conquer the earth\nBut he appears to be a good power he fights for peace and democracy\nAnd he's wearing a crowd because the nations of the earth viewed this empire at one time as the legitimate leader\nOf the nations of the world and the rider on the white horse coincidentally also lives in a White House\nWell moving rolling\nOut the one world government of these you know the policies that we pursued in the middle east could never have achieved their stated objective it was impossible ... on the leaders of our country no these things\nThe propaganda they tell the people does it make any sense if you understand the realities of the true issues we're dealing with but that doesn't stop them from using the propaganda because George the American people there dancing with the stars\nAnd they're watching their favorite and that limb NFL football team on Sunday\nAnd their understanding of any of the issues confronting our country it runs about thirty seconds deep past thirty seconds they change subjects\nThat been conditioned to think in Fifteen and thirty second impulses and white issue can be understood in thirty seconds nothing only propaganda can be injustice and so the American people are clueless\nIf the Russians would say they're not serious people now there is always aware minority that listeners of your show people that are taking the time to stay awake and listened to coast to coast people that are looking to alternative media people that are asking the kind of questions you ask on this program\nThese are the people that are alert and aware and they're like some things going on here we are not being told the truth\nGeorge\nI think that's kind of obvious to everybody was thinking right\nExactly exactly so let's get into climate change\nYeah there's a great example of where we're not being told the truth about climate change we're we're being told that man\nKind this production and consumption of fossil fuels is\nFilling the atmosphere with carbon residue which is altering the climate and in order to save the earth we need to impose restrictions even new taxes on\nCarbon consumption fuel consumption they need to strangle the economy further is there any truth to that at all know the science is the opposite those particles actually are reflective in her having the opposite effect so what is really driving climate change\nClimate is clearly changing right\nOh huge I mean I'm In St Louis right now we've had\nFour days just started to stop to ... I'm not talking about sprinkles torrential rain or the worse they say since flooding of Nineteen Ninety three\nOr were they had a five hundred years one but I mean it's just truly unbelievable forty three people died in tornadoes in slugs already in the Midwest forty three people\nAnd it's practically springtime weather on the east coast\nIt's weird I mean do we do we are in winter now is this is this change do is look all process she changed what is it\nWell the Bible said they'd be signs in the earth and climate change is one of the science there's a couple of dimensions to what's going on [noise] first there is a\nTechnology of whether warfare and there's actual laws that have been passed making it a federal offense to export any weather modification technology outside of the country because whether warfare isn't very effective way to\nWage war which you can stop the weather wars\nAnd who can really blame you I mean who really knows who's manipulating the weather right Jordan right\nPretty hard to prove that won the harp antenna versus another modified the ionosphere and redirected these wind currents\nAnd you create droughts you can just about to your crops assume your opponent you can do anything you can make your water supply dwindled away\nOh yeah you can destroy a nation by changing\nI'm Wondering if somebody's doing that to the west coast right now who are there still resume\nQuestion that the Bible said there'd be wars and rumors of war and the weather warfare technology exists\nThere's a war and the weather warfare technology\nExists I mean I've seen the legislation\nWhere it's as I mentioned in a fence to export the technology that law wouldn't be on the books if the technology didn't exist but so clearly there is whether warfare occurring that involves\nProjecting microwave energy I mean think about a hurricane it's a big spinning top right\nAnd it's a it's a thermal exchange\nSystem that is transferring heat energy into wind and that circular when he was like a spinning top and you remember when we were all young we used to\nPlay with those spinning tops I loved them all you had to do is just tap it on the side and what happened to the the spinning top knocked over you know well maybe it didn't fall over it started in a new path\nMine always wins maybe an inch\nOr you tapped it a little too hard may be too hard you needed a soft\nTouch but if you take these hurricanes they're huge spinning tops what do you think would happen if we being more microwave heat energy into the center of the hurricane\nWas right and\nWe would accelerate that he transmission and increase wind speed what if we start adding energy along one the edge of the hurricane and we start beaming a projected microwave at the edge of the storm\nWe skip it like skimming it like if you get an something spinning and he just slide your fingers real quickly along the edge it accelerates and changes direction\nIsn't something happening to our son Benjamin\nYes sir there is there something happening to every planet in our solar system in it is a scientific fact and as a result of all my work and I'm really an investigative reporter I I'm a gracious research analyst George", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Show Low", "day": "15"}
