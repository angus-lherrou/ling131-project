break we'll come back is there a shot at Elizabeth Warren could lose her Senate seat in Massachusetts that next [noise]\nElizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist front to back she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so\nThis is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty I'm no focus on Massachusetts whatsoever uh\nThis is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nBecause you're one percenters but she also herself detected fifty thousand dollars worth of closed in one year to lower her own taxes That's Elizabeth Warren\nFifty thousand dollars and old clothes that's like the Clintons deducting their use the underwear as a U.S that's all true they did it as a tax deduction by the way I don't think anybody wants their old underwear\nAnd they put a value to it you know I've always said this Jeff that basically liberals are generous only with other people's money and we had the latest numbers from twenty sixteen come out and the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers in this country don't pay three percent of the bill just three we have redistribution\n... percent pay forty percent of the bill you know I mean so I mean I don't know what else the tax cuts the fact that they want their crumbs back they want to impeach Trump they want endless investigation they want to keep Obamacare disaster they wanna lemonade eyes open borders I mean that's the whole thing and hate Trump that's it\nYeah she wants to get rid of ice in fact it was a Cambridge a warning supporter about a month ago that was arrested for putting a five hundred dollar bounty on ice officers I mean you know her rhetoric actually is dangerous in when Republicans wanting to fix health care make it actually affordable about a year ago a she was the one that said the\nRepublicans want blood money from the American\nPeople do this right after a congressman ... had been shot by\nThat Bernie Sanders supporters so you know she really doesn't seem to be able to temper her rhetoric whatsoever and I think if you saw on Monday after the backlash of putting that he'll out a and she got a lot of backlash around the country including Democrats like David Axelrod even as critical uh she went on a twenty six I Believe\nTweet a rant about Donald Trump just obsessed with Donald Trump and has no focus at whatsoever on Massachusetts and what's important here whereas a you know I've been a legislator here for eight years I've actually\nPut ... billion dollars in tax cuts back in people's pockets and they know it and we've been campaigning pretty strongly I think that again you're going to be pleasantly surprised in November sex with what happens\nIs that I Hope so are you may not notice about my background but I live five years in Rhode Island ah in Warren Rhode Island not far from the ... borders with Massachusetts and you know I spent a lot of time this is by the way when it was the greatest NBA time in history with magic\nVersus Larry Bird and and parish McHale a DJ and Danny Ainge I mean it was probably one of the best teams in one of the best rivalries ever in sports ... annual hall then up by bend a Boston a lot it's a beautiful city but I Will tell you that you know if the people of Massachusetts don't see through this I don't know what to tell them\n[laughter] we'll look Steve grow in the former quarterback probably around the time you were there is a enjoy my race to Curt Schilling endorsed had but most importantly\nBy the way where he ... he needs to indoors you [laughter] and we need to get that ...\nIs the most hated man except for the New England he's the most hated man in football number one because he's a phenomenal football player and they just don't like the fact that he wins that much and they don't like the fact that they as you know a pretty wide who used to be a model they just hate him for it\nRight well look at you know ...\nA lot has changed since you've been here\nUnemployment is now at the lowest we've seen in New England and Massachusetts since Nineteen sixty nine that's that's for the whole country but Massachusetts is even lower it said three point five percent right now warring wants to repeal the tax cuts of two thousand Seventeen that have given our state\nMore money as far as new jobs wage increases our states collected over one point two billion dollars in unanticipated revenue because of that she called the crumbs just like\nA Nancy Pelosi and she if she had her way would undo that and raise your taxes I think she said fifty percent would be the baseline and she's not sure she hit Ninety percent might be too much when she was on\nAh MSNBC a few weeks ago Ninety percent maybe too much but at least fifty percent and then of course she wants to make it fully government run health care which as we know has a thirty six\nTrillion dollar price tag attached to it and of course that puts a bureaucrat between you and your doctor a if you like government run health care that you love having a you know to wait for a hip replacement like Canadian Stewart dialysis like uh people\nHow do you think so many Canadians come to the United states when they need heart surgery because they get better care that they're willing to pay for here that's why\nRight government has to ration health care if they take it over and by the way there is no incentive to drive down costs once government becomes the guaranteed pay or just like student loans you know it was a bit worn complains about the cost of college course she\nCharged three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to teach one course at Harvard or but you know the fact is when government becomes the ... of the loans or whether it's a student defaults or not doesn't matter those\nColleges get their money and so they drive the cost of the year after year after year when government gets involved and takes the free market out of it with competitiveness then that's when costs become completely out of control for us the average Americans\nWell I Wish you the best in this race and I hope our friends of Massachusetts in Boston and everywhere in between Lola pay attention to you know the big lie of Elizabeth Warren and understand what a real true ambitions are here\nFor her to become president you got to reelect er and Jeff deal is offering a better economic vision and better security for the people of Massachusetts and I wish you well in your race or\nThink Sean if people want to get involved it's not too late field for Senate dot com T. I. E. H. L. S. O. R.

I don't care that he's friends with Jimmy Kimmel one bit and I don't care that he's defending his friend at all\nBut the fact is is that those days are big ratings on on these networks are over it's done any big news night\nWhen there is news that's covered by the big three networks we are show Hannity beats all of them you know the premier of whatever the big show is that we beat that night I'm a you know I don't even know these shows anymore I don't even watch these stupid shows it was a reality show I think it was law and order oh yea right now\nAnd the point is his ... his ratings are less than half of what I get every night listening Antarctica winning I'm not sick of winning at all and I'm very thankful to the audience that that they keep me on a working on a full time basis but I'm I'm doing my best because I Want this country to succeed more I just feel it now I Want to win so bad\nNumber one I Want to shock the world again never to I Want the successor to continue on that person I'm the forgotten man and woman that's my whole life\nI didn't grow up with any silver spoon in my mouth I worked since I was twelve eight years old delivering papers twelve years old washing dishes I you know all the people now that are getting jobs and new careers and\nWe gave the numbers out yesterday we have the the highest number of billable jobs ever in history and compared to the unemployment rate we have a million more jobs available than we do have people that are on unemployment it is a fantastic opportunity for people to\nChange jobs change careers get more money get better benefits have a greater career trajectory and their life\nSo they can maybe get a little bit better house a nicer car or truck\nThey could take the vacation go out to eat you know every other week whatever they want to do not have to worry about where the money's coming from save for retirement\nYou know get something really cool for the kids the grandkids that's all it takes money you know I've been without money and then I've have money and believe me it's a little easier when you're habits and anybody that tells you any different is full of crap", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "city": "Show Low", "day": "17"}
