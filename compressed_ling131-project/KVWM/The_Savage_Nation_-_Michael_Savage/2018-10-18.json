podcast my writings were great that wasn't the reason it's all politics I Can't do anything about it\nThere's nothing I can do about the politics of the ownership of stations do you understand that I don't own the stations they could run Mickey Mouse playing at the zoo if they wanted for three hours in in in a slot that I was and what are going to do sound better than Mickey Mouse with the ... and you can say what do you want but you don't have any control over it it doesn't matter if the show loses money\nDoesn't matter and all that matters is that the agenda is push forward especially going into twenty twenty when they get they're gearing up ready for the presidential election\nSo the only reason you listen to me at all is why well you figure this guy's a little different sometimes it comes down on this side of a of a subject sometimes that and it seems like he does it based on reason not just on on a desire to please us and he doesn't sit for three hours saluting Trump\nWhich you can gag on that one because I did not Trump that I'm angry at it's the talk show host who thinks that that's all you want to hear that's the part that bothers me\nWhat would you do if if Obama was president and you had a talk show that for three straight hours it's diluted how great Obama was Obama was there so but I'm always great Obama shoes ... by anyone shoe bomber was smarter how could you listen to that did you listen to it no\nNo the the companies that specialize in left wing propaganda\nIn radio one out of business and then when they lost their jobs they came over to the other stations and they started to get rid of conservatives taking them off the air you don't do any of this oh yeah it's a well known fact in the business\nPeople destroyed their networks by running left wing propaganda and now running other media now did you know that even in radio well in one day you'll you'll learn more about it if it's false I wouldn't say it to you\nSo how do you survive at all in this business if you're a truth teller\nThe people will find you one way or the other is that simple find you on line or they'll find you on a podcast or they'll string from somewhere that that's how it is so is then that's the way it is now ... what are we going to talk about let's go I didn't take a call earlier this is one of these days I don't know why it's so\nGood I Know why I feel good extra extra clear like a clear like Scientology a clear I don't I'm not a psychologist by no one guy was in it early on back in Queens he went into it one of the nuts and the crowd\nHe was like one of the biggest star but he made a fortune became a top guy and sign that I was surprised it went so high up in the thing\nBut he wasn't a kid's Eighteen everyone's trying to find themselves he became a Scientology I'm Talking ... like in the sixties and I'll wake up twenties ladies like one of the chief goal rules in the Scientology movement but I remember the guy to a certain things they said they were really good\nLike about headaches for example I have suffered migraine since I was a kid and he tried to have me image the headache and where it came from it actually helped me or really helped my migraines and self cure was reading Georgia salads and Mac robotics and I went on to the ten stage diet\nOf elimination I was Eighteen years old and on my own I found out which which food\nTypes trigger migraines and I rarely get a migraine today unless I slip on that diet for me it was sucrose any any refined sugars will do it for example and I know why exactly because my brain runs very hot and very fast and if it's like throwing rocket fuel into an engine\nI mean that engine will run on it but you're going to burn the engine out with my brain was sending back a single I'm going to give you a headache so you don't burn through fast and burn up the seat that's right feedback in your body and your brain if you if you learn how to listen to the signaling you want to understand that\nIf you learn how to listen to your own signaling from your brain and your body you actually could could lead yourself to states of health that you could never even believe were were possible\nBut and hears the but\nMost of us have lost contact with these signals we don't want to hear them we we've eliminated them we put earbuds in whatever what he would do is I've learned to listen to my body over the years it's not always an ice message\n[laughter] sometimes I don't want to hear what it has to say to me like don't drink ... shut up leave me alone you know I don't want don't drink that rockets not good for you tonight whatever but I I listen to a very close relationship with\nSo I took this andme acrobatic diet didn't elimination an sucrose insured my headache and the rest is history for me it doesn't mean for you maybe you love sucrose maybe like getting diabetes and cancer and heart disease I Can't stop you if that's what you want\nPeople do crazy things today based on on science so the reason I'm happy today on radio is I was able to use my my learning\nMy dissertation going back in Nineteen Seventy eight in the ... study\nStudies that I was interested in them and the relationship to Lou Gehrig's disease today\nAnd the statement by Steven all kinds of God doesn't exist because he died of allies I figure that'll be interesting but do I know if you really listening or maybe you listen to a habit of reading I don't know you could have turned off to listen to ... habit by now because you could hear everything you've ever wanted to know about the administration upgraded is around the clock ... bat\nWants that part down in the middle of his hair you know it's a terrible thing to be a good looking boy and become not so good looking and you're middle aged man wow I don't know what it's like to be like I was never like a handsome guy I was like and not known as handsome I was okay I had my share of fun but\nWhat I'm saying is what if you live on your looks and you have nothing underneath no education and no one no intellect whatsoever and you make a fortune and finally you look in the mirror and no matter what you do you have to park your hair in the middle and looked like a Lew Costello\nIn order to to cover up to the thinning hair and so you get increasingly desperate to be young and you start breaking bricks with your hand\nAnd then the whole ... manhood thing comes up\nAnd the people while they don't call your tiny I mean that was a terrible thing to do with the president I'm Talking about people in the media now call your tiny that's nothing to do with anything with the size of the brains you know what does everything have to be everything some people are in doubt mentally somewhere in doubt physically someone dad would vote someone that I Would nothing that's the human condition when he going to do about it\nBut if you're in the media and you're thriving based on your good looks you're a good guy looks and you had asked us to stay in your face starts to look like Jerry Lewis after it tell us on a in the seventies and there's nothing you can do about it I don't know what that's like that's a that's a form of torture and its own way\nAnd then as the years go on the portrait of Dorian Gray gets more and more corrupt that you know I I don't I think God and his own way has a little way of playing with people who think that they're bigger than God you know\nYou have any idea what I'm Talking about is there any doubt that knows what I mean even talking about I Wonder sometimes I think there'll be like if I run into people strangely and what's increasingly happening to me is that people have different\nCultural backgrounds of stopping me in the street like a\nYesterday I had the day off writes I go to a dentist or something just a nice lady said hello to me like she knew me so I went up and settle oh she's from Cambodia and she sent me very quietly she said\nI Lived through those camps that poll pie created my relatives were killed in them and lived through them and I was stunned here's a living woman who if you look there in the street would say she's ... she's a liberal Senate Democrats\nThe woman who have you looked during the street would say she's a ball she's a liberal send the Democrats are always think that if someone's from Asia there were a liberal or someone's African American there were a liberal or someone's gay there you have no idea what a person's politics are really you can't tell by looking at people you you just can't you know that\nYeah well okay like some cops for
