I don't know but what I realized was when we're talking about the young and how are we going to get people to tune in to a conservative talk radio\nI left went out to the will of the north Dakota right worked in the oil field\nAnd now in the evening I came in after scrubbing toilets a certain amount of cleaning business out there I had a cleaning and catering business right yeah so\nI come in at night and I was in my truck because that's where I could contain audio and I hated the ballot the angel of show and it was created for people that don't normally listening to talk radio so the silent majority Eighteen year old rock next six year old black liberal women were listening to my showing at the highlight of it\nI had a following of like twenty thirty some thousand\nAlso internationally as well\nThat's good for you well let me ask you this\nI'm back here in Minneapolis and it might actually go read and do the job that we need to do and prove to try that we a hundred

there's some really good signs here for going red in Minneapolis\nThe last thing is I Want to remind people there are very important house races in uh Minneapolis or in well in Minnesota for this race um that are going to tip the balance of power like Southern California it's interesting New York New Jersey\nOr places like Minnesota Wisconsin Michigan California state you wouldn't expect\nThat's where a lot of these tossup races but I keep talking about our um look let me ask you when you move to North Dakota and you're in the ... this radio show and you started your own business did you make a lot more money\nUm yeah I mean here I mean\nWere in such a bad recession in Minneapolis and when I moved out there I mean that excitement and all the jobs and I got to say I want to give us out to the oil fields because contradictory\nTo what a lot of people here about a boom and and we'll just and I met some of the finest people in the world and the most hard working and I got to live the American dream which really didn't exist back then but I got to run\nThem I Want to encourage you to keep going and doing what you're doing following your dreams and lots of great things are going to continue to happen and I'm telling you to carry the state of Minnesota force right thank you though Bella call back again a eight hundred nine four one Sean is er toll free telephone number you want to be part of the program\nBut we're all male and state every all ballots have been out for ... for a week and a half now and so every day's election day every day is election day I got the most left wing opponent I've ever had\nA you know she she woke up the day after Hillary law and decided that you need to be a member of Congress and there's much more angry protests Seattle increase in the district hating the president's our qualification to be a member of Congress fish on I think we're all hoping for more than that aren't we\nDo you get it well of course we are we want to help the forgotten men and women and we have a trajectory of success or that I think has been unparalleled the as quick as any politician as promised stuff and then make those promises happen\n[noise] yeah it's it's just ridiculous that's essentially what she's running on anger and so we're we've been doing everything going door to door or a thousand out personally I'm a second pair of shoes\nOr when people become make phone calls door co workers volunteer contribute you know Dino Rossi dot com come out\nYeah what what do you think do you get a day by day return in terms of a Republican Democrat or do they not give that information out there\nWe don't register by party in our state so it's only based on what we've I deed and er and our people are voting but so we're there's clearly in a master we really got to get a meal and about anybody listening to us right now you haven't sent her to do it now get your family to do it all your friends get it in because\nOf the super comes in the same or ... or or at least you can get to the heart cases who may or may not for us we talked to him\nWell she's just writing running basically on hate as you said so that's the main difference she wants Obamacare let me guess she wants to impeach the president Xi wants open borders she wants the crumbs back anything else that's any different from the rest of the checklist of every other Democrat running well\nThat is a checklist we have a few other things that are that we're in the hat obviously we we're we don't have a state income tax or state she favorites that that's been turned down nine times by the public or your but she's she's still on that bandwagon\nOr you know into your time for a for not being a fan of Obamacare when Obamacare team in Iraq's healthcare myself my wife and my my four children and I ended up with a lousy plan to cast too and at times as much didn't cover things that weren't covered everything 'cause I didn't want covered\nThe twelve thousand dollar family deductible on top of that you know my goal is to have as many health insurance companies chasing people around for their business we could possibly get so you can decide what's your plan or some bureaucratic politician deciding for you it's called freedom\nWell listen we wish you the best Dino Rossi a that is the difference in this between Republicans and a conservative agenda or the radical left agenda Nancy Pelosi I keep reminding people vote for any Democrat anywhere in the country is a vote for her and it is because they'll electric speaker\nAnd a vote for any Democrat in the Senate well that's pretty much a vote for Schumer so I Hope the people in Washington state's eighth district get out there for Dino Rossi uh I Know you have done a good job and you worked hard and a sadly you have to take all of the incoming it's pretty pathetic\nUm but thank you so much for being with us and we wish you all all the best is just one of those races the Washington state eighth

I Can't complain because I'm basically much talking about you everybody knows you vote\nHas nothing to do with the voting I said oh we can do is informed people\nHas everything to do with the voting no it has everything to do with every but my my vote is meaningless in New York for the most part\nNow we know we're in a blue state so we do the best we can still voting I thought every year we do our civic duty\nAnd but I Am saying look look at where it's important to look at what states presidents do whatever the you know doing eight states than eleven rally blitz California Florida Iowa Ohio we need you go go when you know at the end for example we sucked up Obama for eight years it wasn't good for the country\nYou know what we would suck up a Nancy Pelosi as speaker one more time but I'd rather not\nI'd rather keep the progress that we've made the last two years going keep the momentum going I'm well we'll deal with it either way um there are three possible outcomes total victory split decision house and Senate or a horrible night you decide the American people have the power", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "year": "2018", "city": "Show Low", "day": "31"}
