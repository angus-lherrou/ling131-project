Connecticut John what do you advise we do when the mob comes for you\n[noise] Hi I'm a what I Do is whenever I go to restaurants I always\nMake sure I faced with or see who's coming in\nAs far as the crowd goes and if I saw a crowd coming in I Would get on the phone call the police that probably tell the police there's a crowd coming in and I think I saw somebody with a gun\nAnd I would think the police would show up um [noise] but uh I've been in a martial arts for forty nine years and a way what you've been you've been in what I'm In a martial arts for forty nine and\nI thought you said you've been in the mob for forty nine years okay go ahead\nNo nothing about uh oh I found myself I've actually had people in my face threatening\nMe uh but I always find when you stand up for bully they back down but the case of a mob I Would try to pinpoint food or leader was who seem to be the the strongest one they have like a wolf pack tally ... Peter\nAnd the rest will fold I've experienced it at least three times in my life for more than one person trying to attack and the minute I took out figure guy or the the one that I thought was the leader and ended it\nOr you didn't you like the cold from the lawyer in Reno about the soldier who was surrounded by this mob of left wing ... through one of them through a plate glass window didn't did you feel good hearing that\nI absolutely loved it because he's for his right to protect themselves but I Would also stand up you don't want to sit down and you want to stand up on a person in the ... because that drop fear for the brain ghost outfit they're sharing and his first day in the eyes\nWell Eric holder said that when they go low we kick them so you're actually just responding to Eric Holder's threats\nQuite I Would love to talk to hold her about that uh because uh I don't think he has the guts to say\nWell we're not trying to start with trying to stop violence in the country remember my book title is not mass hysteria it stopped mass hysteria I Am on with my audience understands this was a book of history and I believe that unless we we damp it all down we're going to get what it's going to get much worse and very bad for all of us\nAnd when when you have Hillary Clinton than Eric Holder the former chief law enforcement America saying basically committed violence it's going to get worse because what they're doing is giving a green light to these mobs that's what they're doing it's mob mentality mentality a mob violence and they're encouraging them\nI had somebody in my face and a ... a parking lot screaming at me telling me it's your fault it's your fault that on the ... it was like oh 'cause I had voted for Trump and he knew I'd vote for Trump\nI was standing there doing absolutely nothing I talk to anybody the whole ironic that's got got within one inch vice face screaming at which point asking for backup nicely and when he didn't I yelled at and it caught him off guard for second any backed up and\nSo you use voice command like he was a dog in other words\nAbsolutely absolutely\nBut a lot of them are very intimidated by a man who will stand up to them with a loud voice there's no question ...
