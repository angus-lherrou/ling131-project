New York magazine who's ignored me for twenty five years even though I'm On New York and they are you know most of the people who write for New York magazine aren't even from New York\nThat's the irony I actually was born in how many people are right for New York magazine are actually born in New York I don't know they're probably from somewhere else I Would think\nSo now New York magazine a ... you know they weren't that bad as as prominent conservatives think the bomb scares are liberal hoax so that's almost neutral and in the way they did it\nThen the Newsweek says Michael Savage the conservative host at least they at least polite about it and reasonably calling me the conservative house thank you of the radio show Savage which has an audience of millions every which is all true\nBut at least they were dignified in their attacks Newsweek I got to give it to them New York Mac prominent conservatives think the bomb scares her liberal hawks it somewhat that sooner dignified prominent conservatives you got that right but please call me Dr Savage when you refer to me\nBecause if you called that fraud Dr Ford doctor every minute with such a\nSuch sacred tones doctor for dentist Dr Ford that that you think she was bigger than Dr Freud Dr Ford Dr Ford said this Dr Ford said that since a PHD that's real which I have\nFrom a great university greater than hers by the way and my publications great out just great out distance anything that Dr fraud published please refer to me is Dr Savage now since you recognize that PHD's are have value\nAnd it also adds a certain or of respectability to me to call me whatever you want make sure you call me Dr Savage do whatever you do to be fair now since you believe so much into Dr business\nBut the main thing is you don't even have to call me that just trying to analyze what I'm saying for the sake of the nation do you actually think it's unreasonable to be skeptical about these things in your heart of hearts are you not skeptical yourself\nAll you people are right for New York magazine the Daily Beast come on when you're alone by yourself in the toilet\nIn the darkest moments of your upper loneliness at night when you see you have no friends because of your main meanness and your horrible politics after all the paid volunteers have gone home and you're alone and you wonder where you went wrong in life you have no wives no husbands no children\nAnd you ask yourself all that sex and no children where did I go wrong\nThat's the one line I Love that's my favorite line by the way to the deviant she'll do try to attack me they think they can get to me I look at them and they say all that section no children they don't have an answer for that one\nBecause that's the way of life that's the normal way of life and it has been from the beginning of time and it will be until the end of time which is children children it's all about the children and and what I Love his all those to talk about the children most don't even have any they generally have no children\nThey all look like Donna Shalala I don't understand that the ones who are most interested in children have not ... how does that work\nWhy are they qualified even talk about your children if they never raised one what did they know about raising a child they stayed up night with a child with the flu and lost sleep\nHave they ever gone to school with a child who couldn't do math or because they were so distracted and put aside their own self interests\nHave they ever gone to plays they didn't want to sit through for their children have they sat on soccer fields in the cold to cheer on their son no but they're all experts on raising children isn't that interesting and those of us are actually raise children are sneaker that as readers\nBy these wonderful people who have taken over our society you see what I'm saying\nAt least that's how I see it\nAnd I just don't buy this right now this little particular\nCharade I I don't doubt that tomorrow the next day they'll dig summing up I have a trailer park\nAnd then there'll be a Jack Ruby right afterwards first they'll get to Lee Harvey Oswald\nIn the Ku Klux Klan outfit or the or at our a outfit whatever and there's probably not an honorary outfit like uh I Would say camouflage jacket with a Trump a sticker on a Trump flag or something a Trump pat the ultimate a villain here would be somebody with the ... hat\nAnd enter a sticker on a camouflage jacket with a Confederate flag or shown on it right holding a copy of stop mass hysteria saying he's a member of the ...\nThat would be the perfect the perfect villain marched out and then they'll have a script in his hand it gets some out of prison in Tallahassee or Georgia I don't know and the law firm like let's say you have free healthcare for his family for three generations if he'll take the fall\nAnd maybe a you know some money thrown in with a one way trip to the Virgin Islands on a Sicilian fishing boat\nAnd then they'll say it'll declaring yes I got all my ideas from talk radio I listen to talk radio and I know that all these people are evil trying to destroy America the new world orders and that's why I did it that could happen\nAnd if it happened several live with it that's all\nWhat am I going to do I don't know what tomorrow will bring\nAll I can do is take it one day at a time and use the powers of reason that God gave me and it's not yet taken away from me back yesterday when I don't know that I could I Can't quote the person but yesterday I went to the ... radio studios in San Francisco where I started twenty five years ago\nIn March and I was actually earlier than out of the march fourth in two thousand in Nineteen Ninety four was my first show but I went in there\nAnd it was like twenty five years went by in the blink of an eye I Swear to you it's amazing just what your grandmother's set the you or your father time goes by so quickly and it does\nDo you know that I've been on the radio for a quarter of a century and these very same forces that an out destroying America tried have tried to destroy me for a quarter of a century they've used every trick in the book they've taken me off stations they've tried to ... slander me\nThey've used media matters to try to get my advertisers to run away and they've succeeded at that and yet somehow I'm Still here\nI won't be forever come January you won't be able to hear me in certain markets because they've succeeded politically and removing the most independent conservative voice in the country but I still will be heard across America or on some stations for an hour or two and also on on whatever they call it podcasting which will be an original podcast\nSo you know there's a funny thing today they can only control so much for so long and and now that they've lost control of the narrative itself\nI think they're trying to take control of a new narrative\nWatch control of the narrative itself I think they're trying to take control of a new narrative in my opinion that's what they're doing here\nThey've already distorted America's view of the population\nThere making you think that a good percentage of the population is gay or lesbian or transsexual in fact the healthiest ... part of society or gay lesbian transsexual that's what they want you to believe\nAnd so you'll this is not to be about to read to
