Paterson who memory he carried the nuclear football under the Clinton Administration\nWrote the book derelict dereliction of duty a welcome ... W brand and tell me your story what made you decide you worry I guess pretty laugh to a Democrat and you started this campaign in this whole thing for you is gone absolutely viral what happened\n[laughter] so um it's great to be her son thank you um so I you know my whole life I considered myself a liberal and my whole adult life I considered myself so I was the Democratic party voter I always voted Democrat\nUm and that was true leaving in two thousand and sixteen I went and voted for Hillary Clinton and I was one of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all the media has been telling me for months and months at a Donald Trump didn't have more than a three percent chance of winning\nAnd they also had been telling me for months and months that he was a racist at a big it in a humble both and a monster and basically the second coming with Hitler and his followers or no better and you know they I think that the liberal media that\nFor me as they did for millions of others are very effective job scaring people making people believe these stories and this narrative that they're trying to push so when Trump got elected I was terrified and I was one of these people going on social media\nRanting you know screaming sometimes crying you know saying you know I'll never understand how people could vote for for this monster and on one particular day I had posted about um you know I\nI'll never be able to understand how people could vote for a man who stood before a cheering crowd and mocked her reporters disability and it was on that day in January of two thousand Seventeen but somebody\nReached out to me after reading my Facebook posts and said listen\nI'm just asking have you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled debunking that Trump mocked the disabled reporter and for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign trail but some of it even goes back\nTen years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice in that exact same gesture as he did that day when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter\nBut what's clear when you watch the compilation is that this is a a voice in a bit that Donald Trump does when he's imitating someone who is caught in a lie or doing something shady or grumbling because they've been caught doing something dishonest and I\nI Know some stupid and our son but it's like it was the first time in my entire life that I really realized that the media was capable of creating a completely false narrative and then isolating a moment out of contact to push that merits if it had nothing to do with news or the truth\nBrand that let me ask you something now once your eyes open and once you become aware of their bias and it's like you you you ask yourself out of ... myself and it's even worse than it's ever been how did you not see it before do you ever say that to yourself\n... yeah yeah it's absolutely the kind of thing that once you see it you can't see it and what you just said is actually kind of the next\nPart of the story because then I went back to the beginning of the campaign and revisited all of those other moments like Trump calls all Mexicans rapists Trump advocates for the sexual assault of all women and you know I went back and revisit those moments and found the same thing time and again that's not what happened\nThat is not what happened but they made a decision after he won that primary or it was clear that he was going to win the Republican primary that it wasn't funny anymore that he was running suddenly it was scary and that they had to turn this man into the the scariest candidate that the world had ever seen so\nLet me ask you this but when I tell my audience\nTo expect and I showed a lot of the ads that are out last night and I've been I've been showing these instances people that are in the public eye that are conservative or support the president you know they're being run out of restaurants I'm Talking about women and children good luck to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I give it your best shot\nYou know I noticed that it either happens to a guy with his wife\nOr an older person or women\nYou know what when there are a bunch of cowards the when they do that because I'd never treat anybody that way but you know this is the narrative every two and four years in elections in America that Republicans are racist or sexist massage in is that there\nAre homophobic Xena phobic Islamophobia that they want dirty air and water Obama use those actual words\nThat they want children to die\nAnd they'll have some commercial with the Paul Ryan look alike thrown granny over the cliff because they want to kill your grandmother that's what they do that to their play book we're watching it unfold today even Thirteen Days out of the election um do you see now that all of that is not true there's not one thing\nThat is true about that look look at the stakes for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nUm the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded for these demographics ever\nYeah no absolutely seeing that now and in fact I think a lot of others are starting to see it as well which is resulting in what you just said that even I think the most ah these minority groups in particular that I think the Democratic party for so long has taken for granted that this oh these are just automatic vote well\nThat's not the case anymore I mean people really are starting to wake up and they're starting to walk away because they're seen so\nHow many people have joined your movement\nSo the movement began on Facebook and then that are rich in that\nFirst initial Facebook group we now have over two hundred and five thousand of president or something like ... yeah all social media platforms we have about four hundred thousand it to be clear for anyone who doesn't know this is a testimonial campaign\nSo these are people who are going on social media and clicking follower clicking like they are telling their stories about why they are walking away so I mean they're they're making videos they're writing these stories down I mean people are\nThey are walking away so I mean they're they're making videos they're writing these stories down I mean people are there this is for like a network of support and people are leaving are walking away from the less\nOf a let me bring in bus Patterson as we've been around

was right in the middle of the Kavanaugh hearings and he was being a lunatic\nAnd I ... I was ... was going on man I'm I have no what am I going to confront him on the street and didn't scream adamant that I mean I don't get this behavior I don't it's not affected by sort of like come on my show one day here's my number that's it why are people locked in a way\nYeah well you know my story ... I I yeah I went up to the White House or as a air force\nLike slate in LA and ... for two years after I left that position of the ... of\nThe dating and travel and better if they were after last night I also walked away so I mean I'm not quite that the transformation that Brandon as but I I went in as a military officer proud to serve less\nResulted in election and then landed at ... media and the obligation weaken the granite it'd be a great tabloid checking your dog people to be walking away and get the money and I can't wait I mean it's going to be fun and it's also got to be an\nEthics to send a signal to the rest of the country get in a crowded party stands for nothing get substantial a fetish\nA live band talked it mainstream media specialized thank God for you shot of what you do um that it's time for people to wake up whether you know I'll tell\nYou one thing I don't like being lied about um you know twenty twenty I I don't I'm not a racist and I don't want to be called one I'm not a sexist or massaging is or a homophobic Xena photo Islamophobia I Want clean water not dirty water clean air not dirty air\nI Love all children they're all children a God\nAnd I I Believe that you know what we got to take care of the elderly whether they can afford it or not\nWe're a country rich enough to be able to do that these lies that they tell really pissed me off because that is not any conservative Brandon that I Know but conservative policies especially when you compare them the eight years of failure of Obama we see a dramatic turn around\nFor the forgotten men and women in this country in other words Sean Hannity Thirty years ago that's what I Want for the country\nI think that's what we all watch uh for the country\nI Am glad you guys are doing this event it's on the twenty seventh it's wearing a DC\nWashington DC right that we're having to walk away march on Washington from the national all it's going to be John Marshall park starting at twelve o'clock Saturday and then we're ending up at freedom plaza for the main rally which all year round two thirty yeah\nAll right and is there any website for people to sign up or they just show up\nWhat they should just show up but they could also go to walk away march dot com which is what they're gonna find tons of detailed information about the day that Saturday walk her arts dot com\nAll right good luck to both of you and uh it's an interesting story a transformation a brand and then I I think that if it fits perfectly with Winston Churchill's observation that if you're twenty and not a liberal you don't have a heart and if you're forty and not a conservative you don't have a brain", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "city": "Show Low", "day": "24"}
