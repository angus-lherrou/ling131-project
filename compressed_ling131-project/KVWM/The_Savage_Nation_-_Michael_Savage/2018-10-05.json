Germany and where does it lead well\nIt could lead if there's a downturn in the economy let's say a blowout hits that's that she this is what triggers at all if we have an economic blowout in in the west a a right wing leader will arise that will make Trump look like what he is which is a liberal or centrist\nAnd things will happen to you can't believe are happening and what happened so fast you'll say it's not happening and liberalism will be there was the reason for it you say it can happen here well it will happen here\nAnd the economic downturn that as being predicted by some\nEconomists is a is inevitable it's going to happen that I'm afraid of it happens it will be worse than ever\nBecause we're the heightened now of the stock market the inflation is out of control incidentally right underneath the surface they're printing money right now in a way I've never seen it done in this country in the country's history\nThere for just printing money and under the Democrats when we criticized deficit spending we were right because I'm a fiscal conservative but all fiscal conservatives have doubled up they shut their mouths you but you're anyone in the radio talking about the run away and the the excuse me the uh\nThe deficit no not one person they all want to go in there and get the or the treatment\nThey all want to get a tour of the oval\nBut someone's got to say stop printing the money this is crazy because someone's gonna have to pay for that\nThey're supposed to go on forever you want to wind up taking a wheelbarrow of cash or credit cards to buy a loaf of bread as happened in why mark Germany at the ... just before all of this that or take a whole wheelbarrow full of paper currency to buy a loaf of bread that's how fabulous the money I become\nNow several years ago I wrote a book called trickle down tyranny you'll still find it on Amazon but I Will bet that the company has not removed a personal attack reviews on that book and all my other books the way they did by cutting nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book what happened\nYes that's right not enough you find stop mass hysteria next week up there what you will you'll find all the negative reviews left stuck there\nSome of them posted by the enemy America some of them posted by enemies of Michael Savage a but none of them will be taken down the way nine hundred negative reviews of Clinton's book were removed and this practice demonstrates exactly how that concept works\nSo if you think that things are great now good for you and I hope they stay forever but nothing stays forever if history teachers us anything there were cycles to a kind of me there are cycles to a political views and I pray that as I write on page three oh three\nThat is where when and how the carcass of the once great United States will become nothing more than ... for the masses as China and India rise we will sink even deeper and we may well do it without hysteria because Americans by than traditional Americans hardworking roll up your sleeves Americans\nWill be too tired and feel to consistently betrayed sound familiar will be too tired and feel to consistently betrayed to dispirited to fight back\nPage three oh three stop\nMass hysteria [noise] so if you're a serious person and you are offended by the the generosity of our time and your offended by how modern liberalism is bringing this country to its knees you've got a place to go\nTrust me on that one [noise]\nJoined the Savage Nation coal no fly by four hundred seven eight five

playing a dirty trick on you they want you to think you must pay it all back and that's simply not drew\nCredit card companies hated when we expose their secrets in fact there are ways you can become debt free and you don't have to pay the entire amount you owe national debt relief offers programs that help you escape overwhelming credit card debt national debt relief has helped tens of thousands of people just like you reduce more than one billion dollars of debt\nNational debt relief has earned an a plus rating with the better Business Bureau they're also the number one rated debt relief program by top consumer reviews and top ten reviews\nUm it still had six seven eight hundred billion dollars of deficits which I had to explain to my clients\nThe government was not bringing in enough money in taxes to pay the bill which included the interest which meant they had to borrow money to pay the interest where\nAre you talking about our government now under Donald Trump\nThis is just this is federal only yes as a\nSpecial way I Want to get this ... you're saying our government right now is is printing money to such an extent that they have to borrow money to pay the interest\nYup every time there's a news article where they're the deficit the deficit means they are not bringing in enough revenue to pay the bill and one night\nSo in other words weight would let me just summarize for the people who are listening we complained bitterly under Obama and the liberals when they taxed and spent we should all the Democrats stand for tax and spend well now we have an administration that stands for spending spent today on one hand cut taxes and they spend more than Obama did\nAnd you're saying that the the dislocation is so great that what's going to happen is what I Want to know\nWell I Will tell you so when I was talking to my clients and they would say so what does that mean I Would say if you want to see what it's going to look like look at Greece does anybody know with Greece look like as an economic powerhouse\nNo tell us what what was it a more weight how about it on our own hemisphere how bout of Venezuela could we go as bad as that\nYeah they're all the same I mean huge economic inequities when you're just not paying your bills and you're borrowing and you're wondering and you're borrowing eventually it has a real economic consequences\nSo why don't the wise men around Donald Trump tell him about this like missed the call on why don't they tell him that\nWell I understand the real world of politics and I understand that the politicians her job is just to get reelected ... that I Do not understand is don't these politicians have children don't they understand the world that they are creating for their children that's\nWhat I thought what is the what is the world that's being created right now what will it look like give us give us if there's a an economic a severe economic downturn what does it look like\nWell I don't want to go as a as a volatiles riot but you know eventually reach a point where people have had enough\nAnd England but there have been bread riots in history in our own country we had riots over food when we had the great depression there were riots people starving in this country\nWhere I can tell you what's gonna happen and probably in in ... in the short term is people don't understand how social she currently works\nThere is no real savings account and Social Security or money just goes into the general account and then when the benefits are paid a comes out of the general accounting\nRight when Social Security was first started you at a loving people paying the benefits for the one beneficiary now you have about two and a half people working to pay the benefits of the beneficiaries and one of the what\nWhat ... what about all the people faking disability on on the disability racket in America what about all the drug addicts about what about all the oxycontin addicts don't work who's paying for all of this we are the taxpayer that's\nTotally if you take a look at the statistics of who's actually paying taxes there was a very interesting statistic about\nThem the ... the tax money where the the left is talking that they want the rich people to pay more taxes\nBut if you look at the statistics the rich the top five percent are paying more as a percentage of the federal tax revenue are paying more now than they did Twenty years ago\nThat's right and the top one percent and that way and the top one percent which is everybody in the media\nThey make no mistake about it all these wild left this there in the top zero one percent are paying most of the taxes the country that is if they're paying legitimately and I can't speak for anyone else I Will tell you right now I'm paying more taxes on the Trump's tax plan that I did before at the you know that living in California\nWell let me tell you my taxes\nWent up in other words or the Donald Trump's show called tax plan as a Californian it doesn't matter that I'm a conservative or a libertarian whenever you wanted to find me I still try to find me I I Wish you good luck I'm paying more on the Donald Trump's tax plan that I did under Obama's did you know that yeah well what's really\nBiggest and so is everyone in New York even if there is a right wing ... because you cannot deduct state taxes from federal anymore\nNobody since fifty percent of the population doesn't even work\nAnd another large percentage are illegal aliens who pay no taxes and people don't even care\nThe underground economy is so big right now people don't even know anything about these things but the so called tax plan that was supposed to be a great salvation for me as a Californian a is such that I'm paying more taxes than I did before did you know that does anyone who really you're not allowed to say anything about it oh hush hush don't say that\nAnd he went to New York though what I'm Talking about any ... any of the those of you listening to the show or fiscal conservatives who are are paying more than you did under Obama because I Know you are you can already ducked your New York state\nTaxes your state taxes from your federal taxes that you know that whereas we couldn't have passed All right I I see the same thing that handwriting is on the wall it's not a very very pretty picture and I tried to tell you this with a history not an allegory I talked about the ah rhyme our republic\nWhere the moral corruption offended most Germany's Germans but they couldn't do anything about it and then along came a after the people were ... hungry\nAnd the violence or the left got too great for them\nAs we now have with down the FAA and the Occupy people with the masks who are beating up Republicans chasing senators chasing right wing or as they say calling anyone who they disagree with a fascist there will be there will be the equivalent of what happened in Germany in this country as sure as I'm sitting here\nYou may not think it's going to happen I Believe the underground there's already bubbling up to the surface and it will happen and when the political assassinations start from the left which they posted about two weeks ago\nDo you remember what they said on the phone they published a statement saying we want you to go out during the day and make believe you for the country and for each other and for the common good but at night put on your mask and kill those political opponents kill them they said\nGo out and kill they said that's the left wing in this country that's the ... that's the far left they say go out and kill\nWell do you think this is going to just go on in its own you think people are gonna sit there like ten pins waiting to be shot and executed I don't think so these are very volatile ... times they're being whipped up by the Democrats politicians and to me the apex of all of it was the Kavanaugh hearings\nBy the Democratic politicians and to me the apex of all of it was the Kavanaugh hearings they came along just at a time where the American people finally saw how vicious how vicious and malicious\nThese people are and I started my show by asking a loaded question\nWho benefited more from the destruction of capital Dems Republicans I Will tell you from my point of view and I believe that I have as good a stethoscope to America as hard as anyone in this country after a quarter of a century of listening to the heartbeat of America I Will tell you that to harass or us hacks\nAnd the other
