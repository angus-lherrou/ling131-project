the president has been awesome with this theme I think absolutely spectacular and disrupt period we've been gone for over the past couple of years\nAnd if you if they listen while you're come back and rebuild later but uh you know I I fear for people who stay in the way of\nWell I Do too that's why I always tell people just just listening to authorities I Know people have said because I'm I'm looking and seeing online and and various media sites social sites people are literally live streaming the hurricane and there's some of them are even on the beach for crying out loud meaning that\nThey're ... they're showing that probably live streaming away from the center because I don't think anybody's live streaming where this this thing's a bulldozer about twenty miles wide bulldozers wherever it's coming in directly\nIt looks like Panama City was on the west side of the wall and you know I guess his court say porch saint Joe it's got to be you know I I fear for that area in there and you\nCalled it perfectly said Panama City was ground zero it was and you also talked about the direction that the storm would hit you are right about that which as you predicted yesterday and and the day before and ... Sunday that the angle at which the storm was coming in made it that much more devastating\nYeah and again it's different from a different from Florence Florence did not come in at her peak this came in all guns blazing as far as intensity goes\nAnd it's one of these cases where everything came together but you could see it coming together even back on Saturday and Sunday as you do I do do you know like I said that email out saying ... plan to show and see what's going to go on this week I've got some good news for you we're not going to be talking about a more hurricanes this year hitting the United states wants we're done with this one\nDoes it was going to be the last one of the season uh last\nImpacts doormen our coasts yes I Believe\nYou know why it's so important that we put you on and you have this incredible encyclopedic knowledge of every hurricane that's ever hit the United states for crying out loud but\nMore importantly with the knowledge that you have you can import that knowledge to our audience and you can save people's lives because you know think about you know the years before media we had meteorologist and the ability satellite imaging for example and the ability to actually track and follow these storms\nAnd all of a sudden people will wake up and they're in a category four or five hurricane and they had no idea where it came from um ...\nThirty eight hurricane you know you lived out on Long Island is\nLegendary their those people had no idea what was coming in\nWhite Joan I'm old but I'm not that old I wasn't there for the thirty eight hurricane in Long Island but I wasn't here\nIt's legendary out there\nWhen you look at it on to well\nI saw a hurricane Gloria destroy my sister's house so I did watch that and ah it hit pretty hard back in the

together they pre positioned a lot of the supplies that you will be needing a I Know a lot of you are going to be very devastated by the loss of\nOf their homes et cetera but I'm the American people the most generous on earth and many hope we can give you I Know that will be available as soon as this thing passes I pay attention\nThose that are in Augusta heading up to Columbia South Carolina because that's going to be in your area tomorrow with eighty to a hundred mile per hour winds that's pretty devastating\nAre All right let's get to our busy telephones here as we say Hi to read says in Charleston South Carolina Reese Hi how are you glad you called\nThank you sir thank you for taking my call I'll be brief out which is calling in and I'm Wondering what the possibility of getting the president to\nEither director suggests the OJ that we go after these false accusers whether it be the DNC Hillary Mrs for if not for a criminal part but for the civil part and it costs the wild goose chases they were sent on uh\nTrying to investigate these things from ties and and so on and so forth and then strengthen the laws against false accusations 'cause they ruin people's lives\nOh I you know I never said this but you really think about it\nAll of that information was disseminated to the American people\nLie to the American people to feed them propaganda misinformation so that they vote a certain way but more importantly then after the election that they lost in spite of all of these efforts all of the lying that kind of always takes place\nWhen and that's what the Democratic party does every two and four years in spite of all that then they use this phony information again and again and again have a media league strategy\nFeeding information from one source to multiple sources to seem like it's a real story when it was a concocted story a scam if you will and that creates an atmosphere where everybody calls for a special counsel and now we're discovering\nAnd that creates an atmosphere where everybody calls for a special counsel and now we're discovering that people were talking about\nWell the ... and the FBI now admitting that they had no evidence of Russian collusion at all that's why they disseminated the information that's why they leaked it to their friends in the media that we're willing\nYou know accomplices and all of this and then they talk about on doing a presidential election surreptitiously going out and recording the president unbeknownst to him so that they can then invoked the twenty Fifth Amendment and then I guess the whole insurance policy is in place done and finished\nI mean that's what happened here\nYes sir and all these things are again being being paid for by the taxpayer and we're basically taking it in the rear end every time they do this\nAll true there's and unfortunately\nYou know when I say this is the biggest abuse of power scandal\nCorruption in American history I Am a thousand percent right and we still haven't gotten it right there's a reason Rod Rosenstein does not wanna testify have the information recorded or do it under oath because he knows he's up to his eyeballs and every aspect of all this\nAnd yet he's the guy that has all the power I mean it's amazing he's in the literally the well the eye of the hurricane if he well\nAll right ... thank you appreciate it I'm let us go to James in Cleveland James how are you glad you called\nI Am fantastic Sean thank you for asking 'em for small like to get my thoughts and prayers and everybody on the coast going through the hard times down there\nHopefully uh everybody has the right thing in places shape and got out of there I was saying but the reason I called actually is because I wanted to tell you that I I was a number of Trump or back in two thousand sixteen\nAnd I completely changed my whole point of view on that\nI didn't think he was electable and I didn't think was conservative back then and I was wrong in fact I lost a hundred dollar bet with a fellow truly mind over it paid him up the next day pretty much since day one I've ended up sending his actions are the president's done a fantastic job here to help my family\nMyself so much I can remember three things in my entire life that I've noticed that the federal government actually do for me first was the Bush tax cuts [noise]\nNow this fabulous cut from the European Trump this time around as her so much money in my pocket\nYou know the other thing that affected me was when my Cadillac plan was canceled because the CIA and Obamacare has cost me nine thousand dollars out of pocket since my company dumped are Cadillac plan when I Do think you know grounds for that and thank you Republicans for me more money in my pocket\nYou know I'm Glad you said all of that because there are a lot of people out there that are still the never Trump or land and they won't recognize it look I can understand that they don't like the president's style\nUm it's maybe ... ... it's at odds with how they would manage things but you cannot argue that he's governing as a strong conservative that gets results and I'll take results over rhetoric any day\nAnd ah I Wish some of the other people that were in your camp would would be as intellectually honest\nOr as you are and I applaud you for doing so ah and I'm Glad you're doing well I'm Glad your family's
