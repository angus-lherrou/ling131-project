newspapers meaning of among what does that headline stop mass hysteria America's on Saturday from the sandwich Charles with Trump which on she had to change the minds of people just with the cover\nSo I was feeling so good I decided to not go anywhere I decided to cook at home\nAnd I could do a whole segment right now in frying pans and you know that\nI'm so into like when I Want to cook I can taste the difference between the food cooked in one frying pan and another I usually used an skit for example none skit bans I use I Threes and the convenience whenever last night I pull out I'm a little weird with stuff I had a frying pan I bought two years ago I never use the ... not an on skid\nI like save things they're gonna find things I bought that will never used in my life I don't know why buy them if I'm not using them\nI buy like a beautiful frying pan so I don't have the ...\nSo I hooked on that last night the food tasted different tasted better I didn't taste I don't know what I think the ... the nuns skin plastics are breaking off into our food there's no question about it no matter what they tell you it's like bottled water I gotta tell you this I was drinking\nI should mention that brand let's say a plastic bottled water for years because I didn't want the fluoride and I didn't want some of the other you know stuff in an attack on the right\nAnd you know you get used to it but you don't realize you're drinking plastic\nSo my son says no no you can only drink bottled water from bottles he sends me cases of and I love him he loves me so much I'll tell you the truth I Can't go back to the plastic Warner anymore the minute I put it to my mouth ... plastic and it's not psychological I can taste the plastic and the water\nDoesn't make sense they put the water in a bottle seven thousand miles away it sits at the bottom of a ship\nThe plastic breaks down in the hold of the ship that in the warehouse then in the truck\nOf course you're going to taste plastic if you've got to find so I mean it's a different things like the frying pan so out of the frying pan into the fire so to speak\nSo it's not a political statement on making it all just like I'm not blaming anyone say the communist did it a Bernie Sanders didn't do it to me the pope did make the frying pan just thought about that are just talking on the level of like a cooking\nI could do a whole park is I'm cooking someday\nYou won't believe what I made last night I Know you don't want to hear something she doing this again it was so good I took two portions I intended to eat ... one portion and then I get older is the weather changes I got out a bottle of red wine that had in the closet for many years at twenty eleven to them they'll oh\nI Can't touch that stuff red wine in the summer I get a smashing migraine the minute it gets cold and it gets getting cold out here now\nHot days cold nights every or October the same yeah global warming every October like clockwork\nLike clockwork burning hot days and cold nights nothing changed I live near the water it actually got one millimeter and all the years I've lived next to it but do we have some schmuck at Harvard of global warming the sea levels are rising they never been down to the see\nThe former mayor of San Francisco never rode on the bay\nHe's an expert on the environment never been on a day most of them ever been on the
