the week a location how she got to or from a location where the crime took place do corroborating evidence no forensic evidence if you don't know where it took place you can't even go back thirty six years later\nAh and I'm an avid watcher of forensic files what they can now do and solve the unresolved crimes from decades gone by is pretty amazing and in sworn statements under penalty of

period of time no interview by the FBI is going to add a thing yeah\nWell it gets very very tough and very scary but I Will say this if we lose due process if we lose the presumption of innocence if

I'm just guessing you don't want people that are exiting New York New Jersey Illinois California in droves because again go of high taxes\nAnd bringing the liberal policies with them and uh and destroying your good state\nUm after they've already destroyed one state now that I understand that but that is something I'm a conservative I'm\nBelieve me I'm I'm voting conservatively in your state and you should be very proud to be a Senator Lindsey Graham who I think has has risen to the occasion more than at any point in his career deserves a lot of credit for his outspokenness in this important time\nWell we all our and our friends have has and knowing very well and\nAnd he's he's really surprised us in in his standing up like this and we're very clearly said he down south and

down and we appreciate it\nYou're very welcome Don ... spokes in a wheel and we're trying to get the country moving in the best direction possible and we want the best economy we want the best security we want the best opportunity and futures for our kids and grandkids is not complicated but politicians that wind power may get complicated\nWell that's exactly right and I don't understand why why the the other side just doesn't want the same thing that doesn't make any sense\nOr I currently you hold on the ship until I got an opportunity to be back down there in Charleston to say Hi to everybody thank you so much for being with us a can is in palm coast Florida next on the Sean Hannity show Ken how are you welcome to the sewer swamp known as your nation's capital\nSean I used to live in Arizona actually lived up in a town called snowflake and it's funny how you call just snowflake but that is a real town in every ...\nWow yeah it it it's a two two members that started the town or something [noise] snow in something flake and they named the town's snowflake in uh when I Lived up there and I lived in Arizona I had the head to vote for\nBoth flake and John McCain\nAnd I used to call him when I live back there and I would tell them all the time I had to hold my nose\nTo vote for you and it's up to you to hold your nose to vote for you know what I was ... whatever's going on at the time and now I'm saying the same thing that Jeff Flake I did help him get elected and I would wish he would just hold his nose and support the president he doesn't have to like\nWhat do you know the president which we all know he doesn't but he should at least\nSupport the people that\nElected him and they're not well let's remember what\nHe said it remember what he said it was sixty minutes on Sunday night he said well what he was asked would you be able to vote this way if you are facing the voters these Scott\nAbsolutely not which means I'm only at doing this because I don't have to face the voters again otherwise I Would just do what was politically expedient so now I'll do what I Want to do that's basically what he said\nYeah but when he was even in back then when when he was you know this is I've been out of a couple of years he he missed major votes that we needed him on one was when he was home with his daughter at some dance recital and another one he went through his son's wedding\nAnd he said that you know the heat plant this was planned a long time ago and he wasn't going to miss it sounds wedding well who in the Senate would say okay if you're going to get married get married ...\nYou know he he he didn't have a chance I I probably I had a hard time even and I call him in and really\nHard time they employ I always was played for the people I talked to how we wish them a good weekend but he he had been a disappointment for years and years and years he's he's just a it's a good thing is going away hopefully I think the only thing he joined me to do is run had a Democrat and you might see that happening\nWell I Will tell you Arizona's have a choice I'm very impressed with this woman Martha ... salad um she's a war hero\nAnd it's it's interesting she's going up against somebody that apparently is a bit of a resistor and\nAndme was outspoken against the war the\nDebate Sally was out there fighting so that's going to be an important raised Arizona's a pretty ... states right now and but I Will tell you it's going to make a difference of Republicans win that seat if Dean Heller can hang on in Nevada and if Joe Donnelly is gone and Heidi Heitkamp is gone and Claire McCaskill is gone and\nAnd Joe Manchin and Bill Nelson are all gone I mean it won't be any problem with future Supreme Court nominees of President Trump and the next two years old and we might not be able to get a lot more things done altogether but anyway I got to run I appreciate the call thank you for being with us or want to get some other calls in here a guy is in\nWell let's go to Kimberly in Connecticut Kimberly Hi how are you glad you called\nHow are you I'm good how are you\nI'm I'm doing now you know I met a girl Alice in Connecticut and I'm looking at one point [noise] [noise] Hi I'm In New York city than\nYeah my advice to stay away from that car that just passed you go ahead\nI'm not is not an effect by I don't know and it's like you\nThat's not an Dietrich bite I have a you know and it's like election there while they're gay away their last thirty okay thirty four I have a lot of hot and in Connecticut we need a Republican governor fat fat um we're kind of ... ... you are\nAnd I need your advice was like hey my friends who are Democrats get them to vote Republican\nLook I I can give you the talking points on the economy it's simple Obama added Thirteen million more Americans is is eight years a cumulative more debt than every president before him combine the only president never to reach three percent GDP Growth\nThirteen million of our fellow Americans more were on food stamps eight million more poverty\nThe lowest labor participation raised in the seventies now and then it keep it simple and there's a Donald Trump has now in two years we have record low unemployment in fourteen states women in the workforce African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and youth unemployment let's start there I I don't know\nGood and you know that's the key right now had our last for friends for like ... which was than you know how you pay and I think I can only going to help the economy crowd\nListen I Want you know I don't know maybe I just have such a sense of urgency 'cause we're on the precipice here of of literally having a transformational economy in the country\nUm if we open up if we've tap these energy resources and all these companies build these manufacturing centers in factories and we get better trade deals like the new trade deal with Canada and Mexico\nThe American workers going to see here is significant prosperity we're going to have an opportunity to take cities once great cities like Detroit Michigan and transform that into a modern day renaissance\nAnd people having good jobs buying good homes and safe neighborhoods nice cars uh vacations you know the things that people want to be able to afford and you don't get it if you don't have good jobs\nThat I went home values in Connecticut to go to go up not down and I think with a Republican governor will definitely you know he can change it\nListen I'm going to tell you all these states that pay high state taxes New York Connecticut or knew joys the everyone in between California you know you got burned you no longer allowed and the fact that that that the state governors and state legislatures but not held accountable\nBecause they tax it like New York it's ten percent state income tax that used to be the duct ... why should states that don't have a state income tax like Texas and Florida\nBeat funding states like New York and get those people that election stupid governors that raised taxes why shouldn't the the people that live in states like good governors be punished\nFrankly they shouldn't and I'm saying that against my own best interest because I live in a state that will always be liberal Democrat it seems\nAnyway good call 'em good luck I uh thirty four days I Hope you feel the sense of urgency and and understand the stakes are high\nLook I um I Know that these off year elections are about one thing you got to show up", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael
