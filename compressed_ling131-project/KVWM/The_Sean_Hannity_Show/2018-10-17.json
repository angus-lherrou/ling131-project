Michael Moore\nDuring his weekly general audience to know St Patrick's square now I don't know the pope who doesn't read current events doesn't read newspapers\nMaybe didn't know Michael Moore was and Michael Moore simply worked his way to the front and huddled with the pope as if he was having a meeting with Michael Moore is left wing radical extremists he's a a contributor Planned Parenthood that\nKills about three thousand developing babies every day he's\nThat kills about three thousand developing babies every day\nHe's a ah certainly an individual that does not reflect American values hard work perseverance fear of God love of country so if the pope knowingly and winning league met\nWith Michael Moore I got a problem with that because especially as abortion feelings but nonetheless until I find out if the pope knew who he was and it's hard to criticize him and secondly and lastly\nBig fight with a couple of weeks ago with Kevin always largely over\nBut I did some statistical work on what was one with a cabin all Brett Kavanaugh and what lies ahead the Supreme Court which\nI've not had the honor yet repairing before takes about eighty cases a year\nAnd the nation's highest court decides another fifty cases without oral arguments general unanimously\nAnd they normally take cases where there's a conflict between the Thirteen circuits that is if the second circuit as a conflict with the sex or the night with the seven they'll take a case to resolve the conflict but just keeping your mind eighty cases a year they take for oral arguments eighty cases here\nBy contrast the U.S circuit court of appeals handled fifty one thousand eight hundred and thirty two cases in a ... month period fifty one thousand eight hundred and thirty two compared to eighty\nSo if you throw on top of that the millions of cases and the ... district courts you're\nTalking about maybe a million cases below the U.S Supreme Court and the Supreme Court and handles eighty cases so whether it's the hot button issues of immigration or gun control or or crime abortion whatever it might be\nThe the ... Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of those cases are decided at the circuit her district court level Ninety nine above nine nine nine nine percent\nSo to break it down even further there's Thirteen U.S Circuit court of appeals of the Thirteen eight are controlled by democratic appointed judges only four by Republican in one district is split and so\nThe most important one is the U.S court of appeals for the district of Columbia which is the one Brett Kavanaugh came off of the Democratic appointees they're seven at three majority seven three one vacancies now available but that's going to be one of the three so it's going to say seven to three [noise]\nSo Ninety nine point nine nine percent of the federal cases are resolved before the Supreme Court level\nAnd all those about Seventy percent are controlled by democratically appointed judges so before you get too far up about Brett Kavanaugh I Want you to hold those figures in your mind Supreme Court takes eighty cases U.S Circuit court of appeals hand or fifty two thousand cases\nDistrict court about a million and so the great majority of the action is well below the U.S Supreme Court even with Brett Kavanaugh they're the only hope we have is normal God fearing Americans as for Trump to be an office another six years\nAnd if he stays in office six more years with the Republican Senate for all six years he may get as high as Fifteen Percent of those appointed by Republican judges so that is the mountain ahead of us don't get too high don't get too low\nSo what I'm saying is if Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the case it never gets U.S Supreme court\nAnd those that do generally deal with the conflicts whether Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch are there or not it's certainly a great thing encourage more of it but it would take years and years of Republicans controlling the Senate and Trump controlling\nThe White House or parents after Trump to make any dent in the fact that about Seventy percent of the federal judges or appointed by Democrats and the way about thirty percent bother Republicans and the reason is the last two or three years of Bush forty three Chuck Schumer refused to do anything in the Senate he shut down completely\nAnd should two weeks from Tuesday\nThe Democrats when the U.S Senate which appears to be a pill at this point but should that happen he's going to shut it down again and they won't be any appointments for the last two years\nOf Trump's first term in office I said first term continuous more fun becomes available we have two lines open to recall now eight seven seven three one two three one one eight seven seven three one two three eight one one\nBill Cunningham the great American in for the great one market living [noise]\n\nListen to what David ask from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk and how much time and\nI have throughout the day and I was able to get a lot more work done ... absolutely right I truly love my ... and I know you will to trust me why don't you feel how much support the ex chair provide\nYou'll never want to sit in an ugly uncomfortable office chair again and your business owners ex chairs or the\nPerfect investment that take the productivity of your entire team to the next level ex chairs on sale now for one hundred dollars off go to ... dot com now that's extra L.

require the factual information when I go to the crowd though I don't have no heroism against them because they're they're the member grow\nThat when the fifth member you cannot deny what you're saying about your own eyes and a lot of going\nTo hold on Cape assuming those things happen and and I certainly accepting their true is not not nearly as bad as a few hundred Americans killed every year by illegal aliens how come we're focusing on that awful murder and not what's happening inside of our own country\nBecause right now we're focusing on it because President Trump I voted for planet down he's trying to change the narrative\nCars\nThat when um the jets landed parts Jeff come out that the Saudis fighter pilot on that ... million dollars worth of weapons that they bought it from\nThat and that's great that put a lot to be able to work at Cape case there's ten\nThousand Americans killed every year inside of America do care about any of them let's investigate cage dialing let's investigate about seven hundred murders who's outside of Chicago not so how about investigating those murders but they don't fit the political diatribe against Trump right\nNow I'm told that that's the corruption out of me whenever we investigate some but not just like some officers that just got killed about an hour ago and Curtis how am I Will not require that in the U.S me so I'm totally one hundred percent on your side we made the get\nLet's investigate that how come a murder of Assad citizen in Turkey is such a big deal here why\nBecause when men complicit with them\nOr not planned similar not complicit were crap we're not complicit with anything come on man come on we're not to see you are you one\nOf those characters whatever bad happens in the world America's complicit went down does that mean complacent what does that mean how stupid was it for the sides to kill him in that fashion almost on videotape that was stupid that was real stupid and I hope we're not stupid but even if\nIt happened the way we think it happened frankly my dear I don't give a damn\nCompared to what's happening in this country every year how many cops are killed two hundred cubs are murdered every year in this country that CNN go into the murder of police officers and why that's a horrible thing how can CNN when I covered the murder cops but they're covering some side citizen in Turkey why\nI totally agree with you just like we have three hundred and Seventy five thousand abortions every year I don't you talk rich you\nKnow big deal but they just using this as a cudgel to be trumping the head with as if we care and\nI don't care compared to the murder of cobs the murder of the innocence ten thousand murders cage timely hundreds of Americans killed by illegal aliens rapes in robberies how 'bout investigating those things that make sense\nIt makes perfect sense that nobody wants to investigate the Saudi to blow it up and if their children and that's where it gets a bath with us made weapons said we're not going to that\nSo complex that you you mean in Yemen bucks just got killed that guy blowout vice weapons with Saudi Arabia ...\nWait a minute hey there you are saying we're complicit in that too because we sold a weapon in somebody is Smith Wesson complicit if one of their weapons kill somebody\nYou know there are now coming under no if Saudi Arabia bomb in a corner of country in the middle east with the weapons\nAre complicit in any of that is correct complicit of one of their weapons is used the wrongfully kill somebody sporadic complicit [noise]\nBut a lot of money is the root of all evil\nKeith you're out of here thanks for your call hope the Dodgers lose this afternoon on let's continue is more aware of let's go to Chris in Atlanta Georgia Chris in Atlanta Welcome to the ... show and Chris please go ahead Chris how're you\nDoing well are you a\nGreat day to being an American please go ahead\nAmen to that so just a quick question you mentioned earlier about um I I don't I Can't air phrase what you said about the specifically about him being a crisis or what have you on earth would you say you have a problem with a meeting with Michael or hell yeah okay\nWell I mean just just out of money I'm just playing devil's advocate for this so I'm not an issue with it too but um if if we believe 'cause I'm I'm Catholic so I Believe in the vicar price just Christ met with with centers um\nWhat what what is your what is your what's your tell I I agree\nWith that to Chris but the difficulty I don't think Michael Moore went there to get the pope on video talking to him as if he was a center wanting to be confessing to and receiving grades from the pope I think Michael Moore went there as a student to capture the pope\nIn a moment that he could use for his own political purposes against Trump and it Michael Moore is that some ... sources like\nPaul and the road to Damascus and said okay I've seen the error my waves I've seen the damage that cause the police officers in American Soldiers I see the damages caused by three thousand innocent babies killed every day in this country and I'm going to the pope for forgiveness for what I've done I'm with you\nBut I think Michael Moore probably went there with the pope today in order to get a photo opt to use politically against him that's what I think\nI I I agree with you with that now just out of curiosity not feel that um maybe he'd already knows Michael Moore is maybe a personal agenda background um\nWell you know Chris the pope is given interviews in which he says he does not read newspapers is not watch TV\nAnd he came from Argentina now in Rome\nAnd we'd like to think in America we're the only country that matters but I guess if you spend your life in Argentina Brazil and Central America South America and now you live in Rome you probably don't read newspapers or watch TV how how would you know Michael Morris and so I you know I guess I could work my way to the front of the line and get a picture with the pope\nBut I Would like to think that Michael Moore is not one of those characters the pope would be familiar with and if he was I Would hope Michael Moore was able to convince to confess as many sense\nSure I I absolutely I\nI think the pope knows more about people than maybe give him credit for um just 'cause I I there there's a little bit about him that strikes me as on\nUm you know I like to be supportive of the pope I'm In a follower Catholicism however there's there are there are a lot of things that really strikes me about him and\nThis to me it's not it's not surprising when as a weapon it's fairly harsh\nThan no question he's he's not the last pope\n[laughter] really harsh\nThat no question east is not the last pope now he's not Benedict each Francis and he's a socialist days left wing er and er\nAnd its whole uh precisely scandal or something that I Hope it's not up to his eyeballs in it from uh South America and I hope he's clean but do what he did with Medicare and what do you deal with world didn't excite me too much and um\nAnd I I just hope there is no there there are what Chris we gotta go thanks for your call let's
