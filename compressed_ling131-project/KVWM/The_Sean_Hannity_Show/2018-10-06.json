Joseph Smith shah and converse with the father and the son that spring day of Eighteen twenty or he did not but if he did then follow the prophetic mantle including the keys of stealing that I lied you bestowed upon him\nIn the most recent general conference president Russell I'm Nelson declared you don't have to wonder about what is true you do not have to wonder whom you can safely trust through personal revelation you can receive your own witness that the book of Mormon does the word of God\nThe Joseph Smith is a profit and that this is the Lord's church regardless of what others may say or do no one can ever take away a witness born to your heart and mind about what is true\nWhen James promised the God give us to all men liberally who seek his wisdom he also cautioned well let him asking face nothing wavering for heat wave earth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for like not that ban think that he shall receive any single\nThe lord a double minded man is unstable and all his ways our savior on the other hand was the perfect example of stability he said the father has not left me alone fry do always\nThings that cesium consider these descriptions from the scriptures of men and women who liked the savior were from\nAnd steadfast they were converted under the true face and they would not depart from it\nFor they were from steadfast any movable willing with all due diligence to keep the commandments of the lord their minds are from\nAnd they do put put their trust in God continually and behold you yourselves no were you witnessed it that is many of them as are brought to the knowledge of the troops are ferman steadfast in the face and the thing where they have been made free\nAnd they continued steadfastly and the apostles doctrine and fellowship\nAnd they continued steadfastly and the apostles doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread and in prayers\nTo persevere ferman steadfast in the face of Christ requires that the gospel of Jesus Christ penetrate one's heart and soul meaning that the gospel becomes not just one of many influences in a person's life\nBut the defining focus of his or her life and character\nThe lord says a new heart also will give you on a new sphere it will I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and we'll give you an harder flash\nI Will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues and you still keep my judgments and do them and you should be my people than I Will be your God\nThis is the covenant we make by our baptism and in temple ordinances but some have not yet fully received the gospel of Jesus Christ into their lives\nAlthough as Paul says they were buried with Christ by baptism there are still missing the part that like is Christ was raised up from the dead even so we should walk in a newness of life\nThe gospel does not yet to find them they're not yet centered in Christ their selective about the doctrines and commandments they'll follow and where and when they'll serve in the church\nBy contrast it is in keeping their confidence with ... that those who are the elect according to the covenant avoid deception and remain from in the faith of Christ\nMost of us find ourselves at this moment on a continuum\nBetween a socially motivated participation and gospel rituals on one hand\nAnd they fully developed Christ like commitment to the will of God on the other somewhere along that continuum the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ enters into our heart and takes possession of our soul\nIt may not happen in an instant but we should all be moving toward that blessed that state\nIt's challenging the vital to remain firm and steadfast when we find ourselves being refined you know the furnace of affliction something that comes sooner relates to all of us in mortality\nWithout God these dark experiences tend to despondency despair even bitterness with God\nComfort replaces pain piece replaces turmoil and hope replaces sorrow remaining from in the face of Christ will bring his sustaining grace and support\nHe will converge trial into blessing and then I say as words give beauty for ashes mentioned three examples of which I have personal knowledge\nThere is a woman who suffers with a debilitating chronic illness that persists despite medical attention priesthood blessings fasting and prayers\nNevertheless her faith in the power of prayer and the reality of God's love for her is an diminished she presses ahead day by day sometimes hour by hour\nServing as called in the church together with her husband looking after her young family smiling as much as she can\nOr compassion for others runs deep refined by her own suffering and she often loses herself in ministry to others she continues steadfast and people feel happy being around her\nA man who grew up in the church served as a full time missionary and married a lovely woman was surprised when some of his siblings began speaking critically of the church and the profit Joseph Smith\nAfter a time they left the church and tried to persuade him to follow as often happens in such cases they bombarded him with essays podcasts and videos produced by critics most of whom were themselves the disaffected former members of the church\nHis siblings mocked his face telling him that he was gullible and misled\nHe didn't have answers for all their assertions and his faith began to waver under the relentless opposition you wondered if you should stop attending church he talked with his wife he talked with people the trust that he prayed\nAs he meditate it in this troubled state of mind he recalled occasions when he had felt the Holy Spirit and had received a witness was the truth by the spirit\nHe concluded if I'm honest with myself I must admit that the spirit has touched me more than once and the testimony of the spirit is real\nHe has a renewed sense of happiness and peace that is shared by his wife and children\nA husband and wife who have consistently unhappily followed the counsel of the brother in in their lives were aggrieved by the difficulty they experienced in having children\nThey expended substantial funds working with competent medical professionals and after a time\nThey were blessed with a son tragically however after only about a year the baby was the victim of an accident there was no one's fault but that left him semi comatose with significant brain damage\nHe's received the best of care but doctors cannot predict how things will unfold going forward\nThe child this couple worked in trade so hard\nTo bring into the world as in a sense been taken away and they don't know if you will be returned to them\nThey struggle now to care for their babies critical needs while meeting there are other responsibilities\nIn this supremely difficult moment they've turned to the lord they rely on the daily bread and they receive from here they're aided by compassionate friends and family and strengthened\nBy priesthood blessings they've drawn closer to one another their union perhaps now deeper and more complete that might otherwise have been possible\nOn July twenty third Eighteen thirty seven the lord directed a revelation to the then president of the core of the twelve apostles Thomas Bee march\nIncluded the following and pray for the other end of the twelve admonished them sharply for my name's sake and let them be admonished for all their sins and be faithful before me on to my name\nThat Joseph Smith is his rebel later and prophet of the restoration\nAnd that the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints is the Lord's kingdom once again established on the earth\nThese there are some essential building blocks of our individual face and testimony\nJesus Christ the savior of the world the book of Mormon is the word of God the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints is the kingdom of God on the earth and Joseph Smith is a profit and we have living in profits on the earth today\nIn recent months so I have listened to every general conference address which president Nelson has given since he was first called
