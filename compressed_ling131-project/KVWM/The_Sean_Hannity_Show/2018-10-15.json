Schumer\nAll right let me get into this this case that has really been a mystery in terms of a global affair crisis I'm the president now said that he is dispatches secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia immediately to discuss what's been going on here\nAnd it gets almost more bizarre by the sec and now\nThe allegation has banned that the Saudi ... crown prince ordered the killing\nOf this guy Jamal ... now he's a Saudi national who's been critical of the Saudi royal families Washington Post contributor\nAnd he's a U.S resident but he's not a citizen he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey October the second he hasn't been seen by anybody since that day\nThe Turkish government had suggested that to show he was killed by a Fifteen members Saudi his team who then dismembered his body and smuggled it out and\nOf the consulate in pieces to an unknown destination but so far the evidence supporting that up to today has been hero some reports claiming that could show these murder was recorded but to date and audiotape know videotape\nNot even the Turkish government which is no great friend of America is currently feuding with Saudi Arabia over other issues saying an absolute saying it's absolutely short because show was killed by anyone they can't say it let alone the Saudis now there's just began to break moments ago\nAnd a reports of now surface that Saudi Arabia is preparing a report in which in fact they will admit Jamal ... show gave this is the Washington Post columnist now this is a very dangerous we start seeing journalists killed\nWent missing earlier this month was killed by interrogation gone wrong\nUm when he entered the I guess the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nRight here to talk about it we have Morgan Ortega's is with us national security global affairs analysts former U.S treasury attached to Saudi Arabia lived in Saudi Arabia two years or she along with dam bond Gino former Secret Service agent\nAuthor as well as the now best selling book a Spygate thank you both for being with us um Oregon you lived in Saudi Arabia two years this just breaking there's been a mystery up until like an hour ago what do you think\nThat [noise] yeah yes and I lived there for ... that I needed something like this breaking and the reason I got it because when the president said this morning that he's sending secretary I'm paying to Saudi Arabia that the secretary of state when it did these people in the world certainly in the government\nHas canceled on plant try halfway around the world um I I was incredibly theory that I got to\nAh we're we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with whatever it is so if there are quick to keep it to leave and we're still going to have to because if if the records out\nThere it's like what comes out or is that these are claiming some sort of responsibility for that looks like they're not going to they're they're claiming senior leadership but not at all but that people are in charge of it in order to be held accountable there's a lot\nHow was your ... there's no until now because of how would they not know until now uh when it happened in their consulate in Istanbul\nThat could have to question and I think the big takeaway that I happened district court we'll see what happens for secretary on paying people to read out not only need to to come clean on their front and satisfy President Trump the secretary I'll tell you didn't have an audience\nClean on this end and satisfy President Trump the secretary I'll tell you know they have an audience and the and the Congress the Senate that they're also accountable to mind you this massive arms deal is a memorandum of understanding it has not been saying that if president ...\nBipartisan consensus first sanctions people like Rand Paul have actually been very locally um I'm supportive of the relationship I don't agree with senator or a number of reasons that I could go into why I think the relationship it is important but the Saudis need to understand how serious it is\nWe need to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to see massive\nA movement away from their big finance or I'm just a few weeks secretary each insisted that we saw the Dow fell off this afternoon as reports\nAnd they were threatened threatening stickier yeah well they were threatening\nYou know maybe even using the power of their oil of impact any of the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S Dan bungee you know I mean this is getting more bizarre by the men and how does somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again\n[noise] [noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely they're really two aggravating factors year one year already brought up the fact that this happened I'm In a constantly I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that breaks every single protocol moral ethical role imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well and you know aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media and I think this is ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm just suggesting that\nThis makes it even worse on the scale of Savage read the fact that this individual aka so he was a member of the media makes it even worse now how could it happen in the diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nAnd highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of the there's the side that said wait back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudi there's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis and the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them where honor razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I think Trump gets that one more thing or something I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they seemingly tried to\nMake these veil threats that they were going to respond\nYou know we were they had to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah to yeah just to see that the thing that not only the threats that worries me that Dan just said\nIt seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they're like the president on that you know the president cannot sit at the king and ... among the crown prince that called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale and most of them that we do know Ellen ... it looks like they don't like the president I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying though it was in the consulate in in Istanbul and say oh we didn't know but I mean I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the\nIn Saudi Arabia and well okay you're going to happen I mean ... there's been a women I chronicled\nThe lot on this program and ... women voting and driving et cetera

from well obviously I'm Talking about the authenticity component with Trump he didn't apologize but if I can be candid with you folks for a moment\nThis is the first year in my life that my wife and I really you've done well um my show the book things just did well they did thanks a lot of you by the way that things just did well I mean no need to go into the details\nBut talking to my account and I was absolutely floored I could really couldn't believe it when we found out how much money the government I was astonished I really\nWas that will be fine I mean we you know we keep money aside to pay for it we don't we don't live a frugal lifestyle at all I mean excuse me a spendthrift lifestyle the opposite we actually kinda were not cheap or anything but we just that we work a lot so we don't get to go out\nI'm telling you I was floored I thought he had a decimal point wrong\nAnd I played straight you know because I I'm like you know a lot of liberals like John Kerry report their boats in Rhode Island played straight so whenever my bill is I don't like the law change it but if the law stinks you still got I got to pay\nAnd I was floored this is the first time my life I thought to myself\n\nI'm Serious folks and my wife probably going to kill me for talking about\nThis but it's okay I I mean it because I think this needs to get out there\nI grew up\nAt the low end at best the middle class and being generous 'cause I'm not I'm not a sob story\nThe low end of middle class at best okay like at one point the bologna for dinner kind of you know what um do you ever see where I got another middle class like yeah we will a mistake was not it was a hot commodity mind when it was it was ... we were not eating rabbis okay McDonald's was like the restaurant to go\n\nI worked my butt off where there was that the police department in the cemetery in the supermarket and the secret service and you finally get to a point in your life and for the first time you make what can be legitimately life changing amount of money right and you want to do so many things I'm telling you we had so many ideas and some of them were so\nI mean we're going to be able to do I don't want to be dramatic about this\nBut you think to yourself I got to give it to these guys these idiots in D.C to do was to do with these\n... are you serious to do what I don't mind my cat I Swear to you on my life the constitutional role of government I\nMilitary guys take my money [laughter] is we need courts I get it that's why we have a constitution but you worked flushing your money down the toilet bowl the people who have no idea what to do with it\nWe need we ... we need seriously some constitutional controls on their ability to take our money they are they are just burning it\n\nIt's the first time in my life I thought I could I could have bought my mother in law house and instead I'm giving it to some bow tie wearing bureaucrats in D. C. too flushed down the toilet bowl\nThe worst unbelievable and I I think it's because I grew up\nAt the lower and middle class and then in the secret service middle class and upper middle class\nLater on I guess I mean I don't know I don't know what the categories I don't care I'm again I'm not trying to make the story more dramatic than it needs to be\nBut I guess it said I genuinely respected dollar because I Know what it's like and then when you finally get help other people right you're like gosh I could do so much with this and you're forced to turn it over and they just mega amounts to the government for me at least probably not for anyone else who's really rich which I'm not\nBut I just I'm paid by every ounce of it\nIt just sucks so bad\nBuild my business everything we can hire new people to write for the website ... and we can't 'cause I've got to give it to these guys and ladies in D.C\nTo burn All right so I get off track you could tell them kind of hard on this topic is another number about the fair share that liberals don't say we pay\nThe top fifty percent of taxpayers top fifty percent pay Ninety\nSeven percent of all income taxes type ... percent the top fifty percent of earners\nPay Ninety seven percent Ninety seven cents of every dollar of taxes Ninety seven Ninety nine point seven Ninety seven percent why does that matter it matters folks\nBecause the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers total logically then pay three percent if the top fifty pay Ninety seven percent the top fifty percent of earners than the bottom fifty three percent of the tax code\nSo this Bloomberg peace they did an interesting analysis they said well let's figure out what percentage of the highest end or is this will make sense of the second I promise what percentage are a number of the highest end earners also\nPay an equivalent three percent of the tax will like the bottom fifty percent of the earners in the country\nLadies\nAnd gentlemen the evil rich that the left talks about the Bernie Sanders times\nI'm using their terminology show how this pure stupidity of their comments you're never going to believe is the top zero zero one percent of income tax payers in other words just fourteen hundred people\nFourteen hundred not fourteen thousand one comma for zero zero for the lips fourteen hundred the fourteen hundred top\nEarners in the United states pay the same percentage of the tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers and the country\nFifty percent of income tax payers in the country [noise]\nTell me again please with a straight face\nWith a straight face how they're not paying their fair share fourteen hundred people pay the same equivalent percentage of the income tax or as the bottom fifty percent of earners in the country and he got Bernie Sanders a one percent are so you're not paying their fair share really party do you even know these numbers\nThat is insane fourteen hundred people pay the same percentage of the tax code as the fifty percent the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers in this country that's amazing\nNow you understand why we got to just break the narratives completely\nYou read it for the rich no no no no no no I'm In it for the economy and you have no idea what the numbers are fair share you don't even know what a fair share is\nFair shall we usually just make up his doping stupid talking points rich do Peter Fisher they don't pay pay as much as the bottom fifty percent of the country are you crazy\nA man of fire to say All right you want to give us a call it seven seven three one two
