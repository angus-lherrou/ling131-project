I. N. home\nFriend's not just in radio but period is dam bond Gino was a big help the last few weeks to\nHe's got a beautiful book or they're terrific book Spygate you tempted sabotage of Donald J Trump I cannot recommend it strongly enough and we will link to it\nAnd I was not on the air when it was released so we'll bring a damn back to talk about it but then former Secret Service former NYPD nobody better to talk about this and anybody else you've been watching the coverage what do you make of this\nOr mark it seems like a very amateurish operation I mean just look at some of the hallmarks of these devices that were sent I mean number one is the obvious one mark\nI'm none of them thank God I'm actually detonated in an unexploded again thank the lord that happened um but certainly not the hallmarks of of of someone with experience in this in this space but\nOther things as Well Mark which seemed to indicate one of only two possible options it was either a really amateurish operation or someone seemingly wanted to get caught\nUm outside of the not detonating also when you look at the photographs we stayed at the devices mark you see a just hallmarks of of of of just a rookie type behavior like excessive postage which is all I mean it's all over the front of you see the the pronounce high\nOn the on the label you know if you're trying to create a device in the mail system to God Forbid detonate in front of a male landlord target\nYou don't use height that's going to draw attention to the package you see the um one other thing mark they had uh one of the packages was addressed the John Brennan it's that well\nI mean John Brennan doesn't work at the end and that's quite obvious the basic Internet search would have produced that information worked at NBC which I mean this is it's really a there's something not right here it's a very suspicious operation very amateurish right now\n[noise] well let me ask you this question is it possible you have such a a devious minded worked that somebody wants to look so\nAmateur well it's certainly possible I said there's only one or two scenarios here I mean either somebody wanted to get caught um for some reason or it's so amateurish that it it it it speak to some kind of a you know motive we haven't yet\nIt's ... it's ... some kind of a motive we haven't yet it's just bizarre\nAnd then that that the selection of the of the target of course there's people want to you know I guess people all over the media right now given out these ... especially if you're going through these other networks who are desperate to prescribe a motive who have no idea\nBut I Would encourage all of them take this very very slow\nBecause I when I when I see mark in my experience in the space especially with the secret service and all of its mail processing system is people who are Syrians who have these Savage animal minds want to do this kind of stuff\nThey are very tactically efficient in the way they do it and none of the all marks of tactically efficient a planning where in orange ... this is a highly highly suspicious or operation I mean none of them even detonated again thank God but that is that\nCertainly doesn't speak to some expertise in this in this space\nHere investigator and you're looking at this I Would think you would make no uh imagined a a\nScenarios that you would just try and get the evidence and follow the evidence and try and figure it out that way rather than while this mode of that motive and the other mode and you really you're you're just getting down to the forensics\nYeah and that's what guys like you and I do\nUh we're always hesitant to jump to a boat or before we actually have the facts and the day that there I mean this is with comments that reasonable people do but of course when you know with the with the current environment and and the media hysteria they immediately want to prescribe them a motive remembered mark\nThe most important of all the W. using this right the who what when where why and how the most important thing obviously it's who get who the actual person we know we have zero clues right now at least publicly as to who that person that I suspect\nKnowing how these investigations go and the availability of the initiate or in these devices which usually leads the signature\nThat they're going to get someone relatively quickly but you have no idea who it is and when you don't have to who you have no idea what the motive is and I got to tell you it's grotesquely you're responsible for these people out there already were absolutely convinced\nThat that that they know exactly why this happened it's just it's insanity\nYou also find it a really gut wrenching sickening that every time there's something a terrible that takes place in this country they trained tied to Donald Trump now rose Donald Trump\nYesterday was compared to Hitler multiple times on cable TV he was said to be a racist multiple times on cable TV because he uses word national listen I'm going to explain this later in\nThe show I'm aware that where it actually comes from comes from the progressive actually comes from Theodore Roosevelt his new nationalism speech but I don't want to jump all getting into that later just shows you how ignorant people are but they were going on and on and and now these same\nHosts the same guests the same contributed call them whatever you will are talking about the rhetoric too hot things need to be coal do they understand the media have led this this this battle with a vicious rhetoric\nMark they've they've accused the man of being a Russian trader\nA a a guilty of treason we've had we've had so called air quotes you respected commentators accused the man of treason accusing him of being a Nazi and there you have Maxine Waters and others talking about getting in people's faces mark\nOne of the things you Sean and the people in the industry of always been clear on on the conservative side people are responsible for their own actions that maniac who shot up ... and the baseball field\nThat guy's responsible for his own action\nBut having said that the people who are out they're calling for confrontation and aggressive confrontation in public how to be more responsible but that's not conservative and the fact that they're trying to turn this around immediately and painted on Trump and make it some kind of a political issue without having any band hounding factors disgusting\n... one of the key advisors to Hillary Clinton during a campaign some fringe name ... whatever his name is\nThis guy yesterday on TV I think it was on Tucker show refused to condemn people getting into the faces of members of Congress and other public officials in restaurants that was just yesterday\nI heard if I saw the exact same what you're talking about but that's who he is the fate of him before ... who he is I was not surprised one ...\n... my brother well we appreciate having you on then you're great friends God Bless you we'll be right back\nWay\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations in oneself gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to met his share for your health care it\nCould be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family is five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do that over time just doing the math of six thousand dollars a year that the significant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members and met a share and it's growing like crazy fight\nWord nationalist so very very dangerous or you got to listen to me throughout the program I'm going to hit this very very importantly in the next few minutes go ahead\nWe know this president is all I Do want to be precise on Congress or in your ... between the program the United states for Hitler and I want you to explain exactly what you mean because obviously this is a this is controversial about what I'm saying is that using the word of nationalism and NASA was\nMeaning that you know when you listen to him he was talking about German for the Germans\nAre and that's it I'm On\n\nAnd Franklin Roosevelt was looking at America for the Americans these are historically illiterate human beings that we have to listen to these not alone Max Boot on CNN yesterday cut Eighteen go\nAs a disturbing historical echoes somebody well now nationalism has meant a lot of things over the years\nAnd in the nineteenth century it was primarily associated with liberal movements people live feed or hurt so the founder of ... who helped to create the fate of Italy or\nBoulevard who helped to create the state's Colombian Venezuela but on the twentieth century nationalism is taking on a much darker much more negative connotation being associated essentially a fascist movements and you think of national seed bank of people I Franco and Mussolini and Hitler and\nPinochet where we are not exactly people at the president of the United states which I Believe the ... and that's why it's very hard for me to think of people and us history who describe themselves as national is this is not a popular term okay\nOkay well I'll explain one very big one who was in the twentieth century in a moment and then we have Joe Scarborough really low some really low some individual cut Nineteen go\nWant to read this this is this is this referencing nobody and so please please my my love and viewers out there do not I do not draw parallels between what is said here and anybody\nSo he's willingness to attack Trump and he thinks he covered by saying don't draw parallels well why else would you be doing just to give us a history lesson on Hitler\nGo ahead isn't that would hurt me\nFor me very deeply and you don't want to hurt me deeply I don't want to weep\nOn the shows this this doesn't relate to anybody whatsoever it's just [noise] it was going through rains\nAnd rains and volumes I Love World War two and ... they are big Churchill fan love what Rosa\nSo I was reading this this is\nFrom um ah the United states has a strategic services in describing just happened that\nCome across this latest gym because when you think uh Joe Scarborough you think of a historian particularly when it comes to World War two don't you nobody sent this to him or put it under as rather huge bobble snows no no he found this on his own go ahead\n... only pertains Adolf Hitler and things that nobody else I can I just can't say that enough is enough this is what they have for Adolf Hitler's psychological profile and for those of you in the midst of\nReading World War two a government reports you'll find that fascinating is primary rules were never allow the public to cool off\nNever admit a fault or wrong\nNever can see that there may be some good in your enemy never leave room for alternatives never accept blame\nConcentrate on one enemy at a time and blame them for everything that goes wrong people will believe of being alive sooner than a little one\nAnd if you repeat it free kind that you\nKnow so there you have ... comparing Trump to Hitler even though he denies that that's the entire purpose of this then Don Lemon on CNN cut twenty go wow\nI'm a nationally\nUse that word we're going to talk about that word tonight it is a favorite of the all right and is loaded with native is and racial undertones and global as well global is have been used as a slur\nOf sorts sometimes even against those in the administration often with anti Semitic overtone\nOkay now keep in mind he's or media figures\nThese are hosts some claimed to be reporters\nAnd listen to how they talk is this cooling down the rhetoric is is bringing the country to get is this news is it even news at all\nThen there's Peter Alexander White House correspondent on MSNBC I'm getting somewhere with this folks please stick with me I Can't do this stuff and quick soundbite cut Twenty one go\nAnd Peter to ask you also about his using the word nationalist saying you know out loud I Am nationally and how does the president of conceive of that term because it doesn't in any way have racial and our town\nAnd racial undertones racial overtones the word nationalist\nGo ahead\nTell them that are not just racial there's enough over because this is something that the presence and sort of shied away from in the past obviously nationalism was a phrase that Steve Bannon a obviously embrace over the course of the campaign and a lot of the president's opponents tried to pay them pay you get the draft\nAnd there's many others so yesterday Trump is compared to Hitler he's a racist he's ... he's all these things\n\nAll these this is the media the media using selectively guests to say these things they know what they're going to say\nThe media\nAnd tonight they're out there saying toned down politics is divisive it's too late\nNow they're reporting and they're not really reporting slowly but surely you're aiming at Trump I'm not a nationalist ladies and gentlemen I'm a constitutional is\nI Believe in Americanism not nationalism\nIn the correct Max Boot and everybody else who heard speaking one of the leading progressive with the last century progressive he ran as a third party candidate is the head of the progressive party was Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd on August thirty one Nineteen ten those of us who actually do study history Scarborough he gave a famous famous speech you know what he entitle the speech the new nationalism\nThe new nationalist\nAnd in this speech the new nationalism Theodore Roosevelt borrowed from a gentleman by the name are Herbert cruelly if you had my book rediscovering American as we know what I'm Talking about\nAnd by the name are Herbert cruelly if you have my book rediscovering Americanism you know what I'm Talking about\nHis and his essay is famous essay\nIn something called the outlook magazine promise of American Life this had an enormous influence on Theodore Roosevelt the progressive movement was really borne out of the Republican Party early on and it's great leader would become Theodore Roosevelt\n\nAnd then there's new nationalism speech I said he called it his new nationalism speech he spoke about the new national is the object of a central government\nThat need for a ubiquitous federal government they need to be interfering in the private sector\nA rejection of market capitalism in many respects a rejection of the ... I'm telling you the truth I rejection of the declaration of independence has written a rejection of the separation of powers that can finds the ability the federal government to help people\n\nAnd it was all the rain on the left on the progressive left but new nationalism\n\nSo why do these people in the media compare Trump to Hitler what do they call him a racist when he uses the word nationalist the criticism should be that's\nA progressive term that progressive own that\nIn the twentieth century\n\nBut Don Lemon is a moron Joe Scarborough is a moron Max Boot as a fake Gregory Meeks is a moron Peter Alexander the White House correspondent a more on\n\nThis was a phrase a word\n\nThat is central to understanding progressive is in the central is Asia and the American government they're intellectuals wrote about it all the time\n\nIs up the presidents to be criticized softly it should be using the word out of progressive ism but now the progressive who run the media for the most part the leftists\nThey want to compare him to Hitler Hitler\nHitler who rounded up millions and millions of people and slaughtered them\nThey use this phrase", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Show Low", "day": "24"}
