country now let's go back to the first sentence of this piece on Fox America has a massive growing racial wealth gap let me ask you a question\nWhy do people risk their lives to come here because\nThat senses telling you that America is racist and there's not equal opportunity in America that's what that senses telling\nWhy do people of color hey hey non whites why are they flooding into America\nWhy are they leave in Guatemala and Honduras and Mexico in one country after another in central and South America why are they leaving one country after another on the African continent why they leaving one country after another in Southeast Asia\nEven China\nWhy are all these people coming to the United states if there is a massive growing\nRacial wealth gap there is no opportunity for non whites is that it\n\nOne of the problems we have in this country thanks to the left weather in the media or entertainment and elsewhere is a lack of promoting assimilation a lack of promoting assimilation learning English learning American laws\nLearning American practices and bracing American culture I mean after all you came to the United states to escape\nThe culture of your birthplace right isn't that where the refugee is isn't that what an illegal alien does otherwise white come to America and America you see is so racist as a country\nThat as Brock Obama and Joe Biden used to say by twenty forty four white people will be in the minority there so race obsessed with America is so racist white Americans allow that\nBecause America as a country is not racist that's why\nPeople should be encouraged to embrace capitalism they should be encouraged to embrace entrepreneur ship they should be encouraged to embrace the private sector the profit motive creativity productivity rather than government government government\n\nBecause the vast majority of people do not succeed by getting a government check it destroys them it destroys initiative it destroys independent thinking it destroys the human spirit\nWhich is exactly why the left pushes so let's go back to this story America has a massive growing racial wealth gap\nNow for the left of course that means more government more redistribution higher taxes\nMore regular you know in more and more and more to govern\nGoes on the median white family today holds nearly ten times the wealth of the median black for\n\nSenator Cory Booker is introducing a bill aimed at closing that gap that caught my attention his idea is to give lower income kids kids a sizable nest egg nearly fifty thousand dollars in some cases\nThat they could use for wealth building purchases like a down payment on a house or college tuition\nDid you hear this where are you familiar with this\nThese they called them opportunity accounts they don't call these marches accounts they call them opportunity accounts what theoretically no this is the article this is the news article it doesn't say that it's an opinion piece\nThese opportunity accounts with theoretically make sure all children have significant assets when they enter adulthood rather than just those who grew up in wealthier home\nSounds cool right equality\nIt'll be a dramatic change in our country to have low income people break out of generational poverty bookers said an interview with Fox we couldn't rapidly bring security into those families lives and that is really exciting to me\nNow that will never be any discussion of where this money comes from never nobody cares\nWhat kind of taxes for it to be increased who cares what kind of additional debt will have to be accumulated who cares none of it matters what talking about the quality\nOf results economic equality we're not talking about liberty don't confuse us with liberty don't confuse that's what markets don't confuse us with opportunities no don't you see we have a racist country\nWe need to take money give it to poor people poor kids up to fifty thousand dollars\nSo they can move into the middle class who say that simple why did I think of this why didn't anybody think\nThese are opportunity accounts after all ladies and gentlemen what coming into the\n\nThe modern era the modern modern era I guess economics don't matter that does it matter tax rates are irrelevant\nWe need and opportunity account up to fifty thousand dollars a kid what's the big deal and why our at it free college\nAt ... at it free health care and while we're at it open borders\n\nAnd while we're at it open borders\n\nAnd while we're at it why don't you destroy the country\nWhere the richest country in the face of the year ... even our poor people live better than most poor people in the rest of the world they don't have local state and federal welfare systems\nFood systems\nHousing benefits they don't have them in these other countries we have them in this country thanks to the productivity of individuals who get up every morning and go to work and come back in the evening\nAnd contribute to society\nWhy do we spend all our time attacking the people who create well who create this magnificent society who built things who produce things who make it possible for people who don't even do those things\nTo have some form of material wealth food clothing and so forth you kill the golden goose you will not have those golden next\nI'm telling you I'm telling you\nYou need to do more than
