I'm Sorry to interrupt you\nShine oh it isn't saying it it is it ... it it is them desperate trying to help the Democratic allies win elections\nI Love which at the rabbi said rabbi Myers said that you know he's a citizen of this country and if the president wants to come here please come on he was not objecting at all to the president's visit which I appreciate and when we start focusing on the blame game which is what we do especially the the ... media\nThat then we lose sight of what really happened to you know what really happened is as we discussed an anti Semite killed ... that was his goal those\nWere the words that were true and spoke in front and he wanted to kill Jews but we also had\nPittsburgh Police who are amazing I Love these guys I Know so many of them they went rushing towards the gunfire while everyone else that of course is rushing away we had a doctor of analysts who went to care for a gunshot victim and he became a victim himself rabbi Myers made every effort to save as many lives as they could and he regretted that he couldn't save more\nThese are the real stories and this is the truth these were not acts\nOf a nation divided that's what the ones that the way the media wants to believe that we're a nation divided but we're not we're a nation or a community like this one like any other when we're faced with adversity when we come face to face with a madman\nWe roll up our sleeves we face that evil with courage and the sacrifice\nAnd and and that is who we are as Americans and when they play the blame game on the media\nIt just makes me sick because we missed what the true story is what the truth is and rabbi Myers I Love what you said he said the bullet holes are too numerous to count but we will rebuild because we're tree of life we've been here one hundred and fifty four years you can cut off some branches that the tree will continue to grow we will be back\nSo that Sean is who we are engaged as a nation I Know you agree that's who we are the nation we are not divided\nAmen ... most of us or not but the blame game ... interests on gas and it's\nAll right well thank you both again a roast our thoughts and prayers to all our friends in Pittsburgh and to the community and the synagogue and a rabbi please send more loving in regards and our prayers um\nEight hundred nine four one showing toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program eight days till election day how do we get out the vote or going to deal with that all the other issues of the day threats against Republicans that the media just outright ignores\nAnd the mob mentality continues will have full chronicling of all of this as we continue eight days till election day the best election coverage available on your radio down\nTells me you know I make a living for people not ignoring I saw your except it\nOkay but I think you're right though because the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman in Georgia with re elected the first Republican governor and that stayed in a hundred and thirty four years\nThe last published poll in a midterm election\nShowed him trailing by Thirteen he won by five they were only off by a team points and particularly in a midterm election worked turnout is everything it's all a matter of who does a better job of getting their voters to the polls and Sean\nI talked to a friend of mine who's helping to run independent expenditures and every target it's been in the house race in the country\nHe told me that in some of these house races dirt down to his view is twenty three hundred are undecided voters in an entire congressional district everybody's got their uniforms on everybody's blocking and tackling and everybody's going to the polls and the good news is\nWe've got the ability to identify twenty six million voters as either evangelicals are pro life Catholics we have phone numbers on forty five percent of them we've got an email about half of them are we we have the ability to get directly to them and we know nightly whether they\nVote or not and then we can follow up with more phone or email us more tax and worked or not\nWhere do you see because I'm looking at six races believe it or not in Southern California that matter for the house there's\nThose races in New York house races that could turn tip the balance of power and New Jersey can tip the balance of power and\nMinnesota has house races that can tip the balance of power but then I say that and then I'm thinking well there were four hundred and thirty five races going on a in a daze in any one of them can tip the balance of power and while you use the poles and it's somewhat helpful it's much harder to decide and get a feel for how the house is going to go\nLook right and now we really have the house is on the bubble we\nThink it's plus or minus five or ten feet and\nWe think when you're dealing with probably right now a hundred seats in play and probably half of those are tied again it's all about turnout and and look you remember the special election in Georgia sex when they had us off or\nYou know two three four five and he lost by four it's all a matter of who does the best job at the ground game and the good news Sean is the power brokers in the media and no longer get to control who wins or who loses we've got the ability to communicate to voters\nDirectly on line on their cell phone at their doors wherever they worked play and live and if we do our job and get art bowed out we're going to have the potential to have a shocking an election night to the to the dominant media as we had two years ago\nI mean that's what I keep reminding people you can shocked the world again we can go against history nobody thought Trump would win I mean the networks were literally what I read the exit polls at five Fifteen I was doing radio at the time and and the at that moment reading the exit polls trumpet lost Florida last North Carolina he lost Pennsylvania\nHe lost Ohio he loves Michigan he lost Wisconsin He lost it all the barely won the state according to the exit polls the same thing happened in two thousand and for the exit polls at five Fifteen election day show John Kerry was president so you're right and I pay attention to the polls but more importantly\nHow do you get all these people involved that they're really spending the time making phone calls getting on you know getting the vote out and sending out these emails and letters and tax what are you doing\nI I have to be honest with the Sean I got to give credit where credit's due first of all a to President Trump for providing the banner of the positions on the issues but it's got these people so excited and secondly to the Democrats for during the Kavanaugh nomination\nTrying to air and destroy a good man and his family and we saw a noticeable inflection point in this cycle when they tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh it's a reminder of why people turned out in sixteen and we've got thirty nine field offices and Nineteen states we have a team's operating in every state in the country\nThere overseeing walking teams that are going neighborhood to neighborhood\nWe had a woman the other day that was verbally accosted a guy got in his car and followed her all the way down the block screening obscenity at her she sent me an email later and said not only am I not that church she said I'm now going to walk every neighborhood in my town and knock on every door it's\nThat kind of intensity that kind of commitment to our country you know at at times like this Sean when people wonder you know if that kind of decency and character still\nAlive in this country the answer is a ... yeah it is it's in the heartland of the country it's at the grassroots it's alive and well\nWell I think grassroots politics works grassroots works and I think it works from the beginning one of the things though I think Obama lead the way but Trump and the Republicans did some catch up and we saw the benefit of their working twenty sixteen and that is the use of social media\nI don't think anybody has more powerful platform on social media than President Trump\nI think that's right I think ah you know a rock Obama was the first\nSocial media Internet president in the same way that FDR was the first radio president in the same way that John F. Kennedy was the first president to master television but if Obama was the pine air I assure you trust has mastered it or not only in his use of ...\nI assure you trust has mastered it or not only in his use of social media platform but also the thing is that his campaign it did in twenty sixteen\nTo catch up with what the Obama campaign did and we for example a Sean when we took our Christian voter file and matched it up against social media platforms\nSeventy two percent of the voters were seeking to contact her on Twitter or Facebook or another social media platform and we're broadcasting out thirty two million videos get out the vote messages and other targeted messages directly to those people and again I Want to stress the minute they vote they get\nDropped out of the turnout universe and all the videos we've been pushing their social media count then begin to go elsewhere\nNow I agree look anything's possible I ... I don't take things for granted I'm I was one of the few that really believe that Donald Trump could when I saw something happening because I was out on the road\nI also see it happening this time anecdotally you know I can see it in ratings every single night it's a you know boxes audiences enthusiastic 'em and you can see CNN fake news and and that mess that they're just desperate and they'd like not doing well they seem almost the audience seems depressed but\nThere are three virtual outcomes here one is we shocked the world Republicans picked up Senate seats hold the house that would be the best case scenario then there's a split decision where Republicans get seats in the Senate but below sea become speaker and then there's a worst case scenario you wake up\nYou know ten nine days from now when you find out as speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elects Schumer and\nIt's really up to the people which decision which outcome they want but this will get the government we deserve you stay home well that's a half a vote for below sea and Schumer if you don't vote for the Republican you're basically voting for ...\nYeah and I and I really believe showing that the intensity gap in the ... gap that wants to separate the two sides has closed significantly since the Kavanaugh nomination\nYou know you see different polls were Democrats with a high enthusiasm maybe Seventy two percent of them Republicans maybe sixty eight to Seventy percent\nBut anecdotally I'm telling you I'm seeing stuff out there that I saw in twenty sixteen I was in Des Moines Iowa last week at an event with the vice president with a very strong organization out there we have over a hundred and fifty people walking door to door just in Des Moines neighborhoods and\nThis one gentleman who was volunteering told me he was at the president's rally the previous a friday and Cedar Rapids they filled an arena\nThat we're over two thousand people who couldn't get in they stood in the driving range for two hours and watch it on the jumbotron\nThey stayed there to show their support you simply cannot Kwanzaa type a quantify that with a poll or with an analysis it's an intangible it's out there and it's real\nQuick break we'll come back more with Ralph Reed founder chairman faith and Freedom Coalition right cybersecurity some things you need to know cyber security\nThat's the protection of networks devices in programs from cyber attacks that are designed to access or destroy sensitive data or extort money from businesses and people strong cyber security has layers of protection spread across computers networked programs and\nRealize not only ON Technology but also making smart choices\nLike keeping software updated and staying informed on cyber safety how consumers also need cyber security to protect their digital lives in today's connected world it just takes one weak link criminals get it thank goodness there's the whole new life lock identity theft protection with the added power of Norton Security that protects\nYou against threats to your identity or devices that you can't see or fix on your own out new life lock with Norton Security\nWell you can get it now like block dot com you needed in this day and age protect your name your reputation your finances\nLife lock dot com one eight hundred lifelong promo code Hannity you get an extra ten percent off your first year in for a limited time may twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with your annual enrollment that's life lock dot com one eight hundred life lock promo code Hannity we'll continue\nOur rounded up and not want to miss it adds to the final our free for all the Sean Hannity show\nOr listening to talk of giant nine Seventy show Seventy eighty Jay ... service\nAnd accused killer in court ...

I think it's important for your uh forties to see what they can do\nTo prevent the next attack and uses armed guards at many of your scenario yeah that's\nThat's a reality that unfortunately juice face around the world if you go to London and the kind of God you are more likely than not to see actually a policeman or or police car outside same thing in Paris same thing in Brussels and other places around the world that you don't want to see that happen in America I Do think that on high holidays\nShutting 'em keep poured many synagogues you do have a local law enforcement authorities at least since nine eleven but this was just choose going about their business praying\nAnd in a synagogue on a on a Saturday morning and to think that every single synagogue in America needs that type of protection protection is\nSad or but unfortunately at least for the foreseeable future it might it might be necessary not only to protect the population a but to give them a sense of security one thing that's important is for political leaders to speak out very very strongly against that I was very pleased to hear\nFrom President Trump I thought he had and what the strongest combinations frankly I've ever heard I've never heard of non Israeli non Jewish leader say those who try to destroy the Jews we will destroy them I've never heard that far from any leader\nAnd not only was it that ... that uh that was I heartened to hear the president of United States say that but I was heartened to hear the applause he got from the people who were at that rally in Illinois when he fit that\nUh and it's important for people on the right to spit out the extremists among them to David Dukes it's important for people on the left to spit out the extremist like Louis Farrakhan and others and to say that there's no place for this type of hatred in the United states\nWell you know mainstream conservatives have never consider themselves for writer embrace David do we were ... people like that but we do have a growing bbs movement in this country it's growing in our college campuses quite frankly it's growing in the left and there's haters everywhere every breed of every stripe and so forth and so on\nBut in some ways it's getting more and more mainstream the the UN is rabidly anti Semitic the DDS movement which is\nIn mainstream did many with many corporations and many organizations and political organizations in Europe and even some of it in the United states this again this is this is intended as an anti Semitic Jew anti Israel moving in DC this growing to\nNo question about it I mean for many years to the un has been ground zero Francis Semitism and holding Israel up to withstand that holds and all of the nation on earth when you have you know two thirds of the ... family tell it was simply U.N General assembly resolutions against Israel\nThat's got to tell you something when you have more resolutions passed against Israel and the un human rights council that all the countries of the world combined\nUm that's got to tell you something and this is a deep problem people thought it was a thing of the past it's not a it's very serious and it's growing and that's why it's so important you know there there's a an old saying that you know it starts with the Jews but it never ends with choose we have always been seen as the canary of the ... in the coal mine\nOf ... of civilization so when you have those noxious fumes that are directed at the Jews um it's not going to end there it's going to spread and that's why it's very important for people to frankly mark put all the politics aside\nAnd stand together whether you're on the right a conservative or liberal whether you're a Republican or Democrat and and they noted this kind of hate and and the lead by showing that this type of bigotry this type of hatred will have no sanctions and the United states of America\nYou know I agree completely with putting politics aside but I've been watching this I'm sure you have in the United states our media and its politics first second and third it's politics morning noon and night it's politics trumped responsible for this is Trump this Trump this is Trump this\nIn this killer this mass murder this this Jew hater he hated Trump he didn't like Trump descended too many Jews around now you have in President Donald Trump made my view the the greatest supporter of Israel any American president\nHe's knowledge that Jerusalem is the capital the president did that before he's moved our embassy to Jerusalem they all promised they never did it before he took this Iran deal which was passed by Congress\nAnd the prior administration which gave tens of billions of dollars to the terrorists regime which has the United states and Israel and its sights he said no more to that\nI mean from my perspective as an American is a conservative who's been watching this stuff for a long long time this president has been the best friend of the Jewish state certainly during my lifetime\n[noise] yeah I mean I I I've said this before or we've never had a strong supporter of Israel than President Trump\nA and frankly it it hasn't even been close in\nTerms of what he's done I mean you look at some of those things that he's gone you have a Nikki Haley ambassador Haley at the un pushing back against all this anti Israel sentiment obviously the gruesome and the case to be ... Santos Semitic regime and the planet they call for the annihilation of the one and only two state and you have Hezbollah\nUh ... Iran did actually one of his ... leaders said a few years ago that he hoped all the things will come to Israel so we can wipe them out there\nSo the president of the United states split up to the entire world and withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran has restored sanctions and against Iran and in doing so he is starve this anti Semitic terrorist regime of hundreds of billions of dollars that would be used to to kill\nAnd promoter uh Israelis are and and also to putting all of our Arab neighbors and everything else one good thing that came out of that that nuclear deal with bart Israel or in the Arab world closer together but we we appreciate very much in a very grateful for that support and like I said I'm very grateful\nThat the president so forcefully\nA condemned or the anti Semitic attack and I I think it is a very very important I think if people think that all of the things happened uh because of\nPresident Trump's election ... they're just getting themselves they don't understand the history of anti Semitism it's not only the world's longest hatred older sacred it's the most malleable hatred I mean ... or or had been attacked\nAnd killed you know for being a capital for being a communist for being of the biggest dogs for being the biggest hawks for being called overlooked for being called you know ethnic separatists\nHaters can always find a reason to hate things and it's been going on for a long time and I hope one positive thing that can come out of this horrific a act is that people will stand together against anti Semitic\nPick a act and keep than together against at the ... all over the top is not the reason why you have a record\nAnd you know a head of the Labour Party an anti Semite if not the reason why you have all these attacks have for many years and you're up against Jews unfortunately this thing is\nI'm here to the United states and ... and is now eleven\nWorshipers and ... or ... or Pittsburgh but if anything can come out of it hopefully people can stand together and put politics aside understand that there are people who were anti Semite on all sides and people for an together again and all out the anti Semite on our side of the political aisle that are\nNot calling you want to call the other side of calling it on your ultimate whether it's David Duke was fair car wherever cops on a college campus with people trying to think about Israel and fame and demonize Israel and make sure that Israel's apartheid state of races state a perpetrator of Canada which\nI think a lot of people put a level of hatred towards Israel don't see of any other country is demonization wherever it is people have to stand up to it I think in protecting the terms I think they're going to be protecting our\nAlright and bashed in Iran drummer of Israel we appreciate your time God Bless them thank you sir thanks [noise] he's really good okay I've laid out he's laid it out\nAny objective news organization should be laying the south but they're not going to cause they're not objective when they're really not news organizations anymore not many of them\nYou know falls officially here temperatures across the country are dropping certainly are where I live\nAfter a long summer of running your air conditioner all the time as quickly approaching the start running your heater as temperatures drop and most of the country\nThe national weather center saying the north in central part of the U.S look experience a cold or October than years passed now is the perfect time to consider servicing your system and replacing your age ...\nWe have the perfect company to help you make your life that much easier filter by dot com America's leading provider of HPV backed filters for homes and small businesses\nChoose for over six hundred sizes including custom options that ship free within twenty four hours plus they support working Americans manufacturing all their filters right here in America\nSaid five percent when you subscribe ... auto replacement so you'll never forget to change it filters ever again filtered by will save you time money and help you breathe better that's filtered DUI dot com filter by dot com and tell them march sent you\nLook we need to spend a lot of time on this election that's\nComing up too and we have approximately ten candidates that are coming on this program in the course of this week", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Show Low", "day": "29"}
