tactics against ... capital um\nIs that enough for Republicans to win I Would I'd love to see a contract with America and promises made by these Republicans to insure people they're not wasting their vote\nYeah look I think there there are\nThree steps here one is to communicate and she just did\nThat this is about America this is the most important mid term election in my lifetime and I think will be decisive in whether we keep going forward or we're returning to this left wing fanaticism second it really is a contrast between\nResults and resistance and whether people want to continue to create jobs to do the things that were to move in the right direction or\nGo back to the failed policies of the eight years of Obama and then third I think the Republicans should have an eye open next week we'll have a set of very positive think of it as a pledge of if if we were elected hero the next steps are all going to take care of the next good things are going to happen and\nI think that there are enough things working between the administration and the house and Senate Republicans that we can put together a very good positive campaign soldiers are three part campaign which America do you want results versus resistance and a commitment to an even better next two years\nI miss this bigger thanks for being with us we appreciate your time as always eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program a when we come back my colleague my friend from the Fox news channel Tucker Carlson we'll check in with us we'll get his take on the news of the day a much more straight ahead as we continue from the swamp the sewer D.C straight ahead [noise]\nRon ... is an Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the census is going to be re watched this has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours\nThey flip around some use of our most phrase next thing you know the lead of every show Ron to San Francisco racist unit was going to happen because it had to happen\nAnd luckily there there are in Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad and Missouri by the Democratic party said oh you know elect Republicans black cross a cross is going to be burnt on people's lawns\nOr I ... well the James Byrd at I mean Al Gore telling a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong agenda for African Americans they don't even want to count you in the census at all\nAnd just really outrageous claims and you know one of the things I'd like to see come out of this that what has now become a predictable tactic that they get called out on this Brett Kavanaugh up until two weeks ago yesterday was a gentleman gentlemen\nAnd now all of these allegations all of these solicitations and it doesn't matter like if Michael ... making the claim that thirty six years ago\nThat there was a gang of boys that were routinely drug ing girls and then waiting in line to gang in trail raped them\nAnd that this was happening with the regular cars but nobody said it at the time nobody told the teacher a law enforcement official apparent that it just kept going on and was covered up for this long because I Know where I go to when I went to school if one kid got in trouble for anything everybody knew within seconds\nWorth ridiculous I mean his client is alleging that she went to nine consecutive ... gang raped in a row and never said anything to anybody no one else does either in she on the tenth one was raped herself and didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven years okay I don't have time for that actually there's a whole country\nWith all sorts of real problems to address tend to\nWatch you really have to be a Republican senator since you had to take that seriously these people fall for the same ... every single time for football and you have like Senator from Arizona's like really get a hearing really\nIf there are multiple claims being made yes they should be investigated this is a guy who's had six FBI investigations ... background in the space Twenty years\nRadical clearance that allowed him ... codes ... nuclear arsenal\nThat vetted and yet we needed another on the basis of claims that have no sense to actually shut all member tacking Christian for it I'm just making the obvious point she claims that this happens from him for people she says for president of course they didn't happen and no one has the brass to ask follow up questions in the\nBook it's a joke is what's actually happening it's a joke and only the Republicans in the Senate don't know what\nThis is the either some said they had no recollection ever of anything like that ever happening or being at any party in the case of a best friend she said well I I don't doubt what professor for to saying about I don't have any recollection\nBut also professor of foreign identified one person and that was mark judge and mark judge having been in the room when this alleged assault took place and he has said over and over again that's not true\nNow they made statements under\nPenalty of felony and if they so when the FBI goes back to them if they changed their story they would be admitting to committing a felony\nSo I'm not really expecting a whole lot to change here except now the Democrats are put out a statement earlier today and they are now demanding all the witnesses telling the FBI how to do their job and meanwhile when they had a chance last week to talk about this Ramirez or\nA Michael ... client they passed than they punted and they didn't bring it up\nBut now they want to end it into that aspect and put so\nBut why we playing along with this I mean they actually\nGot to tell you why because Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski they they wanted this extra work done it was supposed to be limited in scope and uh just a limited amount of time it didn't turn out that way\nFlake is not in control the Senate they could pass it without flake in where the leaders other than ... and I hate to say it Lindsey Graham seems to be the only person\nWilling to tell the truth but where the rats were the other night in Republican senators out there on television make their case not just for Brett Kavanaugh but common sense and presumption of innocence but where are these people and they they control the United States Senate they haven't passed any of the agenda pretty much\nThe president land on they're giving the finger to their own voters and on this one thing they can't just tell the truth\nWhy is that for art and were they afraid of exactly I don't understand\nWhat do you think that you've been in\nNews a long time you were back in the crossfire days I think even had a stint shortly at MSNBC I don't know how that worked out for you but uh I got fired yeah um well I mean I think that they are one opinion network and that's it and it's all conspiracy all hate Trump all the time but\nI'm now you've been doing really well in the Fox news channel news shows doing really well and uh ... what is the difference that you think is happening with cable news today I mean we're on the opinion side of things and Fox obviously I was a news division but\nI kind of look at what I Do is talk show host as being the entire newspaper we report news sometimes it straight news we even do investigative reporting other days\nReport news sometimes it straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we get a strong opinions other interviews we have people give opinion um we do sports we do culture pop culture it's to me it's the whole newspaper all these other people claim to be reporters and they're anything but\nWe break a lotta news on our show and we have reporters working on the show they're only job is to buy new things to fleshed out do interviews I mean I you know I I had been in this my whole life to what my family that I don't feel insecure about you know why you're not a journalist whatever I don't care what you call me\nBut we bring new facts Hawaii\nEvery night and I see our drop water Ricardo explain what this new to really confusing time I wrote a book about it that's what the book is how do we get here why did this happen why did Trump got elected who didn't get a black grow up what actually happened what actually happened was\nThe people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions about our culture our economy our foreign policy they never said sorry and they never worked at the end so voters got mad at punish them are good for them but why we're\nSo that's I that's what I did my job is to explain what ... me and I think maybe disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right\nNo I think the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least we're honest about it I totally like for example there'll be days on this radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on TV there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there were days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that have opinions\nAnd that's what it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host you know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist\nNo but I Do journalism it's part of what I Do but we don't just do that [noise] um anyway\nTalking a little bit ... all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be crushed her silence why don't\nYou know what I mean there are less the nine ... there was a yeah I Know it does a handful of US Soccer

that is\nThe highest twelve plus our on WABC the two highest\nTwenty five fifty four hours on WABC in LA no different than three highest ... plus hours on end to the highest twenty five fifty but now that doesn't mean anything to you and it shouldn't but in our business\nWell it was common for victims to be uncertain about dates Dr Ford failed to explain how she was suddenly able to narrow the timeframe to a particular season any particular year\n\nWell let's say the shoe was on the other foot and it was Kavanaugh would they tolerate that and say\nWhy he's credible no they wouldn't this is a big deal ladies and gentleman\nEarly eighties mid eighties early teens late teens\nThat's not memory loss\nDr Ford has struggled to identify judge\nKavanaugh as the assailant by name NO NAME was given in her twenty twelve marriage therapy notes NO NAME was given under twenty Thirteen individual therapy notes\nWhy not\n\nDr Ford has been claims to recall that she identified judge Kavanaugh by name and twenty twelve by the way before I read on that's her husband ... irrelevant\nAt that point judge Kavanaugh's name was widely reported in the press has a potential Supreme Court nominee if Governor Romney won the presidential election in any event it took doctor for over Thirty years the name or a sailing delayed disclosure of abuses common so this is not dispositive she writes\nShe's nicer than I Am\nWhen speaking with her husband Dr Ford changed her description of the incident to become less specific Dr Ford testified that she told her husband about a quote unquote sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post but she and former husband that she was the victim of a physical abuse at the beginning of their marriage\nShe testified that both time she was referring to the same\nIncident Dr Ford has no memory of key\nDetails of the night in question details that could help corroborate her account we talked about this last week the memory to me as quite selective\nSpecific details specific details that are most harmful to Kavanaugh no details at all oh cooperation\nShe does not remember who invited her to the party or how she even heard about it she does not remember how she got to the party she does not remember in one house the assault allegedly took place\nOf that house was located with any specificity perhaps most importantly she does not remember how she got from the party back to her house\nHer inability to remember this detail race has significant questions she told the Washington Post the party took place near the Columbia Country club the club is more than seven miles from her childhood home as the crow flies and\nShe testified it was roughly a twenty minute drive from a childhood home she also great for the first time in her testimony that she was driven somewhere that night either to the party or from the party or both\nBut you couldn't remember\nDr Ford was able to describe hiding in the bathroom locking the door and subsequently accent accepting the house she also has also described wanting to make sure that she did not look like she'd been attacked\nBut she has no memory of who drove over or when nor has anyone come forward to identify him or herself as the driver\nNo one given this all took place before cell phones\nArranging a ride home would not have been easy indeed she stated that she ran out of the house after coming downstairs and did not state that she made a phone call from the house before she did was that she called anyone else there after\nThat's convenient because then they can't look at phone records\nShe does however remember small distinct details from the party unrelated to the assault for example she testified that she had exactly one beer at the party was taking no medication at that\nTime of the alleged assault and we'll continue this after the break but as I said last week during the course of this questioning by the prosecutor was devastating\nAnd then we have the experts judicial analyst and a host the other one is she doing what is she doing she's growing up but that I mean that doesn't mean anything to the American\nMeans everything everything as it did you stop listening to these Maron after she testified they said Kavanaugh's time he comes up and he's not done then they tell you this woman's incompetent and confident she sent us confident in the [noise] I'll be right back\n[noise]\n\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in those dollars by some experts say another crashes coming what will be left of your investments for your children are your grandchildren will you know you can't fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins in an IRA from Augusta precious metals\nDuring periods are great volatility precious metals regularly outperform stocks because they were true wealth and said that have real value\nDuring this through your recovery period after the two thousand eight crashed the Dow went up ... three point five percent well gold doubled in price call Augusta now at eight five five eight five eight five eight or seven and learn how to I re by my physical gold and silver\nCan hedge against inflation and build a true legacy for your family regained control of your financial destiny and calling us are precious metals right now they'd five five eight five eight five eight oh seven to get your free gold Ira guide\nQuote unquote but she testified that Dr ... actually with a judge Kavanaugh or mark judge turned up the music in the bedroom so that the people there's could not hear her scream\n\nShe testified that after the incident she ran into the bathroom lock the door and heard them going downstairs but she maintained that she could not hear the conversation with others when they got downstairs instead she testified that she assumed that conversation took place\n\nNoticed she never said she turned down the music either that any of them turn down the music\n[noise] her account of who was that the party has been inconsistent according to the Washington Post's accounted for therapy notes\nThere were four boys in the bedroom and what she was assaulted she told the Washington Post that the notes erroneous because there were four boys at the party but only two in the bedroom in her letter to Senator Feinstein she said me and for others were present at the party\nEntered testimony she said there were four boys in addition to leading Kaiser and herself she could not remember the name of the fourth boy and no one has come forward\nDr Ford listed Patrick PJ ...\nAs a bystander quote unquote in her statement to the political refer and enter July sixth text to the Washington Post although she testified that it was an accurate to call him a bystander she did not live legal in Kaiser even though they are good friends leave link Kaiser's presidents should have been more memorable\nThan PJ ...\n\nDr Ford has struggled to recall important recent events relating to her allegations in her testimony regarding recent events raises further questions about our memory raises further questions about her credibility 'cause we're talking about things that are recent a few months ago not thirty six years ago\nDr Ford struggle to remember her interactions with the Washington Post\nDr Ford cannot remember she showed a full or partial set of therapy notes for the Washington Post reporter she does not remember whether she showed the post reporter\nThe actual therapists notes her own summary of those notes the Washington Post article that portions of her therapist notes were provided by Ford and reviewed by the post but in her testimony doctor for it cannot recall whether she summarize the nose for the reporter or showed her the actual records actually was even more and I took notes during the testimony to\nShe thought she may have summarized them over the phone or couldn't remember whether she physically handed in anything over I mean it was really preposterous we're talking about July, July sixth\n\nShe does not remember if she actually had a copy of the notes when she texted the Washington Post WhatsApp I count on July six Dr Ford set in their first what's at message to the post that she quote\nAt therapy notes talking about unquote the incident when she contacted the post tip line she testified she'd reviewed a therapy notes before contact and oppose\nTo determine whether the ... whether they mentioned anything about the alleged since then but could not remember if she had a copy of these notes and she said in her ... message or merely review the inner therapists off and on wait a minute\nSo she couldn't remember on July sixth if she had a copy downloaded the copy of her therapist notes or had reviewed them in her therapist's office does anyone believe that\n\nShe's providing information to the Washington Post and she can't remember\nA few months ago if she downloaded them from the Internet or if she had reviewed them in her therapist's office\n\nCan you imagine if Kavanaugh said this about drinking back in high school I Can't remember if they\nWere drinking at night I don't remember if I had three cans or six I don't remember too are far and we can hear call me saying and I love the law is very big thing so I Would ask call me and I would ask Blumenthal Mr Vietnam vet not I would ask him\nIs a little lie\nWhat does that evidence they say more lies\nLadies and gentlemen I'm here to tell you this is not a memory Asia this was an attempt by her lawyers and I think her now to put a round peg in a square hole or square peg in around you get the point\nIt makes no sense this was July sixth wasn't thirty six years ago wasn't even six months ago\n\nDr Ford refused to provide any of our therapy notes that the committee and that\nIs outrageous they should be subpoenaed she waived her privileged on these therapy notes\nDr forwards explanation 'em by the way I'm sure Shelley White House Sally Whitehouse of Rhode Island school of what are we supposed to do rely on a ladder\nThat's a long trip where they actually asked\nBy God do I have another drink item in not in the public\nDr Ford's explanation of why she disclosed her allegations the way she did raises questions\nShe claimed originally that she wished for her story to remain confidential\nBut the person operating the tip line at the Washington Post was the first person other than her therapist or a husband to whom she disclose the identity of her alleged attacker she testified that she had a sense of urgency to relay the information to the Senate and the president quote unquote she did not contact the Senate\nBecause she claim she quote did not know how to do that on quote it's very hard\nTo contact the Senate\nYou could what we called Google you could call what we could bang you could what we call call even for one the one you could call or ask one of the people on the beach who you consult and apparently frequently uh millions of people contact\nThe Senate every every year we have our living surges diet and Google on the phone number for the Senate is right there she did not contact the Senate didn't\nNot explain why she knew how to contact her congresswoman but not as senator Dr Ford cannot remember if she was being audio or video recorded when she took the polygraph she could not remember whether the polygraph occurred the same day as your grandmother's funeral the day after her grandmother's funeral again these are all reason\nIt would also been inappropriate to administer polygraph to someone who was grieving\nSays the prosecutor Dr forge description\nOf the physiological impact to the event raises questions\nSays the prosecutor she maintains that she suffers from anxiety claustrophobia post traumatic stress disorder Pete TST\nThe data the hearing was delayed because the committee was informed that her symptoms prevent her from flying but she agreed doing her testimony that she flies quote fairly frequently for her hobbies and work unquote she flies to the mid Atlantic\nFairly frequently for her hobbies and work unquote she flies to the mid Atlantic at least once a year to visit her family she's flown to Hawaii French Polynesia Costa Rica she also flew to Washington DC for the hearing\nNo to that her attorneys refused they private hearing or interview Dr Ford testified that she was not clear whether investigators were willing to travel to California interviewer\nIt therefore it's not clear that her attorneys ever communicated chairman Grassley has offered to send investigators demeanor in California or wherever she wanted to meet to conduct the interview\nWe pointed all these points that are important she alleges that she struggled academically in college but she's never made any similar claim about her two years of high school\n\nIt's significant that she used the word contributed contributed when she described the ... the psychological impact of the incident with the Washington Post use of the word contributed rather than cars suggest that other life events may contribute to her symptoms and one question on that point\nSaid that she could think of nothing as striking as the alleged assault in other words she wouldn't that to it\n\nAnd the prosecutor ads the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr forge attorneys likely affect the doctor for the count and she attached a very detailed timetable\nOnce the lawyers and the Democrats got a hold of events I'll be right back [noise] much\nIndividuals
