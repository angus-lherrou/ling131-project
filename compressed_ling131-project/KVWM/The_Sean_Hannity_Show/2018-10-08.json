doctor Gorka coming up next quarter page also stopped by that straight ahead [noise]\nAll right joining us now is the man himself he's got his brand new book out today I Love the title and I liked the content even more why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies Dr Sebastian Gorka is with us or how are you my Frank this book is a must read for everybody and how are you good to see him\nVery excited show and thanks for having me or I didn't think uh this title would be as appropriate as it is often low Seventy two hours but man we are in a fight right now for the future of the republic\nIt is a fight for the future of the republic the one thing I Love about you and I've come to know you very well is that your patriots\nAnd you understand evil in our time evil abroad the need to defend and keep America strong and you understand the political aspects of it as well because if you elect the wrong people and what are you going to have policies of appeasement again in that renders us more vulnerable\nJust look at the last eight years what do we have we had a commander in chief who started his presidency with an apology tour\nAnd then he blamed all the bad things in the world on America what resulted the rise of ISIS Russia invading its ... Chinese Chinese re militarization of the end of the Obama administration just one metric take take politics out of it for a second\nWe had sixty five million refugees in the world that's more than we had at the end of World War two when you don't have American leadership the world is a dangerous place now that ... thanks to Donald Trump now we have a commander in chief who believes\nThat even exists read his wall so speech listen to what he says about ISIS about what the Chinese are doing\nWhat he said at the un line yes\nAbsolutely absolutely so that's why I wrote why we fight but but you're absolutely correct we have domestic issues here he will exist not just outside of our borders look what they did to the godly man Brett Kavanaugh in the last fourteen days a man who had\nThe probably the cleanest most spotless record in an American public life goes from being\nA stand up standing federal judge to amass rapist they will use every tool because they lost the election and that's why the next thirty days are so important shown\nIt means ah everything and then look everything's riding on this\nI don't know if you would have asked me three weeks ago I Would have leaned in on the side that history would would win out because the party that wins the White House\nUsually ends up losing seats in a midterm election they totally not happened three times you've only picked up seats three times in the last hundred years the last was after two thousand and one of the attack in the eye on number eleven September eleventh\nUm but there's so much at stake here and that is what ... literally jumps off the pages I'm reading through your book that we better defeat Americans enemies and we'd better do without apologies tactic orca we don't get to do that if we're not in power right\nWe we have to take very seriously this concept of the left so the left has been taken over by the radicals\nThink about the fact that JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today a hardcore anti communist stronger national security\nYou wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have we have the crazies we have the costs you'll Cortez is we have the Maxine Waters and control who have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply the ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool well guess who use that philosophy in the past that philosophy\nDrives to the labor camps to drive to the ... and the drive to death camps whether you are right wing extremist whether you're a fascist whether you're a communist that's the philosophy and we've got to stop that shall we have to stay true to the principles of the republic you\nTalk it in a book about the a will to win and again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and here's what we can't have any more and you talk about the will to when you talk about will\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized it is and we pulled out you know in Iraq and Afghanistan\nWe pull out weaving of dates of our withdrawal and we lost nearly six thousand kids and and so many others comeback without their arms and legs in their in their faces just figured fighting for their country we cannot commit American troops ever again\nUnless we're willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war than we are not get involved ever period unless we have to you have to win these wars or else don't start to be involved in them\nSo so my book is about two things it's about all the threats we face as a country so whether it's ISIS Russia or China\nBut the second part is much more important this is the one who hitting on it do we have the will to defeat our enemies because Vietnam is a great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with wooden sticks and rusty rifles defeat us\nHow's that possible because we lost the war at home because we allowed the left to undermine our will to win\nAnd at one of the most important things is the individual real to win in addition to the ... of the threats I have four vignettes of American heroes I go back to the Bobby was two hundred years ago I took about a Korean hero adjusted Paula I talk about a man who spent six and a half years as a naval aviator in the Hanoi Hilton\nAlthough I talk about a man who spent six and a half years as a naval aviator in the Hanoi Hilton but the last story is very very important for what we're seeing right now and it's ... chambers\nMost kids have no idea where to contain but this this is a man who was cabinet owed before capital was born in Nineteen forty eight the\nFirst live televised Senate hearing was a man who would accept chambers who have been a communist age with all the Soviets who went on record saying hey I'm no longer communist but I Need America to know where the communist off\nIn the government including el ... his he was a guy who was working for the Soviet what happened to this man who stood up for the truth\nThey accused him of everything cheating on his wife ... of the death of being responsible for the death of his brother none of it was true but what did he do you have the will to fight he stood up for the truth justice justice cabin on the show on his his his his a scary thing\nThe Democrats have done this before don't be surprised at what they did to Capitol they've done it Seventy years ago\nI they have done it every election in my lifetime they play the race card the jet rye or you know they divide America old versus young rich versus poor black versus white this is the identity politics which which they have mastered and I keep playing them and their own words it's not like I'm making it up\nQuick

I mean to a movie right Hobbs story\nWhat he says you know the half the true happiness is due suffering you know we all live to live when you learn from in ... and the one you live after that\nKavanaugh is done with life number one the one he learned from he learned what the left will do that\nNow he's living the life after that and he's figuring out that the path to true happiness and accomplishment is going to be through suffering and sadly folks I mean this from the bottom of my heart sadly cabin on his family is going to suffer the rest of their life just like Clarence Thomas and his family have suffered for the rest of their life\nThese are sterling individuals' user patriots dedicated parents spouses coaches people who've been through more than you and I can imagine in many cases and for the rest of their lives are going to have to deal with liberal not jobs saying the most disgusting filthy things to them and their families\nBut they blew an opportunity because now Brett Kavanaugh's in life and number two\nHe's learned a lot from that first life he's probably learned a lot from the last days of those first lives that end on that are that ended on Saturday that life is now over he's now justice cabinet and he's going to have to deal with the left for the rest of his life\n\nChokes me up a bit sometimes thinking about it it's a good man a good man a decent human being the people I Know and I trust you know I worked in the Bush White House I did not know Brett Kavanaugh personally I I make a make no assertions otherwise but I Know people who did\nAnd the people I Know who knew him I trust trust with my my car my kids my house anything they swear by this man swear by this man what happened to him was an intergalactic embarrassment above highest order it was a cosmic imbalance of grotesque proportions\nBut they blew that and now Brett Kavanaugh is in life and number two\nWhere he understands what he was dealing with him what's been put behind them those doors unfortunately are now largely clothes for him but what's ahead of them is justice\nFreedom liberty\nAnd his seat on the Supreme Court bench to fight for those causes embodied in the constitution\n\nAll right let me take a call here when I usually don't take calls in the first hour but because I always open the phones to ah people on the other side of the aisle to get their opinion that if you want to give us a call each other and seven three one three one one uh please do liberals conservatives whatever I take 'em all\nLet's go to Carl in New Jersey Carl what are you got for us how are you a thank\nYou for taking my call You're welcome and I think it went on and on about Mr having off judge Kavanaugh I listen to the hearing\nBefore all this stuff broke loose and I and many of my liberal friends educated all agreed that he's perfectly fine to be on the court overturn the restraining\nStuff is just nonsense and people don't really listen to what you don't you don't look at how they're going to vote one way other you're not supposed to say you know the damn lost something whether Republicans gained something the country again someone who could be in park that being said I wanted to get your comment about\nUh your financial future in jeopardy if the liberals are in power sure and history and like I said your screeners at the last time that we had a terrible economic downturn that was under a conservative president not\nWho is the conservative president\nIt if we had we had a big problem in a recession that we have a bank problem\nAnd yeah but who is the ... a weight I'm I'm ... I'm confused there was a kid who was the last conservative president\nUtah I I don't remember one of those\nGeorge Bush recall that well ...\nListen I ... I I appreciate your opening and I promise I'll give you the chance to respond by trying to be a jerk but\nI don't know if it's that you're a liberal and you don't or you aren't really reading on conservatism I Love George W. Bush I worked for the man I Would have literally given my life for him I was a secret service agent ... I'm not being hyperbolic I mean that was my job he was a good and decent human being\nGeorge W. Bush was not exactly a conservative president okay the spending levels of the government spending was out of control we had Medicare part D I like George W. Bush there were some great things that happened the tax cuts package but I think\nInsisting he was a conservative president is a little bit of a stretch so let let me just stop you right he was more of a moderate Republican establishment type I think that's more fair analysis that's like saying that's like me coming out and saying to you\nHey Brock Obama was a moderate he wasn't he wasn't moderate on any issue at all and I think you know that um so so go back to your ... your point is that the economy went south under George W Bush because of conservatism now\nLet me ask you a question if you don't mind\nWhat but certainly device deal whether it be limited government limited government spending limited government intervention the economy caused that recession\nOne word deregulation\nAh how how exactly do you figure that when deregulation or the repeal of Glass Steagall happened under Bill Clinton\nThe bank where all the regulator ... you're actually right 'cause I I I'm as\nI Know I'm right but but the reason I'm right to follow this number one the deregulation you're mentioning happened under Bill Clinton number one and number two\nUh tell me the commercial banks that went under because liberal site this talking point often they said was deregulation and it was the splitting of investment banks from commercial banks so I always said I'm OK well explained to me what commercial banks one under as a result the voters central ...\nNobody who will now all the problems with the stock market and the mortgage industry and\nAllowing call no no I I we can't get pass we\nSee the first for me and you have a back and forth\nYou can't just bypass uncomfortable question you said that it was a conservative president that had the last recession I disputed that it was a Republican president now what I'm trying to suggest he was the recession was not caused by what you said it was caused by and I'd like you to my knowledge that the deregulation happened under Clinton that's just the fact\nThat well the last now in the coffee or right was under Bill Clinton and how it happened for many years before that because what happens is when you have regulations right what\nHappens is the the ensuing administration is left and right who were bought and paid for by special interests over the decades years in\nYeah but but the call your point you're making isn't even true I'm asking you if the deregulation that commercial back the these these skills some of the commercial and the midnight joining of the commercial investment banks was the cause of the recession then what commercial banks there should be some evidence that a number of commercial banks went under the answer is you\nWhat commercial banks there should be some evidence that a number of commercial banks went under the answer is you you can't answer because there there there there's no answer to it so I listen I Can't go on to all day because if it's a walkie talkie I Want a boy the audience to that I'm just trying to make a point I appreciate your call though don't hang of it I I think you're a reasonable guy\nI just wish that whereas I can criticize some of the the policies by George W. Bush I thought were wrong I Wish you'd open your eyes to you can't just throw out something like oh deregulation that Bush was terrible and then not follow up at all and presenting the facts and data that's totally irresponsible that's not what happens\nIf you see what what happened is under Bush right at the very end of it a year in power when everything fell apart just prior to a bomber being elected alright\nCar listen I gotta run we're up against the break I'm Sorry but em listen thanks for the call but sorry folks that's not what happened I could go on about this all day we we lost because we had we had a cheap money problem\nWe had a bunch of G. S. these government sponsored enterprises in Fannie and Freddie than incentivize people to buy homes they simply could not afford that was the genesis of the housing crisis that ripple through the economy\nMajority mismatch is it was it's a very simple problem to observe looking at it in retrospect and claiming it was a massive deregulatory after that happened other Clinton therefore the Republicans caused a recession I'm Sorry\nIs just completely utterly absurd All right up there by you know in from work when I got to take a break we'll get to some other callers I promise you eight seven seven three one two three and one month we'll be right back [noise] much\nYour data is everywhere data breaches Facebook breaches big companies mining and sharing your information these are legitimate companies but they are putting you at risk and now you add in all the crux since ... cameras and the risk of ID theft it's insane look the best thing you can do is protect yourself and your family it's why I switched to my id care\nFor identity protection they're the best in the business for playing starting from less than ten dollars a month and only my\nId care offers a one hundred percent money back recovery guarantee you can sign up at my id cared dot com slash mark my id care has taken care of fortune five hundred companies for years but now they're protection is available to people like you and me and you my listeners also get Fifteen Percent off at my\nId cared dot com slash marks and our promo code mark learn more\nAnd then let my id can't take care of you my id care dot\nCom slash mark ... mark that's my id care dot com slash mark", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Show Low", "day": "08"}
