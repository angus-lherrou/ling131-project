wanted to mention it to you know\nI Want to swing back into Florida this Florida race is particularly important as far as I'm concerned because it's a ... what the Democratic Party is up to\nAndrew Gillum is repulsive to me\nAs he has dipped his toe repeatedly and the anti Semitism and anti Semitic actions and yet he's tried to turn this campaign into a campaign of race to try and turn up the minority base in Florida and it may well be work\nHe's a radical left us he wants to destroy Medicare he wants to destroy all your private health care systems all\nUnions out there who've\nNegotiated for your health care all this stuff goes away if you have quote unquote Medicare for all they use the word Medicare because they know many of your love Medicare\nSo they're using the word Medicare to destroy Medicare Medicare for all means a iron fist that top down health care program that's what they're talking about\nGovernment run government run we don't need a government run health care program\n\nNow this guy Gillum is making racial slurs against his opponent run to scientists who served in combat\nHe's now saying that dissent just wrote a book that support slavery\n\nSo I I went back and I read what this guy Gillum is talking about\n\nAnd it's also up at hot air if you want to check it but I I'll upon them\nIt's not supporting slavery and the least he's explaining one happened here's what he wrote here's what he wrote\nHe wrote and I'm paraphrasing that what happened at the constitutional convention was\nThat they couldn't push the issue of slavery as far as someone or to push it\nAlthough some wanted to push it all the way that is the abolition of it because you wouldn't have a United States under those circumstances you wouldn't have brought in South Carolina Georgia and some of these other states in this there's no question that's the history\nOf what took place that's the history of what took place Benjamin Franklin was an abolitionist\n\nAlexander Hamilton was an abolitionist several of them were abolitionist but they voted\nThe way they voted because they felt they needed to have a union and then from there they could address the rest that's exactly what took place you know who else took that position sixty years later\nWell Seventy some years later Abraham Lincoln he explained it exactly the same way that they had to leave it to their progeny their children and grandchildren to fix the citrus slavery\n\nBut if there hadn't been a union that wouldn't have been a civil war to eliminate\nThat's what the scientists rights for all intents and purposes taking up the position that Lincoln took up taking up the position to Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton took up so this guy Andrew Gillum\nSays that demonstrates that to say this wrote a book defending slavery\n\nNow this man is repulsive and he's a demagogue\nHe has a lot is way through this election about the undercover FBI investigation not only the city but him\nHim it was shut up when they gave him that ticket to Hamilton it was set up when they gave him a ... a hotel room I set up when he got a trip to Costa Rica any pretense\nThat he wasn't under or is not under investigation and if you're dead already said you're attacking all African Americans that Sally stretch it out\n\nThat Sally shut you down but I Want to tell you a little bit more about this man who the Democrats are hanging their hopes on rock Obama's in Florida campaigning for Joe Biden's in Florida Hillary Clinton how can they back a man like this\n\nI Would ask him as NBC and CNN how can they back a man like this who has a history like this\n\nAaron Klein over at Breitbart the good man that ties\nBetween the Israel boycott promoting an anti\nPolice dream defenders group\nAnd the Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum run deeper than previously reported\nGillum work at the George Soros finance people for the American way you remember that Norman Lear group\nWhere he served as director of youth leadership programs from two thousand five until twenty Seventeen and over that's a long time and oversaw a radical training outfit calling itself young people for or why pie for\n\nPhilip Agnew the cofounder of dream defenders remember that name dream defenders is it two thousand five graduate of dealings former why pie for group\n\nNow Galen is why pie for gave Agnew that Norman Lear award named after the producer and activists who founded people for the American way you know that group hardcore left wing trash is constitutionally nominees to the court\n\nIs faced controversy over his refusal to disavow dream defenders which is engaged in activities to promote the boycott of Israel as spouses anti patriotic anti\nCapitalism anti military anti police ideology\nCapitalism airtime military anti police ideology with which Gillum has already been associated\nThat dream defenders website refers to the Empire State of Israel as quote the site of a continued shetler colonial project on ... said this is\nAll about anti Semitism and laments US military aid to the Jewish state large section of the site promotes the group's anti Israel activists now why isn't this being reported on CNN and MSNBC\nInstead they're promoting him\n\nGillum stream defenders allies compiled an education tool for us teachers about quote liberation movements and\nThat glorifies the popular front for the liberation of Palestine\nPF helped me a deadly terrorist organization well I guess he has a lot in common with Obama\nRepublican challenger Ron descent as has repeatedly called for him to distance himself from the dream defenders\nAnd during a debate nine days ago John claimed that he had no idea what the scientists was referring to when he brought up my dream defenders pledge Gillum reportedly signed that\nSupports a radical manifesto the fact is Andrew sign a pledge with a dream defenders pledging his support this radical manifesto decide just said during the debate I have no idea what pledge he's talking about the only reply so he's a liar\nAnd that's a pattern whether it's tickets to Hamilton a hotel room Costa Rica is that pattern\nA ball face line because he thinks his supporters and his would be voters are so stupid they're going to buy is race baiting his ... they're going to buy his Hawaiian\n\nGillum claim of ignorance about the pledge came despite is already known close relationship with dream defenders Gillum has talked about aiding the group's activism and has written a strong support of dream defenders and its cofounded this fella Agnew\nTo whom he was a mentor and turn Agnew himself recently described a long and close working a personal relationship but go on and said he considers going to be part of the movement quote unquote\nGillum was taped that age June debate saying that he is pleased at proud to have snake food that dream defender activists going thirty they sleep in protest at the
