I Would flip out that joy when I taught them\nI'll tell you I think there's two aspects of this first of all I mean you saw this with the kids in the high school that had the shooting last year down in your state where you know they almost immediately it looked like they were media trained professionals with the anti gun anti Second Amendment narrative and that didn't happen by accident this is what they learn in school\nIn our public schools they they they learn all of these talking points and tactics they literally do\n'em but secondly ... for those who are not so plugged in and so
