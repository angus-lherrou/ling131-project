ability to reason\nGiven three different\nAnswers as to when the assault happened mid eighties early eighties and all of a sudden actually was the summer in Nineteen eighty two after she lawyers up\nYou have to believe that she waited waited\nReally until now to reveal that the individual who assaulted her it was in fact judge Kavanaugh never said anything to anybody else although her husband now has circled back and said oh I remember her telling me doing marriage therapy okay we'd like to see the notes they won't return they won't release the nose so that's not believable\n\nShe can't remember a key details about the night who invited her to the party how she heard about the party how she got to the party how she left the party where the houses exactly with any specificity and of course most importantly how she left the party with whom she left the party how she\nTraveled back home when she got back home\n\nThe alleged assault has not been corroborated by single person including none of the people she's named including as well her lifelong girlfriend Leland Kaiser that apparently is not change based on reports today she hasn't provided a consistent account of the

can't remember if it was video or audio recorded and the committee would like to know they want to see\nIf in fact she was traumatized during the course of the excuse me lie detector test if she claims\n\nShe talks about the psychological impact that had that she doesn't want to fly she has difficulty flying now we know that was a flat out lie\nAnd say that yes a flat outline\nShe's flown

asked to shop for a hearing she couldn't fly although it has said that she was already on the east coast [noise]\nShe didn't know that the Senate Judiciary committee Republicans the majority had offered to go to California to interview her in any form\nAnd uh\nWhy didn't you know ... people say her lawyers must have withheld that information maybe the lawyers didn't withhold the information maybe she just didn't give a forthright answer\nWe know from her ex boyfriend\nThat she never mentioned Kavanaugh's name she never mentioned sexual assault in the six years that they live together and the few years before that that they dated we know she had no problem with claustrophobia because she had an apartment there was five hundred square feet that's a small apartment\nThat's a very small apartment\nWe know that she never mentioned Kevin O's name to her boyfriend who live in boyfriend have six years so you have to\nBelieve the unbelievable\nTo believe her testimony against Brett Kavanaugh you have to believe the unbelievable you must suspend your reasoning and now that I've gone all through that she's not the bubble lady\nShe came for she said it was a civic duty she's presented herself to the American people and we get the judge said it's not the only body that gets the judge you and I get the judge and we don't have to self censor have to be rude and hateful and all the rest I'm not that and we're not doing that\nNow what if Kavanaugh say that was so unbelievable or contradicted absolutely nothing that I'm aware of what that he may have had more drinks one day then another day he's the one who showed up with this calendars\n\nHe's the one who had witnesses who said he was never there\n\nBut you say the FBI didn't interview him or Ford now according to Ford's lawyers who are very upset and of course the Democrats are all one in the same but that's not the nature of this investigation it's not a criminal investigation\nThey testified in public under penalty of perjury there's nothing else for them to say\nSo why do we continue to play what see what the Democrats we should play brass knuckles with the Democrats say enough already missed a flight
