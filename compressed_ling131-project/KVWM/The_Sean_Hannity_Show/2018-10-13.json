what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think it gets thing is uh Shaun is is I let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nI think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measure I tell you who's not measured at this particular point uh\nIt's been extremely measured I tell you who's not measured at this particular point uh you've you've got Rod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he's the number two at the oj I can tell you got to people on the phone today Jim Jordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nOkay Jim Jordan why is this even an issue why isn't you you have the power to subpoena Rod Rosenstein who you are not and bring 'em in and put them on ...\nYeah I mean and this is why that should happen and I hope I hope chairman Goodlatte will do that we've already subpoenaed than McCain memos and the kitten was or what the New York times\nCited that said there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who said listen I was talking about recording the presence of the United states so we have the FBI former chief counsel a council of getting bigger saying he took that as seriously when he was told about that meeting\nThat Rod Rosenstein was thinking about recording the commander in chief of this great country and we have in the Cape memos that reinforce that we've subpoenaed that became memos and we've asked ...\nTo come in and answer a question neither one of those things that happen\nSo that that you know Mr Rogers is leading that you played Shawn he talked about trends he he talked about facts and and the here and do this and our our our ... our justice system works well one of the hallmarks of our justice system is transparency show what the documents give us the Cape memos and more importantly comments or questions that's what bothers both\nWell why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\nWell I can tell you that you can mitigate has shown weak leadership and I'm I I hate to criticize anybody a but we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house majority leader of the house\nOr Jim Jordan and I with chairman Goodlatte\nIn the room and and two or three other staffers we all agree that what we would do is move expeditiously to have him come into a transcribe interview and if they did not if\nRod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in a than we would subpoena him and compel him to do that and I can tell you that ah\nIt's it's more excuses on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired of\nSo we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and could\nLiterally force him to come and testify under oath an answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme a plan now you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe but now James Baker all saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states\nIn the hopes that it would provide materials that they could invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about it and said sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm and that\nAnd they are saying that they all believe he was taking it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... the guy who was in effect running apartment\nShould not be joking with support it's about recording the commander in chief of the United states\nThat ... that even if it's a joke that's not something you do it particularly at the time that this was happening remember this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on late night the president fires give them call me on may seventeenth ... Bob Mueller the special counsel is one of the huge already ... happen in between there\nRemember Lisa Page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was little menial leaks strategy\nSo that they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was the page and struck we're talking about and it seems we've got our answer now\nWell you're right I think not only were they licking an arid of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this you know where we got actually a memos that have been subpoenaed testimony that there\nAre a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet they knew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media could not be substantiated\nI I Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead and I'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein red defies an application many side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony is\nChilling the amount of documents that they failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well didn't\nThey will read them do we know they failed to read the more they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here\nI'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed it out that the bulk of information use to obtain the Pfizer warrants\nThat that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated they never verified they'd never corroborated any of the steel ... of this of course the ... deals\nYou know dot CA and as a result was used as the bulk of informational pain the war ends and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell they they that's correct that not even a steel and Simpson believe all the things that were given the Bruce or but here's the other problem\nHis is even Bruce or knew that some of the things that he was writing there were not accurate and and yet somehow they get\nPut in a three oh two and they get used as a justification to actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sickening it truly is sick me\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appear tomorrow under oath and answer these questions whether or not\nHe talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes of of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman Goodlatte indicated that he would do that so now is the time obviously to get that down and make sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there\nTo answer these important questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between may ninth and may seventeenth of twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with\nPage and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got to subpoena we've got to bring him into the gas the questions\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest

I I Am a way to uh I'm In a way\nTo drive the four cylinder Silverado until\nThe to make a final judgment on it but I I was disappointed with the fuel economy and you know they have a force owner and a half ton truck I have trouble rap in my head around that first off but if that's going to be the case back to their to be\nReally good fuel economy and it just wasn't there I mean twenty ... twenty three on the highways mediocre or at best and so I I was disappointed how do you turn to ship around I Do several times and I got to be honest Robert\nThere is no tricks or gimmicks to it it's all about people it was who I hired and who the training that we put them through a lot of people that own dealerships just give sort of lip service to a couple of areas one of them is training\nAnd I was a big believer in that because I wanted him to do things my way and my wife was a proven way and it worked and I that's the way I wanted him to do it or the second thing is\nThey don't do a lot of times don't try to find higher and retain the best people in the industry I overpaid my people and I know that\nAnd that's okay because when with another dealership will call one of my people and say hey we're looking for somebody to fill the position are you interested and I'm sure they always\nThey were looking for somebody to fill a position are you interested and I'm sure they always ask the question what does it pay\nAnd they they couldn't hire him away they wouldn't pay him what I was paying now if I'm going to pay that kind of money I have expectations\nAnd the biggest one is you take care of the customer\nBut first off my philosophy was unless you've got happy employees you can't have happy customers and so I worked very hard to go the extra mile and do things for my people if you go back into the archives these true stories up and write and read the one about parties\nAnd and what I did for my people every Christmas and the bonuses that I paid out and and the the the party at the root for all their children on the showroom floor on Saturday and bought each one of them a personalized gift\nIt's those things make the difference but it in Dallas Fort Worth when I was in the business that was twenty nine four wheelers we all had the same in majority we all had the same opportunities we all had nice buildings with breaking glass the difference was\nPeople and if you don't have the best people around you are not going to be successful for very long and really that was I you know the other thing too I think I had I think I had a um I don't I don't know that I call it a gift\nBut that was good it advertising I Would do things different\nI hated typical car dealer ads I never did any TV ad that did all radio and when we ran specials and back then newspaper was a big deal\nWhen we ran specials I wouldn't put a price or vehicle in my newspaper ad unless I had at least twenty five of them so when somebody comes in with a chip on the shoulder said I bet you don't have this one our reaction was what color would you like Robert thanks for the call I Do appreciate\n[noise] things arouse all over the place looking for the ride\nVehicles rat price or you can just simply listen to the car approached him straight talk an honest answer is about everything or demoted you should talk to the ... pro Jerry Reynolds otherwise you might as well just use rock paper scissors to decide you're nice guy call now\nNinety six Seventy seven Seventy says\nWe've all got places to go from\nWe go for music movies workouts and check out it's quite a little sketch if we've got going\nSo you can get right back to go and\nWe're looking for a few select dealers to be car pro USA certified and car pro USA we take it very seriously the car pro USA certify dealer is always focused on delivering a hassle for your experience and a fair price\nIf you're a car dealer or know a car dealer that has the right stuff to be a car pro USA certify dealer bingo the car pro USA dot com in contact us that's car pro USA dot com that\nYou know there's an incredible product to protect your cars dashing staring well from the sun heaps you interior and fits your windshield perfectly\nI like things that that ride at work like they should that's why I Love heat shield it's a windshield sun shade that keeps your car up to forty degrees below while protecting the anterior custom fit for your vehicles wind chill it won't fall down like generic sun shades\nGet yours and I don't think she'll dot com dot com pro two words all caps and the discount codes and get ten percent out that I Do heat shield dot com\nI noticed my neighbor put a broken world's best dad mugging the recycling bin ... curb so it did with anyone would do fixed it with some J.
