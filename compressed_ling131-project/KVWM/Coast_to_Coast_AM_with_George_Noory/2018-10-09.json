more prosperity so I think these ... I think anything that multiplies human ability is\nYou know what's up with a few exceptions the idea if you could make people more productive that's always good if you don't think it is\nThen you should support a law that makes everybody work with one arm tied behind their back because instantly you create tons of new jobs it'll just take a lot more people will do anything uh but our productivity will plummet\nAnd so that's what technology is just like a third arm it means you can do even more\nLet's take some calls here for us by Ron let's pick it up by going to Jackson, Tennessee welcome to the program begins started hey Jeffrey going ahead\nOf time before I Love the outdoors thank you ... it or not they don't want to fly that some ... and fire [laughter] hey I tell you what they don't have and back down and show\nWow no one's saying that don't say that but what what's wrong telling\nMe I won't call it that had a favorite jobs I mean the technology that taking out the white\nWell Byron you're saying that it creates more jobs right I mean look at\nYou you can look at the un unemployment numbers in this country are you know good I mean they're they're down a there's some people who say the workforce participation rate is lower which are the number of people who actually are looking for work\nOr almost all of that can be accounted for by a baby boomers retiring I'm\n... you know technology always empowers people to be able to do more there's this kind of like an infinite number of jobs you\nYou can make a job instantly the minute you take something a lump of clay and you apply labor and technology to it you make something worth more a vase and\nWhatever value you were able to add that to wage and\nBecause technology lets you do more technology increases wages it it's really rough when it when it happens in a localized area and ah so you you get pockets of places where it takes a long time for it to kind of\nShake out and and that's rough and I think we should do a much better job kind of facilitating that up because you know if you can say well it's all going to work out in the long run but people live and the short run\nAnd and that's that's hard and and so we we got to be very mindful of that or we trained people the kinds of safety nets we\nWe provide but to turn against technology to say somehow knowing how to be more productive is bad for for people\nOr I think it's a hard case to make now I'm opposed\nTo and I've said this before driverless trucks I don't want to displace truck drivers are there are hardworking dedicated people and I don't trust a driverless truck I just know what do you think of that\nUm I think that's one of the biggest kind of a myth that a\nIs there is going to be a huge a shortage of truck drivers I think that that goes you know without kind of without saying first of all they're kind of facing a demographic disaster that every year the average age of all the truck drivers is going up\nBecause everybody's like you know young people don't go into it because everybody's like there's a future in that because of self driving trucks so\nMost knowledgeable people in the industry are predicting we're going to have this this great shortage of them and even when we get over the technological hurdles then when we get over that legislative hurdles they they still were only going to be able to do part of the hall\nStill don't want to see a driver\nThey they still were only going to be able to do part of the hall I still don't want to see a driverless truck Gees put it in Los Angeles traffic it'll go crazy [laughter]\nWell I agree there's a long way for the technology to go it's interesting that thousands of people die in car accidents and a president but if there's one accident with a driverless car it makes\nIt's a huge ... in in in ...

back our final segment Byron Reese with us author of the fourth age Byron Isaac Asimov three laws robotics let me quickly go through them and tell me how they would\nReally transform into artificial intelligence\nOne robot may not enjoy a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm to a robot must obey orders given to us by human beings except we're such orders would conflict with the first law\nThree a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law so what are you saying is is robots can't injured human beings at any cost\nThat is kind of like in conflict with the ... you know soldiers that a robotic\n[noise] yeah yeah that's true that's true you know the the the laws are\nAre are literary device so he can tell a story they don't actually get us very far um [noise] you know if I'm going to do something dangerous potentially hurt myself does the robot according to those laws intervene and stop\nMe if I if I order a second dessert uh and I got a few extra pounds on me that's the robot say no you can't have the desert because that's gonna hurt you I've got to save you got to protect\nExactly monitoring your blood glucose levels are too high or whatever exactly\nExactly so like from a practical standpoint the real challenge with robots is no two people\nKind of agree on what moral behavior isn't isn't and even if you just said well we're just going to pick you know Joe\nAnd make use Joe's moral code for all the robots even Joe's moral code is like full of provide those and well you don't do that unless it's this but\nIf they're all they're all of these if if and and that so we don't really have a way to make sure robots but have ethically and like you said there's a lot of incentives for them not to\nThis is a robot out there called ... which uh I I'm going to try to do an interview with some ... because it talks and the you know it's styled after a woman but uh I'm going to call it in it because it's a robot but\nYou can ask a question it'll give you a response isn't that bizarre\nI'm unfamiliar unfamiliar with it or you know I think if you ask it a question just asking what's bigger a nickel or the\nSun and it probably doesn't no no no\nI mean it it it it'll have an incredibly narrow range of things that he can talk about uh if you ask anything like um\nYou know a wide as Mr T. pity the fool or a ... anything just asking anything aside from how do you feel or anything like that is asking anything\nAbout live anything weird you won't be able to comprehend\nI'm even something like the kind of thing that you might ask or any other person you meet like um\nGive it the simplest problem you can do these systems there there's something called the Turing test which basically says if you can't tell if you're talking to a person or a a machine like through text\nThat you have to say the machines thinking at least that's what the desk says if you read the transcripts\nOf actual things that are trying to pass that\nYou would do with one question so they have to put all these rules like you can ask about current events and you can't ask it up and you can ask this again is get this and even then we've never had anything this past it I'm\nSylvia looks good because it looks like a person and if you take something that looks like a person you give it a person's voice and it says words\nYou're kind of in the back of your head going to say oh that's really thinking right right it's if you if you say no that's just\nYou know that that is not if they made it look like I'm a vase if all of a sudden the illusion would be broken wood\nLauncher and I always thought maybe they had somebody hidden away in a corner talking through her and it was really them talking\nLike no no um it's a giant ball with voice in a in a animatronic robot\nMove that software and get better and better and better to the point where you can ask you to mundane question ended laying in being able to answer a\nGreat question there so there are people who are working on that there's something called um there there's a balance Center for artificial intelligence in Seattle found about Paul Allen\nThey're trying to get ... ... to be able to pass I think six grade science test a like that's the big thing it turns out computers have a hard\nTime with common sense problems\nWe don't know how it is that we\n... people [laughter]\n[laughter] right right\nWell let's do this thing we don't know how to get machines to do what's called transfer learning you can take something you learned in one place and apply elsewhere and we don't know how people do that you can train you could show a kid a little kid for pictures of the cat\nThat ... that child knows what a cat looks like and if they see one of those Manx cats without a tail they'll say look a cat without a tail even though they never even knew there was such a thing right you still like the house of cats to train a computer and the computer would never say oh that's a cat without a tail just got fed bails\nLarry in Houston, Texas and get us going here Hi Larry go ahead\nThanks for the um let's see if I've been a tech for computer repair\nI guess that was the feeling here in Nineteen eighty two for a large corporation from many to Superman is the main frames are way up to now I'm a network engineer I question if other hyperbole about how am I which is just the modification of what's been going off the last\nFifty years with computers they you know the the technology keeps expanding expanding because of the way people program them so\nThe technology keeps expanding any spending because of the way people program them so hey I just really extension of that nothing new but\nHow does it that they they think mankind it's W. lemonade okay because you have to have people to service the machine you have to have people that can provide electricity to run the power lines to run the power plant\nYou do all this stuff how do they think that a I is going to eliminate mankind is going to be a planet full of machines or you know I keep hearing this hyperbole over\nAnd over and nobody can tell me how they're going to do all this you can't even get a ... machine to walk right now I'm a power pole and provide Christie are going in trouble shoot a machine that's broken\nYou see in the world the machine will replicating itself by rebuilding itself I don't see that happening Byron\nI I agree I agree with Larry as well uh\nYou know its reasoning for pictures all evidence it makes a good movie you know the the the movie out of hey everything in the future is really good you know that doesn't get my eleven dollars a something's got to go wrong and something's got to you know a hundred people and Will Smith has the Bible something\nAnd and so you see that or not but you're right the the range of things robots\nTend to do and I can do is is actually quite narrow but\nUh but as you keep saying right now how how would that change that change in the future\nTom in Bozeman, Montana on the wild card lines Thomas go ahead\nYes uh I'd like to ask your guest good question or already\nA while not a court downright that make is eight and I took this class in college call thinking that she first said a master and we went through all her ...\nHer so that it is ... ... you know what is the first like ... ... and we went to the at the theater\nAnd what I what we came up with in the end what they can hurt because why ... why the goal but think like the human does\n\nWell and unfortunately the computer can do that at this point\nThere is a school of thought that says they have to be in body\nThey have to ... have experiences that you can't just have like a computer in a in a box that a ... and and that somehow you have to you have to give them form that that's how our intelligence comes from I don't know if that's true or not\nAt what point do you think mankind should slowed down it's technological advance or shoot it\n\nSay this is all behind him now jak Callahan Fox News\nTakes office with gratitude there's no bitterness

I was able to see them so clearly\nIn the smoke and they would like kind of pull the smoke around them I could see their shapes either form\nIt without the smoke they were not there you could not see them\nAnd without the smoke I could still see goes but not as clearly and easily and as reliable as with the smoke\nWas amazing gift you have to do with this Julie we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about your work is the ghost photographer in our second hour we will open up the phone lines will\nSign up no go zone or free email newsletter today at ... dot com [noise]\nOoh [noise] ooh [noise]\n\n\n\n\nIt's ... am on a news talk radio Katie WN and Katie Jay\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast we're back with Julie ... her book is called the ghost photographer I Love the subtitle of course is interesting Julie where you talk about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world and make believe it's coming true isn't it\nThe real world make believe it's coming true was\nIt it it definitely is coming true if it was funny I um when I was sitting with my publisher she was asking me about some of my photographs and I said you know some of the creatures and and that I that I get in these photographs looked like they ... out of movies that I've marketed\nAnd she goes\nOh my gosh you're living like the real world of may leave I say it isn't that crazy during the day I mean make believe and\nThen at night you comes true it comes to\nHave you ever gone to the point where you were scared or you felt threatened\nYes I did one ... times yeah you know when we can start going weird here in a minute if you want to\nBecause some of the things I encountered um are\nAre strange and some are scary and you know I found at times um and and this is where the cliffs intense really that that gift comes in to comes in very handy um where I can feel\nUm if there is a ... a bad entity an evil entity that is around\nAnd I learned something really important for folks that to understand um and that is if you if if we find themselves\nWhere they have it goes to their house they feel like they've encountered something and they they feel that fear in their body all they have to do\nIs be in charge because they are in charge because it's the fear that they're looking for and so if you stand there and go get out of my house you are not allowed in here believe\nYou can you say you can use any of the tools that you want but to exert your human dominant is like dominance like you you can get rid of most of 'em like that and that's what I found because I started clearing people's homes\nAnd I started weirdly because I get my Oklahoma at ... am upbringing I was raised with his ... and so I knew the Lord's Prayer hadn't used for really long time um\nAnd do the work for you\n... what's really interesting is that's another way that I could find if there were um you know dark spirits around is it I Would start saying though I like I start seeing the Lord's for over and over and if any point in time I forget where I stand ... there's something there\nYou're like a magnet it's\nKind of well maybe [laughter] ... I mean when you think we all are telling the truth\nWhile I was gonna say do you think everybody has the capability to you know we're ... we're argue unusual\nYou know I think that we're all born with different gift that we're able to tap into yes\nI have a friend that is the most incredible medium you will ever meet in your life and the specificity of the messages that she gets from the other side are detailed as addresses that you've lived in in your life\nWhen\nFrom the number of into the street name so I think everybody has something different\nYou know it perhaps I have you know so few weird capabilities and and the and in the world so yeah I think probably I Do\nYou actually because you're into course media a big way Mm you Google ... when you were experiencing is how come\nYou know I think any time you encounter something new in your world right and your kind of yeah becomes your reality you want to see you want to know you're not the only one and I think I was looking to see how common are on current\nSpecifically the photograph did you get answers\nUm I started to I started to understand and that's when I started to actually talk about it after that and it was the talking about it that really kind of eased my nerves and then\nAnd then of course I turned to the movies and there are some really fabulous movies that are based on true accounts and one of them is that movie the witch and did you do you even see the which\nI have not seen you haven't\nSeen that there's a scene in which it it was based on the Salem witch trials like before the film which trial\nAnd I'm\nJay ... who is the kind of friend advise the producer and and and he did a lot of work at the New York public library pulling you know an original pamphlets\nFrom back in the day and there's a scene where the father or the and families circled around I'm the son who is um a possess\nAnd he says everybody must say the Lord's Prayer so they'll start saying the Lord's Prayer then the two twins are saying it and then they fall on the floor in concert shaking um because there was a there was\nA a like a\nEvil entity that was around and I later talk today about he was like oh yeah that's the Lord's Prayer is how it was like a\nDividing rod to find them you know and and I'm like oh my gosh that's been happening to me so it's weird how things happen without instructions I think that's a really interesting part about all of this is that all this desert happened to me and there was no instruction book you\nKnow I was able to identify were goes were I was able to figure out how to you know get them out of his face and I was able to figure out how to you know how other humans um protect themselves and you know big thing I I learned a lot about sleep paralysis\nYou lose nothing ... about that Mm where as well is this like the old ... syndrome\nI did for a little bit on this well he could be medical it could be I mean could\nBe people have woken up it relies basically because they can't move ... syndrome and then you realize you know you you you are where you can you get out of it but I've also heard of ... syndrome where you were you basically Pearl watch\nYeah what I've heard what I read about in well actually what I I experience I I didn't personally experienced it um but I have a very close friend and this is how it all started that he was telling me histories of sleep paralysis and um and there's a an entity called the ... man\nYes you know high ...\nI I um I read her on Facebook and I read her book\nGreat girl I think Rudy is tremendous an expert on the half\nShe absolutely is and she is where one of the places I went to very quickly when my friend Alex are telling me about what he was experiencing some um and what's interesting also is that I'm a nightmare on elm street you know created by Wes Craven\nUm uh Freddy right um he had Wes Craven um had sleep paralysis and he modeled Freddie Krueger\nHe modeled Freddie Krueger based on that man\nBecause it came to him that's right and nightmares right there what was\nInteresting with Alex is um I I did a lot of research I I read high these books I talked to friends um and one thing that I've also gotten into is I'm a crystals and stones and rocks and I I've taken classes and I'm even now a certified trans physical therapist\nSo I boy you're up in a big way no well I started to yes I Am I mean I mean if you're going to go go big George such don't just take a few pictures that go send me go all the way\nThrough it [laughter] no fun to\nWrite and and also to serve others because that's really where the turn happened and I learned about the stone called black terminally and black term lane is a really powerful rock it is not the prettiest rock and the crystal kingdom\nBut it's really a powerful and it and it actually holds a charge an electric charge just sitting on the counter\nUm it's been studied by the curious and also by Benjamin Franklin so the stone has been\nA lot of curiosity surrounding it and it's also been used you know by magicians and those just like you know clear their space back in the day so on and so forth Sean and use it and um and I know is to protect us down so I said to my friend Alex and Alex with us on your night stand\nI said I have a feeling that it has a enough of a range to it but it will protect you while you sleep\n\nAnd it did it sure is a big way\nIt helped him to where the only time he had another experiences when he left his rock at home and then I started using it for friends that had kids that had night terrors those kids haven't had night tear sense had another friend sleep paralysis gave her the same thing\n\n[noise]\nRacing for a hurricane object cowboy on Fox News states of emergency

you know I I Will\nTell you um another one of my theory is or what I Believe is that you know I think we live in a a multi dimensional universe and I think that when people even talk about when they see spaceships\nOn that either they crossed into another dimension briefly or that ship came into our dimension that um is it\nPossible for either to move from dimension dimension I Do believe it's true I don't know about moving for five years and and you know whatever happens\nIn the show but um I I think that there is a possibility of that\nJulie you mentioned earlier the double yes I did have you had any direct encounters with what we call the devil\nYou know I have not good I have not I've helped people who have\nBut I have not\nWhy do you think you have\n[noise] you know I don't think I'm up for grabs that makes any sense I I think\nYeah you can't get to your show\nThey they can't they can't get to me it it is because of fear you know I think fear is the source of a lot of our physical disease I think fear is the source of our um emotional issues I think fear is the reason\nFor you know when when we don't bring into our life what what we want to bring and I don't have fear\nI just don't end this whole experience is what has you know bought me to the places of a fearlessness and you know might theories of is if I'm not afraid of the devil I'm certainly not afraid of human\nLet's go to ... in Roseville, California west of the Rockies ... yeah\nHi hey how ya doing good good to have you with us\nLet's see um my thing is I'm used to live in this house that with the L shaped and all the windows on the inside of the ... that was all windows on the inside of the L All right\nWell I used to um go to bed at night and everything they get all quiet and then I Would see this man who wore hats walk by my bathroom window and he that would make him in my backyard\nThat was terrifying\nCurrently terribly so I call the cops and they come out then they couldn't find anybody they couldn't find any footprints or anything and so they started thinking that I was like fifty one fifty [laughter] you know starting shining light in my eyes every time you come over because I was calling them often with three times a week sometimes\nAnd then one night my husband happen to be home thank goodness he always worked out of town that I'm he was home and I would tell them about this man that would walk by the bedroom window and stuff\nBut the men come up and it looked like he was inside the house and he would stand in front of the\nJust in the bedroom go away and then um my husband set up because he wasn't as brain is I was I guess you set up and then he goes only gun ... there's no feet on this and then disappeared and we didn't see him again\nThat was wow you know there are cases\nIt's documented that people will see the ... man who are not in sleep paralysis and that's what you experience\nHave you ever shuttle people Julie yes I have similar to that person\nVery similar I think that kind of run in the same\nJob yeah when I think there are in a different dimension and they're out of kilter with us from some some of them think were the ... don't and they just are trying to get back\n... ... maybe you know I I still think that in a balanced world you know and a chaotic because you think about the world is that many university very chaotic thing about all the stars and that\nAre in the planets moving and moons moving and there's like chaos that's happening but in the butt of balance and imbalance you have to have light and you have to

book by the way by right\nWell thank you very much and thank you for having me\nSo a lot of people are concerned that the world of robots is going to take over the planet take you take our jobs and do everything else is\nThat something for us to be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people jobs but I'm\nClose to my website you take to try to figure out if if your job is at risk and it it records all the answers and very very few jobs actually could have robots take over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or\nAny of the thousands of other things people do when and and that\nAre so no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think we build these tools to increase our own productivity and we we all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence or exactly what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\nWell that's a great question what is it is is more complex than you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means but what what they what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing\nIn about the term are two very different things that may have nothing in common so they either me or what'd you see in the movies\nSo commander data upstart truckers see three arena or a that would be a shame that can do everything a person could do which created it could teach itself new things and we don't\nWe don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and that's called a general intelligence or\nIt is a computer program that could do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic and that we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it make projections about the future\nAnd that doesn't sound all that interesting but that's in essence of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are foster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things that really look\nSmart um by just using simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just curl us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we used to all have some amount of privacy or just based on the fact that there are so many others can't follow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation actually with artificial intelligence\nThe kinds of tools we are developing to do very good things like the ...\nCancer or something like that can be used to to trip to follow people voice to the to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded and it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans that reading lips so every camera\nEven if it doesn't that audio can read lips as well as human um\nYour you know you have a a device the trucks where you are and again all of these things ended up themselves aren't that technologies but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world\nUm you know China has implemented a kind of a social ... yeah that's right you run a red light you lose the point if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points\nIf you write a pro government blog you get two points and uh if you if you go low enough you don't fly on airplanes anymore you don't um\nAnd and you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't get\nAny may not even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are uh have that capability of of of being misused of course hopefully it in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a Republican but ... is governed by laws the price of liberty is a turtle vigilance and so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and enforced\nThat don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nByron is every tell them telephone conversation smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even though Ninety nine percent of them were probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I I just couldn't say the technology is it a point where they could decipher you know what what was that many people are saying\nAnd then it can ah it doesn't have to understand it in the way human understand something that decides to look for patterns and combinations of words along with um\n... and and and just kind of Bill Bill obstruct profiles on people I mean oh I'm saying is is it is it is a potential way to use this technology which can be\nGood there's so many good things\nYou know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand or let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about balmy something and the computer you know is is set up to pick up code words like ... or whatever\nAnd so it finds this uh on one hand it's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy\nOn the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian ... by run in terms of\nIf it's OK or not\n[noise] well it is it and it is a new enough

I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking synch with the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical person if you don't think human beings are\nJust machines then no vending machine could ever do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work the way it does just with chips and the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of brain power on the little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering who really is um\n... the thing is is that when a computer can play chess and when the computer can play go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really isn't quote anybody home there's nothing there\nBut does any thinking at all it's it's one reason zeroes manipulated in memory turned on and off\nA at the speed of light um it's done with which relative it it's interesting the techniques we use foreign official intelligence we'd been writing about for\nForty years it's just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere is a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem\nAnd it's about ... it goes like this there's this\nThere's this room a that's full of these books and there's a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese but people outside the route slide questions written in Chinese under the door\nTo this Chinese to this librarian the librarian picks\nThem up looks at the first character on the question goes and finds a book with out on the spine looks up the second character that sentence him to another both to another book to another book to another book until it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these\nSymbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since perfect and so the question is does does the library and understand Chinese those ...\nThe library and understand Chinese ... to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense but to a lot of people\nKnow the librarian doesn't know if they're talking about color or coffee beans and the analogy is an apt one because that's all the computer does it runs a set of determining ...\nProcesses in memory it spits out an answer and it doesn't know it's playing chess it doesn't know any what he's talking about it doesn't know anything and so you kind of have to ask is the computer thinking or not this is a computer understand anything or not\nA by my way of looking it doesn't it doesn't understand anything but other people\nOther people say if it can do everything that that's something that doesn't understand can do then you just have to say it does\nIt is just mind boggling and it's getting even been or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers through this thing where it in a very simple short and they double in power every couple of years but on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's\nFifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can collect data there'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all of those who they had all this data coming in and these faster computers and so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it\nIf you think about it the Internet the mosaic browser cannot twenty five years ago\nA literally in Ninety three\nAnd all that did was like computers talk to each other and that was hit and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars and well a million new businesses it up in ...

the for the age with twenty five years is a very successful tech entrepreneur with multiple IPO's\nByron is uniquely suited to comment on the effect of technology in the workplace and on society as well he writes books that explore the wonders of the world of tomorrow and delights audiences all over the planet with his vivid presentations on the future of work in life\nAnd here he is on the coast to coast looking for love your cover on this book by the way Byron\nWell thank you very much and thank you for having me\nSo a lot of people are concerned that the world of robots is going to take over the planet take ... take our jobs and do everything else is that something for us to be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people jobs but um\nOther tests to my website you take to try to figure out if it's your job is at risk and it it records all the answers and very very few jobs actually cut a robot take over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or\nAny of the thousands of other things people do and and and that\nSo no I don't think that's a a real concerted all I think we build these tools to increase our own productivity and we we all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence or exactly what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[noise] well that's a great question what is it is is more complex than you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means but what what they what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing\nIn common so they either me or what you see in the movies so commander data upstart truckers see three or a that would be an a machine that can do everything a person could do it's created it can teach itself new things and we don't\nWe don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and that's called a general intelligence or it is a computer program that could do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic\nAnd now we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it make projections about the future and that doesn't sound all that interesting but that's in a sense of what we do we're just\nWell the all that interesting but that's in a sense of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are foster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things that really look\nSmart um by just using the simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just ... if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we used to all have some amount of privacy or just based on the fact that there are so many others can't follow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation unfortunately with artificial intelligence the\nKinds of tools we are developing to do very good things like the ... cancer or something like that\nCan be used to to trip to follow people voice to the to text so now a every phone conversation could be recorded and it can be turned into text ah computers are as good as humans that reading lip so every camera\nEven if it doesn't that audio can read lips as well as a human um\nYour you know you have a a device the trucks where you are and again all of these things ended up themselves aren't that technologies but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world\nUm you know China has implemented a kind of a social score yeah that's right you write run a red light you lose a point if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and if you if you go low enough you don't fly on airplanes anymore you do um\nAnd and you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't get\nAny may not even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are uh have the capability of of of being misused of course hopefully it in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a Republican but that's governed by laws the price of liberty is a turtle vigilance and so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and forced\nThat don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nByron is every tell them telephone conversation smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even the Ninety nine percent of them are probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I just couldn't say the technology is it a point where they could decipher you know what what what that many people are saying and then it can\nAh it doesn't have to understand it and the way the human understand something that decides to look for patterns and combinations of words along with um\n... and and and just kind of Bill Bill obstruct profiles on people I mean what I'm saying is is it is it is a potential way to use this technology which can be\nGood there's so many good things\nYou know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand or let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about bombing or something and the computer you know is is set up to pick up code words like ... or whatever\nAnd so it finds this uh on one hand\nIt's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy on the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian ... by run in terms of if it's OK or not\n[noise] well it is it and it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have the societal consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know\nThe federalist papers that addressed that topic or an hour that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAll right well stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Reverend Reese with us his book is called the fourth age we're talking a lot of high technology folks and what it does his

better it'll have an eye you have a hundred than two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm On my part cost about ... I I find maybe one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking synch with the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are just machines\nThen no than a machine could never do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work the way it does just wood chips and the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering who really is\nUm the thing is is that when a computer can play chess and when the computer complete go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really is a quote anybody home there's nothing there\nBut does any thinking at all it's it's one reason zeroes manipulated in memory turned on and off\nA at the speed of light um it's done with what's relative it it's interesting the techniques we use for it official intelligence we'd been writing about for\nForty years since just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere's a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem and it's about it it goes like this series is\nThere's this room a that's full of these books and there's a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese people outside the route slide questions written in Chinese under the door\nTo this Chinese to this librarian the librarian picks\nThem up looks at the first character on the question goes and finds a book with out on the spine looks up the second character that sentence him to another book to another book to another book to another book\nUntil it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these\nSymbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since ... perfect and so the question is does does the librarian understand Chinese\n... those the library and understand Chinese did to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense but to a lot of people\nKnow delivering doesn't know if they're talking about color or coffee beans and the analogy is an apt one because it's all computer does it runs a set of determining stick\nProcesses in memory it spits out an answer and it doesn't know it's playing chess it doesn't know any what it's talking about it doesn't know anything and so you kinda have to ask is the computer thinking or not there's a computer understand anything or not\nA by my way of looking it doesn't it doesn't understand anything but other people other people say if it can do everything that is that something that does understand can do then you just have to say it does\nIt it is just mind boggling and it's getting even then or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers do this thing where it in a very simple short and they double in power every couple of years but on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's\nFifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can collect data there'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all those you know you have all this data coming in and these faster computers and so it's it will only get faster than if you think about it\nIf you think about it the Internet the mosaic browser cannot twenty five years ago\nAre literally in Ninety three\nAnd all that did was like computers talk to each other and that was hit and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars and well a million new businesses it up in ... I mean it did everything that that imagine\nA technology that effectively makes everybody smarter than they were before you go to bed tonight everybody on the planet wakes up with ten more IQ points that is going to be more transformative than\nThe mere Internet which just connected a bunch of machines together this this is machines think\nReason will they show emotion Byron\nThat is an open question a it is even an open question whether you want them to\nI don't I'm not sure I Want them to\nSo the first question is do you want them to simulate emotion\nUh there there's a couple of different sides to that you know I have a desktop device that I talked to and I interrupted and I tell it to stop\nIn a way I wouldn't do a person um you had you had students had kids in Japan and there was a robot they let loose in the mall and these little kids would bother would beat it and the robot learned\nThat if it's all a bunch of short people kids without a tall person around an adult it needed to run off to a tall person because the kids would abuse it now when I asked later the kid said\nThey thought it was feeling distress so they even felt like it was internalizing it you wonder about\nAbout a kindergarten teacher you know that that's robotic that uh the raising children on the ... the ... you you just start with that do you even want them to have human voices does that is a noble the machine somehow or does\nYou know we've had their car away to these things called human rights a to a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do to any human being and because there's something special about a human being\nAnd and do we kind of want to make things look like humans that we do abuse and throw into a scrap heap and and and destroy without a second thought what that is suddenly had they not being attacked on people now the question can they\nFeel emotion a that is an open question we\nWe have we have something called consciousness which is that we experience the world we feel warmth a computer measures\nTemperature that difference whatever that is that you feel the warmth of something a computer right now we don't think uh can we can measure temperature and even if you make a program that plays a purse\nCan we can measure temperature and even if you make a program that plays a person screaming at the temperature gets over five hundred degrees nobody believes that computer\nFeels that pain nobody believes that ... ... or ... now the interesting thing is we wouldn't know it if I'm\nIf they did really well you wouldn't know if a tree top paid and you share half your DNA with the with the tree you should know DNA with a computer and so we wouldn't really even know if they ever if they ever develop a\nEmotions and even if they claim that they did that could just be in a way a program running that you know the the the program reasons that it\nCan achieve whatever objective it launched by making this claim I'm so\nIt's it's an open question it it all boils down to do you think of motions in the end or mechanical or are they again it's a punchy back to the original question are we machines and therefore our experience of emotion is just something mechanical\nWhat happens in these machines Myron go rogue and they started doing things to watch to screw up our lives on purpose\nWell I'm\nA little like ... from two thousand once the sun\nIs All right I mean look\nIf it ever happened uh we're completely vulnerable of course you know if there were eighty billion devices attached to the Internet\nYou know smart ovens just part of all on and override their safety protocols I mean there is so many ways a malevolent machine would want to um would be able to inflict harm\nThe the interesting and and so you kinda have to say what would that happen and it can happen in one or two scenarios either through ... programming the machine just does that it doesn't have any intent at all\nUm\nOr getting the machine somehow develop goals of its own that are different than ours and ... perhaps in conflict with hours and ... and pursue those goals against those they're um they're open questions I mean right right now though\nIt doesn't feel like you know I ...

twenty million dollars there are six million\nPeople in the city of Phoenix that means\nYou could give every man woman and child twenty dollars\n\nThey're paying twenty dollars a person now you said
