scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments and I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups is\nYou know groups small groups in my workshop you know we'll we'll be healed\nAnd so this is just another experiment in my own mind and I was sitting there trying to figure out how to do this in a workshop because this is back in two thousand and eight and then I wasn't I hadn't really done many workshops before you know I'm an investigative reporter by training that's what I used to bust baby selling rings when I was you know young\nSo um so I I'm kicking around this with my husband and I'm sort of saying well I don't know maybe I'll just put people in groups of eight and or so and have them send healing intention to each other and he's a good headline writer and he said yeah I Love it the power of eat\nSo it can about totally by accident we put people in groups of eight in our workshop the first one we ran in Chicago\nI I was kind of I I knew how to do intention I studied it within tension masters I'd put together a program I'd looked at what we're doing scientific in the scientific lab but I wasn't sure about these small groups should they hold hands and they do so and I'm kind of making it up as I go along\nAnd the next day I figured I'd have him come back the next day and tell us what happened and I had all the groups and intention to somebody in the group with some sort of health challenge\nAnd when they came back I assume they were going to tell me it's it's kind of like having a facial or getting back ribs you know nice little feel good effect\nThat isn't what happened what happened is stuff like this they lined up I gave them the Mike and turn and they said things like I have cataracts and their eighty percent better I Do for a new replacement my knees completely messed up and I'm walking normally today\nI can do deep squats I have terrible insomnia and I set up like a baby last night you know and on and on it went like that total instant healing and I was completely shocked because as I said I'm you know I I look at things\nAs a journalist I'm I look at things I Try to look at the science of things to try to prove thing and this was completely out of my room\nSo I didn't believe that I like to be on his George I thought it was a ... effect but then it started happening over and over and over I mean I've run hundreds of these things\nAnd I've had people where their their arm is dislocated and its slots back into place during the intention or somebody who had couldn't see well because she had a stroke and her eyes went back to normal\nSomebody with school yo says who went completely out of pain and we then you know a month or so were daughter wrote me just say that her back straight in so much they had to change the rearview mirror for car\nShoot stories like this over and over again and\nSame thing going on with some of the Sanders too and that was the thing that really was amazing\nTo tell me about the show how how partial must be and then what was happening to them\nWell their ordinary people this is the amazing thing of the George we all have this power this is our birthright it's just we don't know this we don't know how to use it and we don't realize it amplifies in a group [noise] let me tell you about the story of West\nWith when I met him I put together a couple of groups at the mile high church in Denver just this kind of just as a test this is last vessel on them with my full and um I west wanted to put himself forward he was one of the the initial groups\nUm because he suffered from terrible depression but there was a woman there with stage ... cancer\nLinda and so we we decided to go with her\nWith had a terrible life he had been a really bright guy in college studying biochemistry wanting to be a doctor and he got a he got cold and he had a low lottery number in the very last years of the Vietnam War\nAnd they'd done away with drafted for ... for college um college students so he had to go in the last horrible chaotic years of the war\nAnd it was so traumatic for him he came back with really depressed\nAnd that continued in his life he even even lost the love of his life to fast growing cancer it was just terrible story so by the time he he got to meeting me he had gotten to a point of feeling like what's the use\nAnd he was living in a senior facility you barely able to get up and make themselves breakfast in the morning really depressed\nSo he does his intention for Linda [noise] and then that the next day he told me he broke up and everything had really changed it was almost like you had this amazing heightened sensory awareness\nEverything had really changed it was almost like he had this amazing heightened sensory awareness you know the grass is greener than it ever been he drank a cup of herbal tea and it knocked the socks off he says\nUm but even more amazing was the next night he had this extraordinary vision on a dream almost like a vision where he was back in college and he met his Nineteen year old self\nAnd the the Nineteen year old with communicated to him in some way it's all going to be okay there's still plenty of time\nAnd that experience to him was so life transforming he's a completely different guy now he is power walking Ninety minutes the lifting weights he's running group to it at his church is writing is trying to write again\nHe's doing all kinds of stuff and he had completely given up and that is only one time from being a cinder\nUm and this is a story I hear over and over again we're that active being part of this group of being kind of a higher consciousness is life transforming\nWindows the sender need to have any special abilities\n[noise] well here's the really interesting thing of it you know I again did not believe this I was looking at it from every angle um it took me ten years to even get the courage to write this book\nWorld could we say you were the skeptic ... skeptics\nI was I was the ultimate doubting Thomas because as I said I I started the intention experiment because I wasn't I wasn't really sure about all of this\nManifestation law attraction I didn't I wasn't sure I believed it and I wanted to find out how far can you take it you know we talking about the shifting a quantum particles were we talking about curing cancer here [noise]\nSo um that's one set up the intention experiments but I never\nI never thought these little groups would have the power but the thing that's so interesting is I had a life universities the largest chiropractic university I'm In the world and they offered to do studies the power to let their nerves science department look at this\nSo we sent up a group of students\nAnd we put a ... kept to measure the brain waves of each one person one sender in each of the groups and what we found was so amazing that within a few minutes\nThey would have this completely different brainwaves signature it would turn off all the part of the ... group would have a quieting of all the parts of the brain that makes us feel separate\nAnd also the parts of the brain that make us\nHave worried doubt negativity\nSo these are basically brainwave signatures of somebody who's feeling a sense of the static one this and when we compared these signatures when the nearest scientists who work at the doctors said Stephanie Sullivan\nUm we looked at other things like uh the work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at the masters and and and Buddhist monk any static prayer they had an identical brainwave signature\nBut the only difference was I had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk or a sci fi master through my guys were total notices there were students who never even done meditation and all they had was uh twelve minute video for me I was to do\nWhen we're gonna take a quick break we're going to come back and just a moment to talk more about your work the

back to coast to coast limbic staggered with us her latest work the power of each miniature amazing how ... works and does it take much effort to make things happen\n[noise] real soon that was the interesting thing about this no it doesn't I think would it take is meeting regularly it it takes some techniques and you know in my book the power of eight I've got all the techniques that people have to to follow to become a really good in tender\nAnd also to intend well in a group but for me the thing the real key element is creating a little group of eight or so and you asked before\nThey have to be eight no\nFiber work eleven to work you know eight is kind of a Goldilocks figure you know it's like the not too big not too little\nUm but what's really important is meeting week after week after week and I found that after I'm putting people in groups in twenty Fifteen I wanted to do my own experiment\nBecause I wanted to see if everything in their lives would begin to heal not just their health\nSo I got a group of two hundred and fifty together and had them you know I taught them for a while and then I put them in groups of eight or so and had the meat every week for a whole year\nAnd it was extraordinary of the people who continued to meet regularly you know every week and that was about a hundred and fifty of them pretty much a hundred percent of them had major life changing experience is so it wasn't just their health\nYou know they got financial windfall or they got amazing new careers or they made up with this strange relatives or you know they got a great new house just the one they wanted\nUm just came out of nowhere or they found a new life purpose but it pretty much everybody had extraordinary stories to tell\nOur ... are are you sure that this works are primarily from the field or is or science behind\n[noise] well I think there's a science in the sense that\nUm we did that brainwave study and we found that you know there are major brain changes that go on when you do intention of in a group called ... group prayer in a way I'm In a sense that's what it is it's kind of secular prayer\nBecause you have these major changes\nWhich are really very very much similar to somebody having a mystical state you know somebody having a mystical experience [noise]\nPeople get changed during those kinds of experiences\nAnd they allow themselves to be open to a lot of possibilities where they suddenly feel you know something major has changed all their senses are heightened um they feel really optimistic about their future\nAnd so in a way that starts to pave the way if you want to just look at what happens to the individual that paved the way for major changes\nAnd and possibilities but there's something more there's a bigger piece of this George that\nAnd believe me I'm trying to figure out what is it is it a group of fact\nYou know is it just the power of intention but a big piece of this is the power of altruism um that was the big surprise for me because remember the Sanders we're having amazing effects to healing effects\nAnd when I started looking into\nUm the science of altruism it's extraordinary I mean people who do stuff for other people that are how small live longer are happier are healthier in every regard\nAnd that's what we found in a lot of our intention group I mean when I talk about that group and twenty Fifteen and I was studying for a whole year\nI'm One of the people you know there were a couple of people that weren't getting anywhere you know one of them was a woman called Andy and Andy was going through a divorce\nAnd she had two small kids she needed a new job and she was very talented in marketing and coaching and she just couldn't get anything you know young woman\nJust couldn't get anything and she was just trying everything and we talked with her and tried to work with her and this and that are group tried to work with her and finally I was a bit frustrated by it and I just said oh Andy get off of yourself certain tending for someone else\nAnd she was one of the people who is intending for that young boy Luke and the moment she did that she gets a cold out of the blue from somebody offering her a dream job so\nCan I tell you any everything about how this works you're absolutely not [laughter] there's a lead X factor here I don't understand but there is something about\nThat power of getting off of yourself and doing for someone else that seems to get a reward for you but you're\nConvinced it works aren't you\nI Am convinced it works I watch it as I say I sort of look at it almost like a scientist I've looked at it studying groups over years\nUm you know I run I run these ... year low master classes and I'm I'm actually evaluating what's happening to people they're filling out forms every month to say what's changed in their lives\nAnd you know we've done the brain studies were gonna do immune systems studies um and just see what happens in groups right in front of me you know I Know it works\nOr then or there's some bowling that don't get results in the group\nReal I think it's the people who don't come regularly\nUm sometimes it's nothing to do with skepticism that the interesting thing too I gave a talk once in in Denver last last year and there was a woman who had really bad arthritis and she was a total skeptic and she got healed\nRight away but there and um you know we've had people like that who haven't who were a little skeptical really didn't yes ought to themselves yeah right\nAnd they had some healing doesn't mean everybody in an audience gets healed but a lot of them you know there's enough to say something really interesting is going on here\nAnd now you're interested in the human because it's easier to track in terms of the ... the ...\nOh you mean a physical healing well yeah because it is not\nEasy to ... you know somebody had a condition they don't have the conditions growing up we had a woman with stage four cancer I talked about earlier and she's now you know down to normal numbers now she was doing other stuff too but the intention pushed it right along somebody else\nNow she was doing other stuff too but the intention pushed it right along somebody else with T. M. J. problems there's a temporary ban dealer joint problems in your jaw\nAnd uh that she was sort of suffering with the pain of eight or nine out of ten and it went immediately down to two and then the pain was gone over days so this kind of thing\nYou know it's kind of this healed in an instant or soon after is the thing that you can as you say really track but then you've got other things we're amazing synchronous cities happen you know another woman who was\nTrying to write a book she was a body work um expert Lisa\nAnd she was in one of the year long groups and she was trying to write a book about\nShe figured out a way to treat trauma victims with body work and she wanted to write this book about it she'd never written a book and she was getting new where she had three different editors and just nothing was happening and at the group was intending for nothing was happening and finally once again I simply say get off of yourself\nAnd she started it intending to another member of the group who had some ... serious health issues\nAnd again the next week she has she feels compelled to go into a store and she didn't even need anything at the store and when she gets in there she meets somebody she vaguely been introduced to before\nAn essay gonna chatting it turns out this woman was a former publisher and he's now a book coach and when she hears what Lisa wants to do she offers to coach or through the whole thing end of the story Lisa gets her book done and it becomes an Amazon best seller\nSo I've seen this over and over enough to to have the doubting Thomas in me start getting pretty persuaded that something amazing is going on here", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Show Low", "day": "11"}
