for reasons that no one could understand I was getting into the monkeys but the reason\nSeem to be off in the future so to speak but my contention is it wasn't the future it's that everything is happening all around us at once which is why mental focus is so effective\nI was sixteen when the monkey started plane was there a long long time ago and if I remember one of the members was Mickey ... that's right who played Sherk is boy on television right that's\nRight and and still touring still touring\nYeah who is still going that's absolutely nuts I Love them [laughter]\nAnd do you know the name Joe ... gallon burger by any chance I don't ... wrote a couple of books one called liquid luck oh of course All right I Know the book I notice ... he he would conduct experiments still does in Las Vegas mhm with groups of people ... ... ... you're trying to prove\nThat positive thinking and the mind\nHas a lot to do with influencing things that happen that's right and and he is totally convincing these convinced me too that if you go into a situation like Las Vegas upbeat\nAnd you know just you know positive about things\nThe odds are really high you're going to win\nYes and you know what's so fascinating about that is that outlook is been validated by Syria CSP research my hero J. B. Ryan pioneered scholarly ESP research at Duke University in the early Nineteen thirties JPEG is now deceased\nAnd one of the things the JV found that he just bury this in the foot notable book but it's monumental\nThat when his subject in the ESP lab and these were people tested under very rigorous conditions when they had a feeling of hopeful expectancy when they were upbeat when they were enthusiastic when they were a positive their scores\nIn the when they were upbeat when they were enthusiastic when they were positive their scores bike when they were bored when they were down cast when they were petite their scores dip and it was inevitable\nAnd ... like followed moon it's the same thing that he says in the book\nIf you go into a situation any kind of situation doesn't happen to be Las Vegas down in ... you know putting that black cloud over your head for whatever reason yeah it's not going to happen for you\nIt's not going to happen and the thing that I always tell people is and again this one of these familiar things but listen very carefully to it you\nMust really wanted you must really wanted if you're a person who's attitude is neither here nor there about winning and Vegas where the lottery or money or whatever\nIt's not going to work it has to be something that you really want which is why it's so important to truly identify your most heartfelt desires there's real power there because the power comes from an emotionally charged thought\nWe're talking with the metro what's his latest book is called the miracle club as a matter of fact we are going to tell you how you can get a membership in the miracle club a little bit later on in the program his website is his name all linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com it's amazing how ... how did you\nDecide to write this kind of a book\n[noise] you know it was funny I had written a history of the positive mind moving a couple of years ago called one simple idea and I began to realize every chapter that I wrote every person who I talked about in the book I was using their methods I was road testing these things myself\nAnd I thought to myself look if I'm experimenting with these methods myself and if that's what's driving my historical research why am I right about the methods why did I write about the steps what am I right about the techniques and it was a big step because a lot of historians are afraid to mask themselves\nAs believers in what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and I just really wanted to share with readers the actual hands on things I Do in my own life\nHow powerful is our human mind Mitch\nIt is powerful in ways that our generation is only coming to understand look we are realizing that things work out there like ... surgery we're realizing that people can lose weight literally George\nAnd lower their blood pressure just based on a thought that they carry with them things that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated in clinical experiments\nToday I think this universe is ultimately mental that doesn't mean and we don't live under many laws and forces but if one can understand how much that means\nYour thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs that the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have a natural experiment but the thought change the brain\nYour sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter so fought changes the brain thus far has to be something that extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nLook we're human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't ... if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method at work they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and then they feel projected one of the things that I write about in the book is that we live within a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces\nThe law of mine is confident as a law must be but so is the law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't\nMean gravity is an operative but it's affected by mass the mind is the same way circumstances\nAre going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're working that we experiment very clearly and very carefully\nMetro are going to come back and talk more about your work\nNext hour we'll take phone calls questions and miracle stories [noise]\nDon't forget to watch our TV show beyond belief with George ... just log onto beyond belief dot com [noise]\n\nFind out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar shirt free which only to visit home\nTitle luck dot com oh title luck dot com\nIt's because I Am on news talk radio Katie WN and Katie Jay [noise]\n[noise]\nCome back to coast to coast George\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast George ... whether you along with Mitch Horwitz as we talk about his latest book which is called the miracle club ... thoughts become reality will take your calls and your stories\nNext hour as well how does he is pie fit into this mess you were talking about it briefly but ah I I tend to think there's a very deep rooted tie in here\nYeah oh there is without question you know we've experienced in this country about eighty years of serious\nPsychological research serious experiments that the ESP creek technician telepathy and George the evidence is simply overwhelming and what we're seeing in the SP lab is that the mind\nPossesses extra physical qualities there are ways\nThat we receive and get and give information that go beyond the five senses once we've come to grips with the fact that the mind is extra physical that the mind has an existence outside the sense a body it opens the door to all kinds of possibilities we realize we are not just\nMaterial beings and it helps confirmed to us that\nOur thoughts make a difference in the world we may be like sending and receiving stations we're always looking for people to help us with projects to give us a hand to meet us\nHalf way and as I was mentioning in the last segment J. B. rhyme that grade ESP researcher found that ESP result spike in the laboratory based on the enthusiasm of the subject\nSo that gives you a different perspective on how important your thoughts are what actually happens to you may be based on your emotions your enthusiasm your focus\nAnd you believe that you can just change your entire life this way get a better job maybe find the relationship you're looking for just about all that stuff\nI Do believe that but the here's the key thing and this is really the magic key if there is one behind all of our self help systems\nYou must want it with everything in you you must want it with passionate intensity and we often tell ourselves that we want things without scrutinizing and examining our convictions do we really wanted for example we say we want a job when what we really want is\nSecurity we say we want a new relationship when what we really want\nMaybe is is is something else you know to move to a different city or to have a different domestic arrangement or to somehow rearrange the furniture of our lives it's very important that we get down to the essentials of what we really want before we put a label on it because\nI Would contend that what you want over time you're going to get two people know what they want\nThat is really the key thing we tell ourselves what we want you know we say gee I Want a better job I Want romance I Want to live you know in this city versus that city but my urging people might urging to people and this was something listeners can do right now\nIs to sit down with a pencil and paper and for a mature stand sustained period of time really write down your deepest desires your deepest wants\nThink about this well on this be private about this don't talk to anybody about it being intimate\nAnd see if they channel in one direction discover what you want to or because sometimes we repeat things to ourselves by rote and they don't represent are really passionate heartfelt desires get in touch with your desires you may think you have but I Would contend that few of us actually have\nMitch how close you echoed the secrets that story or is it different\nI ... it's different in some ways I have a lot of respect for Iran to burn and the secret but I rarely use the term law the traction because\nI don't believe we live under one mental super law I Believe that given the circumstances we live under we experienced many different laws and forces like the law of gravity as I was saying in the previous segment\nSo I think it's a mistake to think that our minds and our thoughts are the only game in town so to speak they are part of the game they are part of the game and that's important enough that's essential enough\nYou write about how people travel back into time to help their current life yeah but can't that also be dangerous\nYes it can and it's a very interesting prospect this is why I tell people be careful of what you're thinking about be careful of what you're doing because you know we like to play games with ourselves and we like to say\nGee you know if I could travel back into time and give advice to my Fifteen year old self what would I say well my contention is you may be doing that all the time that may be happening all the time linear time is very likely a very powerful illusion that we use to organize our lives but what we've discovered\nIn hard sciences as well as over the course of testimony from centuries is that\nLife is intimate everything is happening now there is in and finish the two of events occurring at once and we select among them so it could be that we are selecting among events past present future all the time and yet these things feel very real to us very set in concrete to us\nBut I Would contend that when you think about going back and giving advice to a young herself\nYou may actually be doing that so be careful be careful we are granted perspective we are granted some perspective but use your mind use your thoughts carefully because things that you may think of as a novelty may actually be concrete we'll\nPut it all into Apple's stock that's where they come back well [laughter]\nWell who knows George you know who knows the guy who owns apple stock right now you know he may have just had that fought based on what you said and he's experiencing that his concrete reality whereas there might have been another reality operative and his wife a few minutes ago\nMitch what is the third day mental challenge\nThe thirty day mental challenge is something that I invite everybody to join me and it's very very simple and any coast listener who emails me I Will send them a little instruction sheet you basically right out a pledge\nThat for the next thirty days you were going to dedicate your mind to everything that as productive progressive forwarding you're not going to think of negative events of the past you're not going to think of unpleasant possibilities of the future you're going to think that every reasonable ambition\nIs within your grass you make up a grid of thirty days you do this for thirty days it's your private experiment just see what happens see what happens it sounds easy but it's not it's very difficult and if you fall off the horse you don't have to restart the thirty days you just get back on the horse\nThe ideas to just try to direct your mind in the direction of that which is positive and productive for thirty days\nSee what happens when you give thirty days of the possibility of experiencing a whole different life and I will do it with you I Will do it with you and if you're having a hard time you could write to me you can email me and say you know I really fell off the wagon last night and I I'm there in the trenches with you\nA couple of years ago I started the coast prayer club and you know what that is Mitch is on Fridays people will ... a list of people who have written in\nYes who are on the prayer list for whatever they need to know whether it's a new job in a switch and something people even right in and say please pray for my cats you know he's sick and stuff like that anyway how powerful do you believe in and I will say I believe this works cause I've gotten the\nDo you believe and I will say I believe this war since I've gotten emails back after the fact that people say you know so and so's thing was cured and this like that but how powerful deeply prayer is\nI really do believe prayers powerful and it's for this reason I don't think Mother Nature plays cruel tricks on us there are instances and there are times in life where somebody is feeling\nSo depressed and facing such difficulty that they can't do the things that I'm prescribing they can't direct their mind in a positive way they're all kinds of methods and techniques I can give them but let's face it\nThere are times in life where we feel crushed by circumstance ... that's when prayer comes in that's when ... comes in prayer is an escape hatch\nFrom the difficulties of our own psyche from the difficulties of life circumstances when we can do nothing else\nWe can pray and there's no wrong or right right way to pray it's an escape hatch\nFrom our own psyche so again I don't think we've been putting too cosmic framework\nThe tricks us I think we've been given away out when we can't use our minds in the way I'm describing and there are times where people are suffering from addiction from depression from grief and they can't do the things on saying there were times I Can't do the things I'm saying that's where ... comes in and I devote a special section to prayer in the marrow club\nIs new one as powerful as the many when you are dealing with miracles\nThat's a fascinating question now a lot of people have said that if you get a group of people doing something\nIt can amp up the energy and I believe that's true I absolutely believe that's true I Believe if you get ten people meditating in a room powerful things can happen but to me no force on earth is more powerful\n\n[noise]\nThe secretary of state arrives in Riyadh object Callahan Fox News secretary Pompeo dispatched to Saudi Arabia by President Trump\nShould

they just can't seem to get ahead and this will lead me to my second question ah people really have a hard time just visualizing where they might end up in that I wanted to bring up the horrendous\nCar crash in skull Harry New York we're ...\nOr I I was reading some of their ... and many enough of these people were truly professional in their lives you know one because there was evidence\nBefore the crash that something bad was about to happen I Know myself I Would have spoken up and said get me out of this death trap but these\nThose people Mr Horwitz of the upper middle class\nThe all basically we remained mom no one spoke up their their very lives were coming to an end\nAnd yet you say a from a higher exalted background that people should know but the ... they were like many people and society they\nThey were conditioned to stay quiet and it ended up costing there are a lot there were twenty people killed Eighteen and the limo not one spoke up to say\nThis has got to stop pull over now and they could have but they didn't like she does say if they went to their deaths\nSort of wrap all of this up um whether me in the city and seen my fellow city residents many of them good enough but not getting ahead and then in school Harry these upper middle class people not speaking up for themselves\nI'd like you to tide us together and so far as why to say it if I have to like sheep so many people go to their dome and they just can't bring themselves to grab themselves by their lapels and just\nSpeak up for themselves and say gosh darn just let all of this that and let us all come together and do something about it\nAnd she let me let me ask you 'cause we have the story the night it happened it was a tragedy for sure but what do you mean by should tell somebody to stop what was going on inside that blue mold ...\nThere are indications that the car was basically to use my term coming apart that there are people were saying uh amongst the victims because they had cell phones that we can't we can't even hear each other next to each other\nOr talk to the car\nWas being coming very noisy and and literally coming apart at the scenes and you would think that intelligent people and many\nComing apart at the scenes and you would think that intelligent people and many enough for both of you these were quite professional people would noticeably\nHigher ... middle class jobs where they should have had the smart but no out just to say I want to speak up here get this driver to pull over and I know because you've heard me before me teeth oh that\nDriver would have pulled over no if fans who are being you know I I Would have wanted to be\nIn that limo would you you would have stopped that guy ...\nYou know ... there's a lot to unpack and we'll keep is saying and of course I I read that same news coverage now you know there's a new age expression there are no accidents and I break with that expression I don't I don't abide\nBy that everything happens for a reason\nRight right one of the things that are right in the book\nIs you know as I've been alluding we live under many laws enforces we experienced many laws in forces and I have never including love accident including accidents birth for example now peer pressure as as Keith was alluding\nIs an extremely powerful force than it can be a destructive force one must never get caught up in peer pressure because they can be a kind of group mentality regardless of whether it holds you too where you've been born or it keeps you from speaking up if you're seeing something that you think is dangerous\nIt's vitally vitally important that everybody acts with independent agency that doesn't mean you can escape accidents that doesn't mean you can escape tragedy but my contention is that the mind is one vital element that participates\nThat participates in other things\nThat are going on and it is extremely important\nTo exercise it at all times you're never without devices whether you're facing a crisis or based on the accident of birth and economic class I Can't tell you and I would never tell anyone\nThat there aren't crushing forces socially and economically\nThere are but the fact is the mind is one vital tool and your belt that you can always use and it can make all the difference at a crucial moment it is one thing we think of ourselves as having mines that control cognitive and motor function and that's true but there's more to it than that there's more to it that that\nThe mind is extra physical properties\nThat doesn't mean that it necessarily determines everything\nAnd every force that occurs or comes into her life\nBut it's one vital tool and my messages\nUse it use it always in everywhere and in every circumstance whether its environment as Keith was alluding to or whether it's a situation that you think is going to be\nHazardous never feel bound by peer pressure there is no more wanting force of your own will ineffectiveness in potency than peer pressure it must be escaped\nLet's go to ... in California now Hi Tom go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call very up beat interview with your gallery I'm

everything\nThat happens to your relationships your experience you're listening experience right here and now is really you're a motive for mental pictures pushed out into the world so that was nobles

actually try things and and and I I I Love hearing from every one of them\nYou say you can lose weight you can get stronger you can do all kinds of things using the power the mind\nIt's absolutely crazy there was a Harvard study and George this is the God's honest truth and I give the details and the miracle club is a Harvard a clinical psychologist named Ellen Langer she did a study on hotel maids\nShe found that if she explained to hotel maids the fact that their jobs are actually robotically an anaerobic Lee healthy and then studied the maids for six weeks compared to a control group who had been told nothing\nShe found the group that had been educated about the aerobics benefits of their jobs\nActually lost weight they didn't do anything differently they were just saying that you needed to realize that their jobs were anaerobic Lee and robustly healthy they lost weight and their blood pressure were lowered just because they had been educated about that fact came to mind alone help you lose weight answers apparently yes\nI Love it we're coming back to the final questions next on coast to coast am\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the coast noon

work the miracle club the books available for you and we'll get to your calls as well fascinating work Mitch in what's even greater about all this it really does work\nIt really does work you know I always tell people that would never give somebody an exercise that I hadn't road tested and I treat every reader as I Would a member of my own family every single method technique exercise in this book is something that I Would give to my own kids to use it really does work\nWe briefly touched on your thoughts about people going back into time in order to help their current life how do you do that\nYou know Georgia it's simple as just focusing mentally on what for example you might want to tell your younger self that's something that's familiar to us we often think of that as novelties so it's easy to picture I made the determination I read about this and the final chapter of the miracle club\nThat once I had come to feel that linear time was\nBasically an illusion and everything is happening infinitely and all at once\nIf you can actually enter into a relaxed meditative state and picture of yourself into the scene going back\nGiving advice to your younger self at whatever age maybe you want to avert a tragedy or disaster maybe you want to dispense a piece of advice\nIt can change your life right here and now in the present but be careful because sometimes things that we as experience\nAs challenges or tragedies also bring maturity to our life they also bring refinement to her life so you don't necessarily want to raise something that was the difficulty because that might have been a springboard\nTo some sort of greater maturity or lesson\nSo reflect very very carefully\nOn what you want to tell your younger self and then imagine yourself into that scene imagine yourself in that scene write down what you want to tell you younger self because by writing it down you'll be able to actually have some sort of a compass point or vantage point from when you can tell whether things are different\nAnd I think you will find that things will be different\nWhy do you say that it could be dangerous to do that\nWell because if we go back and we race adverse cities we could be a racing something that taught us a vital are necessary lessons sometimes\nThe aspects of our lives that were most proud of came to us from adversity so we want to be very careful this is not a game this is not a toy that's not something to play around with you want to be really sure that whatever the consequence\nYou want to go back and encourage your younger self to do something healthy unimportant and productive but don't think of it as just avoiding tragedy because tragedy can actually be a springboard to maturity\nNow here's the sixty four thousand dollar question Mitch how does it work\nHow does it work that is the question and I don't shy from that question\nThe fact is I don't think we manifest things I think we select things\nI think as in the particle lab everything in our lives as in super position and it becomes localized only when we focus on it as if we are almost drawing up a matrix grid and when we isolate a spot or appointed time on that grid we experience\nIt as being as vividly real as my voice that you're hearing right now so our actual act of life is an act of selectivity what we emotionally and mentally picture rise and focus upon is the experience that we enter into because everything is happening at once\nAnd we go in and out of these things\nThe way a particle goes from a wave state and then it collapses into a localized particle state\nSelect very carefully time is infinite and our minds our sensory tools are a measuring device by which we can help decide exactly what we're going to experience\nLet's go to Barry in Rock Hill South Carolina on the wild card line ... go ahead\nHello there your water ... thank you sir\nYes Mitchell which ... or it is here you are on the air I wasn't wearing ill coast to coast you're setting up they in positive person they may feel the same way thank you so much appreciate it [laughter] oh I hear about that they think story\nOr your your command it All right\nI used to play a lot of poker

always a burning ... higher it's um I think spiritually nature that brings almost every Israeli back home to his homeland so we made that move and now we're very very happy living here you know Jack huh\nWell that's great I Know about a week ago uh for some reason something just hits me and said George happens you have an email to ... you know while\nGetting back on the show and ah you were really receptive in here you are but I've got to tell you a great story you've been on the program a couple of times but a couple of years ago when you were on with me\nYou did an experiment where you had people bring their watches in clocks that were working the whole by the radio in the end you did this incredible thing and I got emails that night and for the following week from people who said oh my God\nMy watch is working it hasn't worked in years the funny part about all this ... years later we re ran part of that program on our weekend shows and I started getting emails from people\nAfter that Shane George my watches are working my clock is working and I'm going what's going on here or he was on two years ago and it didn't dawn on me that we had re run that show a couple of days before that the power of what you did was unbelievable\nYes you know George ... people think that when I Am on television or radio and when I ask people to bring broken house appliances broken watches all close and by the way we we can if you wish we can repeat the same experience sure and\nSo people think that it's actually um my energy that flies through the airwaves and and they come out of the radio and TV but he really know what I Do you can simply trigger I'm I'm simply ... captivity [noise]\nTo the how the mind of our listeners or the viewers them big t._v. shows\nThey actually work started my career in a very unusual way I was on and the BBC Nineteen Seventy three it was my first big television show\nAnd they handed me for two band and I don't know why and what made me do these but I looked into the camera and I said every play at home going get you're going\nTo get broken watches I didn't realize that I sent around ten million people through the kitchen because everyone wanted to experience the dominant first of all no one believed that spoons and for are going to bend and watch his we've come alive\nBut they nevertheless they brought this food they wrote broken launches in pocket watches and\nI mean it was messy and then I did my my thing I say one two three work we scream three times one two three work work work and lo and behold they if they don't want it occurred exactly what happened to you people from all over England way of in\nOakland in Ireland [noise] you know\nFor England way of in Scotland and Ireland [noise] you know there you you didn't have then um you know Twitter in face time and you you you just didn't have the Internet there were no more my phone was old\nFashioned black phone and what happened is the BBC's telephone system couldn't take the hundreds of thousands of calls from people all across Britain\nAny collapse and the next day of course I was kind of the most famous person in in England the the the newspapers ran headline stories where we get our puts England in a band\nSo ... years George I thought that I did it\nI really believe that I admitted in energy that fix broken clerks and Ben spoons but the day I discovered that I was wrong was in in Los Angeles\nUCLA and Dr phil mumble mhm invited me to her class and of course I did my my act\nAnd I left when I didn't know George is it she secretly recorded me while and I went back to New York two weeks later she took that heavy video remember those videos in Nineteen Seventy four Seventy five and Seventy six [noise]\nAnd she put that in her a video recorder she invited a new set of pupils student we broke and watch it\nAnd lo and behold there watches started taking\nFrom that video that she calls me in New York and she tells the story you just fix broken watches the you know scientists and I said no way what are you talking about I mean New York I didn't even know that you're you're doing these experiments and that plenty don't to me\nThat it's basically I'm a trigger I may have to leave I mean they may color to\nThe power of the mind of just ordinary people\nWell when you were on the radio show with me you started watches and clocks all around the world and people will just we're just our gas was amazing I first met early Geller back around Nineteen Ninety seven and St Louis he was an invited guest that the Jewish community center do you remember remember that time Henri\nYes I Do in a just a great time the place was packed in a I got\n... nation and had him on my local show when I was the night talking we've stayed friends ever since watch things have been going on in your life and we'll get into that ... while you're with us but the big story that has started to come out has been\nThe CIA recruiting you a long long time ago what did they want with you\n[noise] okay really old started um when I was Thirteen Years old I Lived in Cyprus and you could see where we left because my parents divorced my mother remarried Hungarian Jew living in the ... which is the capital of the cypress yes\nAnd he added tiny bed and breakfast type of a hotel with a Thirteen rooms and Mossad these rhyme intelligence services they found out that we're from Israel so they basically turned the hotel into ... and into a more safe house oh\nSpies would come into the hotel they would check under you know teachers geology ... but they were really more of the agents that were\nFrom Cyprus where a flying out to Syria and Jordan and Egypt and Iraq to spy\nAnd there were problems in Cyprus if I remember during that time period because I always used to remember them talking about ... fighting with Greek people and there was something going on there wasn't there\nOh yeah there was a civil war he was it was just awful yeah but I was when I when I came to Cyprus I was only live and I didn't know English and I so people blowing up I I I mean not doing anything out of Mormons\nI've seen everything ah curfews bombs exploding a so being at that age it really changes your life so I went through the whole war the Greeks were killing the great British soldier the Turks were killing the Greeks\nBut why do these what's going on I was a I befriended the Mossad agent who told me to you know run errands for him he would send me letters\nWe she didn't allow me to open but my task was to jump on the bicycling psycho them to the consulate in the Israeli conflict any out there Regan I told you the story is because I already was excited\nAbout you know the the the life for fear of spy yeah and I love my movies so [noise] to make a long story short um when I became kind of well known in Israel\nI met um golden Meyer who was the\nPrime minister right and she introduced\nMe to Ari Sharon you know these are all your gender roles and that they aren't sure and introduced me to the intelligence community and they started using my abilities\nHold on right there or we're going to take a break in let's come back and pick that up right from there because you truly ruined the middle of all that with some of the leaders of Israel who stayed leaders for a long long time we'll be back in a moment with the ... the paranormal as the mental us next on coast to coast day on\nThe coast website is no streamline for mobile devices Greek news if your ... simply want to enjoy our website on your moon visit goes to ... dot com on your iPhone or Android rose or [noise]\nYes they introduced me to the head of a most out uh they recruited me and I started doing some work for them which we weren't going to but\nThey basically didn't have the technology\nTo test my abilities and they picked up the phone in the cold the CIA and he was a CIA scientists quote kitten green who took the call basically talks about it in a fascinating documentary called the secret life of Henri gather\nProduced by the BBC and on my website you can watch it\nUm my website is already gathered dot com\nAnd um they asked the CIA to test me they wanted to know they wanted information of how the mind works how can they put the occurred\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy two I left is where it's great to California to Palo Alto to Stanford research Institute which is today Stanford University and I went through rigorous\nA laboratory controlled condition test\nA and then I started working for the CIA doing you know stuff all over the place for them but just about a year ago or as you mentioned before the CIA release that some of the documents\nUm that concerned me and it was amazing the rent you know the press to hold of this story and he claimed worldwide yes\nAnd uh in these documents they show drawings that I've done um from you know inside parity cages are there there was experiments where keep green held\nA book in his hand let's just remind our listeners that there were no more by phone then and no Twitter and Instagram\nAnd I basically drew worked that was in the book and he also wrote on that page\nI'm at their word architectural and I wrote the same word in Palo Alto in California so [noise] yeah that's the answer that I worked very hard that we these agencies worldwide\nWhen you were a United States touring in a you know when I was watching you on TV and the Johnny Carson show into were you recruited by the CIA at that time or afterwards\nIt at that time um but then he ... you know

what you did was unbelievable\nYes you know George ... people think that when I Am on television or radio and when I ask people to bring broken house appliances broken wants his old clothes and by the way we we can if you wish we can repeat the same experience sure and\nSo people think that it's actually um my energy that flies through the airwaves and and they come out of the radio and television but it's really know\nWhat I Do you can simply trigger I'm I'm simply a cap relief to the how the mind of our listeners or the viewers um big t._v. shows [noise]\nThis is actually worked started my career in a very unusual way I was on the BBC Nineteen Seventy three it was my first big television show\nAnd they handed me for two band\nAnd I don't know why and what made me do these but I looked into the camera and I said every play at home going get your spoons\nAnd get broken watch it I didn't realize that I sent around ten million people through the kitchen because everyone wanted to experience the dominant first of all no one believed that spoons and for are going to bend and watch his we've come alive\nBut they nevertheless they brought this to the pro broken watches and pocket watches and\nI mean it was messy and then I did my my thing I said one two three work we scream three times one two three work work work and lo and behold they they don't want to Kurt exactly what happened to you\nPeople from all over England way of in Scotland and Ireland [noise]\nYou know there you you didn't have then um you know Twitter in face time and you you you just didn't have the Internet there were no more my phone\nWas old fashioned black phone and what happened is the BBC's ... them couldn't take the hundreds of thousands of calls from people all across Britain\nAnd he'd collapse and the next day course I was kind of the most famous person in in England the newspapers ram headline stories where we get our puts England in a band so ... years George I thought that I did it\nI really believe that I admitted\nIn energy that fix broken clerks and been stoned\nIt it and energy that fix broken clerks and ... but the day I discovered that I was wrong was in in Los

weeks later she took that heavy video remember those videos in Nineteen Seventy four Seventy five and Seventy six [noise]\nAnd she put that in her a video recorder she invited a new set of pupils through that we've broken want you\nAnd lo and behold there watches started taking\nFrom that video that she calls me in New York and she tells the story you just fix broken watches the fabulous and I said no way what are you talking about I mean New York I didn't even know that you're you're doing this experiment and that plenty dawned on me\nThat it's basically I'm a trigger I may have to leave I mean in may ... to the power of the mind of just ordinary ...\nWell when you were on the radio show with me you started watches and clocks all around the world and people just for just our gas it was amazing I first met early Geller back around Nineteen Ninety seven and St Louis he was an invited guest that the Jewish community center do you remember remember that time Henri yes I Do\nIn a just a great time the place was packed in a I got region formation and had him on my local show when I was the night talk and\nWe've stayed friends ever since lots of things have been going on in your life and we'll get into that ... while you're with us but the big story that has started to come out has been the CIA recruiting you a long long time ago what did they want with you\n[noise] okay where the old guard um when I was Thirteen Years old I Lived in Cyprus and you could see how we let because my parents divorced my mother remarried Hungarian Jew living in the ... which is the capital of the Cyprus yes\nAnd he added tiny bed and breakfast type of a hotel with the Thirteen rooms\nAnd mosques on these rhyming damaging services they found out that we're from Israel so they basically turned the hotel into ... into a more safe house so\nSpies would come into the hotel they would check under you know teacher geology archeology but they were really more of the agents that we're\nFrom Cyprus where a flying out to Syria and Jordan and Egypt and Iraq to sky\nAnd there were problems in Cyprus if I remember during that time period because I always used to remember them talking about Cypriots fighting with Greek people and there was something going on there wasn't there\nOh yeah there was a civil war it was it was just awful yeah but I was when I when I came to Cyprus I was only live and I didn't know English and I so people blown up I I I mean not doing anything out of more\nI've seen everything uh curfews bombs exploding or so being at that age it really changes your life\nSo I went through the whole war the Greeks were getting a great British soldier the Turks were getting the Greeks but why all this was going on I was a I befriended the Mossad agent who told me\nTo you know run errands for him he would send me letters\nWe she didn't allow me to open but my task was to jump on the bicycling psycho them to the conflict in the Israeli conflict anyhow the reason I told you the story is because I already was excited\nAbout you know the the then life for a few over by yeah and I know a movie so [noise] to make a long story short um when I became kind of well known in Israel\nI met um golden Meyer who is the\nPrime minister right and she introduced\nMe to our Sharon you know these are all your gender rose in that they aren't sure and introduced me to be intelligent um community and they started using my ability\nHold on right there or we're going to take a break and let's come back and pick that up right from there because you truly room in the middle of all that with some of the leaders of Israel who stayed leaders for a long long time we'll be back in a moment with the three Geller the paranormal as The Mentalist next on coast to coast the yeah\nThe ... website is now streamlined for mobile devices great news if you're a ghost insider or simply want to enjoy our website on your phone visit goes to ... am dot com on your iPhone or Android rose or [noise]\nYes they introduce me to the head of a most out or they recruited me and I started doing some work for them which we weren't going to but\nThey basically didn't have the technology to test my abilities\nAnd they picked up the phone in the coldest CIA and he was a CIA scientists quote keeping green who took the call basically talks about it in a fascinating documentary called the secret life of worry gather\nProduced by the BBC and on my website you can watch it\nUm my website is already gathered dot com\nAnd um they asked the CIA to test me they wanted to know they wanted information of how the mind works how can they put the Kurds\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy two I left ... straight to California to Palo Alto to Stanford research Institute which is today Stanford University and I went through rigorous a laboratory controlled condition test\nA and then I started working for the CIA doing you know stuff all over the place for them but just about a year ago I ask you mentioned before the CIA release that some of the documents\nUm that concerned me and it was amazing the rent you know the press\nTo hold of this story any ... worldwide yes\nAnd ah in these documents they show drawings that I've done um from you know inside parity cages are there there was experiments where kids green held\nA book in his hand let's just remind our listeners that there were no more by phones then and no Twitter and Instagram\nAnd I basically drew worked that was in the book and he also wrote on that page\nI'm at their word architectural and I wrote the same word in Palo Alto in California so yeah that's the answer that I worked very hard to read these agencies worldwide\nWhen you were in the United states touring and uh you know when I was watching you on TV and the Johnny Carson show into were you recruited by the CIA at that time or afterwards\nIt at that time um but then he he you know kind of um trickled into other areas where senator Claiborne Pell who was the head of the American Foreign Relations committee\nFlew me to Geneva we've them back their max campus then I'm next to me stood Al Gore\nAnd I was instructed to boom barred you live on so to sign the nuclear arms reduction treaty between America and Russia of course there was briefed by by these people in London\nAnd um I got very close to your liver on so I mean I was inches away from his head\nAnd I ... I Know it sounds so far out in ... in science fiction but\nI did exactly that I bought it is mind to sign sign sign\nAnd they sign they knew the nuclear arms reduction treaty of course I Can't claim that I eat eat only happened because of me there are other elements involved that I was definitely an instigator I was in motivator and I use these powers to convince the Russians to go ahead and signed a treaty\nAbout a year ago President Trump released some JFK documents and then later on released some more there's still a lot that still have been suppressed Henri but sure enough we uh we read that retailer was asked to look at the JFK files\nYes what happened is\nWhy I was I'm working for some CIA operators and my handler is in Mexico city it was very kind of genius how they got me into Mexico I was introduced to the president of Mexico or look ... and his wife\nOr his wife was kind of fell in love with the hours and you know she loves the paranormal in the supernatural [noise]\nAnd um she arranged me television shows were talking about the wife of the president of Mexico uh-huh and I was flying all over Mexico with their private jet and so on but by parallel to that\nI was asked to spy on the Russian embassy in Mexico city to see who grows in who goes out where they were there are American spies going game um people who betrayed the country and so forth\nAnd one of my tasks was to find out Neal Harvey all vote actually visited that that embassy or consulate\nWhere there was some controversy about that because there was a picture of what was supposed to be Lee Harvey Oswald coming outside of the embassy but a lot of people were you said that's not him but so go ahead\nYeah well that was my task was to tell them whether that was him or not\nBut there there were more more in much deeper things in in Mexico that I did for the CIA [noise] it was amazing I I actually love the by the way I never got paid for these I did it out of ideological reasons\nAnd uh I Love these showbiz nascent cloak and dagger a there I was in Johnny Carson in Merv Griffin Mike Douglas\nAnd then yet I was doing this secret stuff\nFor also for him I five\nIn in London but by the way you know that the Johnny Carson's show was a an amazing experience for me because you still talk about\nI was sitting there with Johnny Carson for twenty two minutes humiliated by him I don't know if you know this I I walked into a trap\nYeah they they set you up it was because Johnny Was a ... a ... a small news magician on his own so he was interested in trying to nail you and then uh then he had what the amazing Randy with him\nYet he wasn't there he was ... it was a setup so walking into the onto the show you know people here tell me\nWhy or if you do that Johnny Carson you made in America so I was very excited to do the show but there is I sat I been to school in a in the hands of free cardamom Tumblr and if you remember him right movie actor [noise]\nAnd they they for Johnny Was invented enough and um I I was really kind of\nSweating and the only thought that ramble in my mind was Henri gather you're finished for twenty two minutes humiliated me and I went back to the hotel devastate\nYou yeah you were upset I hear\nCulturally I failed the bed and I I thought that seat a I wake up tomorrow morning and I'll pack up and go back to his room but\nAnd I wake up tomorrow morning and I'll pack up and go back to Israel but the funny thing happened I wake up in the morning phone rings in my room and the operator downstairs tells me that there is a man called Merv Griffin them they live for ...\nSo I said you mean the Merv Griffin because I knew them I knew the names she says he says that's who he is\nA so see she switches the lawn and he says to me or a gather I watched you on Johnny Carson last night I Want you on my show this week and that's when I realized that would also co wine that said a hundred years ago\nThat there is only one worst thing in life than being talked about and that's not being talked about you really holds I realize that controversy is fantastic publicity\nYes skeptics didn't understand that that it was really drove the skeptics made during gather\nThey they created the mysterious around me the mystique around me they created the the the arguments around the phenomena of spoon bending over to let the and the more they talked about me the more well known I became a worldwide\nOwn your own I should send brandy a thousand bouquet of flowers for creating and you know my career\nYou still kicking these Ninety One

you know maybe even more well\nWow that's quite a collection it was quite a collection and it was pretty cool and we never listen to it because of it's like when the real big collectors of baseball cards\n... by baseball cards buy the case and then they never open up the gas prices because of the valuable cards aren't in there then the case loses value I was\nSo the valuable cards aren't in there then the case loses value\nI was watching I think it was on the antique Roadshow uh a woman came in her her grandfather\nI guess that he I don't know much about baseball cards but apparently I guess cards used to come in cigarettes\nBaseball cards that's where the ... series and then later bubblegum yeah okay so uh her grandfather he would get his his cigarettes pull the cards out put him in a cigar box she had several cigar boxes full of\nThe most the most popular ones are most valuable ones that look brand new\nWell obviously as just like coins the value is determined upon condition but condition of the car in the rarity of the card obviously but the condition maybe even more so they were\nAll just no one had ever looked at them but when he died he had left them to her and there were I don't know half a dozen cigar boxes just chock full of a baseball cards from way back when\nI figure I put about a million dollars value value in the cards that I used to put on my bike\nOr put them in the spokesman you may go down and lack of my my yeah real good idea or a ... genius idea that anyhow Senator Marco Rubio said yesterday\nAnd now because Mr palm pale isn't Saudi Arabia boy I don't envy him okay not a good job and we hope that he is fading in and well protected and I'm sure he is and they wouldn't be dumb enough to do something\nTo an American secretary of state because that would like really shut off all the deals there or Senator Marco Rubio said that if the president doesn't do something drastic about the situation that the Congress will\nThat there needs to be a strong response if in fact this proves to be true\nThey lowered the slam into the consulate they wouldn't medieval on him and he was killed and it was chopped up and they sent a crew down there to kill them and do all this that'd be an outrage and\nJust because they're an ally and an important mission which was containing Iranian expansion in the region and not allow us to overlook a walk away from that it undermines our ability\nTo stand for for morality and human rights all over the world how can we criticize them for doing right for killing journalists were prepared to allow an ally to do well we've already asked for Magnitsky investigation which means individuals responsible for that decision it would be sanctioned beyond that there are other options that we can take\nLike I said that's something that needs to be thought through carefully because it but it needs to be strong\nAnd needs to be a reciprocal and meaning it needs to actually live up to the the the level of the outrage that and and and the criminality and in fact this has proven to be true\nAnd I'm like I said so I'm Glad the president didn't tie it has in terms of exactly what we're going to do but it needs to be very strong and meaningful can't be symbolic\nBoy once again that little blurb demean sounded awfully presidential ask you to ... no\nNo no no no no you know it's a no no and and you know [noise]\nI Would only hope that Marco Rubio would not take advantage of someone being basically don't earn or killed and cut up to advance his uh\nI Know it is hard possibilities and this is kind of I don't remember I Do not remember a story\nPut together such as this and this was from encourage turkey from CNN\nThe Saudis are preparing a report that will acknowledge that Saudi journalist Jamal cause show these death was the result of an interrogation that went wrong one would one that was intended to lead his abduction from turkey according to two sources right number one I hate anonymous sources but\nIt is what it is that explanation has since been retracted\nThat ... me that a story such as this with this much weight gets out and then gets pulled get ... back in one store says the report will like likely conclude that the operation was carried out without clearance and transparency\nAnd that those involved will be held responsible one of the sources acknowledge that the report is still being prepared and cautioned that\nChange even if you're in Ankara you can't put the snakes back in the box\nOkay okay not that I Love Neil Diamond okay well then that probably wasn't a very good reaction now I was reacting to the to ah someone\nRedoing Neil Diamond well there are a lot of people that did that there were Neil Diamond impersonators remember a Mr White ... than in Las Vegas sometimes kids you got to have the real thing yes\nWell anyhow the only problem with this guy's voice was he had this beautiful tone yet this beautiful by bravado he had this great great tonality\nYeah this beautiful vibrant auto he had this great great tonality the only problem was he only had one note I remember this we went to see him it was almost like listening to a Gregorian chant it was like I'm\nA yeah mine is a little to no one there and you're going wait a minute\nThere's different notes in that song [laughter] oh that is so classic Las Vegas lounge and he's wearing a Cape oh but of course of course ride and he's got the mutton chops side burns going yeah\nStanding in front of this boom box singing one note now is singing in monotone ... if if he could have mastered the other eleven tones and the scale this guy would have made a ton of money now we might have something to you and I guarantee you\nFor him to have gone that far and actually song in a lounge in Las Vegas somebody had said to him you know you really a good singer somewhere some man who is completely tone deaf\nAnd wouldn't know a singer oven fell on their head\n\nWhat had happened to tell this guy that he had this great voice and it was I'm telling you this one note that he could sing was and shale like [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] that's so funny but I Can't even imagine how we would get lambasted on American Idol\nOh or some show like that they would have gone wait a minute he's only singing one note\nSome of those attacks that we would see that from a skews my folks oh I Know we're both trying to get over this hasn't been easy uh some of those acts that you're wandering through the casino middle of the afternoon you know prime time\nAnd you would go and they would be just free shows and you would go in and and maybe take a break from the machines are from the poker table or from the race for whatever you'd go in and sit down and some of them were hilarious well they didn't mean to be they were just hilarious the only\nFunny thing that Jerry Lewis ever said to us during production meetings okay in the nine years that I did the Jerry Lewis telephone\nSo he was pretty active in putting these shows to go he was very active holding I didn't know that well he had a house in Vegas he lives in Vegas I knew all mad a year and then was obviously this person and get around but I didn't know how much\nDay to day hands on a lot of input he had a lot\nOkay and the only funny thing than ever made me laugh when he said it\nWas he once said Eighteen hours into and tell us on and by that time you know your knee high strung and while you are but the tide from the talks is kind of\n... and you know and it looks like you've been sleeping in it and everything like that and in those days he would do the whole Twenty one hours\nHe really was a trooper when it came to that you know\nI remember being very you know pretty young like nine ten twelve I remember when you\nKnow I remember in Nineteen fifty eight when he did the first one he was at the American a hotel in New York City and then the next year he was at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles and somebody
