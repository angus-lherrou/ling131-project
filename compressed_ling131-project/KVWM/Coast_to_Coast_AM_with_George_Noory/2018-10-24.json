I got to tell you the dentist is not just having property it's where it is a in this course the Palestinians and the Israelis are truly one where they are because it's the holy land it's it's where\nJesus and everything else began to them and they don't want to move to Kansas City or Iowa or Nebraska or anything like that we've got the land available there's no doubt about that but it's not just about land yeah part of the issue is fighting over the holy land itself Sam I Want you to take that question\nOr there's land but if not their land and I'm I'm I I\nI think trying to federal um where people go at this point is a ... that's not going to happen\nIt's way way too late or if I'm Wondering if you should ever had um you know the the second burrito um you know forty years after you've hit the fifteenth slice of pizza I I I think what's important to to understand about the Arab Israeli conflict\nIs that the expert the state department diplomats\nAnd everyone has been using a formula that um you know it'll that the Israelis and the Palestinians can be ... and the girl she ate a case like everyone else and they're missing what I Believe is a critical point\nAnd that is that the mathematical equation that they're working on is flawed\nThe state of Israel was um was created the Israelis DNA dictates\nThat the Jews never again be forced to um to do anything at the point of a gun I'm through fourth and the Palestinians DNA because of the establishment of the state of Israel in Nineteen forty eight warrants demands that there'll be some sort of military victory\nSome sort of\nUm you would Jima moments of raising the flag\nMhm or they can say that their ... their opinion there equals that they've achieved they've achieved Harry\nAnd both both sides um in in how they approach the world and how they approach their very very small neighborhood\nUm are are bent on ... are doomed to fail so perhaps what might be the wiser course of action for is the change of the mathematical equation and to try something different to try something where I'm different\nSorts of ... of landmarks and while those can be reached in order to get to a place of coexistence and to this day that really hasn't been attempted\nBrian in Indianapolis Brian go ahead sir hey George morning hay bright\nListen a man what a what a mess over there in the middle east and and and than it used to ride all the horses are wrong are no good over there at outside of Israel and look at the American blood been spilled over there over the decade and it just seems like nothing has changed but my question is\nA must William Buckley is forgotten history that nobody\nUh which William Buckley they've forgotten history that nobody you know really remembers\nBut if he gave that secret in I don't know you know begin or not was your any trickle down collateral damage to the field officer of the of the CIA that were out in the field or from the information that he might have given up\nAnd keep up the good work and I'll take my answer off the air you got to give you that question [noise] sure a good\nQuestion Brian uh answer your question is uh uh at the time or the agency the CIA um could not take any more chances meaning a in essence they they removed all of this personnel assigned to the station or got them out of a country a set up\nThey had to shut down or their source network or and anticipate or the entire ... chain that that had been compromised their uh they had to shut down safe houses are where are you meet with informants are in anticipation that perhaps bill or had disclosed that\nUh so uh you have that trickle down effect and there's also a damage assessment that comes into play here to\nWhere you start thinking about um you know the intelligence services exist to steal secrets and so here you have or\nOr the CIA the CIA point man in Lebanon\nThat have access to everything or what value is that to another intelligence service so if you're the Iranian intelligence service for example\nA Kenyan horse trader swap with a let's say a B Russian KGB at the time so those are the kinds of things that you have to anticipate and you look at it from a worst case scenario\nAnd you shut down everything so\nUh what was the operations compromise or\nA operations were uh certainly shut down stopped a until a complete damage assessment is done to see how bad things are and then you have to restart a your entire um human collection network a which is never easy\nSam what's happening delivered on today what's the situation there\nUh well I'm has ... perhaps the most powerful political party in the country while I'm Hezbollah has um\nStockpiled hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles that aims Israel Hezbollah fighters are getting on on short on characteristic Lee I'm\nA crucial combat experience and counter insurgency um capabilities\nFighting in Syria um the\nThe\nLebanese fighters in in in Syria have played a significant role in in off of being able to the regime being able to remain in power um Hezbollah remains\nI'm One of the world's largest narcotics traffickers a money laundering of 'em you name it we've out so throughout the world including South America\nAnd has remained very clear and present danger to the United states Israel in western interests throughout the middle east\nDrug why do they deal with the cartels are that are in a you know South America\nUm yes there is a very large population in South America in Argentina in Columbia Venezuela a in a previous work that I did um ... we learned that um the the government of president my door in Venezuela\nUm had a um a shuttle service\nOn the Venezuelan um airline troubling Damascus and I'm bringing in narcotics to Lebanon of course everybody of along the way to go to ... and then from Lebanon being dispersed\nThroughout um points throughout the um you're in the middle east um\nMoney the money from those cells were laundered I'm In West Africa um some of the money was smuggled as a result of stolen car rings in the United states um it is a global criminal enterprise\nUnbelievable I I've always felt we should just legalize all drugs set up ... you know clinics to help people but legalized drugs don't put people in jail they'll stop people from robbing people because of the prices will plummet\nAnd it's one way you're getting these people who are making all the Germans drugs and distributing them what do you think\nWell a large large portion of his ... budget comes from um illegal activities and I I think that's um you know when we think about that we have to remember that more important than the religious elements more important even sometimes\nThey sponsorship of terrorist organizations are criminal groups and they\nThey survive they thrive and they operate with um with criminal criminal gang um revenue\nAnd that's that's that's what we're gonna come back and wrap things up one final calls ... because the [noise]\n\n\n\nOn news talk radio Katie WN and Katie Jay\n\nAnd we're back with their final segment with red ... than Samuel Katz their work is going to be rude rules are website linked linked up and goes to goes damn dot com Freda want to get your take on these ... situation of course and\nOf course the Saudi royals lied about the case or in the beginning a truly was killed that the consulate butchered\nOr you know I guess because of what his ah his writings were about the royal family and about Saudi Arabia but geez my gosh what's your take on that\n[noise] my goodness Georgia I can never remember another incident like that on a\nDiplomatic a facility in the history of time uh now I'm sure the Russians have possibly ah ah disposed of some bodies via similar methods that we're just not aware of just knowing how the KGB operates a in this arena\nBut uh I just uh I cannot imagine how a this operation was put put together a to actually do this or\nInside a diplomatic facility\nOr with all the eyes and ears that are on every diplomatic facility in the world\nAre you certainly could could have thought of a a much better operation and and\nSo uh either it was done with the purposeful intent to resonate\nUh although it or how it appears that this just was a a a tremendous fiasco and uh I I certainly don't think we've seen the last of this now the curious part to George with this this uh based on some of the research we've done here at strapped for\nA there appears to then a few other ah Saudi princes that have disappeared too so um\nSince ... since the royal prince basically took over\nA correct or and before or this incident to an extent both so\nUh this just might be part and parcel to a Saudi a outreach and covert action or to a target and eliminate a dissidents or any enemies of a of the royal family but uh uh it's certainly an unprecedented a mess\nYou because when he came in with his daughter base when his father basically said hey you're going to be in charge here or did he put a lot of royals away at the rich Carlton a in Riyadh and basically held them as hostage\nOr yes he did and you know you get back to a you know the the CIA director uh is en route or just arrived there for meetings or\nA which is always very interesting because uh those meetings never happened in a vacuum or I Would not be surprised to see a some sort of a\nA effort behind the scenes to to try to ah make sense of what took place and and move forward or you know that's the other interesting thing and these kinds of cases Georgian of behind the scenes or you know the intelligence services just go about their business\nAnd um because you know the the world doesn't shut down with threats with\nWork and uh and the curious part there is you know the Saudis are for all their dysfunction and chaos or there's still a an intelligence provider no that that gets funneled into the to the big intelligence community so uh it it certainly is a a fiasco though\nIt's like a partnership with a double isn't it\n[noise] well most relationships with governments are uh at times [laughter]\nYeah I'm a ... sad to say and it's just the nature of the business uh you know some of rock along steadily without uh any hiccups like with our five eyes relationships um but you know those don't or at times working smoothly as a as most people think\nAh because remember a you know there are no friendly intelligence services that's the one monitor that you learn and and basic agent school\nIs a there are no friendly intelligence services and each nation state is going to operate and what they feel is the best interests of their country\nAnd ... cars showed me apparently was the nephew of the Late Show the arms dealer a non ... uh there was so ... you know there's been this power group within the royal family for years what what did he right that was so devastating that they want to kill him over\nWell that's the fascinating part I was talking to a couple of our ah Saudi analysts this morning here in the office than a one of the analysts actually had a went in and watched him at a at a local speaking event uh this is an individual that are really wasn't that high profile ah\nAnd you probably could have lifted you know a dozen others that are more vocal against\nThe I mean he's more well known now dead then he was alive\nWell exactly yeah and you know wasn't one of these cases where are you know you look at what the Russian what putting in the KGB did going into the u._k. and and taking out scribe Paul when ... you know the poisoning\nOr you know so uh you know do do these intelligence services see these a nation state moves like this and say well heck why can't we do this too I I mean it might boiled down to being something as simple as that\nYeah it's crazy and Fifteen people and apparently they're going to war ... most of them which is interesting because of the big are they going to rat on the person said get this done for me and I think we all know words leading a or are they going to keep quiet and the hope that they get leniency and get out of prison and a year or two\n[noise] well and you don't want to be in a Turkish president that's that's the one getting\nYeah that's true too that's true to Tom in the Bronx let's get us started Tom go ahead\nI like to have that their leaders are horrendous caper is Yemen\nI mean it gives the United states very ugly face and name and out in you or how can it be said that they want peace between Israel and the Palestinians\nWhen they have this when they have these terrible stories going on one\nFor another if I were in charge I Would say well maybe you can take guys are and make it a temporary a hot when the of the was not for oil and that would go not a silver but\nFor the sake of humanity to stop they get it from a sending missiles at Israel and Israel bombing guys do at least stabilize it\nIsrael and Israel bombing guys\nDo at least stabilize it that way and then there's another aspect to this story they ... they took I they they took Libya and they made a mess headed Libya\nAnd in the um they they should go back there and retake the area in the creative said government for the Libyans\nI well I think I tried that Tom and it's just sailed miserably so far ... of course we'll books on been God's me that horrible situation there\nA coffee of course there was

everything else what do you think of that whole situation for it\n[noise] well uh first uh you know the state department or has a long history of tragedy I've I've lived through a lot uh\nAnd uh you look at bin ... I\nI'm a you know they they have done a tremendous course correction or the organization mild outfit is hired more agents\nOr they've they've now train they now train and protect with buildings on fire\nOr they've worked with F.

of changes made and protection\nA been God's he was a mess I I mean and bathrooms Stevens never should have been there on September the eleventh\nAs the chief of mission of the president's representative to to Libya uh they pretty much can do what they want and he decided he wanted to go and he was there and he shouldn't have been\nAnd um\nThe agents got overwhelmed and you know certainly the the CIA a security support team were heroes you know they can and ah and and got everybody out of the special mission compound there but ah\nUm it's just a a another long list of

thing when the first people to think about that but we talk about it a lot\nBut it's it's an endless fascination with us in with a lot of\nPeople well and you write about this important aspect not all these people are making things up or lying or mistaken in even if you have a hundred people in Ninety nine of them are making up the stories that they she goes to new lows big foot\nYou've got that one person who's not lying who has seen something very unusual in that that's what fuels me that's why I continue looking for these answers\nBecause that that one person is the reason that I go after these stories\nUh-huh right show it all it takes is one ghost story to be true and they might as well be true\nI tell Linda molten how who's a reporter Mac\nOr she's an expert in crops formations and are truly believes that most of the crop formations are made from other sources other than man\nAnd one of those sources could be could be UFOs could be the earth doing it as a vehicle to communicate with us whatever it is she thinks most of them are done that way\nAnd I I've told her I says Linda\nIt doesn't matter because even if all of them except one oh he's the unusual one it's amazing story it's it's the story of the lifetime\nCan absolutely for sure and all like Argo story you know if you could talk to if there's one\nSure and I like Argo story if you could talk to one person always come back here from the afterlife that's it was amazing thing that's ever happened ever\nWere you in the you were in the UFOs is a little boy were you raised religious Mac because there's a follow up questions that\nI really you know I grew up in Chester which was the kind of working class out of Boston you know we were we were Catholic and I had to revolve around the Catholic Church\nSchool and you know and so on and so forth but not not overly religious you know\nWe were you out there when Alberta solve all the Boston strength color was out there doing this thing at\nThe same neighborhood I'm Sorry to say but\nYeah I thought so I thought what an amazing story that was shore yeah it wasn't he a family man\n[noise] ah well it is kind of a not adrift but you know it never really helped a lot of stable job then you know a lot of people think that he that he was actually framed by the costs because they needed somebody to you know to to arrest it because there was I can remember it as you know it was the headline\nAll the time all the time you know this guy strangle a lot of women right in our area and um [noise] you know there was some stuff that he didn't know about some of them are at a side but who knows but one once he went to jail they did stop so\nYeah they did stop and there could have been a few copycats object to it that is true they're always on the lookout for those how did you accumulate the stories for hunted universe how did you get them\nWell uh you know once again had boxes of all this different research and that for a while I work or or it tore up website those out of a TV CBS is uh-huh okay yeah they just decided to five Fifteen an odd story as a month and that just\nYou know I bought lots of books on line and so on and just accumulated all this are filed by other strange stories\nAre you still finding new stories Mac\nGo all the time yeah I'm sure\nThey don't stop and I'm sure you've got some favorites or after we come back from the break rules we'll talk about how the universe and go through some of these stories will have time for them and then we'll take calls next don't work as well\nUm and I'm sure you've got your own favorites don't

floor the body of another old man they pulled him over they turn him over right 'cause he's on his stomach they roll 'em over and it's a little man let\nThem in a while they turn around and that guy is gone and there he is dead on the floor\nStories like that they just think wow what's going on\nSo we got a call from an EMT who was on the scene of an accident and she was she was not working so she stopped her own car got out when running saw the body and the side of the road\nWas looking at the body sees somebody standing by her car and said please call nine one one\nIt was the guy that

we can tell us about the a lot of elite disappearance right\nYet luckily disappearance a very strange story ... in fact the first story in the book uh back in World War one um the uh British\nA ... a British soldiers also with a lot of Australia and New Zealand soldiers\nInvaded or a pod of turkey turkey was an ally of Germany so ah they sent an invasion force a dime to turkey they landed this invasion force and just really gets stuck on the beach and it was just really horrible just a ... there were a lot of spiders in World War one but this was like\nJust a really really a massive one um Mel Gibson Scott in a movie\nCalled goes locally and if you see that you know it's just heartbreaking how all these people died there well anyway there was a um a company of a hundred soldiers called the ... and they were actually made up of service from a large state and England\nAnd they had trained together they went over to um a fight the Germans together and they were part of this invasion\nAnd really all it was was just a troops just marching into a murderous a machine gun fire anyway this company of soldiers British soldiers just went into the smoke\nAnd would never seen again or their bodies were never recovered ...\nUm they um during this part of what they did you know sometimes take these cruises where they would let people either both sides take their dead and wounded off the battlefield but no one ever found the bodies of these a hundred guys and even the person who was in charge of the British a commander in chief said you know he he could never figure out exactly what happened\n... what do you see him\nI don't know who knows you know it's ... it's just very unusual but none of these none of the soldiers from this particularly unit that one's getting the bodies are never found no remains found of them are they literally disappeared during a major battle\nWe've got a guess name divas the ladies max that has written a book called missing for one one several other books after that were people disappear in our park systems never to be seen in many cases some of them right some of them they do find their bodies but they are in very strange circumstances but\nI'm I'm sometimes wonder if there's some kind of dimension or ... or something that people stumble through and they're gone\nOr something I I Know in some of those four one one stories and national pox young people that to people like jogging and one goes round the bend and then they never see 'em again you know it's it's it's something that happens immediately a very scary very interesting stories as well\nA little situation or just a month ago with the little boys from Louisiana who his father's a little kid and he ran away and he couldn't keep up with them and they found the kid the several days later you know dead by creek I mean just strange stories\nYeah really yeah yeah creepy\nWhat am I on England's phantom Tom what's that\nWell this was one you know we we really kind of had to look into this one because I'm the areas of up until a few years ago if you went on a go go off you looked in any kind of a phone book or whatever and I'm\nWest blanket ... England area ah you said that there was a town there are called ...\nI had everything at its all post office and edits on newspaper and you know had a job section real estate company there's even a dating service there but it turns out that this this time never existed um anyone who went to the land cotton and given to\nAh you ought to Google Map they would just find an empty field\nOr no one really knows exactly what happened a one newspaper said that Google and the people who supplied mapping data you know unable to explain you know why they had this town on the map but when you actually go to the place\nIt's not there I'm not sure when the book you know we we we really can't you know figure out what is going on there you know there's no UFO activity near the place a military activity to one person told us or what better place for government to hide secrets than a time that never existed\nUm it seems to be some kind of um drill or some kind of how to you know for some reason maybe some intelligence services want to know what it's like to create a phantom time well they did it in the middle of England\nThat's weird isn't it yeah it sure is in a\nStrange stories like that all the time we were talking about your photos in that you've never seen one than I saw a couple with night vision goggles in your opinion based on your research were some of the best places in the United states to spot UFOs\nUh-huh well you know it's funny I'm there there's let's say a top three or four but one of them is a place called elk river Minnesota\nAnd that there's nothing really you know extraordinary about this a place except a standing a few years ago people started seeing UFOs almost on a daily or let's say a nightly basis\nAnd uh it's just a small community it's you know more for its fishing and and and I'm\nA scheme men are than anything else but what's strange about it is not only do people see you oppose frequently the but they're not your typical UFOs some of them I look like a one person said that\nUh they saw one that you know it looked like a huge jellyfish or others look like you know just very ... uh some of the size of a a line of some of them are you know a small is basketball's\nBut for whatever reason is they want to congregate around a little elk river Minnesota that's one place\nOr another interesting places even built Texas which is down near where I'm\nAt George W Bush's ranch is sitting there was a major citing down there years ago and in two thousand I ate where some people saw\nA a UFO being chased by F. sixteen fighters or Airforce fight as other people saw a ... escorted by F. sixteen fight as it happened right near where George Bush's ranchers and apparently you know down in that part of Texas\nIf you keep your eyes open and go out at night and maybe get those night vision goggles you could see lots of different things\nDo you think his ranch in anything to do with that where the you know\nI ... I don't know you know I think the whole idea that some of the witnesses they had a lot of witnesses and um some of the thought that the outsiders were chasing the UFO but then other people swear they that they saw them flying alongside like they're escorting I\nI'm In just the fact that it was his ranch you know who knows but um yeah that's that's it and it still today as a place where if you want to take the time to go down there\nAre people see you all falls on a regular basis Gulf breeze Florida which had a um a controversy many years ago where a guy\nFlorida which had a um a controversy many years ago where a guy named John Waters Walters came up with lots of photographs very detail photograph\n... story region right\nAnd and and then you know I have some people went to great lengths to prove or in their minds any way that you know these were hoaxes but the strange thing is is that people still get down there that people still see things in the sky and they still take pictures of them still detail than almost look like\nThe ones that are at Walters had so um what whatever is lying around up there you know there's a good chance you're going to see it if you get down of Gulf

object appeared overhead and guided him to a gas station\nUm but later on in his autobiography ... head of the story of his autobiography telling the New York times his quote was I told the truth that I lied and I know that just seems like ... to me you know um another odd one was a big Jagger was um\nIf he can believe it camping with his girlfriend Marion papal Nineteen sixty eight had a very vivid I'm\nA UFO citing so much so that it is a\nEnglish estate he actually installed the UFO detected whatever that might be um the odd thing about that story is it's hard to believe that Mick Jagger

Charles welcome to the program\n\nIf he if he had a um [noise] a knowledge of a it become aware of anything related to where some of this technology that we require UFOs have been a you know what the question or two\nAnd a protected because er at one time I was asked I I myself was that that would help a destroy it some people in the military\nUh fortunately that tend to believe this technology is demonic and they want to they want to destroy it I mean it it it kind of has to do with their religious beliefs they are\nAnd I wondered if uh [noise] I declined of course that a\nLot of people think these things are demonic Charles yeah\n[noise] [laughter] but you yeah you're on the fence so\nWell the thing is I don't I there's some if some of this technology I feel that we need we need to hang on to try to figure it out of that reverse engineered and all that I don't feel like we need to go jumping to go and destroy it\nOr just because it's some kind of religious I tend to think of it as somewhat irrational religious belief but there are people at very high levels in the military and other places that are that tend\nTo believe that you know this is sort of stuff we should just destroy it rather than try to figure it out and see if we can put it that some kind of good you\nAre and I believe that there ... there could be some kind of way to use it well or use it cautiously you know with with the poker you can strengthen considerations\nUh but uh so I don't know it's just that but uh I was a little bit I don't know how far the reason why they asked me because I might have on like ... or easily access some of the places\nWell that's that's an interesting take to be sure as so Mac you're back with us\nSo I Am yep thanks judge\nSo tell us about the man eating tree Madagascar\nWell believe it or not there um ... there's like a plant those I'm close to those plants that eat wise or Venus flytrap but yes it's actually a tree and there were reports that these things to to get too close some small animals all the way up to a you know well\nA children and so on that this thing rap you up and literally\nDigest you\nThings have always fascinated me I mean I Know they do they do they you know like they have like chemicals and grab you\nYeah mhm yeah and and and you're just gets it in a ... that is very sticky and so you can't get away and they just kind of wrap you up and that and you're gone\nGosh other regions of the country that are more haunted than other regions or is it the same all over the place\nWell good question um it seems to be a you know kind of universally scattered all over the uh the growth certainly ghost stories you know a kind of almost every culture sure I'm a ... that would actually be a good question more ah that places on this road that are more haunted than I\nWould sometimes think the east coast in that region would be more haunted I don't know what I think were Gettysburg is in in things like that that just seems to be more strange haunting going on there\nIn the u._k. for just talking about a very odd that place maybe that's the most on to a place in the world the people see more ... than any other\nThe place maybe that's the most time to place in the world the people see more ... than any other place uh in Scotland there's lots of ghost stories lots of military ghost stories\nComing out of the European civilizations been there for so long these things built up you know but if but now that you asked the question if I could come out of world that's the most part that I Would pick the u._k.\nNext stop we go to Ernie truck driving in Washington first time caller Ernie thanks go ahead\nYeah Hi George either and your gas uh I've got a UFO story that back in Nineteen Seventy two it was August\nI remember I was taking pictures of the moon and I came around the corner and here I thought I saw the movie ... off my ... wrapped and realized the moon was behind me and it was you are oh hanging over our house is covering their ...\nAnd I pulled over I stopped I watched it for about Fifteen minutes I got out of the car forgot all about the camera and the back of the car that on the hood watch this thing it was about Seventy feet across perfect here\nAnd then I heard in my head something go we got to go\nAnd I said to myself something's gonna happen and I climbed back in the car and about that time yeah them down and started moving on the way no nothing and it I could tell it wasn't in the sky because if we hold all the tree line with the trees behind it\nAnd it wasn't a moon [laughter] no I ... I gave case and I got up to a hundred and twenty and it pulled away from me like I was standing still wow well\nSee that's what's so amazing about these stories Mac people are actually witnessing things I mean here's a guy when a hundred and twenty miles an hour to trying to catch this don't do that folks but I mean something's happening right\nRight you know well one person or told me I'm right after we came out with your clothes and a lot of time that\nThat um after nine eleven or the records from military pilots are your thoughts went up in a dramatic way\nAnd not that Europe has had anything to do with nine eleven but the fact was was that they were just more of a military jets\nIn the air round the clock back then to make sure it didn't happen again and therefore more military pilots up their boy UFOs a scene but that just tells me that uh you know these things are there everyone always wants to think that your clothes hide from us but they're not they're around us all the time people see them all\nOn they should do and military pilots are the best you know witnesses to these things\nWhat do you think in these UFOs shutdown missile silos\nWell yeah we did a chapter in that in your personal time that's a fascinating story about the ... the topic for several books on my God it's\nIt's true you know I mean people lots of people witness Europe was going over a nuclear bases in a in the Midwest and she can literally shutting down the targeting systems the power systems to a nuclear deterrent really a serious uh you know breach security but it also happened to the Russians too\nAnd um that's a very strange it was almost like something out there is trying to say we know what these things or do you have to know that we can control them to\nLet's go to Joe in Monterey, California hey Joseph welcome to the program\n[noise] Hi I'm max you you're very interesting man a lot of good work you're doing um have you have so many questions in so many things um have you ever heard of several other areas uh other than the immunity triangle and also I have a friend who used to photograph UFOs\nHis name is uh he goes under the Monica ...

you know of ... ... between the Sunni the Christian and the Shiite populations for domination of the country and the Shiite were always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy eight

of luck\nFred is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as al ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a relative a statement uh before uh Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than\nThan any other group ah I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on\nThe U.S embassies in the hijackings in the air\nIt's from investigating the attacks on\nUS embassies in the hijackings in the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which\nUh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a kind of put some history\nOr does it never been done this was an organization that had\nA literally a snatch to the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild\nA all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing uh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um it it was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred\nUh but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because\nUh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley\nUh we we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us\nExactly where he was so um [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are\nCertainly a um I'll never forget and um but I Know that there was a ... a heck of a lot of us that that certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\nWhen we get into that story I Want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty eight as Well Fred heard what what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to even worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise] Georgia and it's a fair question uh you can only look back on the events of ah nine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers and\nThe plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon or as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region or why we need a footprint uh in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy\nA and a a take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil\nAnd uh that's the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nAll right we're going to talk about William Buckley here and just a moment we're with Fred Burton Samuel Katz their book is called Babe Ruth rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them on what truly is\nA very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized in hopefully Fred didn't Samuel with your book be rules you get more and more exposure to what's happening over there and if you can say I'm In a couple of minutes we have before the break\nGive us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nWell speaking of Hezbollah um the has the forces have been fighting from the onset alongside rainy and special forces to help keep from President off of um regime in power um has ... has been transformed from an underground for\n'em in the Nineteen eighties the period we're afraid of him I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of um the fundamentalist suicide Shiite brand of terrorism and it has emerged and to probably one of the stronger almost conventional armies in the middle east\nUm it is for the United states in Iraq it was um it was absolutely in a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq to fill up there I'm ... I'm strategies and tactics that killed so many American servicemen I mean to the ... launched\nA um horrific war against Israel where I'm laid siege I'm way of indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities um it does involve the narco terrorism because one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm I'm traffickers in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with\nThat we cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has if we were so them operatives in this country\nHas for many years and it is an arm and extension of Iran was um\nA desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important for us national interest\nAll countries or course work through straw parties we worked with Osama bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets on and they're\nGiving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah but why are we getting talk with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions\nWhy don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stopped supplying them we're gonna win ... why don't we do that Sam\nI think that this country has been very apprehensive about engaging Iran militarily\nOr hostages were the is that the U.S embassy in Tehran I'm a many many years ago I think there were numerous um declarations of war by Iran has like in the United states\nThe bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and to see the bombing of marine barracks which was um on the thirty five years ago to this day\nHold on hold on for a second Sam will come back to this point and we'll talk with you and Fred as well about your book be rude rules next on the coast to coast that you\nNever missed a detailed Lewis show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free it goes to ... dot com\nNo I don't think so I think um we haven't gone after Iran militarily because we're not really sure what a direct military conflict with the wrong might bring I think the rabies you of groups like Hezbollah to export terrorism throughout the middle east\nAnd the rest of the world is daunting enough for 'em policy planners in this country\nFor generations it was directly responsible for a lack of response to suicide truck bombing of the embassies\nThe Marines and the kidnapping of\nA theory station chief from things that was unheard of in the world of espionage up until that point and ever since uh William Buckley was the only station she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered in the history of the agency\nFor Britain tell us about William Buckley\n[noise] ah there was a a a true patriot George uh he uh grew up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening to this is not the journalists were talking about\nNo it's not there's actually a funny Side Story due to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years I wrote them and uh our bill thought it was pretty funny in a thought about a cashing them but a\nA bill grow up in the Boston area a seminar are lucky enough to uh get the cooperation of bills or family has a elderly companion or that he lived with for many many years and a sister\nWho just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up ah\nI'm In he went off after high school into the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea\nAs a young kid and um where he was a silver star recipient and are\nAlso a Purple Heart I'm an which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into\nThat when it comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates or gets hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties as it was very murky or as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find a anybody that could tell us specifically what he was up to\nA but regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things when you\nDidn't surprise me because of uh the nature of it as a curiosity and his language is and you know ... to\nTo just I'm a study history and specially military history\nUh so uh in Nineteen sixty or he joins or the U.S army again a and goes into special forces are and um and it's also a associated with the CIA and that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter and recruiter and I'm Bill goes off or\nTo Vietnam and where he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire\nA so that this was a man George that was always running towards danger and uh he he reminds me of the NYPD or cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers up\nYou know you know show known for years they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um and and off the bill uh was uh uh the only guy to raise his hand to volunteer to go to a route or at the CIA\nOr after the devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station is wiped out so uh that was who Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nNow was his assignments bread in Bay roots clandestine war was it pretty well known by people\nWell ah the station chief or um is usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the or the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other intelligence liaison services know that too I have such as the Jordanians the French the Israel and so forth so a bill is not a and a undercover physician during that time period\nSomebody read it on him no doubt\nWell uh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period um it you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meat snitches uh and so forth and so uh you know bill was that kind of person\nAnd I'm In essence a leading his apartment one day a in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a\nMultiple of vehicles are\nAnd Hezbollah grab them and uh they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't he have security around there\n[noise] it's a good question or I can tell you a first hand from that time period it was an unusual for station chiefs and not to have security uh salmon I did our last book on ... uh where you had a whole Qadri a professional\nUh security personnel to specifically watch or CIA officers backs\nAre in that time period are they really didn't exist you could request security you could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but uh you can't really do your job as a as a secret agent to use that phrase\nIt with an entourage so ah the nature of the job in that in that time period was or you were a single time you were kind of like a a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for what about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\nHe was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty\nKnow when he was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and um I was part of the hostage debriefing team where uh we were assigned to at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out to who was a wonderful man I spoke to him and then at the spot and Germany after he had been held in captivity\nAnd and he told his bill had died and that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because um we had devoted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so\nThen it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nMust have been like looking for a needle in the haystack right\nOh my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was not time period um you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then um\nWe we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but\nUm it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a a person in a building or in a\nCherry barracks um and we literally did could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was\nA at one point or the FBI believed that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran a and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut while I'm which I'm\nNot you certainly a smoking gun or as to who was directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam ... let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time jak Anderson wrote an article about William Buckley simply saying\nHe was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but where do you think do jak Anderson's column accurate or not\nI I think if I'm fairly safe to assume that under torture I'm Bill Buckley a revealed information\nI'm a very classified nature as station chief um he was the supervisor he was the um the branch manager of the ... the U.S intelligence apparatus in Lebanon\nSo he knew the names of the other age of he knew the name of their sources and he had all that information I'm In his in his mind because he had to control it on the basis you have to supervise I'm One of the um [noise]\nYou know one of the things that we reveal in the book is shortly after bill was um confirmed that he
