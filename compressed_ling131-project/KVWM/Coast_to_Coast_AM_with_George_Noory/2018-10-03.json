teach 'em to use free markets and a property rights and um a lot of other sorts of things that would help those economies to grow and you know the good news is that\nA those are those are people are growing a we have about a about a I think it's about six hundred million people now that are under nourished across the world\nUh uh that's uh that's about the little less than ten percent of the world's population used to be thirty percent Thirty years ago\nSo are people are are getting more nourishment uh they're getting more food famine has been basically eliminated\nUm it used to be that every decade twenty million people across the world would die from famine that was in the early Nineteen hundreds now every decade it's less than a million people die so we are making a lot of

was actually that\nIs true they are having more earthquakes but it isn't really fracking it is the it's the injection of the wastewater from fracking that is causing those are like well that's what I mean by the Frank\nYeah well you're right indirectly it is but uh they're working other other places where we can inject water all all day it's that's a really a problem to be solved by geologist or they need to tell us where we can safely inject water where we can't and then uh and then will reduce the possibility of quakes\nSure possibility Steve that this entire planet should just have some horrendous catastrophe that something could happen just shattered the planet to\nAbsolutely it could you know I I Hope that never happens and and you know all we can do though with with the things is adapt that's what we\nWhat we do with the storms that we do with the sea level rise we've been doing that for a thousands of years uh there's really no evidence that we can control the climate we can do something locally with temperatures and locally but ... with weather but not on a global scale\nI'm very unlikely that we can control the climate at this point\nHow to British Columbia Canada we go to the first time caller Terri Hi Terry thanks for calling\nFellow man that's a good night to be having this discussion I most appreciate it to say a George ... first then if the court in ages the information age user are the cutting edge and you'd have my total respect thank you Mr Gura them\nI say I am the Lone Ranger [laughter] I have\nLost most of my credibility\nOn the killer researcher but people think I'm Crazy or heated and bringing up these these arguments that you do really means nothing and there's [laughter]\nIt it will warming is a very sexy position\nBecause people feel smart and that if I just you know say my balls or do whatever I'll save the planet and [laughter]\nI'm sure you've heard it before but now a big thing that I Love to bring up in this totally discredited like Mr grown to address the or the Ninety thousand to cargo ships at sea they're pumping [noise]\nSulphur into the air\nThat must have a profound effect on 'em well there is there there\nIs an issue right now I'm cargo ships use fairly high sulfur fuel fairly furry dirty fuel um and I think the uh I Can't remember which organization is but the but the international organization on shipping\nHas actually agreed to go move to some different a lower sulfur fuel types\nAnd a lot of folks in the industry think that is going to be a problem it's probably a good step though so I'm generally in favor of moving to lower so for fuel overtime [noise] um there's a lot of people also talking about cutting greenhouse gases from ships though it primarily carbon dioxide I think that probably is not such a good idea\nBut that is one of those real real pollution problems that need to clean up we also need to do a little ah improve uh the problem was litter of plastic and the oceans that's another issue\nThat we need to work and then learning as Asian was the international maritime organization\nThank you that's [laughter] that's it\nAnd they're they're predicting that the the increase is going to be a huge uh in the next several years by twenty fifty you've no action is taken the increased by up to two hundred and fifty percent that's a big jump the sulfur yeah\n[noise] oh possibly so yeah I I couldn't really comment on that but I think so I think that's probably a good step\nThat's gonna roots in Portland, Oregon Hi Ruth go ahead\n[noise] [noise] Hi how you and your and thank you for telling my blank spaces that I have no control over their hands\n[laughter] okay now I'm very I'm\nBack in ... I think we ought to hit a word um right now and if you give us some have I have a plan they they can make our world more free time\nI like my aunt paying it forward now putting our technology in in in a place where we can\nBring our energy you where it can be free for everybody that would be great and I think they can do it\nAnd that might be here that you are here donate you making our our uh dams and ah\nHe goes to do better and I've done that we're looking at it even even the little people out here like ... and ... is bigger than I Am can pay it forward right now I think that we all can live free I mean without anything\nThat would be great but Steven they're going to want to make money on this some aren't they\nI mean one of the great points that I talk about in the uh the second chapter of outside the green boxes the rise of democracy or the United states basically was the first modern democracy now we have\nUh just about I think it's almost Ninety nations that have a they have a form of democratic government so it's going from zero to Ninety nations\nAnd with that you know we get the benefits of legal equality and freedom of speech religion rule of law limitation of slavery women's suffrage personal property rights a lot of other things so the world is getting freer\nOh that's a very positive thing and it's all part of this idea that everybody is better off there's a lot of people going around saying the world's gonna collapse and we've got over population we've got pollution we've got all these terrible things but people are ...\nSo we've got overpopulation pollution we read all these terrible things but people are healthier lives and and one aspect of that is the rise of democracy\nShe what do we do with people's cars this to me is one of the most heartbreaking situations people who cannot afford electricity or their gas or let's say it's the dead of winter and it's going to get shut off because they can't afford it\nWhat do we do with those kinds of folks I mean it's it's sad\nYeah that's a tough situation actually United States is in better shape than many European places because uh we have very low cost electricity um [noise]\nA crisis here in the United states I often put up a graph comparing Europe almost all the ... the nations in Europe have higher a electricity prices and we have here in the United states we have the lowest cost natural gas in the world\nRight now with the biggest petroleum producer\nBut we should we say though that nobody nobody gets shut off during implement weather or can we say that\nI Am not going to get into that I Do think many of the the uh the utilities have that sort of policy that they're either not allowed to do that by law they have a policy where they're not going to do that during equivalent weather and they tend to postpone things in the summer I think\nHold on Steve we've got a break and come back we'll talk more take final call the next\n... students ... the new version of the coast to

com\nBoom on news talk radio Katie WN and Katie Jay\n\nAnd welcome back our final segment with Stephen Moore I'm Steve when you're out of vents what seems to be the question that most people want answered\nWell there are many um\n[noise] you know I speak a lot to businesses and one of the things I run across as they they tell me you're preaching to the choir [laughter] you know but the funny thing is though they don't realize that the majority of us business thinks that the climate laws and the energy laws are foolish in many ways\nThe headlines are grip by a lot of the big companies like apple and Google and uh the political leaders but but the kind of the rank and file of of American business I'm a little bit different but they don't realize that they're in the majority\nAre so it's a little bit of a strange situation\nUm [noise]\nLet's see what are some of the other major questions why why are all the climate models wrong is is uh something that people come up with and that has to do with some of the assumptions\nUm\nAre they concerned about anything\n[noise] [noise]\nWell they you know back in Nineteen Ninety the United nations in the inner governmental panel on climate change predicted\nThat a temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade\nOr with a mix of five ten so low of two tenths and if you put those on the shirt\nThose rights pretty fast but over the last Thirty years we we are much less than that so we're\nWe're below the estimates for the United nations that they made in Nineteen Ninety we're not seeing the the rice that was forecasted which basically says the assumptions of the climate models are wrong and natural factors dominate global temperatures\nLet's go to Joe in Long Island New York east of the Rockies Hey Joe go ahead\nSteven threats than show uh actually I Want climate change of heart the warmer but the question\nA at a ... a got a quick uh my first question would be a we just had a at a factor in Indonesia unfortunately and they said that they weren't really warned\nThat that was supposed to be a week and that was working with the papal cut up to the library of this thing\nSo I I relate this to a\nTemperatures how well monitored ocean temperatures at the satellites come into play with anything to do with that second question would be\nIt's come into play with anything to do with that a second question what the\nAh the political climate you know ... all I talk about the last couple of weeks twenty four seven as the uh you know Brett Kavanaugh are in his shoes and ... and uh you know it does make me think that the senators\nDon't have time to study science never or the interest and really don't have a good grasp of science maybe they took one course thirty forty fifty years ago and science and never really updated themselves on their own\nUh and uh you know I don't want to pick on trial is already gotten blamed for the recent hurricane or in the Washington Post yeah and uh that my comment would be uh you said the nuclear ... or a industry uh was traditional\nAnd I think it's a like a lot of people are a potential disaster waiting to happen and I know it doesn't contribute to climate a big ... CEO too if you look at Chernobyl\nThat still only buried it's still lack of it's not a bank contained nobody can go within fifty miles from the place all these years later\nSo uh you you take New York for example you got to the point right near them a this big metro area or something ever happen with that then what happens in New York City\nSo you got a whole bunch of things there I think there were three of them one was what are we doing with ocean temperature measurements the uh the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has I think they are the ones who put out these diving\nUm a measuring\nDevices I forget the name of them again but they have thousands of 'em out there now but\nUh they've only been deployed for about a twelve to Fifteen Years so we really only have data on ocean temperatures are from measurements are over the last twelve to Fifteen Years before that it was just you know people take them and ships and kind of measurements are going around and those were very accurate the um\nThe thing you said about uh what's um let's\nSee what the third one was the nuclear plants I think one of the big issues with nuclear plants that they need need to solve is they need to be able to shut down automatically we still have plants and most of the ones around the world that are relying on cooling systems and if the cooling systems fail fail\nLike happened with the Saddam in Japan then we have a chance for a big melt down so that problem needs to be solved um the other big problem with nuclear is is just frankly natural gas is so darn cheap right now nobody will build a nuclear plant and I think the third one was\nUm satellites\nWell you said something about governments and what's your question\nYeah I'm just saying I I think you know ... or ... defeated about five times in the U.S Congress\nI think the majority of the ... arguably more than half of the United states so members of Congress right now do not think global warming is a dangerous problem out most of those around the Republican side of course\nAnd as I mentioned we have we have a we now have a climate revolts if you will in Australia in Ontario so I think I think political leaders are starting to get it uh this has been a disaster crisis for more than Twenty years now and we're really not seeing the disaster so I'm hopefully I've covered most of your issues\nI think the biggest problem we've gone to an ex clear from the sun that could wipe out our power grid in a rigorous useless wherever that\nThat's possible probably a big explosion there again if the if all those ... go off in Antarctica note of big bunch of ... the south of the of the peninsula down there that could be an issue this many many things that could occur\nUm again we need to adapt as well we scan and the biggest one is an ice age boy I like this warm weather folks I Do not want to see the start of the studies that\nWe've got we've got a guess Robert Felix who believes were in the early stage of an ice age birthday\nWho knows Walter in Pennsylvania taken away well go ahead\nBy Georgia needless to say great to talk to you once again George\nThank you Walter George you out\nWith all due respect Mr Gore on sounds a lot like a doctor Kimball ...\nGeorge with all due respect to Mr Gore on I don't think that Dr Paul Ehrlich has been discredited though I think George I think it's just common sense\nThat the human population on this planet cannot increase out in the mind them\nNow George we share this planet with myriad other species are not modernized their culture may have allowed a kid or\nYou know the age in a bank now law of salmon but modern agriculture consumes much natural habitat but in Africa the human population is driving the dollar hit to its sanction just as in this country ah\nYou know we have largely eradicated the great a herd of buffalo bites and mhm\nOh so you know naturally you you could not twenty million up\nThe great fighting sitting hers that used to be twenty million in a hurry you could not ... it would be compatible with the agriculture went up by some horribly wrong rehab law expansion fields of corn and soy beans in week so uh\nYou know I just think it's common sense the human population now cannot increase in allowing them\nWell there comes a point Steve is they're not that you know you can't have a population of twenty billion people on the planet\nNo you can't and and you make good points well but the the the uh predictions are now that we're going to level of about ten and a half billion there is no doubt that we've radically transform the surface of the earth\nOr we are certainly have done that and taking over large portions of it and I think we're sixty million bikes and at one time estimates\nAre those days are gone there are some good news there are some good it was by the way Dr Ehrlich as once said if he was a betting man he predicted that by the year two thousand England with no longer exist because of population growth fees but one of the guys as maybe been wrong or the most time said publicly in history\nThere are some good there are some good news things one is\n[noise]\nHousing disaster on track

person it's like a he said she said\nRight I Believe me the proof\n[noise] yeah I Believe that these people have no ax to grind I heard that story a when a or did it and I'm thinking about it the man was not being paid\nHe could have easily just shut up and walked away\nHe didn't he wasn't trying to sell anything you know [noise] ah he was reporting what had happened and the fact was he like a lot of other people had a certain amount of guilt about it\nOr having seen it they really didn't know what to do with it they knew there was going to possibly be some repercussions and so they buried them or I've had a couple\nOf encounters a where animals had been killed was said to have been killed one of them are was in self defense\nAnd ah this man felt this thing was going to kill him a and\nWhat are you to say about that am I to say you know you're wrong for doing that you should have you shouldn't have done that you shouldn't have pulled the trigger I mean I can only I Can't imagine\nThere and that's a difference than just going out into the wild to look for one to shoot it\nWell that's that's correct you know if he's like I could uh well I don't know let me let you continue I have so many things Erica chip\nWe will do that in we've got a break coming up in a couple of minutes or ...\nOr like I said I have some people are\nWho have seen bodies a couple of guys say they've shot them and as far as bugs are concerned I thought he knew his firearms I thought he knew his uh bullets\nUh it didn't seem it seemed very real to me and there's a lot of people uh down south uh ended his neck of the woods\nThat do go out on the night haunts ah I have a couple of uh accounts what guys were out hog hunting feral hogs\nAre which is becoming a big problem down you know it's huge it's right\nAnd uh there are people actually being hired out now by a\nPharmacist and landowners a because different view of the children are getting attacked by these boards and whatnot\nThat a hiring people to go on their property they go out at night they have lights they're riding around some of them have electric basically golf cart so they could ride around rather a stove fully\nAnd they're you know trying to gain an upper hand on some of these I personally I think there shoveling against the tide but um [noise] people feel like they have a need to try to take some of these animals down\nA thankfully as they're doing it the meat is going to you know food kitchens and whatnot but it's a it's a real problem I had a\n... year ago\nFrom an individual who was fishing and he caught two trials and he said as soon as he kind of realize what was going on he saw a big flood looking at him about eight feet away\nAnd he said he's holding the two Trump the guy is in the big foot\nLooks at him and he went oh my God what am I going to do so in a panic he handed the to travel to the big foot in the big foot took them looked at them and gave one back now does that sound real to you or do you think the guy cold and made it up\nWell I'll be honest with you a that is most one of the most unreal stories\n[laughter] or if I heard that I Would have discounted it are entirely however having said that I had\n[noise] uh entirely however having said that I had a gentleman that was a new wing in Vermont and he had taken a lake in to a creek\nLet's hold on to that story while you were going to take a break we'll come back and talk about that I've always had suspects about that a fishing story but uh let's get yours when we come back\nGoes to insiders the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for iPhone in now Android for ... listen live we're on demand anywhere any time go to coast to coast am dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n\n\n\n\nOn news talk radio TV WN and Katie Jay\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast we're here with William ... author of big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe when a\nBreak on is yes yes oh well this gentleman was or canoeing in a creek\nAre up in Vermont and really he was poured urging stomping when he came across some nice holes that he felt he could get some good trout and and uh he was lining up some trout on Iraq near him as he was catching them he was camping undecided the creek and his plan of course\nBeing the cook 'em up for dinner so he had caught a few brook trout late I'm On a rock and when he turned over the Trump were gone now his first instinct\nWas that a raccoon took more raccoons took them and I've actually had this happen to me fishing connect quiet river or wherever I heard a little ruffling the bushes and I turned my head and a rainbow ahead laying up on the side of the river [noise]\nAh I see a raccoon stick it in ... left and right grabbed it and went back into the grass so I Know this happens and that's what he thought\nSo\nA little later on he was putting more fish up there when he saw a long arm extend out at all most ground level\nAnd the huge hand grasp the pile of fish and not just one fish in one school grabbed numerous fish and retract it back into the weeds\nAnd that when he thought that it was game over because he knew this was something in the woods that he hadn't bargain for and the problem was that where it had reached out at ground level his tent would shut up about fifty feet away from them\nSo shortly thereafter that he\nGot the guts to go over there and repack up his tent and started to make its way out with the canoe\nBut he had said that he thought it was a big foot obviously what else has a long hair rearm in a big hand grenades and the bushes and then he also realize that this thing had to have been calling on its belly\nThose words will be sneaking along kind of like a soldier trying to sneak up\nIn Ninety company somebody and was able to know that he was fishing saw him fishing sure when he was doing by placing these fish on the rock and then had positioned itself\nOr in such a way where it could get up there to get the fish and recreate back into the woods without being seen but according to him when he saw the first group of fish missing he was actually hitting on a rock smoking is pipe\nAnd he had his peripheral vision looking out towards the rock now now being mindful he wanted to catch the raccoons and the act [laughter] what he caught with not a raccoon at all and uh he was pretty it was pretty frightened off by that\nAnd and tell us with these reports hotter people describes the creature in terms of height neuro big but how big\nYeah well it it really varies I Would say a minimum you're talking a seven feet tall a and I\nHad a ... point he had\nA a lot of people say the comical shape Ted did varieties of a a hair for coloration ranging from like salt and pepper\nTo a a lot of people use the term or burn or read [noise] uh and then of course\nUse the term or burn or read a and then of course brown and black so there seems to be a variety and then we have two different basically physique or a theme that you either have these kind of almost cylinder fickle body very burly\nA beer like for lack of a better term and then there's the other one that appears again and again and it's described as being like a weightlifter or a ... you know Arnold Schwarzenegger or to the nth degree type of body extremely muscular\nOr the chest you know Bolger thighs you know just like a a real monster\nSo these these are the things that people are seeing and it it just varies a I had one I'm\nA\nOne story called decreased and an incident I named it where this fellow claimed that his trees stand who is twenty five feet in the tree which put his feet at something like twenty feet and\nThis sasquatch and a group of voters size watches it seemed that the group was distracting him making our own noises in the woods while he was bow hunting\nAnd he couldn't see because of the density of the trees and the fog that was laying in this valley in the early morning\nBut he had said he recognized as a hunter that these our noises when not real in other words they were being mimicked\nAnd that he was kind of paying attention to this and sorting out the pieces a sasquatch snuck up on him from the rear and gently grab the heel of his book [laughter]\nThink about how big this thing had to be even if he was wrong and his measurement\nNobody's hits the tri stand ten feet off the ground I mean he said twenty five feet so what if he was at twenty feet and its feet or ... I don't know Seventeen something had to have tremendous height and reach\nBut the amazing thing about that story was\nThe way he said that the creature gently grabbed his book and he jumped to the point where he almost fell out of the stand and when he looked down this thing was looking up at him\nAnd he commented how he almost or what that is just wanted him to know that it could do that that they could sneak up on him and grabbed his blue\nAnd then it left the scene and everything went quiet again\nGeez now in the navy your book big food ... in the woods tell us about the terror portion what what's going on out there\nWell I mean first of all when we talk about terra or when we used the word bizarre uh in regards to big foot I ... I take the stand as to what is more terrifying\nIs it ... is it not enough terrifying to see a ten foot tall monster walking across the shoulder road or is it more terrifying to have one flanked you in the woods or when you're hiking with your girlfriend\nThese things are out there they're frightening people are a lot of\nThe encounters or somewhat casual wear this scene from afar and then the people exit hastily but then there's other ... encounters where it's my opinion these things don't want the people to be where they are\nAnd they seem to exhibit behavior that in my opinion the chasing the people out\nThey want to monitor region for somebody they\nDon't want them there and I think if you push the envelope\nOr you're going to be in the sorry state of affairs or when you talk about this gentleman that said he had to fish and the the big ... walked over and he gave him to him [laughter] he gave them one by telling you right now George\nThat big foot if I see that big foot I'm going to get wheels like pop up on a Kansas huh [laughter] yeah we're going to speed up the film real and my legs are going to be turning like the wheels on a car running out of the\nWilliam does does anybody ever report Bebe big Flint\nI have a\nI Do have an account or this is very interesting another fisherman and here's the thing George\nI Believe that\nAside from the accidental sightings which there are numerous ones the vast majority of these sightings of being had by people who are out there doing things that your normal person when they say normal I don't mean like the abnormal normal but\nThey do when things are involved in things that the average person does not do their hunters that fishermen there in remote areas uh the loners they're people who are getting out and going into places for peace of mind to exercise whatever the case may\nBe and in so doing they enter into this realm where these creatures seemed to be a now getting but he doesn't but we were just talking about just said\nWhen were you were talking about these creatures but do people talk about ... Oh yes yes I'm\nSorry a so this gentleman was at a small little water for when the river a I Believe it was mean and\n\n[noise]\nYes the report on judge Kavanaugh maybe you're done today\nJak ally and Fox News source close to it sells Fox News supplemental FBI background check at the Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh can be wrapped up by the close of business today potentially leading to a confirmation votes go over the weekend that hinges on three swing Republican votes possibly some moderate Democrat\nI kept a Democrat is on the side and North Dakota now Charles her Republican opponent like ten points by the conservative Judicial Crisis network route fifty six percent of North Dakota's ...

I don't even know what to say about that you know and yet\nThis is something that was passed on\nYou talked about would knocking that the people are hearing what's going on with that what's that some of them well\nYou know this is one of the things that we we see on the television or relative to a big foot people running around knocking on trees with bats and sticks\nUh they apparently believes that this is some type of communication uh between big foot you knock knock backward the signaling each other in the woods but this is really odd this account came to me and to me if you believe this\nIt really disapproves of the board not because according to this couple a this guy's name was ... he was a a semi pro landscape photographer [noise]\nUh and he and his wife were in an area called lower Crabtree meadows in twenty Seventeen July so this was fairly recent\nThe two of them were walking into this area to take some panoramic pictures now some of this guy's pictures are actually on line for sale so he says uh so he he also commented that I don't know when somebody is touted to be a professional\nBut he had been doing it for twenty five years and never considered himself to be a professional at\nAny rate there in this valley taking pictures and there was nothing in the valley they hadn't seen any animals and then know el ... there was nothing around and they heard a loud knock and many through the valley\nSo he's got his cameras set up in the tripod the wife has a pair of binoculars and she starts scanning around and ... has been I see something pacing around over there on the hillside\nAnd he says what do you mean you see something pacing she says I see something there's something on two legs over their pacing around on the hillside too early\nTo legs so he swings this time around using a telephoto lens\nHe's trying to look through there she's got it now he sees it and he says even though it was so small in his lens at the distance he was looking\nHe knew it was a big foot there was nothing else around there and he says he described it as looking like a nervous man waiting for a bus this thing was just like pacing back and forth swinging it's arms up in the uh uh\nThis thing was just like pacing back and forth swinging it's arms up in the uh uh like you said the nervous man waiting for a bus\nSeem very alert to\nYeah well ah so then they're watching this thing it stand still raises its head up into the air like a Halloween wolf\nPuts his hands by it so I just like you were I Would do ... patrol voice forward and then they hit\nThe knock you know what I I Can't even do it but you know like if you click you told me get through the mouth [noise]\nYou've got at George was like only like you know a ...\nSo he said it wasn't the knock at all\nBut it was more vocalization that the creature was able to do somehow with the its throat it's Tong its mouth who knows you can ask him questions but he said it was not a knock at all\nSo then that was really interesting that somebody had caught such a thing you don't\nUse it in your opinion is it is ... ...\n[noise] I don't know George I you know amplify aren't you yeah it's it's its own thing you know\nIt's all you know like in in a blue walk on Ford's very rarely will and he walked just standing up right it uses its arms and it's not colds yeah on a move along as a chimpanzee does to this seems to stand up right all the time\nOr not so really yeah uh I mean people have encountered them\nUh hitting all fours\nIt would look like a beer to me to do that\n[noise] yeah but a little different or I'll give you this is this is really a strange encounter a this was called the balloon is citing the balloons citing this guy had been given a gift certificate by his new wife for his birthday for balloon rides\nHe always wanted one I got\nA he was afraid of heights and his wife didn't know it [laughter]\nSo the fact that they came one day when a to meet up with this balloon is out in the field and ah he was scared out of his wits but he fought through it and they went for a ride and if the guy\nOr to try to keep the balloon as low as possible and the guy kind of weight to them and said you let me know when you get really comfortable and he said there were about five hundred feet drifting over this farmland and more land\nBut here's what happens which is really a unusual they got to a point in their flight there were other people in the ... with them by the way a it was like just him and his wife to probably five or six people in their [noise]\nThey got to a point where the pilot or the balloon lowered the balloon over a wooded area so that the gun ... was scraping the branches\nAnd they came down and did that and everybody was cheering and everything you know trying to grab belief off the tree and all of this\nThen he'd lifted it back up again\nAs they made it across the next field he did it once again he lowered it down and they just moving slowly along scraping the tree up and they all started cheering now he said you'd think they won the lottery the way the people who are carrying on and it's gone Dover but\nHere in with a big foot comes in when they're scraping over the second series of trees that was bordering a field\nBusting out at the tree line as the balloon is guided along gliding along comes this big foot he starts out walking quickly looking over his shoulder and the guy said I Swear he was looking directly at me\nEverybody said look at that and one lady snapped a picture of the thing\nThat kept quiet and you can't control the balloon this fellow said that after\nThis thing think took several you know very long and fast strides walking it hit the deck on all fours and took off he said it looked like a racehorse at the Belmont\nRace you see that's unusual isn't it\n[noise] well I I mean you know I've heard of this I I have a story in one of the books that cold along came a spider\nWhere these guys were hog hunting so here we go back I told you had some accounts of a federal all on the on\nThese guys were harmed counting\nAnd they were sitting in a field or coming up on dusk waiting for the ... to come down out of the trees that were already some out in the field they were in the tall grass and the grass was sporadically patch and all the words that were clear areas and areas of high glass of grass\nWorking away around this field they saw what he described as a furry army helmet\nSticking above the grass that's what they were looking at all these shows like the dome of black for they were watching this thing moving through the grass\nIn spurts similar to like a spider wanted most quickly and stops moving quickly and stopped\nFinally they catch this thing crossing in opening between two patches and it's heading towards the hearts that they were looking at which was still far away\nWhen this thing came into the opening he said it looked like a ten or twelve foot long spider on four legs with the head sticking up what they saw was the head\nIt's scurried into the bushes or the or the grass and the other side making its way towards the hearts\nAnd as they were watching this thing it go up and one that stood up they knew it was a big foot and this thing made a lunging leap like Superman dive onto one of the harms\nSome type of quick movement on the ground and left the field\nWith the hog under its all of them was our story William are going to come back and take promise phone calls next on coast to coast they\nOne of the perks of being a ...

you're a Kindle user or feel like a a paperback book which I kind of faith and myself I like to feel the pages and touched\nThe ... old school but nothing wrong with that yup yup\nLet's go to Chicago Robert's with us to get things started hey Robert go ahead sir\nThank you George George with you hear me okay on him you know we can thank\nYou two questions first of all have you ever seen or Ford or to or because they were tortured and killed him and so rainy and around a little clues shattering the micro there's this thing really looks like the real McCoy\nThis was in Pennsylvania now in a circle Eighteen Seventy they're holding this one big caught up in the other big what they have them and\nAnd the second question I Am as you mentioned that your little some men at\n... at a big what happened after the break ... why would you go down like I mean they should have what kind of weapons that they are well\nHere's an answer your first question no I'm unfamiliar with the uh two big foot in Pennsylvania\nUh but I have a number of historical accounts one of them was quite an interesting uh that came from a photograph taken from a a a grandparents' house after the final grandparents had died\nIn which was depicted a work camp in Virginia at the time [noise] uh that was set up a after Roosevelt had established a uh the protection of the parks [noise]\nAh they they needed to start making ... an access to these parks and structures so people could go in there and stay in a bathroom facilities and rangers stations so they had assembled this civilian core of workers\nAnd these guys were in there basically roughing it in the wilderness in these newly protected uh a wooded areas that were to become a national parks and they were regularly having encounters with what they called the hairy men\nAre in fact in the one in ... account in a one of my books called the hairy men one of the things came into the camp and tried dragging on the demand off of is caught\nAny older men attacked it throwing a hand axes and grabbing guns shooting at that thing as it ran a out of their uh encampment now but the odd thing is about these things\n[noise] it seemed that shocked gun fire\nHas almost no effect on them are in fact in one account called the pheasant hunters this guy hit this thing at twenty twenty five yards with both barrels of a seven and a half lead shot and he said the thing didn't even flinch and kept running through a briar patch\nOr in answer to your second question\nAbout a big what's being shot\nOr in my account called the bullet this guy was hunting and uh I think was Idaho\nAt any rate he came to an area where in the woods where he was confronted with a mountain ridge line on three sides in front of him and he ran across what he described as a quanta taught me that stick\nHe said this thing did not randomly form there in fact there was nothing about this pine forest at lent itself\nTo having this quantity of sticks and branch bows or bows and branches for getting this type of thing any inside had about a two foot deep a layer of branches ... as well for me what he thought was like betting so his initial thought was that\nHunters had built this thing as like a shelter when they were out there but that was soon change on this bridge line that he had initially seen coming into the place he was now seeing a dark figure standing in\nComing into the place he was now seeing a dark figure standing at the rich which started to charge in his direction down the hill now he estimated that this rich line was about a Fifteen hundred feet\nOr above the valley that he was standing in and he said that the rate that this thing was running down the hill was impossible for a man to do when this thing broke to the base of the rich\nHe estimated now that it was about six to nine hundred yards away from his position and at the time he was a hunting with a vintage Korean War vintage am one car being\nAs it got closer he level the fight on it and pumped around over its head thinking he was scary it kept running he described this thing as looking like the cop in the Terminator movie\nOne that that the cyborg or whatever the heck they called it the Terminator robot was a posing as the police officer\nAnd how he was running relentlessly with the arms pumping and like nothing could stop them\nEven load is gone fired a second round added he was ... it it had no effect on them and they kept running\nHe fired a third and fourth round and if things kept coming at him now was closing in he squeeze the trigger on the fifth bullet which is why it named a story the bullet and it finally drop\nAnd when he walked up on it he's got closer we shot it with another round he got even closer to he realized the thing was was not moving in that it was gone\nAnd he left it where it was now here's the thing George first of all this\nGuy shoot this thing is self defense he's in imminent danger right a ... things coming at him like a bad idea how he's shooting at this thing and the bullets seem to be having having no effect on them and yet when he saw it lying on the ground he conceded that had been willing to do was multiple blood\nPatches where these bullets had actually hit it\nBut why these things can go now we all know if you go hunting\nIf you don't have a movie show or in Al Gore deer if you don't get a good long shot heart shot some type of solid organs shot\nThese things can run and hunters to lose their a quarry not being able to find it because they can go for miles or you know they could just disappear on you if you don't get a good shot\nBut these creatures\nIt seems like to me if you are going to take one of these things down it's got to be a head shot it's got to be in the neck or the ... or something\nBut sadly then you have to take them down well I mean what are you going to do George\nRhino R. by the way I looked at the picture of that Eighteen seventies syriza Bigfoot\nOr they didn't have photo shop in those days you very very intriguing picture\nThey got a couple of these are old hunters which the ... uh they're holding him up or he's obviously did buddy huge huge huge huge I mean you just Google\nEighteen Seventy big shot in Pennsylvania in the pictures will pop up\nAmazing take a look at that\nAnd I I have a diary accounts\nOr I called the hunters diary it's it's no longer than a handwritten letter that you would write\nTo your wife and in there they're not talking about big foot or anything this isn't a a brief account of a guy and uh his two friends that went up to Canada and on\nAnd he describes in detail the weapons they were using the bullets what they encountered what they didn't and about midway and the letter\nHe describes how his friend and the guy became a laughing stock of the camp having reported that during the hunt a during the days hot they encountered a hair every man running through the woods\n\nCamera crew to end today jak Fox News

energy economics his book outside the green box\nIs in my hand right now Steve welcome to the program good to have you with us\nOh very good night to George and great to join you\nI was just mentioning climate week with just wrapped up in New York well\nWhat do they do anyway\nWell they they had a lot of people there are a lot of dignitaries or their goals from the website where that they were run it to a race ambition reduced climate change and accelerate climate action\nUh some big notable Tony Blair form of a prime minister of England spoke bonk he moved from the United nations um actor Hugh Jackman\nUh-huh ... the ... man\nThe Wolverine spoken a so quite a quite a bit group also a big public relations steely claim a five hundred thirty five million people were reached in three hundred and news articles written\nSo a a kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would er and and a lot of folks there I think believe that if they change light bulbs they can save polar bears\n... if we all drive electric cars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build a wind turbine towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe and George we live in a in a modern age of superstition or there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo there are definitely man made global warming proponents aren't they they are well I have never been a fan of that because you know I think one Steven I think you agree were polluting the planet there's no question about that and we need to fix that\nIsrael pollution went into fix that's\nCorrect but I don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think we're in solar cycles a I think this this planet or has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbons in the atmosphere and anything like that\nThere are at least for periods of the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist eight thousand years ago and we've been gently cooling since then although temperatures go up and they go down\nAnd ah you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were ah many people are conflicting with a coal real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment\nThings that carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide so for a day I'm the mercury particulates with carbon dioxide which is a odorless harmless invisible gas\nAnd what I speak to groups I like to say to him what the cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that there are so many proponents for man made climate change\nWell it it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress and\nInstead of NASA came and testified before Congress and they it was on a very hot summer day and he said he was Ninety nine percent sure that the earth was warming in humans were causing as he was a computer model or\nAnd within a year and a half the United nations form Intergovernmental Panel on climate change and just three years later we had forty one nations and the European Community signed a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases\nSo in my opinion the the first thing is that the world kind of jumped to a conclusion quickly on this\nBut uh you know for the last uh Thirty years or so the computer models have been predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it the temperatures have warmed just a little storms are stronger the polar bears doing fine\nAnd then the second factor though is I think a much of this is being driven forward by momentum by money\nMhm uh we have a\nWind and solar and biofuel industries we have dean says sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability corporations\nAnd there are over there is over two hundred fifty billion dollars a year spent every year on renewables to try and stop the planet from warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second there's there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nAmazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days they've been talking about fears of one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nWell you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee a governor of Washington state\nJust to post an article on CNN quote hottest show Trump you care about climate change and he's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer and that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well we've had that one degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years\nOne degree ... yet and I think it came from the sun well like you know to\nBut that come straight from the climate research unit at East Anglia in England the the number one authority on this one degree so so in the last decade maybe we've had attempt of degree in ... in Washington for a son to say that all these forest fires are caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work um the way we take care of our forests are for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous miss allocation of resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved\nToday eighty percent of the world's wastewater is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago and Brazil the swimmers didn't want to swimming in the water\n'em and they're just building the first water treatment plants down in Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nA a electricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease yet we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming and the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun\nIt's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things you're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that the you know the the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change keep ... heads\nBut I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to feel the way you do that we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\n[noise] well if you again if you look at ... at any of the well any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about uh\nUm what was Hurricane Florence ...\nAnd last year we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas\nAh we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida\nBut if you look back at history this has happened before\nWe've had a twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states these are this is really nothing new a hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century\nOther ... and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see that's storms are either getting more frequent are stronger\nOr the U.S government also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more floods are more droughts we had more droughts in the Nineteen thirties we have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never showed data comparing the past to the president\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book outside the green box Steve ... linked up the coast to coast am dot com spell it for you first name Steve G. O. R. E. each am dot com ... ...\n... the new version of the ... a a map is now available ... in now enjoyed ... ... on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded to the [noise]\nBecause businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they're forced to do many things\nAh that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse\nA which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction uh and the fourth is a resource depletion those for fears are really at the basis of all of a our state and federal\nLaws about energy 'em and they're taught in universities and taught in a high schools but if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been exaggerated to a very very big extent so\nI discuss the Fort horsemen and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries\nOr energy materials agriculture or et cetera but it's fun to read it say a colored paper back and\nGot a lot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also but uh uh eight hundred notes in the back so people can go deeper why the wait for its size it's a heavy blocked\n[laughter] well I don't know about that but in lots of reasons for going to put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which kinda summarizes some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\n... which climate change with what's happening I'm a I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you know\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago amazed that\nCould be temporary because Saudi Arabia's ... talking about turning out a lot of ... additional oil production but uh we're growing very fast the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse [noise] and ah yeah we're the biggest producer of crude now\nNow I Believe in Thomas schools theory of abiotic oil that the planet is got in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs in plants\nI tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time but we know natural gas can be created by all sorts of things including a you\nKnow camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I saw I think there's probably a combination of of some that his fossilized fuel but others others that do come up from the ... of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase fossil fuels I like to use the commercial hydrocarbons instead\n... well you know one of my simple theories on why the ... theory is the probable theory is because most of the oil that is pumped on this planet it's way way down there oh yeah hot in Lansing dead animals get down there\nThey're finding now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah some of these very deep wells they find oil and you got to kind of wonder the other thing is a lot of it has been you know found in the polar regions too and and uh those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but\nI Know we have shipped shifting to the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I I Do think it's a\nIt probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the bowels of the earth what\nIs the argument about overpopulation and then it's a major problem for all of us yeah so\nNineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world in up in until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy ... the big reason for that was we had declining um infant mortality had declining death rates as we solve all these disease problems\nAnd so a bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties\nBut they didn't uh first we had a global agricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled up by a two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output\nBut the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping the fertility rate the number of of ah children a woman will have in her lifetime and back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average is having five children during her lifetime well today that has dropped down to two and a half\nThat said dropped in half and the reason\nIs we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological a sort of a state we have more women entering the worst workforce there waiting to have children they're having smaller families\nSo all none of this was for seen it all occurred and the great news is that uh we're probably going to get the global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years and so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nAnd the benefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles for the red cross and or feeling you can't fly in a as we were driving to get to the venue I saw things that I haven't seen in years you know because I spend a lot of time in St Louis\nI saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in June ... strewn all over the place\nWhere his dad was in ... in Los Angeles yeah I mean I'm looking at is homeless\nPeople in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so it really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call waste dumps everywhere or pollution\nUh it certainly is that it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah\nUh it certainly is that it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though that if I might if I might comment the government to California keeps making housing more expensive you know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand they're they're gonna want everything to have a electric car plug in\nSo he just had about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California does isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right what would you recommend that people start doing personally to combat this situation where\n... people and businesses or you know actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going in the land fills a vet piqued about Nineteen Ninety in the United states and then as now starting to trend down\nWe're doing more recycling um but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we've touched on before um nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide particulates et cetera are not carbon dioxide\nUm so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide is what they're pumping into greenhouses and California to make their cannabis crop grow\nA bigger and faster its its plant food\nAnd it's right or the idea that ah that C. O. two as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these pictures that where you have this dirty looking air over China\nIf you can see the air that's not causing global warming\nAll of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gas is number one is water vapor that's the biggest greenhouse gas to his carbon dioxide three has nothing those are all invisible\nSo if you can if you can see the air you got to clean that up but the greenhouse gases are are really not causing air pollution or so we need we need to get our our uh aimed at the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nSteve you talked about in upheaval coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of upheaval is this\nYeah well we've had a basically a rate payer revolts now in Australia just this last summer in Australia um\nWe had a a Scott Morris and take over as the uh the new uh ...\nMinister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out and leading the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is called for withdraw from the Paris accords\nUm the prime minister Morrison says is number one priority is to reduce power prices while we keep the lights on wait a similar thing up in Ontario by the way both Australia and Ontario electric rates have gone through the roof more than doubled over the last ten years\nUp in Ontario a premier Doug Fort took over and within a month he had cancelled more than a hundred wind and solar a contracts they eliminated um uh for the fourteen thousand dollar Canadian electric car credit\nAnd now we have five provinces opposing the Canadian carbon tax that California has said so we got to rate of pay revolts going on California says they want to be a hundred percent renewable from the power plants are electricity rates right out there right now are are fifty percent\nGreater than any other western state in the in the forty eight states fifty per cent fifty percent\nNobody you guys are fifty percent higher than any other state and um it's going to go much much higher deep deep carbon is Asian many studies have shown is going to increase the rates double or triple so I'm predicting within the next ten years of rate payer revolt California as well [noise]\n\nIn from folks Brett Kavanaugh's accuser name Anthony Fox news\nI don't remember I don't remember I don't remember how many how is it
