I don't know what the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally you'll read the headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system [noise]\nUsually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize if it were really coming it would be so bright\nThat you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go look and see it coming you wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping it secret\nAnd you would have been visible to every backyard astronomer with the whole scope for the past decade and it would have been visible every professional astronomer for the past fifty years if all of these people are in on the conspiracy I don't know anywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nSomething ten times the mass of our our\nMost of the world is something ten times the mass of our earth where even out past Pluto out in the ... rebelled what would be the obvious observation all changes perturbation in our solar shift\nIn the inner part of our soldiers would be an apartment in the planets that we know of but it has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets and you can figure out why it's ten\nWe actually think more like seven o seven times the mass of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun and the earth is\nJupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is so Jupiter has a tremendous effect on the planet to the solar system and nobody sits around in his worried the Jupiter suddenly going to come destroy us\nPlanet nine is really far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter's so its effect is really minimal one effect that it does have is that over four billion years it is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planets but even that it's just a very very minor effect\nIf you're going to Hawaii in November and maybe you'll be successful this time would it be possible to talk with you in December about what you might find or you have to wait to do papers for\nJust the way the process works is we'll go there in November will collect the data it'll take us several weeks to months to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so\nIf we have found what we're looking for we will know within a month or two of collecting those data and then to that point will announce existence as soon as we can confirm it we will have found it will go back to the telescope and double checked that it's really there\nAnd then we'll melted existence right of ways we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] so January twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nI'm always very optimistic Constantine fatigue and my partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it'll take us another ten years I think it'll take us one year so maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\nThat gray habit Oregon right from the man who discovered the\nUh in terms of the ... of those half a dozen bodies that are all kind of gather together out where the hype about in a cloud in that area and I think one of the most important part of doing the research\nProject with these scientists is that I have no confusion about the fact that if there was something that\nThat was trying to move in to our solar system what it's called the inner solar system\nFrom a mercury the thought and mercury out to wear a now Neptune and urine is our biggest Pluto or been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hype about\nThat there's nothing they could be out coming this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity that that's the thing about gravity in that\nIt it would have impact on every single thing and so\nThat's the way I would've loved those Zacharias itching to have been alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if you would have been able to convince him about that new bureau\nWell I don't know how much time left but I can start my own work that I had a discussion a face to face eye to eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do it said that for conversations that lend it because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting that even if\nHe doesn't agree in some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff well\nThe idea that there could be a map planted but when you read like say about the ana knocking through scholar and the translation that we're a cart and dime and you look at the carving\nOne thing that always is confusing to me talking about Trump planet but in the can of worms or eleven

eight hundred sixty three forty five forty six\nOn news radio Katie WN Katie\n\nAnd won't go back to the coast to coast George knowing what you were back with ... and how we story next we'll deal with climate change Linda\nYeah you know I was Thirty years ago and Nineteen eighty eight when the world with really kind of waking up seriously for the first time to global climate change\nAnd real potential dire consequences in the future if we didn't get on top of the expanding methane and carbon dioxide blankets around the earth\nAnd at the United nations many countries especially those worried about being islands and which sea level rise could flood and displaced populations\nThey came together to form the inter governmental panel on climate change also known as the eye PCC and the objective was to provide data about earth changes on an ongoing basis\nTo help project some of these impacts on world politics and the economy\nBy twenty Fifteen only three years ago and the Paris Agreement on climate change\nMany small island nation were so worried about disappearing under ... rising sea levels that the I PCC committed they're doing a twenty Eighteen report written by Ninety One scientists from forty countries\nThe question was should humans to restrict global warming two degrees Celsius or one point five degrees Celsius below pre industrial levels the October twenty Eighteen IPC the answer is\nStricter one point five degrees Celsius equal to a to point seven degrees Fahrenheit should be the new target to achieve and hold in place by twenty thirty that's only a decade from now it's right because if we don't\nIf I plan it continues to warm up above that limit of one point five degrees Celsius\nScientists warn that would be a catastrophe math guy off they will accelerate and the coral reefs\nAnd if they die that kills off other marine species dependent upon the coral weather will become more violent and wins flooding rains and devastating wildfires weather extremes will cause famine and fighting over land food and fresh water\nAnd sea level rise will force more and more Ireland the coasts populations to move back to where the twenty Eighteen IPC report that the next ten years\nBetween now and twenty thirty are crucial and in order to keep the one point five degrees Celsius limit nations must cut greenhouse gas emissions\nBy almost half of what they were in twenty ten\nSolar wind and other renewable energy sources must replace as much as sixty seven percent of today's electricity coal it as an industry around the world it must be phased out the coordinating lead author of the IPC the report says quote\nThis kind of a head in the sand mentality that has taken ... now in Washington\nWhich seems to pretend that this climate change threat does not exist but this was widely knowledge in the defense community meaning the Pentagon as recently as three years ago in twenty Fifteen ...\nHe is professor ... del ... professor of earth sciences in the earth and sciences division at Duke University and he joins us now from Durham North Carolina\nCould you please give me the top five places in the United states where water is coming in and flooding is already making people move\nI Would say those are Florida Alaska and around the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia and Louisiana so those would probably be the talk of the United states\nAnd where it would be the five top nations in the world that are now Ireland and other places that are most impacted by the level right\nAround the world unfortunately all too many very low lying countries and that's a large part of why we have this new report says countries wanted the United nations to investigate a lower warming target thinking that\nTwo degrees was probably not sufficient to protect them those are most of the islands in the south Pacific also mold is can the Indian Ocean many Caribbean countries\nAnd then there are very low like countries like Bangladesh where the bulk of the population lives very close to sea level Nigeria has huge population Heath Ledger she level but you know sodas most of the world in the United states also has enormous populations right at the coast\nAnd where in Alaska\nIn Alaska you have an interesting problem where it's it's one of the nation rising sea levels and melt the ice and the ice protected the shorelines from the waves from the ocean\nAnd without the ice the waiters can reach the shore more easily and the waves are higher because of rising sea levels and so a lot of coastal communities along the west coast and the very straight area many of them are already having to be evacuated and move fire cramped\nSo it's not so much the north slope of this house the west coast\nAnd who is paying for that\nI Believe that the combination of federal and state governments\nAlready moving people in Alaska from flooding to higher ground yeah\nAnd he is that happening in Louisiana Florida North Carolina as well\nThere's not been so much evacuation of the coast there's been more what\nUsed to be rare flooding events now becoming quite common\nSo I think that there is likely to have to be evacuation in the next couple decades of at least some places there's an island in the peak for example between Maryland and Virginia more than half of it it was already going to\nHave you seen the water come up through the drains skin to Charleston South Carolina and Virginia where nuisance flooding there was very rare it's become so commonplace that governments had to put a marker so that motorist can see how deep the flooding is is so routine and Florida has been some of the worst\nFlooding of streets in the southeast\nThe team in Florida it's been some of the worst flooding of streets in the southeast part of the\nHas become fairly routine as he level rise as continued and we've seen an acceleration because both the Greenland\nAnd Antarctica ice sheets are melting more rapidly than was expected just a decade ago and dumping more water into the ocean unfortunately what we've been seeing over the past several decades since we started to generate these projections from the computer models\nAnd then watch the model has often been to conservatives and things are happening faster than the models project\nCan you give an example of what has been dramatic compared to the computer model\nOne thing was the boss of sea ice in the Arctic it went like two or three times faster than the models projected\nYes the Arctic has melted two to three times faster than the computer's projected already by twenty Eighteen is that a harbinger of the fact that it's likely the warming and melting ice will keep increasing faster like what happened in the Arctic\nWell we've been observing from satellites that melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating so that is definitely a worry\nIs extremely challenging problem to figure out exactly how this massive she might become destabilized based on say melting from the top with water slipping down through cracks in the ice sheet and lubricating the bit below\nYou know when we worry because the warming has been so fast in the Arctic that the acceleration will continue\nAnd we're speaking in October of twenty Eighteen what would you project we will be seeing more dramatic weather events between twenty Eighteen and twenty thirty\nLess rainfall in the west increasing water scarcity greater probability is out greater likelihood of high fire conditions and receive flooding in the east as you get more extreme heavy rainfall events and the more heat waves everywhere around the country\nAnd will even the sheet extremes going up in metropolitan areas around the country so things like Chicago in the Nineteen nineties having a severe heat wave that killed thousands of people\nThat kind of thing that would have been you know maybe every fifty years or so that will start to become more and more frequent and it'll begin to happen maybe if a decade or so where places like Phoenix\nWill still hit the extreme heat for Phoenix\nPretty direct cowboy and Fox News coverage of troops get their orders to deploy

provoked by that\nThat seemed to overlay the appearance of whatever the white uh we'll call it ... smokers smoky fog that is here to my office twice\nThat led to my asking for a whether people had had these kinds of foggy white stuff\nAnd that led to Charles hazard and other even mailers who are saying that this is not the only person last night on my YouTube channel I had a dialogue with my audience\nAbout has anybody whether they're in a dusty and experience or meditate or had they had any insight about water a lot of water affecting the planet between now and twenty twenty six\nAnd that was a year that had been presented to me by a real whistle blower science with that that uh he worked on a project having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six\nIn which there could be from either a natural cycle or something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that there's going to be like a shift or a jolt\nAnd that it would cause in armies in tremendous amounts of flooding and I had had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them about exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle\nInteracting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is flood that has written about in genesis\nAnd that is how woven and a complex\nAll of this seems to be going that every single question is leading to answer that people are raising more issues and scientists are all for coming forward and saying that they have information about this and so tonight if there's anybody listening on color\nIf you are in the military government whistle blower category or human abducted category

sent me his duty to fourteen to prove his military background which I've included the end of my earth files news report\nTonight with email contained a life experience that he wrote up for me in titled quote the experience that made me a believer that we are on line and it began\nHi Linda my name is Tony\nI Would like to tell you about something that I saw as a black child I Am fifty seven now but at the time of the incident I was four or five years old in Nineteen sixty five in Nineteen sixty six I\nWithin my bed one night and I have woke up and could not go back to only\nHear now from Winston Salem North Carolina that tell any town boy what that and him as a child and hot attention to this very day is retired us air force staff sergeant Tony guy\nI Lived in Dayton, Ohio\nI was about four years of age\nI live with my mother and she had a best friend that she ... within two bedroom apartment my mother had two children\nAnd my mother's friend had two children and we were all about the same age it's a two bedroom apartment and it's two levels you have to go up the stairs we get to the two bedrooms and bathrooms\nAnd I was in my bed sleeping along with my brother in two other kids and I woke up in the middle of the night\nI have trouble going back to sleep and not just in the dark couldn't go back to sleep so I decided to get up out of the bed and I went to the window\nAnd I was just looking out the window and it was very quiet but I didn't hear the cars that's how I knew it was very late at night 'cause I didn't ... year cargo by\nSo I'm looking around and I happened to look up just look up in the sky you know just looking around because it was really nothing to see but a grassy field in between the apartments\nAnd so I look up and I see a lot of light light in the sky high soup that was an airplane that\nSame light that I was looking at because it was the only thing in the sky I notice something was coming down and by the time my notes it may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet off the ground the light that I was looking at came down it was an or\nWhat I noticed about it was one\nHalf of it was so white collar and the other half of it was me on green color you know like the glow sticks that you see at the concert when they had to close the extent are neon green glow sticks right\nIt looked like that and I was saying to myself this looks like a perfect circle but with so little all is if you cut the perfect circle in half and then just pull it apart a little bit\nA little lighter in the middle then it would have been if it were perfect circle\nYeah and I noticed there were two lights met in the middle the salt white light in the lime green light there was no bleed over you can clearly see where the neon green ended in assault Hawaii began and this object it looked to be as thin as a balloon\nWhen you say he was like a balloon you mean that in the surface was translucent and you could see through it\nYeah I could clearly see through it it was no metal nothing like that it was more like a seafood balloon so the and it's like you're looking at a seat super long and what are you seeing\nWhat I'm seeing is a person standing inside the fall of white part wearing like down and he's looking up\nHe's just standing there looking up like he's looking up into the bars I don't know what he's looking at it but I could clearly see this announcement here in the months we'll look at that that's a person can keep in mind I'm no more than twenty five to\nThirty feet from this was the only reason I didn't climb out the window that night was because I was like if you knock out this grieving go down there\nYou go on the beach you [laughter] you know what to do this without with big white man I wanted to go but I'm going to be you know if I Do this you know ... years but I just didn't understand it the key is the significance of this\nOkay this is very close to you and you are looking at this window describe the person that you are seeing in the white side of this circular orbit\nWhy give you my thoughts at the time this is the conversation I was having to myself I was thinking man this person looks like God and then I thought I'm not going to say that unless he actually pills believe God right then I'll go man be sure looks like the guy in the picture a church\nDescribe everything the gal and he was wearing like\nWhen you're looking at the small white I noticed it was blue light or brighter colors and the white light you could tell the difference between all white and bright white\nI could clearly see that the gal was white ...\nVery bright white he was looking up and he was Caucasian and he had a brunette here and they came down to I'd say his shoulder to shoulder lanes mhm and he was just standing there looking up\nWhy kids hair strange wavy or curly\nI'd say was straight dislike you see when you see these motion pictures a Jesus of ... ... it was like that\nWere you close enough to see the shape or color and he's I Know I was in ...\nIt's enough to see the shape or color of his eyes\nNo I wasn't close enough to see that\nAnd what was the shape of the down\nFrom what I could see it looked like it pulled over his head that all look like once wallet peace and it went all the way down to his feet\nCould you see his feet in this your uncle craft\nNo I couldn't so how do you know it went down to his feet\nBecause I could see that where the or where he was ... he was at the very bottom of it I could clearly see the whole the year it's kind of strange because like it but you know made it but I could look in the green part for your apartment buildings on the up and shot\nExcept from twenty five to thirty feet as a four year old looking out your apartment second storey window\nYou are able to look through the surface of the white side of this year a goal or or craft and see the man inside the white side yes but you could not see into the lime green and you could see past the lime and the white\nYes and the fact that he blocked out the apartment buildings that were beyond it seems to suggest that even though it appeared very strange to you\nThat he had to have been solid matter or at least blocking so times to have blocked out the buildings that were behind it\nYes it is the is floating down is that if you would blow up a blow into food in the air that's about speech this thing was coming down\nAnd I was thinking that it was going to land I Need to get down there asked this person's some questions you know but ah as it got toward the ground I watched

use orange around their head was sparkly lights with\nYoung sparkly gold often\nThat's true and what is this and I don't think that it is something being made up I think it is a\nPhysics part of the universe and other dimensions that we had been denied or had never been told or ever educated about it's always been a thrown into the bin of methodology or something else\nAnd that we've got to start looking at all of this in terms of a brand new\nCosmic understanding of the physical relationship between the now the universe we are in it could very likely be a projected hologram you would have to be rejected from another dimension more and more physics papers are being written about more and more evidence of other dimensions\nAnd if we cycle if this so is the important part\nAnd at the moment of death we transition into one or more different dimensions depending upon something having to do with the growth of the soul that not all souls we'll go to the same dimension than recycling back

national security in that school you could do with the book at risk about safety that we would not it could do a real good at any\nTime in doing and yeah I understand your question and I have had to live with it for a very long time forty years uh where I began my first investigation into animal needle Asians in September of Nineteen Seventy nine and it's twenty eight team\nWas strange harvest was ...\nStrange harvest and uh it was a a well received a documentary it was awarded a regional Emmy\nUh so I was dealing from a pure pure fact based journalism as I could in that film and I had to wrestle myself\nWith the question of going out into pastures often by myself together to issue in and various things\nAt my vulnerable and having to decide within myself\nThat I was going to keep putting one foot in front of the other and if something took me\nA so be it and I am still here and I was a to my knowledge never adopted from any of the many many many places on both hemispheres of this planet that I have walked where I had been where Anna mutilated animals are\nNow what I'm trying to do is set a different lens and framework here\nYes there are animal mutilation there were animal sacrifices five thousand seven thousand ten thousand years ago in many parts of the planet is well\nThose animals sacrifices may have been provoked by the same other intelligence that is today in the twentieth and twenty first century uh doing animal mutilation instead of making us line up to do the animal sacrifices\nBut what ever it is that is the truth behind the UFO phenomena on our planet earth I Do not think it is singular I think that there are many facets\nI think that some facets are truly allies and if we had not had allies whether they are from another solar system in this universe or from another dimension\nI Do not think homo sapiens safety and would have survived the the last several thousand years without help for something else why the help does it make itself front and in our face this is who they are may relate to the fact\nThat humans have been abused and misused by a tremendous number I think of intelligence is using this planet and the solar system\nNow but that doesn't the fed and humans being cruel to each other and the wars I don't defend that I think death and killing is horrible but I Do have a feeling of compassion for my fellow human\nCreature that we we had never been treated to all the truth about the true nature of evolution of our own selves on this planet led to learn other intelligence is until all of us know all of

you George and your staff for the miracle of coast to coast having nights a week and Linda I Want to thank you for your magnificent research here after here it's just truly appreciated by the coast audience\nWill end up my question is about CERN\nSpelled C E R and D neither yeah yeah exactly the have drawn collider and job I'm Wondering if you've spoken to any of your whistle blowers governmental military scientific who have\nTalked about CERN it appears to be triggering some people say that that's triggering planetary anomalous phenomena through its operation it appears to be the area fifty one of the earth radical quantum physics\nAnd they appear to be doing some great work but they appear to have not just a public persona for perhaps say covert\nYou know side to CERN like area fifty one well\nI have heard these kinds of rumors that on the other hand I've interviewed guy by now I I at least a dozen\nPeople who have been getting different experiments at different time at the Large Hadron collider is the way that they refer to it\nAnd I think it started a because I had interviewed one of the ... who is responsible for a proposal\nTo see if they could generate many black holes like getting the Hadron Collider up to a certain be here with the reason it makes sense to me\nThat if they could generate little black holes that could gain for a certain period of time\nI can make measurements that there were any gravity wave moving in to the black holes the key gravity wave moving in two small black hole\nThere would automatically can from another dimension and that way it seems to me a little kid I meant are based on all the reading that I have done it on ... foreign work and others\nI we rock what it was that they were hurting now that one of the tests that we've laid out a paper or to do two or three years ago and there were headlines\nIn the u._k. Barry sensational newspapers and other that ... going to be making black holes that would destroy your me black hole we're not going to destroy the earth in any way shape or form um there are probably many black holes being\nGenerated and cooking away all the time everywhere it right\nBeing generated and moving away all of the time everywhere it was\nDesigned and that this is what's important\nThe Large Hadron collider is a great tester of hype haw says he's having to do with gravity and dark energy and dark matter and dark black holes in all of it and that's what it is designed to try to do and it's not very easy\nAnd so when there were these\nReally\nTerrible headlines about many black holes being generated that would consume the earth\nIt was just to me it was frustrating I Can't imagine what the poor scientists feel like and it's not true\nAnd therefore we are constantly getting ignorance and the rabbit that in many ways is turning into a cesspool where\nPeople are making a quarters in pennies on click through on any hysterical headline that is not the case with any kind of sad\nAnd unfortunately we have an administration that has been pushing all kinds of attacks and their claim on both ... a fake news is causing fake news and so this is a very very difficult time and I'm just going to the to the best of my ability\nTo try to keep putting one foot in front of the other and amassing as many facts as I possibly can and hope people will always know I Am fighting for truth and like\nUs you are Ellen in Dearborn, Michigan is with us by Alan\nAnd I do earn yarn\nGreat good to hear from you\nAnd we ... them and same ground that's for sure sure did\nA version Linda Yes sir I just wanted to say thank you for your integrity in your reporting well thank you I Try really hard I'm sixty five years old and I've been following you for a while they were huge or listen I'm\n\nLinda all I Need first of all I Need your email address we gotta talk we heard it it always\nThink of a reporter who filed news about the earth so it's earth files one word E.

gold body mass dimensional shell\nEl that may be true what I'm trying to understand is what is the truth is that\nWhat is the real physics that we have been denied or still don't understand\nBetween

dot com want to introduce you to Jonathan Gabriel rescues Jonathan I Know this is going to be tough for you but thank you for joining us today\nThank you thank you very much for having me\nI Want you to tell ... audience that will truly\nBe very sympathetic with you tonight exactly what happened to Raul because this story is so important for so many people to understand a but let's start let's start from the beginning he was a vibrant young man what happened\nYes Ralph was a vibrant young man with no\nMedical history whatsoever was admitted to the University of Missouri Kansas City prestigious six year bachelor degree empty program were children graduate and six years with a BA in an empty [noise]\nAnd after completing the first year that program he got food poisoning [noise]\nWent to a hospital in Kansas City\nIt was administered very controversial drug by the name of ... or ... G. L. A. and the generic version of it ... this is a black box drug that was used as a first line of defense or something like food poisoning\nAnd from the moment that drug was injected within days Ralph both physical and mental condition began to deteriorate and there are many many many cases of this that can be found on the Internet\nAnd when you see it begin to deteriorate physically and mentally did you notice that change with him\nAbsolutely within a day or two he and one of his medical school room mates had done research\nAnd the changes I noticed or his anxiety began to increase he began to complain of strange pains that he had never had before and this began a slow deterioration that I Would call something like this doing this whole lot of the human body\nAnd at this point Ralph took his life\n[noise] over the course of a early in twenty Seventeen he was I brought him back home to St Louis and he made three attempts on his life\nTo take themselves out of this horrific condition that was bringing him intense pain and from what I understand the form of anxiety times a hundred [noise]\nUm and on his last attempt he was successful and um I did hold his hand and was there and he passed away\nHow old was he Jonathan he was twenty [noise] and how does he take his life\nHe tried with two other attempts that were unsuccessful but on the last attempt a he used a gun\nAnd at that time I wasn't there he sent me a text that really began marking over here but the text came to me at exactly eleven eleven\nAnd that's where we're going to talk about tonight the ... that have occurred for you especially after this trend\nTo talk about tonight the ... that have occurred for you especially after this tragedy occurred I mean I remember being in St Louis when I heard about this\nAnd it was a was a shocking situation for anybody to have to go through a ... it it is my biggest nightmare of course as a parent\nTo lose your child before before you go and uh I could only what you were going through at that time with this kind of pain but the synchronous cities then started so tell us a little bit about the name ... and then twenty two which is the name of your book\n[noise] well I I looked at that tax George again and again and again it in some way I found solid and connecting with that last tax\nAnd as I began to stare at it again and again it occurred to me loving alive and well Ralph was born on two twenty two [laughter] and so the number twenty two began to resonate with me a firm that was the beginning point I Would say up that resignation\nI Want to tell our audience does a little secrets of the year when I was talking with Jonathan several weeks ago a about the this situation in his book and of course the tragedy that occurred now he had mentioned that um you know his his son Ralph\nA was a you know just a delightful young guy and uh he's ... use the name Gabriel of course uh you took that name as well did you not\nI did Ralph middle name was Gabriel and so I changed my middle name to Gabriel I felt they Eunice and that one this and doing that it was symbolic was spiritual and has brought me significant meaning\nAnd on and I was talking to Jonathan and I said to my dad's name was getting real and uh you know he was born on February twenty seconds which is the same date that Ralph\nWas born in these weird synchronous he started coming up all over again and Jonathan's eyes just opened up in it and everything else do you believe that your son is Cindy ... messages Jonathan through these strange occurrences\n[noise] I I Do believe that I I've always been a rational analytical regimented person and in my personal life in my profession in ab aiding [noise] and\nWith the pain of what happened it began to open up my thought process and I said wait a minute there just got to be more and I took down the wall of what was my personal rationality and began to read I began to study\nA I've been studying a ancient ... text in Hebrew I looked through other religions and mystical world and I do believe that the infant it is communicating with me\n[noise] what message do you think what else is trying to pass on to you what does he want you to know\n[noise]\nI find comfort in knowing that he's letting me know that the existence of him has not changed life on earth for him has seized but the existence in the cosmic soup if you will does not stop\nAnd that has brought me tremendous comfort\nI I I was going to say you must you in a very strange way of\nCourse to give you the kind of comfort to know that his existence continues that he's out there somewhere or in trying to get you little messages every once in a while just to make you aware that you know hey Dan I'm here\n[noise] [noise] well you know it it hasn't been always once in a while sometimes it's a little more frequent uh about two weeks ago I've been wearing his watch that I gave him on his twentieth birthday which is an automatic watch okay and I've been wearing it for the better of course of a year and a half\n[noise] I'm not touched it it always keeps the correct time ten days ago I woke up I put on the watch I got in the car I went to work at my watch was twenty two minutes behind\nAll I had to look at it a few times but it was twenty two men\nAnd do you get behind the car and you look in a license plate and you see twenty two there to do these numbers pop up all over the place\nYou know they do pop up to me and at times I think they're popping up and at times I think they're not coincidences so I really created a work for myself out of coincidences I'm calling them coincide in says because\nAs a recent trip to Los Angeles and I'm thinking a lot about him and hotel I check into in the hand me a key and I walk up to the room and the room number is to twenty two\nJeeze random they just give it to correct you didn't request it\n[noise] but I don't think it's random I'm I have removed random from my thought\nProcess right yeah I mean there might be random on the hotels side but somebody else's directing this at least thought patterns Jonathan stay with us we're going to come back in the moment and talk more about these strange synchronous these of course a you've got some more stories to share with us we'll also open up the phone lines for a couple of reasons\nFor folks who want to just ask you a question

website in the need to twenty two dot com linked up the coast to coast the dotcom we're talking about his latest were called in for twenty two about the life with his son ... cities that have occurred since wrong tragically passed on\nJonathan I Know how tough this was for you when this tragedy occurred how're you doing now\n[noise] well George I'm I'm definitely doing better one of the things that's really help to me\nIs to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the infinite and in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings has disability\nBut I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body as the finite zone and for the anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body and so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite\nAnd so in meditative thought and thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infinite zone where each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat'd you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\n[noise] I have to say that I I question that I\nDidn't think about it much and ever since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nTrying to think culturally then we'll get to them in a second but there are three strange occurrences that occurred I Want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the driver situation what happened there\nSo about eight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a\nFunny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want and he looked at me and a very strange stare and said I'll just tell them Ralph set it\nOff and I looked at him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said no\nShe how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] I Love it how about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon and I thank you balloon in the morning\nAnd after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it and the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\n[noise] I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and say we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\nShe's against timing in secret a city again and then you had an occurrence with some strange bedroom lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and I turned off the lights\nAnd I was leaving in the house was empty and the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me during the lights back\nBut the light switch back down and put it back up put it back down and they went off the lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off and at that time I left the house\nAnd just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\nWhich is the point where you got angry about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing [noise] um [noise] I don't I don't fault him I\nHave struggled to try to understand how\nThe generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shielded themselves from any and all liability from every American citizen\nWhile they're they're protected by a federal law aren't they\nIt there there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJohnathan which was wells subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\nNo Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student\nOr frequently making jokes he was just if you ask is friends they would portray just\nThe most on us um you know likeable young man you could you could think of\nNow did you go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stay at home they take some stuff uh you know they go to the bathroom as often as they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the hospital\nI I think I think he was vomiting proof usually there was a lot of blood that with his friends who were all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go\nSchool students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that cool\n[noise] well I got the call after medication had been given to them about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOh okay let's go to some culture for you Jonathan let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington question a story Hi Patty\nHi uh I I've got a little story and I hope it's relevant to this synchronous cities that I think I've got more and then you can shake a stick at\nUm it started with my son ah who incidentally was taken away from me when he was born we somehow managed to to make a connection\nUh that we can look back for each other on that he was born on Labor Day three minutes apart from the same time\nI was born in from their synchronous cities just roll in um\nUm we were both born nine fourteen I was nine fourteen fifty two it was nine fourteen sixty eight and every number we'd have to deal with this is not at nine I mean ... of fourteen or a seven were divisible by seven\nYeah I'm sure you get certain numbers as Jonathan gets twenty two you get certain numbers popping up all the time too\nYeah exactly well uh your first thing was we noticed my initial ... P. R. R. P. um his mom name was Donna I'm my dad's name is Don ... it's adopted\nParents are exactly the same age as my parents to the air\nThe month July Nineteen twenty nine and November Nineteen thirty one and I mean that kind of blew me off my socks\nShe penny let me ask you if I can why did they take him away from you as a child\nI was he was born on the sixteenth birthday ah okay okay ah it was it was better for him and me I understand that happened that way and I mean it was it was excruciating let him go but we did find each other twenty six years later and that's another one of the same kind of these\nOut of twenty six years we crossed in the mail looking for each other and to\nMe is is he still with us\nOh absolutely okay yeah I Lived with me for seven years and they moved back to his home state of Utah\nAnd um we were both born on air force base is a ... than this hatred that cities and their beyond coincidence so absolutely when ours he was dead were like astrological start when\nIt's on ... in winter again John what you call coincidence\nI call them coincide and says I I Believe that we all have these we just have to tune ourselves into them\nNo question that reality now you\nKnow there are ... I don't believe in coincidence is either I think the steps in and things have a purpose in a reason a shirt sometimes there's luck and strange occurrences but I think by and large there are no coincidence is is at all what do you think about randomness\n[noise] I don't feel things are random I feel that there is in order\nTo the happenings I may not understand the order but I think that that there is in order to the happenings\n\nSure\nSome of the packages mail from a post office in Florida I'm name Anthony Fox news\nOvernight federal agents along with Miami Dade County police were actively working with the post office looking for any clues into that person or group responsible for the potential bombs now numbering can\nFox is Todd pie wrote those packages all sent the prominent Democrats and vocal Trump critics look similar condoning mom like devices and never went off and they're not being analyzed than an FBI lab\nWe continue to revise the American public to remain vigilant as just those remain possible for the Pakistanis have been what could be mailed a vi assistant\nDirector William Sweeney President Trump was up in the middle of an idea waiting in a three yeah and it's funny CNN and others can criticize him even blame him for the currents of bombs but when he criticizes them they go wild and scream it's just not presidential\nDriven astray she was getting ready to send hundreds of us troops to support the border patrol has a caravan of thousand Central American migrants slowly moves are way\nIt's turning king Thomas and St Louis to not be allowed in Iraq [noise]\nThat's homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen Fox's group Jenkins is out with the caravan early this morning in Mexico\nChurch group is set up alongside the main highway highway two hundred to give them food and water in supply sing clothes sings or they may need on there\nThe security adviser John Bolton reports the White House has invited Russian President Vladimir potent come to Washington the orders unclear when or your food and accepted the days after both Newt and held talks about a nuclear arms treaty President Trump plans to pull out of claiming Russia is violating it\nMoscow denies that this is Fox News\nFox News rundown who's a weekday morning fog or the deep into the major and controversial story it's a good day hosted by the makers of Fox News radio subscribing now your perspective of news you won't find anywhere else going too far 'cause you get a job\nFor [noise] for government being involved in this at all the money on the return of embarrassed when the conversation on holidays\nWith the dry areas we fight Easter Fox Business network\n... wanting to do is they want someone that can try hard job is to come through the talking to my to my ... for getting on the top ten because there's a lot of intentional resume out there and they have any talent in\nWhen I'm going to make sure that whenever you know for the guys who are fully formed from ... twenty four seven news\nThe airlines are going to be fashion whether it for you know I mean for the fungus you\nReal news real honest opinion NATO's\nLeader says the U.S as right through Russia has written violating that Soviet era nuclear arms treaty that President Trump says the intense of a lot of secretary general Jens Stoltenberg doesn't support and that he says it will be better to compel rushes to comply with it says we and our NATO allies why war games\nThe largest needle exercising decades\nEighty thousand troops hundreds of jets game standing out across Norway including the surrounding waters and what's being called trading juncture usa Harry Truman had six thousand sailors and dozens of aircraft the nix the first time in nearly Thirty Years' trimming became the first aircraft carrier to launch chats in the Arctic Circle\nLast month Russia held its largest military drills since Nineteen eighty one which includes Chinese forces at the Pentagon look is Tom Watson Fox News\nTo search for missing a Thirteen year old girl from Wisconsin law enforcement has gotten about Seventeen hundred tip still no sign of Jim make last not seen since her parents were from murder to in their Wisconsin home twelve days ago in Idaho or possible Reagan the case of a missing woman\nThe Idaho county sheriff says a border collie that belongs to a missing Seventy six year old Connie Johnson walked out of the woods weeks after she disappeared the dog named ace Stoddard a camp near moose creek ranger station\nAuthority started searching for Johnson almost three weeks ago when Johnson was last seen in a hunting camp where she worked as a cook hunter say they saw her when they left behind and came back to find her and her dog missing\nCops called up the search after a while but will likely resume that now the sheriff says it's possible if they take the dog back into the woods it could lead them to Johnson ...
