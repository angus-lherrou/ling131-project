mental tell a path experiences with in one week\nAnd I had a bitch revelation that made me become vegetarian and and now there was no one else around no I'm for not animals that I was by myself and I guess I'm I I right to know\nPeople that are tell a path that now you said that people are are usually good with meditation I haven't done a lot of meditation in my life that I had been on my own a\nA tremendous amount of time I'm at\nA deep thinker I'm spiritual\nAnd I think I'm an empathetic [laughter] so I wanted to know if the qualities allow people to be more ... path again and it ... for about twenty two years I have been double and triple digit\nI'm On the clock on the email address is ... and whatnot and nominate has become bigger and society at the time I didn't know what was going on and people didn't understand what I was trying to tell them but um I\nI kind of thinking that this might be a telecast that experience is well seeing something like ... to on the clock I'm thinking important message it you know something recording life seeing signs so I kinda think that it's all intertwined and then just one more thing I'm\nNo awhile ago someone had told me I'm In the spirit and the solar actually different I I Believe and maybe in five or some religions it's the body and mind spirit soul\nAnd so I kinda think that what your home is differentiating ... spirit\nOr the other person is outside in the spirit inside [laughter] or either or but um I I kinda think of it on a level what you're saying as well\nI Would think mark that the ... maybe one in the city what do you think\nIt thank you for your question on ... um I tend to agree with you George and there's an analogy I Love also from Dr Bernardo Castro which summarizes the way I think about things which is to imagine reality as being like a stream of water where water represents consciousness\nAnd each of us is like a world pool within that stream so we're having a localized individual experience within the broader stream but we're fundamentally still made out of water\nSo what happens when the physical body dies that's like a world full of dissipating and the water doesn't leave the stream it just transitions into a different state\nAnd so the water to me is consciousness and consciousness is having this variety of experiences whether localized in a war pool or otherwise industry\nDo you think that's consciousness is a normal process of living or it's a supernatural\n\nThe way I view consciousness is that it's like max clunky said I regard consciousness as fundamental regard matter as to rebut if\nFrom consciousness meaning that consciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things point to that but I Do everything that we experience as being a basically a modulation that is happening within consciousness\nHow has this new knowledge for you more changed your life\nIt's changed it massively [laughter] so I alluded to this earlier that the material is perspective that I subscribe to a leads to a very bleak outlook on life once your brain golf is over\nI mean I understand the implications of that and I think that's what our education system is teaching um now I think that that consciousness does not die when the body dies because consciousness isn't dependent on the body so I see much more uh ... meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is real\nSo I see much more uh meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think I Wish that had been taught me a long time ago but going back to the near death experiences what people often report is known as a life review\nWhere they experience their whole life in a flash and again this is when their brain it's either offer highly impaired and\nThey're judging themselves for how they acted during their life but this is the kicker that really I think about this every day is that some people report experiencing the life review through the eyes of those they're affected\nSo let's say Bob harm chain in his life and Bob is having a life review he might experience the pain through chains eyes\nAnd he comes back to his life forever changed caring much more about uh how we treat people rather than material good so it will be thought about meeting in life the life review as a potential land if we take that as a literal phenomenon about you know the purpose here is really to treat one another well\nDo you think in our life that we were given this gift to be able to do these incredible things\nThrough consciousness pre cognition fill up at the ... and things like\nThat well yeah I think that these are natural abilities that we tend to have in the ... the study I mentioned earlier where people are thirty two percent rather than twenty five percent there's a subtle ability even ... in people who aren't trained\nI think their ability that are just simply not harness in modern society because these ideas are considered a novelist and totally paranormal and this is one of the reasons I wanted to write the book and felt compelled to do it is that\nAn understanding human potential and feasibility is that we have could revolutionize I think the world but also our science and our medicine if we understood how to incorporate them into what we do\nFirst time caller John in Flint, Michigan welcome to the show John go ahead\nYou doing sir great I'm an ex military and I will tell you I don't believe in ghost UFOs and everything else but I Will say that again retired military I was a cyber multinational unit two thousand six in Iraq\nBut by the way thank you for serving first night where\nYou get that I was assigned to an SUV intelligence unit and we basically we're looking for a bomb maker\nUm we were able to use what I understand the remote viewing from a section of the three intelligent shop where there was a coal location for a boss and some building\nWere able to find that three UAB and the person I Believe who was the remote viewer that was brought in\nA was Paul and I believe he wasn't no by no\nWhich is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English I Believe he was Israeli descent from what I can get of who I dealt with over there mhm my question is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in a remote viewing\nBecause of his I guess you would say non English or not American up I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality that is more than ...\n...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\n\nI Would say that's consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic it just isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trends or certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something with the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has our he's outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the whirlpool analogy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and they accept water that's outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you still with us Yes sir I'm ... so you do or ... you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's er it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately with me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I uh [noise]\nA lot of things that I that was a I including all those sightings and everything else I've been able to do something else\nOkay so you're you're

Katie WN and Katie Jay [noise]\n\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast our final segment with mark ... market can we conclude that consciousness is a part of the universe always was\nAnd that it survives outside of the physical brain than physical body but it's there it's out there in the ether I mean can we categorically all agree on that\nTo me the evidence points in that direction more strongly than any other direction when you put together the phenomenon that we discussed tonight a psychic phenomena like till after the cycle can eat as pre cognition near death experiences children with at like memories when you put all these together\nCombined with certain phenomena of quantum physics it's they get\nThat consciousness is playing this fundamental role in the universe beyond space and time\nWe've got George in Corpus Christi Texas now hey George welcome to the ...\nGeorge ah may God Bless you and your show continue aggressively thinking it was wonderful really long before\nAnd my ah my question is do you ever got hundreds of colors or their reincarnation as a result of consciousness really outside the body in each of us\nAnd the so AKA consciousness moves on to affect another human being good or evil out this free will play a part in or effect consciousness and I'll take my reply on the right\nTo free will have anything to do with it mark\nThis is a very tricky question I think the question of free will ultimately boils down to who is the agent that we're speaking out that has the free well\nUm are we talking about the ... body having free well are we talking about like the consciousness it's self and if we think of consciousness as being like the stream of water than all there is consciousness\nSo at the level of the fundamental consciousness it would appear that there is a infant it pretty well but at the level of perhaps ... an individual that is\nConsidering it felt to be separated from that consciousness or at least appearing that way then perhaps the free world did not exist at the same level that make that\nYeah it does it on a very difficult subject\nIt very difficult and I think there are some of the concept that we're talking about night I think are beyond what what are linear human mind can conceptualize sort of like an entity we all know anybody that can we really understand what it means I think there are certain ... at that our brains just limit us from understanding fully\nYou think somebody like Jesus understood the ability of consciousness and how to how to deal with is how to use it a Andy Andy used it\nI I think there were probably people throughout history\nUm who really understood the nature of reality and I don't know the details of how this might have interplay with consciousness but from ... in pieces I I've heard it off while the he was one of these individuals who really understood\nHow things work and it seems when one understands reality perhaps we can do things that seem totally paranormal but again they're not paranormal under this alternative framework\nWe have a guest his name's Joseph a gallon burger and he's a he's a professor and he is conducted experiments in Las Vegas one of his books is called liquid luck he has concluded beyond a shadow of a doubt\nThat the ability of the mind and attitude will determine whether you win or lose in his studies in Las Vegas where he's tested and ... and ... and he said it's uncanny so if somebody goes into Las Vegas offbeat positive\nUh there's a high likelihood they're going to win but if they go in we're going to lose this isn't going to happen they're going to lose and and he said the results are on candy\nI think that's all tied together like consciousness it's all part of the same don't you\nI'm not familiar with those exact studies but I'm very open to the idea for the reason that you just stay out of consciousness is the basis of reality where everything is just the stream of consciousness than the reality we're in is almost malleable\nAnd sometimes very subtle where you have a random number Gatorade or that's behaving fight may not randomly in other cases we have reports like he talked about a metal being that using the mind so who's to say that outcome which is just a part of the physical reality could also be affected by the way our consciousness is acting\nEast of the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James waiting for a similar James\n... Ah yes real quickly before oh make my favorite I like the uh respect of this disagree with a that age is a view about the effects of a drug this thought in the fall and the mind you know the indicator\nThat consciousness is a product of the my ...

Research Center\nAnd these studies are use five levels of blinding where the media and the person who allegedly can communicate with the deceased is\nSpeaking on the phone to the researcher and all that person knows is the first name of the dead person and they're able to bring in non chance information and there have been to peer reviewed journal studies on this thing just think that the mediums are able to obtain information we need more research on it but that's an example of\nSomeone who appears to be deceased and a living person getting information about someone who is deceased\nWhere do you think of some mediums do you think are some of them are very effective\nErasing important point I think there's a tendency um I think in the mainstream to say that there are frauds out there that are claimed to be mediums and maybe there are some fraud I think there are some people that\nThat has real abilities and the ...

specialize on the electronics they work with the ... meters\nOn you know we have those that use the quarter is and I think it's just a good team of people that have worked together for so long on just have a routine down\nHave you ever been on an investigation Maureen were you what are we better get out of this thing you know no\nNobody knows more than once really [laughter]\nYeah there's there's been a couple um there's there's been a few and when those moments happen there even though they're rare they're still in nursing you know I mean Ron let's say well I'm not afraid of anything that's you know he'll say but to me you know you have to just keep aware and uh I don't\nIntend to feel the effects of an investigation let's say over a period of time has no joy if it's taking energy for me if it's feeling you know I'm literally like I have a pain in my chest or I'm feeling all this\nUh you know after effect let's say um I still have to work a day job so it could into the air and that's one thing I always have to kind of be aware of\nWhat would you see is the most fascinating case you been on\nTo date\nOh jeez fascinating um\nTo me we investigated the Portsmouth White House um one time and there was a the last White House keeper his wife ... small I Believe what's her name\nAnd to me it was fascinating because this was the sweetest woman that had come through I felt for energy and it was nice for change you know so I wasn't I wasn't in fear for feeling um painter having any ill effects\nAnd it just was a pleasant feeling and what was even nicer was after we were done and I was investigating how she came through she was so excited she I channeled turf felt like she just was so excited to be alive again 'cause she\nThrough she was so excited she I channeled her felt like she just was so excited to be alive again because she could talk to the people around her\nBut to me what really what's fascinating was you know we investigate and a lot of times that you know ... century right that you're dealing with so you don't necessarily see the person face to face that you can overcome you know communicated with\n'em and so we had done it talk after this investigation um and once we did that talk you know here's this woman ... small her picture as life size in front of me and I just\nI didn't expect it but I literally just broke down because it was again first time I got to really see a woman I just felt a connection to her that I did it on the plane\nNo ... that's ... that's got to be emotional sometimes\nWhen you see things like that and I bet when you were in the ... you know you look at a gravestone did you actually think you know here's a person who lived and died\nAnd you know the remains are right here and then there's the show kinda grossly operation attached to that that's got to be emotional for people did you ever have you ever just broken down\nOr you know I've broken down on while I Try not to break down but when I'm done reading for people um you know and I've actually you know you you talk about\nThe loved ones you talk about I mean these are real people you're talking about you know their pains and that's ours and it doesn't help them really to break down but you can't help it sometimes because if you're a compassionate and you have a hard it's hard not to\nUm it as much as you probably try to try to stay focused you know you get involved in these things you do\nDefinitely do you can put yourself in their place and and realize that you know our own you know mortality right so\nIt can you come face to face with dealing with death on many occasions ... it it can be hot breaking\nWhat would you say is the strangest case you've come across strangers skittish\nStrangest case okay well when Ron would take me out to investigate many times and just about all the time he would never tell me where we were going\nOn because it's the keep me honest right so I'm not Googling mine that information they were one I'm the one day he gave me a call and say hey Maureen you know I have this case it's ten in the morning you know can you come with me it's really only take us in our\nYou know so yeah exactly I'm sure I'm sure Iran\nYou know he's very creative right so I said\nOkay you know I guess I can go for a couple of hours so we go to the home with this you know little ranch style house and we we get there and as the men two guys there wanted they just look really rough and tumble you know and this one guy you know like one I think his name was moose and the\nBig big guy covered in tattoos and we just try to you know just\nOverwhelming right sit there and so it was just looking at me and we get in this house and he said I think I have a little girl in here spirit and you look around and the mayor is shattered glass table from busted and\nIt just looked like someone went through the house with a bat um it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know my phone's been ringing with all the rules on it and my wallet went missing and now he's telling it all the things that he kept saying I think it's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see what we can pick up\nSo after a few minutes I'm thinking oh dear God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know a spirit of a man very angry I'm very trying to get his message thrown I thought wow you know this isn't meant no it's not and he was getting adamant that you know it wasn't and I talked to\nUse them brings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right um we run up at the top of the driveway with the guy knows any rags me down on the on the driveway and he looks at me he said I Want you come back here tonight by yourself and I said\nWell you know I really don't feel it's a little girl you got to be careful you know you don't want to welcome in something that you don't know is there and and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering my best friend\nShe\nSaid and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want to hear and I thought oh God I just have to get out of here so that\nThat is scary

founder and lead investigator of the New England ghost project with a degree in environmental science now he was\nA skeptic however in near death experience changed all that for him no longer blinded by his skepticism uses scientific background now to seek the truth about the unusual in paranormal in addition to hosting ghost chronicles on the ghost village radio when I tunes he holds a weekly Internet radio show on the\nSaga net dot com and also has written books with Maureen the ones I'm told I told you about more ghost chronicles and ghost a day welcome Ron good to talk with you\nGood morning looking forward to this ah tell me about this near death experience\nYeah everybody wants to hear about that I think that's the funniest thing because ah I I had cut my ah fingers off on a table saw and ouch\nYeah well you know anyways uh I went to the hospital and they looked at it and they really couldn't do anything at that time\nSo they could a wrap them up and nice and and kept me an emergency room so they could bring a specialist on them six and a half hours later they\nPut them all back together and ah you know that was fine but during the night um I ... that came up to see me and she realized something was wrong even though I I I thought I felt fine and she called in for a CAT scan actually had to bring the the woman in the hospital was nobody at that time\nAnd they realized they had a blue Murray embolism\nAnd from then on things began to have a well Lewis is all going on I had what I Believe was a near death experience or it's not like the\nThe usual ... here and and that it was I was just basically in a different place it was extremely\nBright white I guess it's the best way to describe it and ah they were uh people their figures anyways they couldn't really see any features or anything but they also white and ah [noise]\nThe weird thing about it is also there was what I thought was it sounds really ... enjoy like music had that\nMhm type thing and uh also felt a and there's a line in them and go on a song like a prayer that I always quote and that is it felt like home with a very comfortable or it was very warm and then the whole thing just be disappeared like the closing of an iris and\nIt was in the wall of that right with us and it was just the duck or ah ICU that I was and there was no music was just my hot feet on the\nIt was a nobody around and certainly wasn't a warm so I when I got to the hospital I didn't know if it was a true experience or was it just the drugs they gave me so that's how I kind of got into the paranormal\nWhen did you conclude that ah it wasn't just the drawings that there was something really unusual going on here for you you\nKnow it's something you you just have to um what's the word I'm looking for the experience\n... they're really either believe it or not and uh\nSo I I Know that I had this experience can I tell you it is absolutely a and yet I just that the experience you know can absolutely tell you it wasn't you know so it's one of those mystery that that pushes me to the other uh things that they do\nDo they really attached to the fingers were they able to\nDo yeah yeah well oddly enough and uh\nHow many do you cut off\nI cut the the middle one all on my left hand at the middle and totally off the the um next to it I had ... several places that was\nA kind of dangling the top of the fun I had cut off completely uh they actually put a ... when they put together my ah middle thing and so if I ever give anybody the finger I always tell them it's not me [noise]\nYep 'cause it's possess ask if that was that was a joke\n[laughter] ha ha ha at three thirty in the morning it's good but so it's to the hand works normally yes it's amazing to guide\nYep it's a you know what the time it's it's a you know a little difficult with the cold but uh yeah it's fine\nNow tell us about the New England goes project that you started what the what is that\nYeah it's a a ... it was for um probably about Twenty years ago\nUm when I get out of hospitals looking for something to do and a media one was often a course in TV production at the time 'cause my hand was cast and it was all kinds of blood and things so it looked interesting\nIt was a federal cost but I'm not up to complete it you had to do it on a a show on something and I still have this near death experience was that drugs they gave me a lot and also I owned a manufacturing company and my manufacturing company was supposed to be haunted by\nPeople that weren't there and uh you know it hurts all kinds of [noise] anyways I ended up with so I you know what I'm going to do it all goes as a lock and uh that's how it all started I went on my first ... TV shows slash\nInvestigation and er I realized that were a lot of things even though I have a good science background that I couldn't explain and I was curious and I'm curious I get them all I did it and eventually I began doing it fulltime\nAnd you love it I Do but they're still\nNot sure of all the things that happen what's real and what's not\nSo you've got a degree in environmental science yeah you're on\nThe moon program as well\nWho are interested in in in ... you were a skeptic but now you're a believer ... you've made this full circle how far are you on the other side now that you believe this\nYou know I Believe there's something out here I Believe in an afterlife do I believe that\nEverything icy and and it's you know I'm always skeptical like my science brave I guess you call it a a like early brain always you know makes me what's going on and I've had a lot of a unique experience is but uh [noise] is enough there that I Know that the experiences have but\nAre they really paranormal already you know something else mentioned Asian or something I just can't explain\nWhat keep striving you why do you keep doing this\nOh there's a lot of reasons the the primaries is to try to understand it more I Try to understand\nAll aspects of the power of them just like going in as a you know well to give you an idea a when I first started doing this I thought that salt mediums where shallow things like a ... at the beach do it for what you're telling a when I met Bahrain I was pretty much of the same cast\nFourteen telling a when I met Bahrain I was pretty much in the same category but I figured it couldn't hurt\nTo at least a try to understand what they are and who they are and what they do\nAnd uh so that's kinda my whole aspects of what I Do even if I don't believe in anything I'm always open minded enough to at least try to understand if I'm going to criticize it I got to know as much as I can about it\nTo do that so that's kinda how a a more open minded but still it at that heavy skepticism\nWhat do you think of her abilities as as a medium\nOr marinas is a very unique and uh you know there are a lot of mediums out there and\nBut uh woodworking with her as she comes up with some amazing stuff and and our trips channel courses it's those skills the crap out of those people who see it so uh yeah and I you know I definitely she believes she has some type of ability\nYou run across a lot of people like her in what you do [laughter] yes and I used to live with\nMe lots of mediums lots of them yeah\nI mean and we you know I also do a lot of studies for instance the physical medium ship is it's something that's always fascinated me in and of course for those who don't know there are two types of a medium ship mental ... ship or a disparate speaks supposedly speaks to\nThem like ... ... Whoopi Goldberg him that the movie ghost\nThat well that's a chance to meet him in in that uh that still that the spirit works through a medium versus a physical medium ship which the spirit comes into our around and actually moved stuff's for ...\nI like the Patrick Swayze and that same movie where they move the coins that\nThose pennies moving and stuff right\nSo I I've been conducting a red light say it is a uh for the last four years to understand physical miniature see is what how much how valid isn't and what type of experiences and see if I can explain some of those experiences\n\n[noise]\nIt was going to be the strongest storm ever on\nFlorida's panhandle ... catalog and Fox News lunchtime today or shortly afterwards hurricane Michael expected to make landfall as a category for hurricane near Panama City Florida Williams above one hundred thirty miles an hour and says Jack up the national Hurricane Center a virtual water rushing onshore\nWe're expecting widespread high storm surges along the coast of Florida possibly in the Appalachian State area to the east and weren't like fly off all the searches could cause a inundation of nine to Thirteen feet above ground level\nA category ... storm will typically damage most roofs blow down most times of demolish mobile homes Florida's governor Rick Scott wanting people in the storm surge wanting areas to get all bell\nMe be clear or get Michael's going very near to where we are the dangers in life threatening major hurricane if you don't follow the warnings from these officials strong peculiar\nBut keeping weather records for one hundred sixty seven years never in the Florida Panhandle but with a category for hurricane the federal emergency management agency has been staging personnel and equipment to respond to sort of the store to staff\nI was going to be stabilization of critical uh our security health and medical energy communicates\nOn last month's Hurricane Florence the storm is expected to move quickly curbing to the northeast and actually the Carolina coast law and by late on Thursday United Nations are bad for Nikki Haley says it on our\nShe'll be leaving her post ... years and the only President Trump months ago she needs to break the president praised about sort of Haley socio level to\nGet a few weeks it's Fox News [noise]\nIt was just\nBecause now more than ever before you\nYou\nFox News rundown going into the major and controversial story to buy a box of scribe now you're a perspective of news you won't find anywhere else going to Fox News for a job\nOn the news they want someone that you try job is to control the talking to Martha ... we're going to ask the question because there's a lot of conventional wisdom out there and then bringing\nMaking sure that people are fully informed for twenty four seven news\nThese are going to be there for a long history of\nThe real news real honest opinion [noise] Capitol\nHearing his first cases yesterday it was the Supreme Court justice\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh's family watched as he took a seat at the end of the Supreme Court right after a welcome from chief justice John Roberts the court heard arguments in a case of prison sentences for repeat offenders cabin all asking several questions\nProtesters did hold signs and check out side to court them many more were lined up for a seat inside the court today the justices consider a federal immigration laws the tension requirements in Washington ...

I actually don't like me and when you give them a body they for\nYou know they they use it sometimes she's thrown herself on line she's throwing me across before dislocated my finger and a couple of things so all we had the air it can be nasty but I I think the the most of them are really not\n... not you've written about Ron happy in your back what does that mean exactly\nYeah no one had made that we've worked together for so many years on and then the beginning you know if I started to transfer channel you know he tried to call me back meeting we you know whether you're weightless I'm an opera him army and what's going on you know it's getting too dangerous\nAnd you know it took us a little while to get that rhythm on wind would talk to her on and say you know in my mind and know what I might appear to be out of control in my mind and actually you know talking to the spirit or trying to you know to connect more or get into more of what they're wanting and what's going on\nSo now I Know I Know that if I Need him to pull me out or to help me in a situation that's not safe\nAnd he's right there so that's having my back and and then if not he'll kind of make sure people don't kind of touched me and go near me to allow me that space to do and I need to do\nLet's go to urban in a state of Maine urban welcome to the program\nAll right thanks for taking my call your thing love your show 'em all along the Gulf is uh I live in a house gets you a hundred and five years old\nAnd my age at about Monday on the experiences that house it's crazy it's actually kinda funny really 'cause I I uh really only have any like hope the dice activity when I I'm trying to fix the house\nIf I like Jay do something on the inside a one time we had gone I've been doing some your ... the majority in the house and I come home and ah\nThat there was a couple or three feet away from my stove that have been ripped off in your every move my laptop though it was like picking up ...\nRight and I go into my bedroom and it would take him to one of my TV they trade and you know the one guy and he kind of set up in front of the couch yeah it does make them that set it up on my bed\nAnd ah I think I Want my wife and my kids have actually seen a kid and a lady that I I actually had never seen those but I heard um I've heard like footsteps iceberg slim has gone\nSo you're pretty convincing other they're\nAll there is no doubt about it [laughter] or absolutely my uh I guess my question is is why why went up to do something to fix the house is that when they seem to get bank\nWildly they probably don't want any changes to the house who do you think Maureen\nYou are right on George um think about it if you put all your effort into a home and you made it what you thought was the best and it was wonderful and then you know you're still there and you're looking at it from a different side and now people are starting to change it you know sometimes that can actually stretch things up\nNo question about that it's just amazing how many different kinds of entities are out there to do whatever they do some are fun some we're having a good time other evil what decides whether they're good or bad to Ron in terms of that\n\nI think it's it's who you are with this this life if you don't change you're pretty much who you are and the next life so if you have to deal with the court quarterly of there are some times\nWhen I eat 'em and don't speak nicely to of as as some people like in ... but they don't deserve that respect it's it's you know if they're ah that'd be any annoying or being\nA offensive to to those who are in this realm now it's it's you know they don't deserve and they you know super respectable\nScore the Giovanni in Los Angeles alone Giovanni\nA out on your it's well thanks I'm and I'm Glad to be back glad you got to fight coughing again here say a wrong green\nISI out there and be careful with uh with all the stuff that you guys are you know you guys are exploring with uh I Know it can be really dangerous I just wanted to share a story minus really quick [noise] uh I ... truck driving right now but I I still do security from time to time\nOne of the places right security with our cat was a um a building called the malls that building and here in downtown LA\nIt's pretty old building it's one of those buildings that I Know\nI did the test of time beautiful architecture and all that stuff\nBut um you know definitely ...

final ... more ghost chronicles Ron where do we get your book\nWell it's a sold everywhere a Amazon and uh all the major bookstores so\nI was only a marine that our dear friend Jeff ... wrote you're a forward to the ...\nOh yeah definitely are yeah go way back he he was always been my mentor when I first went into ghost I think I went on the Web site on the Web which was new and that was the ... site on the ... village so that's a since then we've become really good friends\nThis technology continue to make ghost hunting easier\nUh probably easier but not better not better quicker than it does a lot of um\nThings out there some of them are really junk science but the\n... yeah I don't know I mean spirited but Ralph for you know hundreds and hundreds of years and ah they didn't have a water technical stuff back then yet people still hate experiences though had great experiences and seeing them and everything else I Know now we need a\n... you know it reminds me of ... in all all the physical meaning ship stuff the lead you boards and those were those were designed so that they could eliminate the medium because people want to go directly and that's kind of what these electronic devices that doing that\nThey're trying to get the goes tentative deal directly with her and not have to go through the media when I have to you know almost on demand type of thing but it's yeah I mean there are there are some\nUm\nBetter pieces equipment out there and there are some that are of course but you know there's nothing wrong with the good thermal imaging camera or a good uh I I Can't remember a a good record\nAnd Maureen how 'bout you will technology or change things\nI don't know I honestly don't think that technology has reached the point that makes it more sensitive than human being you know then what we can censor ourselves on and we may be getting ... some areas that they're they're finding out but honestly I don't think it's sensitive enough yet\nSo you're not going to be replaced by a robot ghost investigator anytime\nSharon [laughter] I don't I don't think so\nAll right let's go to a final calls here let's go to Z Hastings, Florida bill's with us and bill are you in a safe haven there ... hurricane headed your way\nWe're on the other side of the state we're south of St Augustine so I think we're uh we're probably going to be safe on the front\nOkay let's pray that everybody else's go ahead bill\nYeah it goes story for you or when we came down here about eight years ago to Florida we were at a a paranormal investigation if you'll Spanish Military hospital in Plano it gets theme which is known to be on there\nAnd while we were there a ghost or this in the middle of the night it goes to actually made it table moves likely up on the second floor\nSo we went up to the second floor and we were able to communicate with the guest wife Susan and I and some other people that were there and we [noise] we any yeah many male flashlight on a table and the ghost could answer our questions by making light link\nAnd uh so risky various questions and we've got it to indicate that his name was ... and then it was a well it's been a nurse at a at the hospital at one time during the Spanish\nPeriod jeez you know I think in that at the time my auntie um I had a brief case with me and I was carrying around a large amount of money\nAnd then subsequently I'm wary about the next year so it time would hear clicking\nNoises that go teasing me that he was opening brief case\nI Love it\nNow while I'm going to happen is um\nIf I drop like a little I don't care for all of a chair or something I'm ... latest about I'm not last July but the one before that the middle of the night well having a little plane bottle campers coming up later that year and it's fun and like I was going to be there for\nWhy are they mischief makers Ron ... what are they trying to accomplish by playing around like that\nSometimes the that just attention seekers they they just want to be seen or\nHeard other words that you know where I Am here pay attention to it if you have a a cat for instance the cats are pretty much like that to a you know they'll they'll come in and do silly things to what you know there there have pay attention to me so I I think that's that's primary it\nBut ah I I have to tell a funny story about the a book I elected to my next door neighbor and ... and the next day I came back I met her and she came back with the book and she said hey I take it back she says we were reading the uh the first chapter and I was having a glass of wine and my glass shattered\nOh so she says I don't want anything to do with it [laughter] it's like glass shattering books his\nJob is and the other interesting\nThing to do anything really what they what to do I believe\n... tweets Tom what do you have a this one from Sarah in Rochester\n... ... each time what do you have a this woman from Sarah in Rochester I'm curious if one were Maureen can recommend ways to prevent ... from coming to a person's life evil into someone's life let's give that to you Maureen\nCall so I don't even leave it to the wrong one [laughter] we'll get own man really well yeah\nYeah see I'm honestly I'm a big believer with the with St Michael so I Know for me that's a key things one is intention if you you know here in Brooklyn for that and you're believing that eagles coming into your life and you know it's very possible that your credit invited in\nOn the other thing is I for instance I have a granddaughter who is you know too young to do that sort of thing but she's picking up the actually she thinks there it's already\nUm so what we're doing is we had a St Michael's prayer cards that I put underneath you know her mattress and then her pillow and I have different varying crystals around the room how many ...\nOn and she's doing a lot better so I Know you know and again and belief right so I Believe it works on its intention networks I think if you have to believe in yourself as well on you can tend to\nHave bought out bought out most times what'd\nYou say you were on what about it\nWell I agree with it away and and you judge because you talk about the the hurry came in your intentions sure make good yeah so and tensions as a hundred percent but being a good old Catholic boy I rely on my religion the costs and so that's that's what I always recommend\nYou you know and I've seen this happen before I've seen hurricanes go from a category four down to two down to one and you know who's the sea prayer is the cause but hey you know what it works\nYeah I'm trying to be a hundred percent with the judge snake\nIn any way we can let's go to bill in Idaho west of the Rockies Hi Bill go ahead dawn okay\nTo say first that uh I think we should all get centered\nIn our heart and intent to dissolve the third yeah I agree [noise]\n... are questioning is probably tomorrow\nI ever\nBeen serving the land for the last six years here I feel it's time for me to go back to serving man\nOf attempted to move in April when I had a series of events that that showed me it was a time yet so my question is would it be tough for me now to leave all\nDid you do a quick little reading here Maureen sure any one moment okay\nWhile you're pulling out to lunch chat with Iran on this what's what are your next project Ron How often do you get cold to investigate\nWell we get caught a few uh you know I Would say like it used to be daily but it's it's probably weekly now and uh we only choose the ones who really want to do basically uh uh\nYou get flooded with requests you know what\nWe do get a lot of them the honest with you judge so uh yeah and you've got to screen them somehow so which is all you know difficult ...\nOkay well let's go back to bill in Idaho and a marine go ahead\nAll right so bell actually called the ... couple of times and one was aspirations paying you know ... to go after what you want right it's almost like a spiritual kind that you know you need to be empowered you this um and it's getting a good idea right you'll know when that moment is right to actually make a change and it seems\nLike them working behind me off I hate and kind of the night I'm working really hard\nAnd it's kind of kind of read some of those benefits and actually to move forward um obviously I Can't tell you what to do but I think that if you were to make a change now would be good\nLooking at the time I really appreciate\nThat okay good luck bill hope everything works out next up we're going to

with us author partner at the sherpas technology group in Silicon valley a former investment banker with UPS in New York He's world view has been turned upside down in the late to two thousand sixteen period when he was exposed to world changing science\nWhich suggested that country the mainstream assumptions consciousness has not produced by the brain now after researching extensively he wrote this book in the end the upside down thinking\nTo introduce all a bus to these cutting edge ideas and you use on coast to coast I've got this really shocked you initially mark didn't it\nAbsolutely shocked me thank you for having me on\nI'm looking forward to this too I always ask questions of gas scientists and people who are experts on the brain\nDodge consciousness exist outside of the brain or not now the pure scientists Joe the medical professional folks mark would always say you have to have the brain in order to have consciousness in the brain dies it all goes with it\nAnd I've always thought now there's something else here which consciousness you finally found out did you\n[noise] I did and I I was very squarely in what's known as the materialist science camp which\nSuggests that the universe is fundamentally made it matter there was a big bang about Thirteen point eight billion years ago selling the universe with physical material that we call matter and when you have enough matter in this big universe you're bound to get interaction between does does it matter we call that chemistry\nWhen you have enough random chemical reactions you're ... you're bound to end up with a self replicating molecule like DNA chance that that would happen and DNA leads to the evolution of living organisms like a human being the human being developed the brain and consciousness awareness comes out of the brain that the perspective\nAnd if you buy into that which I used to you then when the brain dies consciousness dies memories are gone\nThat when you think about meaning in life\nIf you take the material is perspective very strictly there can't be any meaning because once one dead there's now memories there is no consciousness and that's the prevailing perspective as you mentioned in science and most of science today\nKnow looking at your bio I Would lose money in a bet saying that you would write a book about consciousness how in the heck did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter] so it was about two years ago when I first learned\n[laughter] so it was about two years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally material is that is what I Would call it now in hindsight\nBut I I randomly stumbled across a cast that started talking about these ideas I was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the queue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had and at the end of that her name is Laura Powers\nShe mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers\nAnd I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula and I listen to a different episodes and people there were many different people have talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities utility for consciousness to survive bodily debt things I had no familiarity with\nAnd over time just hearing enough different people describing similar perspectives unreality I got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discover a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real\nAnd this was a very jarring and disorienting real issue for me because I thought life was meaningless and here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer of consciousness maybe the brain's more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that processes consciousness\nAnd the identity that we have is not tied to the body so that totally freaked me out\nAnd changed my world you completely led me down the path of intense research because I Need to rethink all reality spent about a year of basically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in financing consulting\nAnd as I was doing that I told friends over time at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive and these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity with the topics\nUm and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight\nSo after hearing enough of this feedback and also seeing that I had intense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened\nSo it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend and I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco and decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days\nAnd ended up writing more than half of the book that's now out\nAnd then finished over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript\nAnd ultimately a whole email do Gladstone who's now my agent at my publisher multiple people recommended that I reach out and I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents that car totally dig deeper Walsh a and so that's where we are\nSuper now what did you mean by an end to upside down thinking\nI consider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness\nWhat I now see to be the more likely picture of reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing yawn space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness consciousness comes first\nRight without the brain does consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests\nNo would science back us up\n[noise] so my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body so one example is chapter nine\nWhere I talk about near death experiences and if you'd asked me a few years ago wasn't near death experience I Would have said well isn't that just a ... nation that happens when someone is about to die it's like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple\nUh first of all what's described in the near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness is not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as they ... out of body experience so the person is out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back to their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that is suggestive of some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark ... bird dot com is linked up for you at ... dot com the name of his book we're talking about in into upside down thinking me or read the subtitle dispel the myth that the brain produces conscious does\nAnd the implications for every day like we are going to take phone calls next hour with mark and I'm going to come back we'll talk with them about\n... mission to love to see how that all works out signed the the brain and what's causing [noise]\nDuring the ... page with thousands of members ... connecting with other means ... to ... dot com slash goes to ... him and the like button [noise]\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up to the pre cognition tell like has a cycle ... says you you of course mourned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nAbsolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science and controlled study that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about ... what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation my aunt who was a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigating telepathy and uh she ... she came out with some ... things but what did you find\nIt yeah I thought that he's a very important phenomenon it's it's mine too mine communication and just taking a quick step back\nThe reason that I then each of these phenomenon is that I reason that\nThe material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain that perspective cannot account for things like to laugh at the end the other things will talk about and I read them that any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture does work\nSo weaponry to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns held experiments and the basic design is as follows and I should say that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter and when you combined the results\nThe statistics are very compelling mhm doctor dean rating who just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called six sigma\nSix sigma refers to statistical odds against chance when you get a stick stick my result the odds of it that the effect is just happening by chance is more than a billion to one and in telepathy we have six sigma results\nSo the gun spelled experiment the study has one person in a room we'll call him Bob and very very relaxing state listening to relaxing music there's another person let's call hurricane who's in another room\nJane is given a picture by the experiment yours and the experimenter state game I Know that sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally sent\nA picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room the gate is mentally sending this image to Bob Bob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what picture game was looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all that Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent right\nNow I'm going to be the ... the last probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials but instead it's closer to thirty two percent\n\nSo from a statistical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect is twenty five versus thirty two this is massive statistically it's suggested something is getting through\nAnd it actually conforms to our commonsense everyday experience because\nIf we were one hundred percent ... then we would know each other's thoughts all the time sure is that it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they text you or they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two versus twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nWhat could increase ... percent mark is at the center or the receiver\n[noise] this is something that that needs to be explored much more ah but what we see with people who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a have had been involved in the U. S. government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and\nPeople who are better meditate or ... seem to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI've always wondered though if somebody is really tuned into certain things if they can pick up all kinds of different events without really having the sender\nHeavy much to do with it I I I think that's a receiver might have a better effect in changing the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... ethic or communications with the deceased\nThrough medium ship these are people that tend to be picking up information\nAnd if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's it's helpful metaphor where there's a consciousness that not localized to the body those who are able to better configure their antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular center or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver the person in the room and simply not show them any of the four pictures but they just had to tell you what they think she said to them\nWhat do you think would happen well well I think\nWe'd have a distribution first of all we had just an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic then we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw at the U.S government uh but if it's an everyday person I think it would be more difficult study to examine because the effect is so small\nWell let's talk about the U.S government studies in uh the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me I'm the program is sometimes referred to as Stargate Program and use psychic spies for national security purposes\nMany of the arena been on this show by the way\nUp during the Cold War and the people who were involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many reviewers who are involved to say this was a real so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real [noise] I'm\nIn my book I I have some documents from the CIA which had been declassified recently and the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was one but we're\nAnd the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the ... he was one but remote viewing is the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being they're physically\nSo it's like you could see something in your mind that far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes it sounds completely paranormal consciousness is localized to the brain\nBut if consciousness is non local then it's at least conceivable\nDocument\nUm say explicitly and I am looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon\nThis is from a declassified documents that has been released recently [noise] so I mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that and my business world as I had a consulting case for example that's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me at least made me question things\nUm even further than that there's a page on science channel and there's some very credible people including someone from Cal Tech the next page in the document says science panel's report principle findings either direct quotes implications are revolutionary\nEvidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we have looked at these a tele ... studies and I've always wondered\nIf the government really never stopped doing it but continued now I've asked some of the people who've been involved in these studies\nThat just that same question and they said no it stopped because they would have kept us on they would've used us I'm not sure what the government has found other people and they've continued these kinds of mine studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used\nTo find a downed Russian bomber in an African jungle that they couldn't find so there was some utility to the program whether it was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful\nSo you'd have to think that if if it were a useful thing to be doing that a organizations would be trying it\nPre cognition mark a very valuable tool for people in their life because of the ability to sense things make decisions based on those gut feelings and to react to them now a lot of people don't react\nThey don't do it it's something happens when they go oh I should have done that and I I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre cognition\nSo there are some studies which show a very subtle pre cognition known as pre sentiment where the bodies sensing something very subtly and we need to stick to show it before something happens\nAnd there are other examples where it's much more explicit where a person has a dream known as a creek pocketing dream the dream something and then the next day it happened exactly as they dreamed it that much less subtle but if we go to the pre sentiment studies this is where I think it becomes very compelling again if we look at the meta analysis of all the statistics\nThat basic design is as follows it reverses what we look at in psychology typically and in psychology the typical study is you show someone a picture let's say at the neurotic image or a violent picture\nWe know that the body will unconsciously respond to it though the skin response the pupils dilate the brain and the heart respond\nNine Seventy\nOr again Michael gets even more fears I'm Dave Anthony Fox News
