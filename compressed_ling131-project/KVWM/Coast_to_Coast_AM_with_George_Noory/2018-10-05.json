percent of the take or or just a nominal salary he took the salary he said I ... in in that I can\nI can do that one better I he ... he he got paid with a painting of Michael Jackson [laughter]\nThat was probably worth something [laughter]\nNext up let's go to chip he's in North Carolina forty nine years old chip to go to movies\nI'm Sorry you go to movies\nI did yesterday yesterday I just saw the ... super well we got him and uh on my list I haven't\nSeen it yet oh it's awesome it's part of the uh\nUh because doing\nFor me I Love those yes the great um\nWhat I told you about is or what your thoughts on the fog and sands has on what your two of my favorite a horror movies from the early eighties I\nI absolutely love than has been a fan has them was a made on the weekends or the ... the kids who may fantastically smoke dope all week and then on the weekends the shot bans has them and um and when they when a cost to really uh [noise] you know took him almost a\nReally long schedule I think it took him almost the whole year\nShe'd all the footage for the film and um but when they put it all together a it was a great blend aside by an were and imitated a lot throughout the eighties I think the kind of hearken that sort of blend of fantasy side by and horror that you see\nIn a lot of later uh eighties films in the tall man stands as one of the most memorable screen villains a full time\nUh and the fog is truly creepy great film great atmosphere Adrian Barbaro great go story about um the letters or a Nineteen names that come back but the goal the through the fog\nOr it's just a so good you know are so many great performances how whole workers the priest\nWhich I think was originally supposed to be um\nRonald pleasant but I don't know what he was doing at that time but\nYou know it it just a John Carpenter again we've mentioned several of junk carpet assume hollow losing one of them are they live being one of them the fog on them one of them so I mean John John Carpenter you know next to Steven King I mean John Carpenter dominated the eighties or with a lot of really wonderful imaginative felt\nWere these inexpensive movies to make\nA comparatively I mean we weren't like Star Wars movies you know I'm thinking of the great thing about a horror film um the beauty of a horror film is that you know you can scare some even take sixty thousand dollars and make fourteen million dollars from\nYeah you have the right to distribution absolutely\nSo so then I think that that's why it's such a hearty genre because you can make it on the cheap usually the darker you make it in the more interesting than it is um the more the mind uh takes over you know the less the shark you see the more effective jaws was the last of the alien the\nScarier the alien was so you know there is a lot to ah the slight I think it's very easy to over produce core I think it's a horror movie has too much money and it\nIt seems protected you know you look at the second Terminator movie you know it it it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one because the shift too much money and it feels like a franchise\nSo um you know a horror film you know you almost with the cats the budget because if you put too much money and do it\nIt's stopped flu like a surprise in in his ... he can eat the train coming down the track no one is going to you know one shouting grew is going to scare you you know so you it has to kind of be a slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think that's why a lot of low budget horror films like\nUp here on ... and I think that's why a lot of low budget horror films like not to let him get grant a are incredibly scary and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell have made a living doing lower budget horror film seventh day\nAbsolutely yeah he's like the Olivier around he really is\n[laughter] and uh you know and I you know I got to interview him and he's charming guy and ah you know he uh he loves the you know he ... he doesn't like it but he he likes it he liked the attention like an\nHe likes to paycheck\nTo paycheck absolutely you know and ah I'm evil dead is a is a great uh a film for an actor I mean he pretty much is carrying that whole movie on his back he's putting himself through\nA you know all of these ... it's almost like a Chapel Hill where it's just it's you just following through all of these tap blows that they've created for him so it it you know ... not too many actors can can carry a whole movie on their back\nWhat do you think of the Stephen King movies from his books that all seemed to have that horror type feeling for him a pet cemetery in things like\nThat yeah yeah I mean I I like Stephen King films a lot more than the books I mean but I'm yellow film guy you know people always say oh well the book was better it's like they're not exchange commodities you know I mean a dance is different than a sculpture\nYou know ... book is different than a movie or just you know when you're in the mood for a movie you you you're not in the mood to read a book and vice versa and it works in a book doesn't work in a movie and I I think that a lot of my favorite Stephen King stuff is all the short stories I think novels or to\nA pattern to long winded you know what I understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met the man\nBut you know he doesn't know where the story and when you start he just he just keeps writing he he used to just as surprised as we are because he just keeps writing and drinking and writing and finished you know and and then uh you know five hundred pages later it's done so there's NO PLAN\nGoing in ... which I still allows for him to the ... you know again ... ... there was no formula so I can say that but that's why it's books are so surprising but I think at the same time [noise] you know a good director can kind of oil back down to ask them\nYou know he hated the film the shining and the film a shining I think stand is one of the best pieces of art you know the twentieth century so I you know I don't know\nWhat about TV shows that are dealing with horror like the walking dead and things like that\nUh yeah it's interesting because you know I mean the walking dead I definitely I feel like O's every night of the living yes and now it's kind of come down to the main stream I'm Down to the front line you know you go into the wall Mart and you see the you know or the rubber ears that you hang around your neck or the\nYou know the whatever get inside the signs and you know it it's all um it's a very commercial\nUm you know I think that uh you know the soap opera um and I think it's kind of cowboys and Indians to smoke that um you know modern zombie movies you know I Know ... is the enemy that you can shoot and not feel so out of out\nAnd we don't have you know we're we're in the world of you know we're very politically correct world there there are there aren't many a screen villains that you can kind of indiscriminately um shoot down mowed down with a gun and it has no uh ... you know a\nRepercussion repercussions\nWe're going to come back and take some final phone calls in a moment with

it\nInteresting take the people make movies for YouTube\nAh people do make movies for YouTube I mean you to having a lot of problems with a indies right now because uh they're changing a lot of their

ah\n... I may not have been jury but it might have been the producers that took advantage of that\nPerhaps it but the wacky world of Dr Marcus I think is probably the first movie about a whore house that I Know of uh and uh you know he was below up in St Louis than in Louisiana and Detroit or\nDetroit you know he had he had a he had a remarkable run a and ah you know of course he's always it's always been a favorite of a gift of mine or whatever he appeared on coast to coast there\nI uh ended up working at the TV station in Detroit that he was working at he had left so I didn't meet him there but he was my boyhood idol I Love the guy\nIn how ... how could you not\nAnd then we got to know each other through coast to coast which was an amazing thing and for ah for Christmas one day my network\nFlew him to Los Angeles from New Orleans as a president for me and this was so weird Mr mobile because I was on the phone with him a interviewing him\nAnd all of a sudden his voice got more and more distorted ... strange you can hear him but it was just echo we and all of a sudden he walks in the ... in my studio\n[laughter] very ... it was my ...\nWhat a great trick like like I say are you out of here\nAnd wanna talented guy he was innovative you know during those days\nWe didn't have a lot of like computer animation and things like that everything he did was innovation and he was just he was funny because his experiments all sealed on television on purpose but everything he did failed and it was just hilarious\nUh yeah ... it would ... it was like watching the ... you know he would create the illusion so perfectly and then he would shatter it it's really amazing really amazing to see his stuff very funny\nSo who you yeah very clever he came into the studio and were live and he said that he is invented a new force field barrier that stops anything and he told me to take a swing at him\nAnd I said no I'm not going to do it and he said he said uh George George this works this works now popped pocket he right here in the ... are you in the mouth\nAnd I did and I knocked is to sell [laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter]\n[laughter] oh my God everything like that anyway let's go to the calls here one of the time\nWe go next to Tricia pie in California ...

Oprah and then I went to bed at night and I woke up the next morning completely petrified you know the whole idea of having to fundraise and all the rest of it and\nSo at lunch I think Tim very profusely and explains that I really wasn't going to be able to do it and he said oh Marilyn stop worrying about the money the money will come and I'd like to say it was just that easy but uh we did accomplish something that now has been all over the world translated into multiple languages and\nAired on Oprah about two years ago so it's been out there and making 'em an impact with people who are struggling\nOur goal in both the film and the book was to help transform that fear that people have into an inspiration for really living well\nI mean I always tell people I'm not in a hurry to leave but I'm not scared if we have to do it\nRight and we will\nEventually all of the world that's the whole interesting thing to in terms of future science you know we see now that all the cloning is happening they've just cloned um eggs that can be fertilized to turn into humans in a petri dish\nEach crazy it's amazing it's it's truly spectacular\nYou learn how to download memory and preserve it on a chip watch and then click on your body and then put your memory into the body we live forever\nYeah that may be how we get life on Mars or future beyond that is that it's going to come with you know some kind of genetic manipulation and cloning and\nYou know it may not be that this physical body goes out into space but that it's generations later through these kind of scientific interventions that we start to see the future of humanity\nWhat'd you say to people Maryland who say hogwash life after death does not continue when we die ... ...\nWell I'm In a respectful that people have various different perspectives different world views and my inclination is to think that what we really believe\nIs probably what we're gonna end up in\nA so those people who believe in reincarnation may well reincarnate and those people who believe in sort of the Buddhist journey of enlightenment um may end up through in a you know maybe in a black hole somewhere you know alternating at the the threshold of\nPaul somewhere or alternating at the the threshold of some event horizon I mean I think all of those things that seemed completely farfetched in the past and now something that we can really start to grapple with when I made the film I interviewed a Michael ... who is\nHe's ... he's the skeptic the well known skeptic he's also you know a really smart guy very interesting and a nice guy he's a nice guy\nYeah I Would say so and I had a really great time interviewing him and what was fascinating there were two things first of all I he acknowledged that one has mom died he hurt her voice\nAnd I ... you know with a little surprised that he was telling me this on film and I said well really let you know go back to that and he said oh well you know it was really nothing but yeah I heard her voice\nAnd I thought well that's interesting acknowledge Mitt and he had a good psychological justification that was just some kind of hitting that God jak experience right at that threshold them of sleep and dreaming\nBut it was interesting that he acknowledged it and then the second thing that I I really loved was that um he got married shortly after my interviewing him\nAnd I guess they got married in either his house or has a now White House and her father grandfather I Can't remember the details exactly but had left her a radio\nAnd uh it didn't work and Michael had tried and tried to fix it and eventually in frustration he stuck to the radio in a drawer\nAnd didn't think about it anymore and then months later they were having their wedding ceremony and in the middle of the ceremony all of a sudden they start hearing music playing\nAnd they proceeded to complete the ceremony and went in and followed the music and it was that radio and his wife was quite convinced that this had something to do with her departed loved one Michael wrote a column in Scientific American where he\nStarted to play with the idea that maybe that was something more and his colleagues came down so hard on him that he retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of entrenched position of skepticism\nWell what's important to as a skeptic is not a non believer a skeptic wants proof\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it was the dogma tests where the people who really understood anew and the skeptics were the ones who are questioning it wasn't like they deny the existence of these things but they wanted to raise questions and I think that's different than the bunker\nI think so too and it's a ... I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism is the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulse\nYou got it Marilyn stay with us we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work\nIn our final our next hour we'll take phone calls about this but I also want you when we come back to talk about this\nStory of reincarnation up on a little child that was born with three ... of march\nAnd we'll talk about that it's an amazing story so many more Dr

makes life possible also consciousness and he leaned as well and Marilyn would you tell us the story of the reincarnation of the little child\nWell there's so many stories but I'm\nJust want him to step birth march or something like\nRight well Stevenson was a very unusual psychiatrist who developed a very strong interest\nA very unusual psychiatrist who developed a very strong interest in trying to document cases of reincarnation and he collected about a thousand case studies of young children who had had\nA some experience in the past life that they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read medical reports\nAnd in about thirty five percent of the people that he identified they had some kind of unusual birth mark\nA so it's not a typical mould but some kind of unusual birth mark and it was often associated with the cause of death of the person that the young child remembered\nSo there were numerous examples where for a for instance one child remembered being a man from a different village\nOr in Asia and he um [noise] in Stevens and then went and investigated the biography of this person that the child remembered being and it turns out that that person was shot through the chest in the same place\nEntry and exit of where the bullet ostensibly went through the body and so that becomes a kind of biological sources evidence for reincarnation and these young people you know it's not absolutely evidence but\nOr evidence Shaw but it's still compelling\nIn our film we interviewed Jim Tucker who now works in the same Institute at the University of Virginia that in Stephenson had founded and he tells the story of a young boy who uh you know very early just about the time he learned to speak\nRemembered being his grandfather and he would tell his dad when his dad was changing his diapers a I used to change your diapers\nAll\nAnd it was kind of shocking for these parents and the sure and\nThen this kid started remembering other things about the kind of car that he used to drive and so as a little test the ah parents got a bunch of pictures from the dad and the first of all they had a class picture when he was in elementary school\nAnd so this would be the child grandfather and they asked him to pick out which one was him and he had no problem finding himself in the line up\nAnd then ah they were going through some of the other snapshots and he saw his car and he said that's my car that's my car I used to drive their car and so again it's not\nDefinitive evidence that there is a kind of um survival of consciousness or identity after ... death but these instances give us really compelling ideas about what is possible\nThat it's truly remarkable you remember the study of the little boy who claimed that he was a World War two pilots\nAnd the new things about the plane landed too hard the tires would blow up and really nobody knew that other than the crew and the pilot\nAnd he was telling his ... and they and they got the ... and uh they took him to a reunion a a World War two veterans and he knew shovel of the people from his unit was an amazing story you remember the case\nI'm I'm vaguely remembering it I don't remember the details of it but I think you're right these things are phenomenally intriguing and it's very exciting I Know that the University of Virginia right now is hiring a post dot\nTo work part time with them and part time at the Monroe Institute to do some psycho physiological research on this\nAh we're right now setting up a lab here at Sophia to look at the cycle manned him and this was a a technique that was used by the ancient or colds and greets yes and they um ... ostensibly were able to identify and communicate with spirits\nBy looking at are gazing upon a reflective surface and Raymond Moody develops this protocol where he put people in a darkened room\nPut a mirror on the wall illuminated the mirror and such a way that you couldn't see your own reflection but because you're kind of going into a trance state people start to see things and hear things and experience things and uh you know there's been a number of experiments looking at\nPeople's ability to make contact with their departed loved ones and they have those kind of conversations that they never had a chance to have and it has been shown to be extremely\nA useful for a ... counseling so people have an opportunity they have the conversation they can see it\nThey can see there's the spirits and so what we're doing now is bringing that idea into a virtual reality environment so we'll have people sitting with the virtual reality goggles uh\nLooking at a mirror in a sensory deprivation procedure and we're going to record and try to understand what it is that people are experiencing when they enter that state\nOne of her very special guests author and researcher Rosemarie Ellen ... uses black moon ... to do a lot of those\n... and actually really strange uh-huh what\nA worthy interested in talking to her yeah\nYeah just to do with the charm if you would have marijuana in June get you in touch with her on her website is visionary ... dot com you might be more humid was straight through there\nOkay but what you're saying even that title for website is really not so much about what happens after but\nHow those ideas and beliefs inform how we live now and you know we know that people are believe different things even within a common culture a all we have to do is look at the political debate that's happening right now to know that\nPeople justify their beliefs based on different kinds of evidence and while in our culture we tend to\nUm hold in esteem the idea of rations rationality about reason about the idea of objectivity we we make appeals that if we have good objective data that that then is the evidence it's going to shape our beliefs\nBut what we see is that it's most often something else it's most often a personal direct experience something emotional or transformative and that's what really shaped our belief and then we just rationalize the rest of it in the name of objective data\nAbsolutely our special guest Dr Marilyn ... we're talking about the really things dealing with ... and the other side how many people who believe in a life after death also believe in God what do you think the percentage Maryland\nI think it's a tricky question on the Korean War and plenty [laughter] I Love that about you George\nCorinne ... [laughter] I Love that about you\nGeorge [noise] um I think that it really depends on what people believe going into it and what they defined God to be for example in um the Christian tradition there can be a lot of fear of\nYou know the afterlife because it can be met with you know I'm\n... well ... and if you're eligible to of course\nRight hell and damnation can be very very scary\nWhereas if you're coming from a Buddhist tradition where there isn't a God per se but there's this idea of\nYou know consciousness as the ground of all being so in a certain sense consciousness become God a that can be a much more\nUm a beautiful journey towards something that allows us\nA sense of safety and hope\nOptimism so I think you know those preconditions that shape what our culture tells us is true can very much influence how we think about the afterlife and how we hold our relationship to the divine\nYou talk about the denial about that so many people ... why do they would have the freedom\nI think we as human beings are hard wired to be afraid of uncertainty\n\n[noise]\nHe cannot vote school for lunch dot lawn jak Callahan Fox News was that it will take its procedural vote is holding the

good question but doesn't believe in spirit and thanks okay I haven't been listening to you know all of the programs from way back when on bell is on and his wife and the U. S.\nAnd I've had this experience and I don't know who who tell him to some time now my husband of course was a known believer after he passed away about just three days um but before this happened\nOn the surface burial service on a hill\nJust says he was going down into the ground yeah the phone came all\nThe way it was wild and when and everything it just happened so fast and then it stopped it took only a few minutes it was very odd no we were leaving the cemetery my son the oldest one\nSaid mom when we were getting into the car to go home dad came home with us wow this is what do you mean\nHe got in the car also\nBecause they could just smell him call was filled with his body odor and my husband was very mean person but he had this sense about him he wasn't a smoker nothing but here comes my son said that and I guess that's cool\nThat's in a few nights pass always sleeping and my left foot but still bothering me from the accident and we add that's here is from the escalator and um\nI was so on and say no\nI called my ... going up in the air and they was my husband at the end of the bed lifting my left foot wow\nYou could clearly see him\nOh beautiful yes yes yeah he always wore his white T shirt in the neck and short yeah the ten short dog and he passed away before he couldn't hit Ninety four so sorry just\nPretty good run though wasn't it\nAll he wasn't perfect\nI'm so sorry just pretty good run though wasn't it\nAll he wasn't perfect specimen that doctors always asked what do you do for aid that he was Seventeen year old man in Ninety three as\nI said nothing he does it all the exercises you know and walk and he watches his diet my husband never had already come on him but George this is the thing he pulled my leg up and I woke up and I said you know and I looked at him like sitcom that hurts\nMy foot hurt and he says I Want you to take care of this Fort ... by the the the doctor can\nHe dropped it and that was it it was very upset I wasn't neglect\nCan you go to the doctor ... after that\nYes I hadn't been but the thing is George my mother also came to the game I you know he was a non believers as I told you\nBut they are able to church course good Christian person [noise] but they even taught Sunday school sits there Dr in but the thing is he only after seven years this happened he says Alice\nMother came to visit me\nI said when when we lived on ... street but I said why didn't you tell me after seven years you're telling me he said I didn't want to tell you what was it all about what she stood at the end of our bed and and ... he got up and there she was standing at the end of the bed\nAnd mom what what is it you know and he says well Tom\nI Want to know how else is doing 'cause I was six months pregnant when she passed away and she was concerned how might help but snowing she passed away much first he was only fifty\nFour new something to how old are you know what I'd like you for Ninety four good for you\nAnd I'm the senior George I had been wind called several times\nBecause we listen to you every night my son and I and he's a believer now like you know it wasn't a believer in school but he's been listening to your program\nAnd he has changed and full of wonderful he believes in an afterlife and so he's not afraid that thing on just like they have looked you know other\nChildren who are did not believe is that just go to church all the time but they\nDon't they don't believe yeah they don't believe in the afterlife but the thing is George I had been having just\nFirst attack when I was seven years old I was going I Love to be a Catholic but I'm not Catholic I'm everything as my dad says just you know how would you what were you raised that\nWe were raised as just from a hot kissing your church is right here right in your heart\nNo formal no formal\nYou have to go to a certain church never my dad with my dad was a Roman Catholic my government Nelson was also and they were the Catholic they were ... but he became a father and and um and then it gets hot and in in his late seventies\nHe wanted to become a purchase\nAnd I said that what happened\nHere because the British people don't go to war they don't think it'd be fighting all the time was when you read the Bible you know it's always fighting on George you know the Bible\nI I haven't read the Bible to into law school and everything but the thing is this happened to me when I was seven years old because my two girlfriends were Catholic they went to the Sacred Heart church and um [noise]\nWell when India one and the Catholic so I went to go with them seven o'clock masks on Sunday and I wouldn't have breakfast too because you get neglect to confession\nAnd I can eat also\nBut there was a while they were getting dark confession done and I'm I was sitting there at the Pew and\nI just thought you had passed out my neck fell on the back of the computer you know yeah so I my breathing was cut off\nYou know you could have died I yeah I was that's when I met Jesus I mean this is something that just this day you know and even the priest when they came to get me to them that they saw that with a goner\nI'm but you've been through a lot of me when when my two girlfriends well right yeah and they came up to me when they came back they said oh this is\nAnd you know what Jesus was already a stretch and and the angel behind him you know when George I had never seen anything so beautiful my life and we never had color t._v. or in Boulder you had was raised you at home back into thirty\nWere in those days that's all you know surgeries\nAnd now I tell you what I had all the callers and when I hear your caller called in to say they they ... they had been up and came back I find it very difficult to believe some of the story because\nMy visit with not one that I Know what he looks like yours was a good business\nWas beautiful George and Jesus just so happened to them [laughter]\nI Love hey we're going to take a quick break in a moment Marilyn was recalled Ninety four years old\nSo inspiring Alice thank you and also one of the things couple things one is\nA lot of people do feel lonely when they have these experiences because our culture isn't more supportive and so I think what else is saying is um it really helps to have programs like yours\nWhere people can hear from others and know that they're not you know isolated they're not crazy they had these experiences and there's something to it\nThere's no doubt about that Maryland We're going to come back and take final phone calls with you just a moment in Dallas you keep calling us from want you to get the Ninety five Ninety six Ninety seven too long\nThat you think would agree to go door to use my mom

very interesting\nResearch some of my colleagues ... others at the Institute in Atlantic sciences we're looking at\nThe possibility that when a medium is getting information that is accurate as compared to when it's inaccurate\nThere may be measurable differences in the brain and in fact that's what they found it was a preliminary study but it showed that when people evaluated\nThe statement made by the medium as having been accurate or correct\nThat the ... the memory center of the brain kind of cleared out it was as though the brains of these mediums we're creating a space for another set of memories to come in I find that extremely provocative and interesting\nSo yeah I think there's there's all kinds of mysteries in this world and science we're only beginning to approximate some of these experiences that people have\nHarry Houdini spent most of his life chasing down mediums wanting to try to communicate with is dead mother he was on successful\n[noise] well I think there's been a lot of\nFraud there's been a lot in this direction and that doesn't mean that all instances of communication are wrong or inaccurate so\nYou know again it's how do we know what we know and what is the basis of formulating our beliefs are convictions and are they right or not you know it's often we get stuck in places that aren't necessarily the best path forward\nBack to the phones now we go George in Corpus Christi Texas with us George\nEurope hello George either hurt I'm just like oh what a lot of the callers call is uh is higher consciousness or\nIs it or humanities destiny because of all or you know are we going that way is is that going to be the only save your or everything that we do and uh the lady before a spot on she said\nIt was about the heart and mhm a final believe that it is just the heart and soul\nOr heart pills what the soul to do and the soul who's on and I just want to hear her say about that and I thank you so much I Love the show\nThank you Joe and scientists are beginning to think the heart is much more than a pope Maryland\nAnd the guts I mean we know that we have multiple sources of intelligence in our bodies and I think that's extremely interesting I don't know and the answer to the question are we evolving toward a higher consciousness or\nAre we evolving towards greater levels of complexity in technology but\nI'm more allergy and our ethics haven't really changed that much I've been watching\nA show on the ... cheese\nAnd we know that you know they were catalytic to the time of the renaissance and\nPromoting our ten language and science but at the same time there was enormous corruption and you know people poisoning other people to get them out of the way or you know really creating false narratives about people talk about false news\nUm fake news you know it's been happening and I think people have manage their\nInability to resolve different points of view through violence and I'm not seeing right now that there's a whole lot\nOf alternative higher level um meaning centered altruistic kinds of principles that are certainly being\nCommunicated in the popular media by our political leaders I'm just not seeing a lot of\nUh references to a hopeful message for our own evolution toward something higher if we want to use that metaphor and it doesn't mean I'm not hopeful because I also see that\nIf we want to use that metaphor and it doesn't mean I'm not helpful because I also see that there is tremendous good in the world and often times we just need to shine the light on\nThat I think eventually good beach over evil don't you\nI sure hope so I mean I think if we have an option of what to believe that's a good one to believe in\nYou sound a little tentative though about\nThat I Am a little um ...\nYeah I'm a little skeptical of how much we can simply just say yes everything's going to be fine you know I'm just not sure that that's really where the story goes I think each of us in our life can make choices and do we want to\nAh grab hold of our highest potential do we want to develop our social and emotional intelligence you know those things take effort and if not people can just\nResort back to these kind of base impulses that come from the ... on the fight or flight and we don't really get that prefrontal cortex involved in a way that allows us to make wise decisions\nAnd one of the things we see about aging and talking to Alice was that ah we know as people grow older\nAh there is this concern that we lose memory but at the same time we gain wisdom so it's as though we get these ... that help us to\nManage our lives better and so that's one of the hopeful things at least in terms of our own life development is as we grow older we may lose some of the detail but will gain greater insight\nAll right let's go to first time caller Michael driving in Ohio Hi Michael go ahead sure\nTheir village okay thanks\nI just wanted to call because I had this story that I have that uh\nI'd listen to the Maryland than I normally listen deal might not ever have anything to say you know I don't have any stories of my own but this one you got one while I was a kid I was hit by a truck when I was riding my bicycle and I didn't die or anything you know I didn't like have a near death experience but I remember\nGetting hit by the truck I remember hitting the ground and then the next member have after that is the sky looking up at the sky but then I looked down and I can see a circle of people around me weigh in on the ground\nAnd I was just wondering if that's like something you've ever heard of before like it's not a near death experience but it's definitely it out of body experience\nI live in Maryland you had something like that\nYeah that sounds very similar to my experience and again I think what's helpful in telling each other these stories is that it helps us to remember our own ... instances of this and yeah that sounds like a very\nA predictable kind of near death out of body type experience and it suggests that consciousness may have the capacity\nTo move outside of our physical embodiment\nWhat is the no webpage experience the organization of course named after one Michel ... sciences but what is the no wedding experience me\nWell no what it comes from the Greek meaning a direct knowing so you might think about kind of what we've been talking about tonight the

I mean I don't know if I classify shining at the slasher\nUm but it's certainly a horror film and and and and ... and ... and a and a good one and I think it's what I mean forty years old or something now right you know these these are these modern horror films are pretty are uh you know the ring is Twenty years old you know so um [noise] you know it's a\nYou know a lot of them are are are ah you know whoa hold up pretty well um with age and I I really I think a Halloween the first call I mean\nIs really a pretty suspenseful movie and Donald pleasant this really excellent that's kind of like the captain Ahab trying to stop this uh you know maniacal a killer actually not even maniacal\nThat someone from Nineteen Seventy eight man\nNineteen Seventy eight it is a forty year anniversary of the original Halloween imagine it's been that long like gosh\nUh and John Carpenter who of course ah gave us a the remake of the thing that came from New York and a bunch of other uh [noise]\nOr films a science fiction a heat of the original concept was that it was going to be an anthology is that every Halloween they would do a different theme or different type of scary movie and the first story was called the babysitter killers\nAnd and the babysitter killer a and that was the ... that was the Michael Meyers story ... story kicked in and uh the character became so popular um the mask he's wearing that\nWe're trying to come up with a scary math and and and what they ended up doing was taking a William Shatner Star Trek mask and spray painting it white\n[laughter]\nSo That's William Shatner math ... wearing\nUm\nI Wonder how I built feels about that yeah I don't\nKnow uh but uh you know ... and so it you know the fact that it puts a blank you know expression on the mask and and and not deliberately scary face\nA you know I think that that made it more uh more scary you know I think a lot of times they are newer movies they try to heart you're talking about the conjuring and some of 'em there was a family of films there's an of bell which uh\nKnow the original tall but the Warren are having their a basement full of uh object\nIs Iraq at the end all and we all know what raggedy and looks like and the one that they had ended up doing in the movie they tried to make it look scary a it looks like something out of your Halloween you know and and and it's just\nIt's it's a you know it no one would trust the stalled for two seconds you know they're like oh what a beautiful dog with its like horrific looking right off the bat you know it's much scarier when it's something you least expect you know no one would think that\nThat there are little record the ant all is gonna gonna try to possess them or ... ...\nComing up on fifty years Rosemary's Baby can you believe that started to leave that either a ... to she was just almost a kid when she started in that movie\nShe was she was you know and that was kind of you know she got kind of a controversial sort of mob look with short hair right she ... proteges you know\nAnd that's true and that didn't last too long but you're right\nYou know and and uh you know a William Castle wanted to make that move you know William Castle was the producer\nOf course in the fifties was famous for his gimmicks you know all like emerge Joe and uh you know I always feel the ... and the seats and the uh uh you know all of these are moving gimmicks\nOf a house on haunted hill and ah um you know straight\nJak classics hold on for a second Mr logo rent a break we'll come back with more next our phone calls you will share your movie experience with Mr ... later on on the coast to coast they\nDo have a photo that you think would interest that goes to ... we're always on the hunt for unique an unusual images for a photo gallery to submit your image simply go to coast to coast am dot com and most over the media button on the upper navigation bar you'll see the submission option [noise]\nKind I'm the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it's kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching these movies the kind of be with my dad and that he would be in the recliner and watch them creature features and I'd be next to him or hiding behind the recliner some time\nAnd you know it ... I think it was maybe I don't know if it was crawling hand or just the hand but they had this very convincing\nHand ... ... it's embodied hand crawling by itself\nAnd I and and I'm ... I'm ... and it bothered me so much to my dad's ... you know if the rubber hand that they still with great jelly and you know are manipulating with liars and ... and I'm sure his explanation was dead wrong but but it put into this perspective a\nWay if this is fun time they're playing this is a show this\nIs this is this is this is a game you know this is something can make a ... this isn't something that just the torture me this is this is something for fun\nAnd I think that was kind of an odd kind of moment and I think from that point forward\nOr I couldn't get enough you know I was a high ... if it ... ... and not just for all of your horror I feel is is that under ... under the bigger umbrella of fantasy though uh\nI think the horror is an offshoot of fantasy and so it's fine I I like all of that I like uh oh I was younger movies I like ah you know monsters and\nThen the robots in inches and pirates and all\nMy dad used to bring me God rest his soul to all these movies when I was a kid I I remember him taking me to see the ... when I was seven years old Mr ... oh yeah and then of course the scary one for me I was nine years old the house on the haunted deal\nWith the original one with Vincent Price right I mean\nHow so how do I want a blind woman in the cellar man I thought\nHe would bring me to all these movies I don't know if he brought me because my mom didn't want to go when we when we just wanted me around but\nI mean all these all these movies he would bring me too yeah and then the the TV shows he would love to see\nScience fiction theater in in ... in those kinds of shows right you know he'd have them on all the time I I think he's one of the reasons why my mother is one of the reasons why I got into broadcasting and I'm you know into UFOs and the paranormal\nBut my dad got me into these movies and all these science fiction shows he loved those things\nWill sure you know in all of those and I think it all ties together you know because I think that curiosity you know I'm just the fact like just like a like a show like Star Trek my you know kind of brought us the cell phones and and ah you know all sorts of thing\nYou know I think that that the curiosity for this a coping a supernatural you know I think it is probably the genesis Steve although a lot of um your your guests on your show who who started watching these uh\nMovies in and decided to go hey let's dig deeper what you know are there goes let's find out\nI think so too what do you think of the Texas Chainsaw massacre Nineteen Seventy four version\nOf the Texas Chainsaw massacre ... has had the heaviest wrap everyone was trying to do the Texas Chainsaw massacre there is hardly a drop of blood in that ...\nYou think there is you think there is right\nThink theory it's why you know and you go back and you watch it\nAnd you know it's all still murky sixteen millimeter and it's the chainsaw and the the how weird their house was with all the the mold mobiles made out of phones and you know the the psychological aspect is really what clicked with that movie and I think that everyone that what came after it\nThose were really I think they're really sloppy slap dash\nYou know a bunch of teenagers waiting to get slaughtered kind of movies but really as the original Texas Chainsaw as they were they were they were heartbroken when they got an R rating they were trying to get a PG E because they thought no one was going to go see it\nThe Nineteen sixty Alfred Hitchcock movie psycho new shower scene you would think you were looking at ... moons every second not won them stabbing did you see in that shower scene\nNo I Know at no point does the knife a entered Janet Leigh body at any point uh you\nYou are you there you know it's happening but you don't see\nThat the sounds I think out a lot of that and there were a bunch of ... there were a bunch of melon that they had laid out and they were stabbing different types of melons\nAnd Hitchcock is standing there spoke with his chin watching this down guy you know making all these weird hollow strange down stabbing all these different fruits and vegetables [laughter] look doesn't say a word and as he's walking out the door he just says her father\n[laughter] Blair Witch project started with pennies but that was a scary one to\nBlair Witch project is really interesting because you know a a you know they were uh unfortunately I had a friend who was the ushered when a when that movie came out and he was cleaning up vomit every single night job he couldn't handle it because ... and it wasn't because it was scary it was because\nPeople hadn't had become accustomed to the ... found footage\nFirst person you know just a just to have the camera camcorder filming a whole movie\nUm you know so uh you know that was kind of a first of all sort of found footage type films\nAnd an independent film that went really big and you know and it's like okay well you can say what you want about that movie but you know that that movie was a that was the director hat final cut and they made the movie they way the way they wanted to make it and they created this whole legend that much more I mean I live in Pennsylvania not far\nFrom a where the where which is supposed to happen and people still drive in they're looking to uncover this thing that never happened so they read a really great job of not only are making a a a found footage film but but creating a a a\nMaking a a a found footage film but but creating a a a a story that people wanted to believe in and uh you know you nowadays I think that'd be hard you because of the Internet it gives you can't keep a secret for twenty second but in Nineteen Ninety nine\nA food everybody everyone thought the Blair Witch was the thing\nWhat did you take a Freddie Krueger nightmare on elm street\nYou know it's interesting I didn't like it when I saw it originally uh no this is kind of just\nGreedy and came out in Nineteen eighty four right\nBunni for but you know I I've gone back and there's a lot of humor in it and and it's great marriage that said you know he's not just stabbing people going into their dreams\nUh which I think we've pretty liberally ripped off from the movie dreams scape whichever one came in the year before which is an excellent movie that people should seek out\nWhere someone is trying to assassinate the president inside of his dream right ah but ah yeah ... it's actually very clever movie and and uh but anyhow any Arnold whenever they go five six seven equals yet they're getting pretty bad\nThere was a movie out two thousand fourteen I never saw did she got a weird movie it shows up is one of the horror films have you ever heard of at the bottom of Duke\n[noise] yes I have you know and I did not like the father just pretty much it it's Australian film I Believe it's about a a mother and her child [noise] and ah they are basically kind of dealing with the grief a of a loss of of a spouse\nOr or and father um and I took it manifested in this in this creature that kind of comes alive from a children's storybook which kind of looks like London after midnight you know that like the top hat and kind of frighten me kind of hair and he's a cartoon of out of a children's book\nI I didn't really I mean it ... it didn't I never really believe the ... but that wasn't the part of that is why I didn't like that it seemed like a two hours don't walk commercial where it was just reading [laughter] this this allegory for their depression in their grief and that you you don't ever really escape your grief you just have to feed it\nWhat is it about horror and creepy films that people generally\nLike to be scared\nUm you know I think if you serve you won I think there's two there's two aspects roller coaster you know there's two kinds of roller coasters you want to you get on it right you get on a roller coaster and you have so much fun we want to get back on it again\nThe other kind of roller coaster is when you get off your kissing the ground [laughter] in a for effort want to get on the roller coaster it yeah and they're both fought\nA and I think that you know you you you're you here say you know you get to put yourself in a kind of a mock a mock danger you know and and but really you're safe and then you feel like you've overcome something and I think that it's just that that Russia I think it's just that thrill\nAnd and again I think it's it for a moment there it makes you forget all the really thing real things in real life that really do terrified and I think that that that's worth the price of admission by itself\nOne of the demographics of movie goers these days I mean I went to a lot when I was younger and I don't go to nearly as many movies now that I'm grown ah I prefer to see them on video or DVDs or you know streaming you know in the comfort of my house\nI think a lot of people are like that it it's interesting 'cause uh you know I I think that
