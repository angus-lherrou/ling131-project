reading Joyce was everything that you do in your field what would you say has been the most fulfilling aspect of what you do\nI think the medium chip card the psychic medium ship part ... where\nPeople are killed when they receive messages and their loved ones and they realize that those people are not really just dead or fix tell or whatever they may be thinking that's really\nI Love church and religious organizations but they don't do as a big favor or they don't say that person's doing really well so I think that would be my primary message for people to know that when you cross over you shouldn't\nGo into a place of grief let them be joy for on the other side and enjoy that healing and wellness with them so that that's really important to the medium ship brings in that ability to let people know that their loved ones doing fine\nDoes the spirit never come to you and say the monies in the bag on the shoe bomb\nSure they\nThey do stuff like that\nYeah it's a lot of things and spirit or if you have before you go if this applies to everyone before you go to sleep at night\nYou ask say please tell me if you continue to ask where is it usually you'll get an answer if you ask me maybe three times four times she should get an answer just really hang in there with it and be diligent in your request\nKeep asking we were talking about spirit photography and you've got some of them have you taken the pictures or had just been given to you\nWell when my husband was here he took a lot of pictures he always had a camera eye to eye on his neck I took a lot of pictures so I have a lot of spirit photography I have a lot of or I have a lot of weird things going on and it's so interesting George maybe you can tell me that the reason why we're in this comes out on film but it doesn't\nCome out with just the human eye thing at wife is such a difference do you think\nThere is a huge difference and it's very strange because for some reason the camera picks up\nGoes Forbes just about everything that you can see with the human eye I mean I guess were restricted to to see things in a certain level a word that camera digitally and otherwise picks it up\nThat's right it it's so odd and it would have cell phones are really to the same degree that irregular ah thirty five millimeter camera would would a present it's the same thing so I have yet to figure that out spirited not tell me why but other than the fact that the uh\nThe photography scientific photography has the ability of the I just not have and that's the only answer I could come up with so far Joyce is not good [laughter]\nHow do you know you're not being tricked by some demon or something that that is the train that deceased person somebody cared about\nThat's a great question because if you do any kind of spirit work or you have any kind of messages or you have anything at all you always have to have a blessing for us to test the spirit you say really are you of God and that's really what I Would say and that's what I Would recommend everyone's saying before they become involved in this kind of work at all\nSo you always say are you of God and that's what I Would suggest and then team is can come in they will not come in or if you have any kind of threat around you or you're afraid of anything you know that they will not get past that barrier and if you're religious she can say the name of Jesus Christ or whatever you can relate to\nHave you ever witnessed an exorcist\nNo other than the movie which I did not like because books fell off the shelf by themselves and very unsettling so it's not a place that I Would want to go to I I Try to avoid darkness and\nYou don't play with the ... board\nNo and I know your feelings about the wage of ... with you I have a picture in my seven steps having book about my ... I did a terrible thing when my son was young says teens ah and my brother that we're using a way to broaden my living room and I was sitting on a couch watching them\nAnd yeah we were all very young at that time and my husband took a picture of it and you can see over my shoulder looking in the window behind me from outside a theme and say oh really that's in my book seven steps\nThat's going to the phones next up Greg in North Hollywood, California November twenty six Nineteen fifty seven November twenty six Ninety seven bridge got a birthday coming up\nI grabbed out a way Hey Greg wanted to test your technique ability because over the past few decades has met the psychics and maybe a hand who are actually came up with predictions by things like a\nYou know with with the Toyota Corona doing around [laughter] and that's how I got there [laughter] but uh\nThe others has worked off of ... what do you think oh you should be a speaker and this and that\nSo that's how I should be anything but I'm telling you this I Will say one thing about you\nOr you have at the time of your birth at Mars a sign of a Scorpio so you a secret\nAnd you'd be a great detective and you're always looking for the solving mysteries I Will say that to you and you know you you do it very well and you basically very skeptical which is great because that's how you get answers and true so great because it's something I can do for you\nYeah I Wonder if you see predicting wise or something coming up from a career or my income wise or change or to make it better [laughter]\nWhat you know what I just mentioned that you love mysteries [laughter] have you ever done any kind of forensic sciences or technology or anything along those lines I detected work anything like that\nNo I Do watch a lot of these uh game shows where you've got to get the words [laughter]\nOh that's a good start well how are you starting a new career\nI'm not really I I've been in a career but then it's freelance or independent contract work with the you know sometimes it's lower this depending on there\nAnd what I Would say to you is if you want to find out what's really a sole purpose and I feel that it's discovering mysteries you should really solid along those lines out just kind of study forensics bed\nAnd when you're not doing construction and you're going to find that you have a whole part of your brain that is really exciting you're an honest person and you love honesty and a lot of people in this field and honest so thank you for saying that Greg\nGreg Cooper everything works out for you speaking of honesty joined should you see something bad will you tell that person\nYou have to be honest but you have to cook it and I don't know what you mean by bats I\nMean like like a shining accident in action and I think I'd tell them about maybe you can avoid it\nI had a very very very bad accident a few years ago because I did not listen like I told me not to go out for twenty four\nA few years ago because I did not listen guy\nTold me that take her out for twenty four hours and I was all set to stay home but someone came along and said no no we have to go to the beach we have to do this and I had a really horrendous accident the guys who will tell you and if you're not told and you had the accident anyway that it's supposed to happen like you charge I don't believe in accidents\nNo more and you know when you lose look back at the movie the Christmas carol ... looking in the window with the ghost of the future says spirit or these things that will be or could be and that's a that's an interesting question do you think we have the ability to change our destiny\nI think as you raise your consciousness grow in a awareness and you grow in truth and love and light and understanding you absolutely can't and that's why we're here with the it's a school this is one big school dj origin you know it\nAnd a tearful lessons you too well you know you have to experience something really nasty and bypass it\nLet's go to bone in Wichita, Kansas ...

stories are directly related to that\nWell it's a recurring dream is coming again and again there's a hilarious story a mysterious realities about a woman doctor from England who's complaining of the breakfast table\nOh Robert why do I keep having the same ethic dream when I got to do my medical exams Thirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you if it really is the same ... very close to the same dream it's probably because\nYou have dreamed producers who were making a dream movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through you're trying to get you understand the situation in trying to educate you or assuming you might have some clue about what's going on there tried to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I a lot of the stories I I have to sort of dream production movie company\nThat is making dreams for us and repeating the performance if necessary in order to get a message across and I actually picked\nHow I Dreamed producers might be getting very bulletin fed up with us if they have to keep on making the same\nOffices and not getting the message of not taking action from it that's one of the ways that ... come about I mean dreams that not all to be put in one box we\nDo have dreamed productions where you feel and you might be quite right when you feel this that there is a production crew behind the scenes\nThat is making a certain kind of dream you because you need to get a message in another the stories of mysterious reality as I describe a very strange woman who sat down next to me in a plane or reality and mentored me at a certain point that the debt husband or the ... he\nWas the pop musician he'd been shot in the face in a diner in Seattle\nOn the knees creepy story and he says to her in her dream I'm\nI've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies for people that that was the in their dreams that I'm doing the music and the special effects I think I've actually goes on I think that's another fascinating aspect of what's happening and dreams\nWho's in charge of this though who's who's the director of these productions\nWell that's a very good question indeed it might use that dream or if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you become conscious it might be that some shadow or hidden aspect of yourself\nMaybe if you're a high a self maybe slightly wiser and fight the highest though\nIs the director I don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this I think the dream production company that might be staging movies for you\nIs not alien to you is not hostile to you and it's probably being run by someone with a slightly why is the perspective and maybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about your current situation because one of the ways that dream\nShock is awake into doing some course correction is\nThey dramatized and they spoof parity or what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing that some action might be required\nDreams are powerful Robert in a eyeball we used it for my own personal life to get things done accomplish things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no end to what you can do\nRight I mean I think that here's here's where our current understanding of dreaming and currents physics or meet up I mean the our current understanding that kind of understanding I mean there really is ready to revive those writings and understanding about dreams of dreaming is traveling for example\nA physics tells the science tells us that we have access to\nIs traveling for example a physics tells the science tells us that we have access at any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're the field of information onto the field of information that contain everything we could ever possibly need to know and we have access to it\nAccording to our ability to harvest the information and do something with it in ... in the first place what's going on I think in dreams we discover your purse no doorway into this whole quantum information field\nAnd depending on the work and play with prepared to do with the information might getting we can bring through more and more I mean you could set an intention any night for example to be very simple about this is simply a practical you can do dream in the basement juice at an intention\nTo get guidance on any theme that interest you and probably something will come through if you think you've got anything you're awake in the middle of the night to reset your intention and maybe at this point\nYou're ready to lose the dream on that subject as well because he's got some rest and you're ready to take off\nAnd it's amazing how many creative solutions come true in this way and they've come through across history one of my book the secret history of dreaming\nIs full of stone narratives from the documentation that suggested dreaming is actually a secret engine in the history of everything in the history of credit breakthroughs in science mhm elegy in the aughts even in business and economics as well\nSo when you say that if you wake up to what dreaming is it can take you anywhere you are literally correct it really can can take us to the hidden dimensions of reality that super string theory pause it it can take us into the off the lights that you see the ham\nWalked the job opportunities in the living environment a like a beyond death so you can talk to and says two beloved loved ones and ...\nAnd others so this is the ... the of adventure healing guidance and possibility that opens when you become a more conscious ...\nWhat about the ability to chime travel in your dreams\nWhere we do it we do it whether we know do not do it even if we don't remember our dreams and I think it's a basic survival function of dreaming\nYou know if I'm a mistake on the practical mystic George I think you know that I Want to take away is this that in power out every day life and one of the things I Know from my own life both I work with is the dream show you the future in a way that is actionable mean this is very important dreams shows\nOpportunities and challenges lie ahead their husbands the things we don't yet know about\nThey can save your life they can save your job they could say that marriage I couldn't be talking to you today if I did not know the ... and show that I that I have avoided death on the road predates with death fatal accidents\nBy coming back from dreams that forecast book was happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with the Eighteen wheeler coming down the hill to fall on the other side of a blind\nSpot for example so that's one direction for time travel but time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact\nYou understand what our relationship with the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of Libya time altogether we step into a different place and in between place from which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times we're leading Apollo alive this becomes very interesting when you begin to look at gifts of lessons you might have learned in a parallel lives that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and not at all the power alone I\nThink it's very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost that time\nWill be guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives in situations of people in soft lung places to a part of your multi dimensional family I'm a bit of a an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience\nBut we are connected to dramas being lived in other places in time I look for certain\nPoint of view it's all going on now I wouldn't be doing what I I'm not doing or not found myself connected with an Anglo Irishman who came to the American colonies\nSeventeen hundred ... Indian very well I found myself breathing in his life that I had to study has lived\nIn a hold on for a second Robert we're at the break but we'll be back with more in a moment of coast to coast they\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the coastal newsletter sign up to the coast to coast am dot com\n... the way you do safely and in complete control my you know 'cause I ain't secure communications with private proud virtual credit card that security features that you can search ...\nShall I put out costs and I think it's kind of aid I met her get out now the now for credit card debt use your seed identity to stay safe secure and found that my friend that I\nThought today and get one year free ...\nAm on news talk radio Katie WN and Katie J.

publish the old way George but I must tell you I'm getting nervous because I Dream some time ago I have a life contract that says I have to probably sixty eight books [laughter] a short of that\nThat's still pretty prolific do good for you good for you and they're ... they're all fascinating works\nThese dreams are so important I mean I I think people can you make themselves healthy in a dream that you can get a better job in a dream they can make other people think about them by concentrating on them in dreams it's amazing what you can do with dreams isn't it\nAbsolutely and you just listed some really interesting areas for example in terms of a help\nI mean one of the things going on in dreams is that that body talk as well as so to get other words in dreams we see what's going on inside the body an old fashioned doctors\nUnderstand this and in traditional Chinese medicine for example this is front and center the idea is that a dream my gives the X ray even an MRI of what's going on inside the body might show is symptoms that are developing might enable us to avoid those symptoms but that's one of the functions of framing and the and in terms of our emotional and spiritual health\nI'll dreams which shows the things that help us to get wild and to stay well and it was acting up on those dreams and try and bring their energy through you mentioned connecting with other people were United telepathy which literally means fellow feeling at a distance or or or being in touch with someone else\nIt it's a common phenomenon and dreams in fact it's surprising that more people who are related to each other either by Lovell by family well\nBy common colds or whatever I'm not aware more often that they might be dreaming with ... and all of each other I mean there's a phenomenal shed dreaming or interactive treatment which we find ourselves chairing adventures with friends and other people I mean this was another fascinating phenomena and dream\nAs a matter of fact you discover if you wake up to your dreams remember more look at what's going on\nBut you have what used to be cold and it's been cold again super normal capacity that all abnormal they're not super natural but that beyond the normal and we're talking about things like pre cognition\nUntil after the ... and and so on and and and and you are able to see things before they happen to see things the distance but I go to connect with other people and these are natural powers and abilities that belong to you and if you become a more active treatment you'll find that you are growing in developing these gifts and the very helpful in life\nIn terms of creative solutions for things green tool to live with them if you can't find a solution to a problem or me alive\nPut the question to your dreams and see what come\nAnd I would add to that that you can do this in everyday life as well because dreaming for the U.S not just about what happens when you close your eyes it's what happens when you open your eyes wider so proud of this part of part of the sense of all this is\nBut the world around you once again we'll speak to like a dream if you pay attention so I encourage people many of my story is done on this\nTo notice what goes on in the amazing moments of meaningful coincidence when you've got a thought or preoccupation on your mind and suddenly the will deliver that incident or striking\nThat gives you not only a reflection of what's on your mind but sometimes\nA way of dealing with what is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I encourage people to play is\nWhat's your question to the world go down the street or go into the pocket go your morning commute\nBut that question in your mind and received the first time usual unexpected thing that enters your field perception as a message from the use of the surrounds you it is amazing how specifically the world will speak to you to bring a dream like message when you play that game\nIn Nineteen Seventy one Robert I did my first radio audition tape and the and I had it on tape and I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid and hire them to be some radio person on the street reporter\nAnd what I Would do when I dropped it off at a certain radio station I wanted to work at I concentrated on that person every night when I went to bed or he already had my tape I hadn't heard from him a mature enough after two days I'm going to sleep concentrating on the individual\nI'm visualizing what he looks like I had met him one time and uh sure enough two days later the guy calls me and says hey I like this tape and I've got something for you come on down it works does ...\nYes wow you're send to Europe be met and your manifested George I'm not surprised one bit you know Mark Twain staged experiments of this guy he called them mental to Laker feedback in his day when people said telegrams he'd make a habit of writing a letter or an old fashioned telegram to someone he wanted to be in contact with a not mailing it\nHe just ... attention\nOn that I noticed what followed the news said that actually almost didn't solidly that was a response so you're practicing a game that is a joke and it works I mean we know the thoughts are already thing they're already thoughts and feelings already action\nAnd if you're thinking about another person you're probably going to reach them unless they are shielded again being reached W of reaching a but nine right to do something good we wouldn't want to be open to be reached by just anybody with with any intention but that's a lovely creative a benign example\nOf sending a mental sending medical ... is what Mark Twain\nAnd I you know I subsequently used it a lot by doing the same techniques it's almost as if they have this inbox that you get on the same path with and you drop your little messages in there and then just for some reason they pick it up\nYeah yeah ...\nWe'll we'll do a little experiments that might groups by which one of those degrees the bell said to him it just might be a painting it might be a sculptor it's a non announced image for the group of people have to guess in the morning after the night of sending walk the walk the image that was being sent\nMy two beaten and it's interesting how that works and some people a very good at picking up and some people I've got to send us another ... this is just a focused example of something that we do automatic they were connected with each other where to burn into leaving field of interaction and it goes on in ... all the time\nRobert you've talked about synchronous city explain how that ties into our dreams\nI think it's like this when you make a dreaming once we understand that dreaming might be traveling we get out there we go beyond the cook will develop or re I'm standing in a consensual hallucinations and we get into a deep space we have the counters with\nPeople who live in the deepest space excluding the hotter than our ancestors\nThrough synchronous today we often feel the forces and intelligence that lives on the other side of those cook in the walls of Audrey understanding come pushing or poking or tickling to bring us a way to give us a message to some guy and\nThis is the thing about synchronous deep meaningful could that you gave us the would sit in front of the cause is set up without trouble in Tokyo about coincidence I gave us a different would instead of state we often feel they're the hidden happy feel like getting a we cannot handshake or pushback\nFrom something beyond our kittens something we cannot see so although at the phenomena this cold isn't a causal phenomena him and said that there's no obvious happen of cause and effect we often feel there is causation that play you might even feel that very large forces are like both of the forces that you'll be called the archetypes\nEven feel that very large forces are in play both as close as you called the archetype so that people might have called the spirit of the gods of ancestors are in play so I Am a great proponent and then actually conditions and shaped every day of my life\nBut paying attention to the unusual unexpected things that are going on in the world around you and seeing what the ... looks like not just one message you might get one message you needed at say stop or something like that but you might notice that there's a ... enough connection as you go through the day is certain team comes up again and again\nA certain cymbal comes up again and again and you notice when that is happening as with a recurring dream hey slowdown pay attention or what you need to do with this what is the universe is telling you that you need to rectify\nRobert since you've been doing this have we gotten the answer on why it works or how it works because we do agree that it does work but how yes\nWell it it it the the law of attraction has been oversimplified mistakes that by the by the new age but the law of attraction it's always in play the law of attraction means that we attract over ... events or encounters according to the energy and the ideas we carry\nIt works at all levels of our lives is never be the secret it's going on for very long time\nSo what you notice in the way of sit in front of city and maybe what you remember from your dream has a great deal to do with what you're open to and what your available for\nA you know in in everyday life if you're carrying a negative attitude about the world the world's going to give you lots of reasons to sustain that view that you are carrying if you can manage to go about with a more open minded and available attitude towards life a more positive attitude towards

seems very serious and talk and threatening going across the ... and seeing this may be his EMT\nOkay maybe that's symbolic of something that lies ahead to me in life which is going to have the

liked the idea of the upside down cell phone yeah it's scary but if it's my dream I actually you however many years that he has since the dream\nI sort of want to reach into the dream grab that cell phone or the hold it to my ear and say who is there talk to me while you and see what I get it might be that it's the kind of phony what you can talk to someone on the other side of death\nIn our

mired in a confusion in a terrible and things like that why isn't it just so obvious\nWell I think that actually the dream so the dream sources of many sources of pretend to try to communicate as clearly as possible but but not necessarily not enough to follow all of this\nAh and also we need to remember the dreams are experiences that whatever report we we quote to each other from a dream is only a report it's not the full experience so it might seem convoluted all confusing\nWell not ... but that might be because we've only brought back a few things from the dream and don't know how to put them together which is why\nI find the best way to understand the dream is to try to get your head back inside to try to get back inside the ... take a look at what is really going on when you do

listed breathing is amongst the population of the moment\nAt the moment I Do know that probably everybody is having ... dreams but only a few people are aware of that yet only a few people have woken up to it\nI think it's it's routine I think that we do in the night whether we know it or not scout ahead of us so some aspect of consciousness checks out what lies ahead I think that's going on all the time but I think many people have yet to wake up to the fact that they can do it and could use it\nSo regular dreams what regular dreams of people I mean the dream spanning the whole spectrum they are big dreams a little dreams that little dreams that are rather routine processing of what went on the day before commentary on how you said yourself and how fast you ate the night before then there are the big dreams\nWhich of the dreams of which you feel that you have received a message or she might kill yourself with President of the highest source of wisdom oh you've gone travelling you know you've gone to distant galaxy or different time period or a place with a dead or alive so the\nPoint is that all of these avenues of knowledge and adventure open to everyone all the time the only thing that prevents you from getting in on this\nIs is perhaps your reluctance until now to make time in your life to remember more of what's going on in the night to write it down keep a journal

our eyes when we go to sleep\nWe have dreams and in the ... mental a travel ban maybe even\nTime travel but then\nA night of solver we open our eyes and is it possible you imply that is that we are stepping from one dream state to another that we are stepping in prom night\nTo oh waking dream during the day a dream and watch reality is maybe plastic malleable\nUm where we can not just mentally travel mentally time travel but actually like the ... men and women around the world\nPhysically travel and physically time travel because they are aware that\nReality is a white can dream as opposed to a night during that was wondering if you comment on that you seem to although I\nI I Love your raping statement Thomas yes I think we do step when we come out of the freedom of the night into the dream of the day I think we do step from one stage unconditional treat me into another one I think the\nWaking life is also a dream and the reality might be more plastic and now the book and we make allowance full we talked earlier about how your your your tensions the energies you carry the attitudes you carry good a shape you'll reality\nThe physical possibility of time travel or shape shifting et cetera is of course is is his beat on to debate among scholars and scientists and their traditions of it in different so many lineages\nAs you imply whether time travel is a physical possibility either for certain kinds of primal Sherman or with the technology of the future I don't know but I Do know I mean I don't know from my experience I don't think I physically stepped from um time into another though I felt very very much on the edge of it sometimes\nI don't know what the shape shifting in the way the Germans connect with animal spirits cetera it's physically impossible for most people today but I Do believe it probably was physically possible an early stage of human evolution when the human animal divide was not as absolute as is today\nBut any way leaving aside those are areas which fascinating to think about and the stuff of good stories\nI'm absolutely certain that you are right when you say that to come back from a dream of the night in the day is to move from one stage of dreaming to another actually I often feel Thomas\nDivide step from ... from one room into another from one landscape all from one willed into another I have a sort of just so feeling okay I

you I think the\nImpact important thing for me George is the stories that come from it I mean I'm a story and I made a stranger on the plane they asked what do I do I say I'm a storyteller and it gives me great pleasure to help other people find bigger and brave the stories they might you might\nHave been living and to apply those stories and bring them into the world and\nDreams our thoughts of story this is a very ancient from the ... the age of ... get out the western desert in a straight to\nA ... an aboriginal people who still love the old way like some of the crooked job will sit around a fire boiling a belief of the tea about they're sharing stories no TV that the stories other entertainment and the first comment on a certain kind of breathing story might be\nA good story that an old story sweet tea\nI let let me just go a little bit filled with this I think sometimes in life we're trapped in the old tired the snow histories we need a way of finding a way for would entering a larger more powerful story which can be a source of healing\nAnd courage and determination in light of dreams deliver stories so I think the me all of the time I've been dreaming\nI'm looking for the story powder cream stories I could write them could tell stories that helped to tell my life in a lot to frame than the ... the little everyday mind might appreciate and I really love it really gives me great pleasure to watch other people finding an harvesting the stories that tree that giving them\n[noise] and then your work conversation with a Damon of Luna yes a lot of people a little scared about that what's what's going on\nWell they might be I mean uh it it it it might be scary to think that there are realms of spiritual being beyond our human plane\nUh who are operating in ... tree that might initially be a little daunting to human it's an ancient understanding the astro plane of the moon and I'm Talking about the physical ... known to the Astros realm of Luna\nIs a place of much traffic with solar spirits coming into the body in this world transit with solo third leaving the world after death might also spent some time but it's on the right track is going up with Rob Dunn with some of their beings all this thing\nSo I gave voice to of being of the hospital realm of living that he's not to be cool to be money is not even he's a day mountain that the ancient Greek too which is neither good or bad in itself it means he's there to being who live on a different plane of reality and we're hearing his voice\nWhat might be going on in your life on line in terms of what happens if people are and what happens is off the debt which might be but they're a transition voting for the Tibetans have goals cool bothers states which have a certain geography which is it does seem to find out about the geography involving for example\nThe ... realm of the food so I gave voice to a very interesting cultured creature all of this of this realm and read it and judge yourself\nExcellent let's take the calls let us go to Joe on Long Island New York Hi Joe go ahead\nHi Robyn a couple of things my first question would be a um noticing some trains\nThat seemed to have a scene with moving parts square that this moving parts and I would kind of compare this to say like the second half of the Titanic movie where a DiCaprio is trying to find his way out of the ship is always moving parts\nRio is trying to find his way out of the ship is oil is moving parts and they still has that theme of he still wants to stay with us girlfriend in the movie or you know it still has ... about the relationship so the idea of a dream showing moving parts\nAnd my second thing just as you're talking now I was thinking of a I had played a lot of basketball and I never focused on shopping and I noticed\nA couple of times like block shots at work near the top of the back yard so I had to be shopping high energy good jumping Joe [laughter]\nAnd this was correlated to they'll linked to the gym a lot more and I wasn't going to the gym so I could jump higher you know is basically concerned with scarring a lot of points or getting a lot of assess\nSo I keep having to scream about shopping\nAnd I never really thought about shopping when I played a lot of basketball so what's\nThe idea of a dream bringing up the aspects of something you did a lot\nYet didn't focus on while you were doing it and why would a drink to that it's OK maybe like a singer you know always son a certain type of song or or and walk and its springing up another type of a second you know\nVery interesting I mean I'm thinking if I if I Am a former player I I'm not doing it the stage in my life but here I Am jumping at high as I used to do in in my dream\nMaybe the dream is preparing me for jump jump in life of a different kind where is the next tide jump I might want to take in my life it might be a new form of activity\nMight be a new form of understanding where am I going to be a slam dunk in another field of activity in life so that we might be making an analogy between my ... my great prowess on on the basketball court\nWith these jumps and the junk that it lies ahead but the the moving parts and the Titanic analogy is interesting is not a lot to go on but if I if the moving parts make me think of that you know emotional scene from the movie\nI might wonder again where in my life my being ... by history to move on in some sense and I can't think about the Titanic without recalling that there was a great British research a psychic phenomena and the

pre cognition as embodied the story Rob and simply a dream report I must add the fed up the death dictator or central dictated or a marketable account of life on the other side of the cold the blue

one of my cousins had drowned so there was like a built in fear of water and my mother and that the you know don't go in the water so I never really learned to swim\nSo when I was about I guess was

that was back in my body\nBut [noise] ah I wanted to tell you that it was a growing experience and I've had many that was really one of the first\nAnd uh I learned a lot from that I learned not to let my sister teach me how to swim for one thing it probably in the mail message from that\nExactly it's a scary thing I got to tell you the same thing happened to me when I was a kid except I didn't have an edge elect experience terms with my father's brother my uncle he was the twins and we're walking in a lake\nAnd ah I'm side by side next to my uncle and uh I get a whole in this leak in just like you down I went I must have been about eight years old Joyce and I'm gone I and I thought this is it I'm dead and\nNow we're back something upon me back up my pop right back up and then my uncle didn't even know I went under just kept walking but it was the weirdest feeling but I thought that was it for me it was a strange feeling\nGood I wanted to tell you I don't know if you ever went to my website but I was home lots of times\nOh thank you I was that the world Trade Center when nine eleven occurred because my husband and I had an apartment very close we're like a thousand feet from some of the world Trade Center and we moved there about a month before buildings came down gosh\nYeah is there a month and on the day we moved and Jack and I looked up and the world Trade Center was towering over our little building on liberty court and ah I said you know said to each other boy this thing comes down we're finished well exactly a month later they'd come down as you know and we were\nWe had to leave the building because it was unsafe to be there so many people in that area had to leave\nBut we came back a few days later when it was safe\nAnd I had the most phenomenal experience and that's what my website where um what happened I I I actually had gone to sleep and that was awakened and told to go to the living room and to help people to cross over because they were coming through had created a portal in my building and in my apartment\nAnd people who were had just died were coming through and being released out into the onto the harbor by the statue of liberty and that was Battery Park\nSo that was one of the many incredible experiences I've had and thousands of people see it just kept coming coming I guess you know\nAre you still out in that area Joyce\nWe saw that apartment when my husband passed away and then now I'm In Florida\nBut uh just like so many incredible things that people were just try to remember some of the things that happened to them I think most people say well if it was just something that just happened but write them down recording your dreams as I'm sure your your next guests has got to tell us\nBut write everything down and try to analyze what you're experiencing the best way to develop your yes pay is to try to remember and to try to record with your experience thing and it will really happen that way and open up more of that that consciousness you'll be able to help other people as well\nSo that's that's my primary recommendation record your dream to record your experiences\nI had a I don't know if I should if you're ready for me to tell you another one of a one my phenomenal experiences about a\nLot of low yeah sure absolutely\nTruck thank you I had never heard of a thing but I had an out about maybe four years ago I had this out of body experience where I did ask to travel which I had really no memory of doing ever before I think we all travel and we just forget or don't we don't know about it\nBut this was unusual because I went to a a Tibetan Rami Khouri\nAt to see the llama whose name was ... and you know in Tibet George on the day the babies born that's the first name he was born on Tuesday says named Tuesday lob sayings rampant and if you go to his website it's a lot of things rapid dot org\nBut he came to get me and I went on this phenomenal trip\nTo mystery and he had a the ability to answer many of my question is do this\nAnd he had a the ability to answer many of my questions that this man had many walking experiences supposedly he was over many hundreds of years of age he had taken different bodies on the last one more out he took a new body on and he was living as an Englishman\nAnd his final incarnation on the earth and Nineteen eighties\nSo I was at Islam is Terry and it was phenomenal and I came back to my body brought me back and as I was waking up\nHe said to me don't forget my name and I had never heard I couldn't remember it but my husband was there and I said jak before I wake up these write this down and\nI felt it out ... and I misspelled it slightly different age on it or it didn't belong and then he was a lot of things gone but I went to his website and I was blown away because he has written\nMaybe a couple of hundred books\nThat are free anyone go to his political\nExtremely cell and just really an amazing amazing man and it not only was he a doctor but he was also just so many different incarnations it makes you realize that we don't really have to die I think your main also was walking and George do you believe that that's possible you could take on\nFurther uh incarnation\nI think George many things are possible mhm\nReally do I mean I'm I'm Still wrestling with the living in\nDying process and exactly what it is we cross over um
