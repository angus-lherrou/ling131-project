called captured which is still for me one of the greatest UFO stories of abductions I've ever read it is one of the reasons I got into this business\nBecause when look magazine came out with the interrupted journey or the story in Bahrain Benny Hill I mean I was just mesmerized even at a young age\nHow would you categorize that case the Barney and video case\nWell I I think it's a very important case and for several different reasons I'm\nOn the people uh we're not talking about people who don't have a reputation we're not talking about people who are trying to seek ... for attention say that he was a social worker or respected member of the community\nShe had a mixed marriage with Barney ... she was white that was very unusual in the early sixties it took guts for them to\nCome out and that's right and\nThey were very concerned about what the reaction would be a ... this was in the early sixties and you know it got to ... if you're going to have people who\nSet a new standard of what's going on ... you got to have people who can handle eats speak\nIt's unfortunate that Barney didn't live terribly long time when a Nineteen sixty eight I guess and uh\nI'm Betty I'm Around a long time for which I Am glad and uh it was a good case to accept the ball rolling so to speak on the whole business of options and interactions with early not sensationalize\nI mean let's face it stand back and say betting Barney where specimens for somebody yeah\nAnd they weren't ... treated but they certainly weren't going off and glory and claiming all kinds of must see things as being part of their interaction with the ... ah\nAnd you know I I was fortunate to have the opportunity to meet them early on [noise]\nOn my ... and I I was very impressed uh and I was impressed by something else uh the medium\nIn that case I mean K in Pittsburgh biggest station in town and uh you know I I that's where I made my view on the air so to speak\nAnd they called me and told me that they were bringing Betty and Barney into town and told me where they were staying and which is very unusual yeah and I contacted them we had dinner together\nOr just the three of us and I had a chance to you know one on one kind of thing and I was very very impressed and I had known what to expect because I hadn't fell stuff like this I mean\nIt isn't a bit crazy story aliens grabbing a couple a

sixties or seventies or eighties [laughter] that's right no till I was very fortunate to have met them one on one so to speak and\nI saw them at conferences I didn't get too many meetings with foreign who because he died within two years when I first met him a lesson that\nA very he's gone on that and of course I worked very closely with that he's nice Kathleen Martin and we've done three books together mhm and uh\nThat's been a pleasure to or if not often you find it can write with people uh have co written books ... with other people but uh we seem to be compatible\nYeah you you you too clicked and she's great in in the field that you follow due to a ... she's super person you don't gamble when I was that Twenty one year old reporter who interviewed you\nOne of the other interviews I did was with Dr Benjamin Simon who ... who is the psychiatrist who who studied Betty and Barney hill and this is I'll I'll always remember this because he was in Boston I interviewed them over the phone I'm In Detroit\nAnd in ... you know I'm I'm obsessed with the story and I asked him I said so what do you think Dr a ball they're\nTelling you the truth or not what do you think he said\nI I don't know if the story happened or not but I Will tell you what I Do believe\nThey're they're not lying whatever happened to them both of them on under hypnosis separately told the same story and they they believe whatever they saw happened to them and he said based on that\nI cannot say what happened but I can tell you they aren't lying to me in a what an amazing story\nYeah we have to remember that the doctor Simon random facility for three thousand shell shocked war veteran\nYes called the ...\nWere way before anybody would get involved in stuff like that\nYeah and he had learned to use ... as as a means of bringing guys had terrible experiences you know your buddy said on off next year battle [noise] ah that's traumatic hate but weeks\nAnd so he learned how to handle this and so they were very fortunate and winding up his hands\nAnd you know I I'm Still not sure exactly what he finally thought about the whole business\nBut he sure we thought that these people are not mine that's right they're not looking for attention cetera et cetera\nI was impressed with him and uh I was puzzled by the ... to ... and ... unfortunately but they they they were they had nothing to gain

the portal and sees the wave computers\nSomehow some way whether it is some way as crazy as all this sounds I assure you it's true that\nThey have this ability to go back whether it's going back in time and changing this\nI don't know but I can assure you of this for anyone out there who would say oh well\nThis is just the Bible that are you know they make these changes coming off the printing presses and all that I'm Sorry I'm Talking about a hundred and fifty seven year old Bible that has changes in it a Bible that's been in my possession for years\nThat has changes in it now so that can't be resolved we be in human understanding we can't resolve that and another thing that I find very interesting\nIs that the Lord's Prayer I have it on paper and a frame on my wall that was changed what I just told you ah but yeah I have Lord's Prayer\nIs carved in a stone in my home and that is not changed and it has not been change so it's interesting to note that what ever this technology is apparently it can\nThe what ever this technology is apparently it cannot make changes on something that is in stone or some type of metallic so or something like that another regard that George\nOr do you have any Roman numeral clocks in your home or do you have a watch with Roman numeral\nYeah I think I Do I think I have a couple of watching with that\nOkay well I Want you to look at

would look like a a V.\nThat's now turned upside down where it looked like an egg that's weird and again\nFor anyone who thinks that this is crazy talk just look at your watches your clocks and and and another ... and I take a photograph of this as well and people from all over the world order thing\nAnd the other thing I have some watches with Roman numerals that have been affected and changed yet I have a clock roaming the clock\nOn my wall it might that have like metal and for the Roman numerals and ... ...\n... you know we're going to have our ends to pull back on our website as we get some new software and I'll be able to pull people instantly bill and I would love to pull people on the lion lays down with the lamb and see how many people say that they agree that's what it was\nAnd then compare it to the statistics are you a better job overwhelming people would say that it that it was a little lion lays down with the lamb\nNo question about it I mean the offers ridiculous it doesn't fit there's no way when you say that it just it makes no sense odd George when you look at it it just looked so uh it's not right now let me ask you this\nThat the ... ... you're familiar with the drug Enforcement Administration\nWell it's interesting that you say that because it was known as the drug and force men agency that's why they were ... agent and now it is the drug Enforcement Administration\nWow I bought see I've always thought of it is that we're going to come back with more built that moment on coast to coast am your phone calls with Bill being big foot and the Mandela

right no safe dot com rhino safe dot com it's because I Am\nOn news talk radio Katie WN and Katie Jay [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast our special guest bill being as we talk about big foot the Mandela Effect and your calls as well bill with this fall under the Mandela sect category or the actor jak collapse\nPeople thought he had died he's dead now but during his day when he was very much alive everybody thought he was dead everybody you talk to his would that be part of the Mandela Effect\nI tell you that George I would\nVenture to say yes I mean it's not just jak aware or the Reverend Billy Graham ah Nelson Mandela at the other you know what the name came from Jim Neighbors and various other um stars like this or politicians or that\nOr or you know people that are ... um [noise] somehow we all had it wrong and ... these people are ... years ago and you know a lot of folks that died in recent years here and are\nThere are people swear that they remember funerals for Billy Graham and televised specials and things of that nature and\nIt's mind boggling and really interesting that I could say is that\nThe devil is a master of confusion\nThe the apple is a master of confusion\nAnd division so where there is confusion there is division because if I say to you well George I think it used to say this or whatever and you go now now now it's always said that now we have\nConfusion and division is going to come in and I really believe that the source of this is demonic in nature and this is Jay can't pick\nThis in my opinion is part of the strong delusion and the great perception that has come on the earth I've had debates\nWith Bible scholars on other shows about this topic and they swear\nThat none of the scriptures have been changed it always said the wall fan all these other things that I'm an agent for that that won't for saying this and it it's mind boggling George and anybody that knows me and you know me well enough\nGot his first in my life I Am an agent for God I'd go all over this country helping people to be free from demonic garbage\nBut yet there were people die in debates against me on things like this that just said no way you know you're twisting the scriptures around and nothing could be further from the truth\nWhat did they say the devils greatest trick is making people convinced that he doesn't exist\nYes absolutely and it's uh I'll tell you that this is where we really have to [noise] and and I am poor people out there here what I'm saying are now is the time to really get closer to God and ask God for discernment\nTo know what is right and what is wrong with his true it is not who is true who is not because\nWe are in an age of deception and it is only part of the power of God\nAnd the guidance of God and the protection of guys that were going to get through the things that are here and the things that are coming\nHe it's actually kind of scary that so many people the great majority believes in one thing and then there it is clearly in black and white something else and we swear up and down that does it can't be\nYeah it's incredible it's mind boggling it truly is and\nPeople are free to believe what they want it's not my job to try and put somebody's arm into believing something but it is my job by the power of God as a matter of God\nTo speak truth and when something like this comes along I Can't remain silent on it because I feel I have an obligation to people\nThat tell the truth and as disturbing as this is I'm Sorry it's the truth and people need to get ready and prepared for this\nLet's start with the phones Joe truck driving in Indiana they're going to start an age oh go ahead\nHi George was very good thank you this man backs up this free ... it is really is a\nLike a I remember it is still alive and then they'll wrap myself too I I don't know it's all in my mind off ah\nBut ah that sort of holding back because I think that's an act in the actual like the real world I dislike movie was there's a couple of famous through the lines of her life change for her some song lines and like ...\nOr something like that but like there's a ... like if there's a tree over most of my house or the other like the family or any of the people who live there in ... there and all of a sudden there's this fact kidding [laughter]\nThat's funny oh this is are there so I just wanted to know that there are\nAll right thing would that be part of a Mandela Sackler everybody doesn't even recognize the tree and it's their\nGeorge there are people that are reporting stuff like that that they're seeing a you know things that were never there before that are there they are seeing I'll give you another example for breeze you know that that the air freshener for breeze\nYes how would you spell that\nI'm a I'm just guessing but it's I Would have said F. E. B. R. E. Z. E.\nYeah that's how it was and that's not how it is now they've dropped the knees so it's that the P. R. E. Z. E. for breads now and ah you know\nBarron Barron steamed bears is\nNow parents staying there said Mr Rogers do you remember this George it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood right\nWon't you be God da da da da\nDa da da da da da da da da de in this neighborhood\nThat's weird my mother has a Bible that has got to be a hundred plus years old or maybe even more I mean it is\nHuge and the ... the covers leather in old it's one of those things you see in an old movie it could be two hundred years old for all I Know yeah but if that phrase the lion and the lamb has changed to the walls all freak out\nI'm gonna have to check things you'll have to let me know and I'll guarantee you that it's changed so I'll guarantee you on the air right now in front of all these millions of listeners that you will find when your mom opens that Bible she is going to find that it has changed\nNow how does it change if we all agree that it was the lion in the lamb and it was there in Prince and black and white hot at age ... change\nThere is some type of now that's coming down to quantum physics in my opinion and this was way out of my league it's it's way above my understanding and picking\nOut of ... as we said in the navy\nYeah way above but I I really truly feel\nThat it it must be a combination of this earned device which opens support those up and the the way of quantum computers that work in concert with that and somehow\nThat now again this is quantum physics thing ... this is a guy and all these different things that are so far beyond my understanding that that is the only thing it would have to be something that are really\nIs on the border of supernatural that kid come into a person's home and a fact objects\nThat are in ... in one home and all through these things that is the only\nWhat if it has changed with what is it hasn't changed bill but we have been moved into another reality that is not ours but it echoes hours in that all reality words the lion and the lamb\n... we we have somehow been moved out of it\nI have thought about that and I've studied on that but what brings me back to a more sinister\nIntent is that when you read some of the scripture changes George some of these are absolutely evil and Monica ... some of the things that are put in here now\nIt is truly evil so there is in tents based on some of the scripture changes there is true in ten\nBased on some of the scripture changes there is true in tend to not only mock dot but\nThe all the scriptures in a way to where evil will be accepted as normal\nIf I went online and typed in the line and the lamb and where is that in the Bible what will come on\nNow it's Isaiah eleven sex and if you went or if you just punch into Google right now I Love and sex or the lion and the lamb if you find that in a guarantee it's going to come up the wolf", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Show Low", "day": "25"}
