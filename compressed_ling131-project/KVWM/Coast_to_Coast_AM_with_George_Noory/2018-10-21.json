we'll check in with\nThem yeah Brian instantly elevated mood on the sideline where you think about what's happening in the last three or four minutes of the game modern Jake landing in the defense or in the Bruins back inside their own territory the defense held\nAs they've done for most of the other game up to this point is the first point and then the audience went down in sport\nIt was interesting to see it's not hard to imagine Brian Arizona being fourteen to ten had not been for decades or giving them all out of his man\nOh fourteen depend had not been for decades are getting them out of his reporting cost the ends on it was interesting to watch him when he came over to the sideline he went over to got on the phone my coaches upstairs\nNo one was oh yaupon to board the entertainment of just permitted to anyone who sat down on the sideline mind so\nYou just got a sense that he had this idea you know what if if if I broke loose ones I can break loose again\nWent up to the audience you'd wind huddle yeah you could tell that he was telling me I just keep opening the holes and they looked at him and said we'll keep\nThere's always got something going wrong and let's see the defense can take a turn and holding them back again ... God\nWe drink milk tennis man for the ruins and the ... gone is going to be taken\nIn the end zone or a touch that UCLA will started his own twenty five\nYears down the tent so that was the about the ruined quarterbacking situation Wilton ... coming in after joining Thompson Robin similar shaken up\nAnd Thompson Robbins and taken to the locker\nAnd so the Michigan transfer it will continue with quarterback he's over three through the year against his first actions since the season opener against Cincinnati\nAnd see what the ruins can do here they have all three of their time outs remaining and straight out of the shutdown will take\nThe snap swing pass out in the\nThis document Kelly out of the market at the thirty seven\nA flight from behind that could be a walk\nThat's some time buyers near side that's a good boy\nAnd a Ford Yvonne Cooper\nWho defensive player there I\nWent over to help break it up it was legit gates can get the ball out there he had\nKinds of Hong Kong to long hair\n... three of seven\nTo the White House to the side home I have\nYour side and Tony Allison got put up\nContact between the defender and receiver\nReport that I don't agree with that\nI think they're going to say they were both going for the ball and\nIt was just their their feet that got tangled up\nAfter thinking about it for a moment when someone will bring it Dylan clump department\nVarious picket is deeper UCLA scrimmage against Arizona forty two\nRuins\nWith admitted nine o'clock running see what they want to do your eye hanging over there was a\nLot but I Want to go out of balance and UCLA the ball and again\nYou know if this was chip Kelly if this was the Oregon chip Kelly yeah they were to hit the accelerator here or he's still may take a shot\nThough because they had the arm to do it well we'll see\nWhat it out of bounds at the thirty\nI think they'll try to take a shot on first now maybe do a play action and throw it and then if if they don't get anything that maybe just run the cargo\nSeventeen Seventy UCLA\nManaged to left in ruins with all their own thirty\nState will take the snap out of anti bacterial fire the passes sort\nOut of the thirty five yard line\nIt's got to be looking for them to try to go over the top\n... Wilson tight and makes his first came to the night\nYou know six out to the thirty six second down and forced to throw from the gun back fires right all the way by calling school urban felt in the receiver schoolers been well he's been everywhere all season but yeah he's been everywhere again player where you better know where he is\nBefore the play starts because he's just a probably make her third\nDown and for for the Bruins it their own thirty six thirty eight seconds left in the house space empty set he'll take the snap steps back to throw over time again waiting and he's going to go deep down\nAt the office it's easier and kind of ran over\nCompletely unnecessary the wall\nThirty one seconds left and a half\nHad\nBeen on the good side of the middle east and I that's the only the second and now the ruins of the Arizona forty nine when they first down thirty one seconds speak out of the shotgun will take to snap back row upon salaries and he's going to be\nOn the other side of the fifty yard line at the forty seven and time out called\nLet's see Kevin some of them\n\nWell you heard that jihad words are represented I twenty\nSix seconds loss of more on the boy named ... Harris was sacked by the way that summer just wants to get\nWants to get his even focused and tell them keep their eyes out for you don't want to give up anything stupid forty six seconds left on the clock is ticking down to fourteenth for UCLA football\nAt the ruined forty seven year old ... quarterback he'll take the snap out of the shotgun back rows ... goes down real hot Arizona forty yard line\nBy Wilson Caleb also the idea he's tackled out of the ruins color\nTime out\nThe ball at the Arizona forty\nAnd Eighteen seconds showing\nAre going to try to get a feel a lot of this is what they're going to try to do they're going to try to see if they can get them\nAll a little bit closer you get\nInto Jim Olson has been outstanding nine or ten and field officers longest\nThis season also occur long for him fifty yards against Colorado\nSo they still got to about another ten yards get into his range that they've gotten time\nDirty or Nineteen second sorry Nineteen seconds\n\nWhen the Arizona forty yard line it's third and one by the way\nIt's made from the shotgun in Lauderdale I thought wow\nWell UCLA is\nYou know the Wildcats lead the nation and kind of an odd category opponent\nPenalties if it was a\nCrazy as it may seem so tonight including tonight now\nArizona opponents Seventy nine times or speak to throw step to the pocket fires down all the way into boy when I was a dangerous past you know\nSmack them like you and so now it's pouring down\nAt the Arizona forty five fourth in sex with a fourteen seconds left\nAnd so obviously they'll go for it here if they convert or they don't feel far enough they could try a field goal I think they just want to get a feel a lot of they probably should have at least got one left okay so they they are going to probably take a shower I'm trying to get a first down here in the field though right from the Arizona forty five\nStraight back to talk with a shotgun sets up time again those are the Arizona forty tackled side of the first\nMarker so along\nThe way it should not unless they got a quick time out what they did say they stop the clock immediately so with ruins all the time out to see whether they walk the mall should be short short but it's just inside the forty\nAnd so we're talking\nKnow fifty seven yard field goal or something which I just\nYou know a fifty seven yard field goal or something which I just along you know\nHowever we got to see about this part of the ball and they control the purse down which central and they are short and so it doesn't matter now because the Wildcats will take over the ball\nSo\nLittle victories and again you go back to that bubble\nIn detail I got the ball not the way going in which would have been a fifty yard touchdown run fifty six yard touchdown and ugly and a\nWhole different story because games out of reach by any means so now the Wildcats I Would assume here although they line up in their normal settled see what was going to do here now the visuals UCLA is going to call him a\nChip Kelly didn't expect to see that he thought they would go out and maybe a Rodriguez would line up and take a need but Wildcats wind up like hey we're going to take a shot at it here and they were in\nDifference for that they are they basically had a single I coverage one safety and everybody else was the man to man covered that the I mean you get a job that I could throw in a bomb and if you got to be able to touch them if they're smart though back off and get into some sort of prevent they're basically ... coverage right there\nOn we'll check the scores it after I met again with USC losing today in Colorado losing today to pat twelve south is up for grabs\nIt now they've gone through a previous difference yeah everybody will drop back\nSo should be the final play the half hour and a penalty\nRodriguez will take us out of the shock yeah back to\nSetting up now throws a short man has dropped by James Taylor\nAnd that is the end of the house\nSo despite the fact\nThat the Bruins committed ten penalties in that first half the Wildcats turned the ball over twice one of them very costly took a touchdown away\nAnd then have to hear the rose bowl UCLA Seventeen in Arizona seven were back after this on the euro zone I N G sports network\nThat he suffered a hamstring strain sometime this week and that held down the beavers\nOp eds as cow wins

his first career start tonight or Fifteen to thirty four thirty one two touchdowns added two interceptions that was really not the story of the night or this game went back and forth on the second half of the Wildcats ever falling by by a rally to have to lead\nAnd this ball game and the second half but a UCLA came up with some critical ways and you know just looking through the statistics you try and find a a turning point here and\nI don't know if there was one because of the second half of the other while kids are getting six times in office and they scored five of those six possessions I mean you cannot criticize that at all you had to scores in the second half in their six possessions but they had that that leads\nYeah there are six possessions but they had that that leaders have time and in some cases you almost go back to the first half and say that was enough yeah\nIt really was you know I don't have plenty of opportunities you know there is no one play that you could point to and said that lost in the game they\nHad multiple plays a lot more opportunities when it was just there were not able to make enough of those plays no one comes to mind detailing rundown feel wide open getting ready to you know for a touchdown or get inside the tin knocked out\nIt's just one that's just that's one example of many many opportunities um\nYou know Scotty young they have UCLA stopped on thirty five they get the first down so lots of opportunities wasn't one player with multiple place\nIt's sometimes in the course of a ball game\nYou can go back and find three or four plays that could swing a game absolutely and there again tonight that was probably the case you look at\nThe intersection in the end zone fumbling the end zone or supplemental fourteenth voice right there I think particularly the bubble because essentially scoring\nAbout just war before the the the possible\nAnd you know in that that penalty was certainly one that\nCame into play tonight I Will say you know try and look at usually lays perspective would say that the ... the first game of the year for us to do duty tonight\nWhen Tom Robbins or got hurt it a nice job\nSeventeen to twenty seven too overboard\nA couple a touchdown just kinda shaky early but settled in and uh into their credit you know he played well and then Josh what Kelly got things going in the second half and almost a hundred yards rushing and the second level though\nWe did everything started everything started to clip form in the second half they started finding some holes in the defense started counteracting what Arizona was doing because in the beginning Arizona had the upper hand on them and the second half Arizona came out oppression right up the middle and started really gets to make them from\nUm they they came back and start making some adjustments start throwing find the tide in over the middle and really started you know pushing the ball down the field and him and it got Arizona off balance again and then it started opening up the run\nSo you know it was a very back and forth game um I think that you know you can be proud of Arizona where they fought today they they had a lot of opportunities when obviously you're never happy when you don't execute and finish it up but you know\nThere they had they had a chance to witness\nI think if you go back and uh I'd have to go back and watch the film again but I'm going\nTo say is starting to UCLA these third officers series [noise] probably [noise] you know somewhere in the third quarter when the Wildcats were able to put pressure\nOn the Bruins quarterback dividends in several areas and then\nThere was that time there and probably starting late in the third quarter where they weren't able to get that pressure and it tells you how important that could be because\nYou know ... six foot six these big strong had time to stand back there and find receivers right\nAnd it's how you get pressure to Arizona had the manufactured sometimes sometimes they're getting from the difference for a lot of times they're listening to do it whenever you listen you gotta you gotta also understand that you know your anger secondary out to dry load of or there may be an opening and you know you got to give you credit\nCounteract it what Arizona was doing it was a battle back and forth on one some once and battles and

conversion again we've talked about that a lot this season that something that is hurting the wildcat defense on several occasions it's just not being able to get off the field ruins rent ten more plays the Wildcats did denied Arizona was six or seven in the red zone UCLA\nTwo or three times ... position which the Bruins by about five minutes or the walk at the ball over three times today none of the cost of the points in other words the Bruins in swore\nOff those turnovers however as we just talked about it and it bears repeating two of the three turnovers uh one of them in particular costs the Wildcats are touched down the other one could have cost them and a\nWhile and if you really want\nPut it in perspective Arizona lost by one point they would feel\nRange at the very least and those are both sides of this so that was of practice at multiple opportunity when as\nAnd that's you know you can look at it two ways you can say it's a very difficult game to lose I mean every game is tough to lose but sometimes it gets more difficult when you have those opportunities it can't quite get their ... or on the other hand you look at the other way and say boy if\nYou lost a game last week did you really never in ... on the road and they have to come right back on the road\nThat's the game last week did you really never in on the road and they have to come right back on the road again and you get down by ten points and you keep fighting that's one thing Kevin someone has been real proud of this team is that no matter what the circumstances of been this year and there's a lot of football I have to be played\nYou know they keep fighting to keep playing nobody's hanging their head and saying well was me and that's what a coach really wants to see out of his team no matter how the season's going when's the last ... so you look at it that way and say okay they they\nThey came back from last week played much better to know you got a sophomore quarterback who was making his first start yeah no I didn't play a perfect game tonight but I tell you what you do when you're thrown into that situation on the road and you go out there in battle like that uh again he was

through the air Wildcats a\nTotal of Seventy two plays five hundred and twenty yards that on their down Arizona was seven Fifteen\nWildcats a turn the ball over three times as we mentioned a couple of times that I individually for Arizona\nA red Rodriguez and his first career start a threw the ball like this Fifteen and thirty four two thirty one two touchdowns two interceptions JJ Taylor Nineteen

top of that ah obviously headed for an all packed twelve\nSeason if not an all American season of some of that might have to do with the wildcat success down the stretch here right if you know they've

whenever you as an opportunity to do it and he's been consistent force on this decent\nAll right so the Wildcats are home to Oregon next week or after the ducks be Washington last week you looked at in Oregon at that point\nThere are only loss prior to today had been to Stanford and again they could have one at home and let get away and then came back and beat Washington again that could have lost it does is it a field goal but Oregon want it all over time and so I think that the the prevailing thought was and I do you agree with this that this morning\nOregon was the best team in the past two of us so then they go to Pullman today in the first half absolutely get manhandle for thirty minutes on the pollution today I mean it was a about is one sided is I've seen you know when you're talking about a couple of top twenty five teams right\nBut then in the second half Oregon made a game of it they ended up losing thirty four to twenty or in a ballgame or you know they they didn't\nAgain they didn't fall and kind of like when the Wildcats got behind today\nOr they didn't vote came back Oregon never was able to tire or get the league Justin Herbert two hundred and Seventy yards of a rebel ended up with fifty by brush Oregon just didn't rush the ball very well it fifty five yards rushing in that ball game which I think it was really to their demise along with just a ripped up Washington state\nSo all of that being said\nUh Oregon is still a you know one of if not the top team in the past will\nAll it's easiest to say that in and you'll have to you know really make much of a case they definitely are and they definitely have one of the more talented roster is in our conference I'm so regardless of you know what people think a lot of their super talented they've got one of the best quarterback from the nation some people\nPick him to go first and then I think he may be the first quarter back taken in the draft um huge lines on both sides of the ball lots of athleticism everywhere so it's a you know that's it's a definitely it's a it's a great Oregon roster\nWhile the ducks will be in town for the kids home come again next Saturday Night kick off

failed and it's just said paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad ah you know the president preceding Hoover had a roaring economy\nGoing and of course remember remember the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know things\nWere starting to where it started out starting to\nBe able to afford luxuries in the country but\nHoover got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise the taxes and put some regulations on and here that fast\nAnd uh you know so here comes FDR and he realizes there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering so he has this is explosion of legislation or in a you know in order to help these people in or so he thought\nAnd he did he did a great deal of hell for a lot of people we put people to work and it was on the government or the government paycheck\nAnd um this was the experiment from the communists the communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp in Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information or was coming through\nOr his friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then you're a New York city or and so this is was their idea of\nHow to help the workers in the working class\nAnd it was a flood of legislation or were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FDR regulated it at that point everything from farms to banking to security that act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put every once in a work on the government do so we can have this cradle to grave wonderful society that Stalin and the Soviets had you\nKnow fooled us into thinking existed new ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing where we're going to escape the uh the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the governor was in charge of everything and I wasn't a wonderful\nPicture valleys of capitalism I think you meant the I think he's the communist instead of equal value misery\nSorry about that I Know where he's at fault and valleys in a ... of of of capitalism you know so right you\nMean ... if I might you can because you you are you you print the list of legislative uh um actions that were enacted\nA in in who murdered FDR and I'm just read here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy act to beer wine revenue act\nOf creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief jak agricultural adjustment act emergency far mortgage act Tennessee Valley authority act securities act aggregation of gold payment class homeowners look lone act Glass Steagall banking act national industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act\nAnd the farm credit act um\nAnd he I mean he did this\nReally without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically ran it through I wasn't going to board a buddy with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I Will not\nThat I'm happy to board them with it here [laughter] so I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was re out of almost like the communist manifesto that that he had the kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it certainly it certainly was the same basic control he was carrying just like Stalin Stalin just Persia all of his enemies you know if you got no way of stone you know you ended up dead his first two wives his doctor who he told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either disagree with America challenging politically\nAnd Stalin did it FDR did it by what packing the Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worried you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know wary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought\nOkay so\nAll of this was going on in Europe is great ... you know is the silhouettes of Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it so if this was a great a second new deal must be better so\nI'm starting to put a you know implement the second new deal and they start to realize that substantial portions of it were unconstitutional so\nThe um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if you get past than it was I mean he was really really fiddling with things I mean a tremendous amount and I know in the history books\nHistory books say a lot of things uh I Know the history books paid him as this wonderful magical genie of or economic success he wasn't there was an economic failure people were ah they were surviving and that was about it that was about all they were doing in the you know and less\nDriving and that was about it that was about all they were doing in the you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services where were you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for until his death I mean that was it was a it was a cat us it was a ... because atrophy\nHow do you use the trading with the enemy act or to to to gain more power lend lease is playing the you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\nWell [laughter] again when he did was that was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the St Louis the same thing with the with the lend lease program\nHe was moving you know munitions and goods and services to the to the to the ... the axis powers and he was given to the to our allies you know free France included and eventually this the Soviet Union\nSo that we could win and they were just running up the cash register to be paid back at a later time\nThere is a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started or he had to do that because he started to realize the new deal is not working so there was no there was a lot going on economically in in our country and then there came to a point\nWhere he knew that we had to get into this war they despise indeed and\nYou know we have spies who I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries that have them more you have spies to our spies in Germany were starting to tell us they're finishing your have your water experiments and with the beats who rockets to carry the nuclear weapons all for it to the globe\nWe'd be speaking German right now\nI mean they were on the brain so we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\nSo when the book you argue as many as ... a man that that FDR new Japanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um then the question is did he did he sort of make it happen duty let it happen or was he just sort of glad it happened\nYou know I I say in my book that I think that the I was probably the greatest war president we ever had and that's because you just love and war\nHe did everything to make World War two happened and I might catch flak for that but you know what the words too bad it's true Iraq um the Japanese were their oil debtor nation meaning they don't create enough oil to run what they have to do in their country\nSo they're getting our oil from us they were coming off a huge war with China they didn't the last thing they wanted was to go to war against us so they were trying to negotiate and negotiate and negotiate and what happened was we shut up the oil spigots on which\n\nHow police officer shot and killed two suspects identified I mean ...

working with you all are although we've never actually met face to face\nBut I've always looked forward to hearing your reassuring albeit discarded voice coming through my head set of these last well nearly five years so God Bless Godspeed and good luck to Nathan state and I hope we can work again sometime\nYou know by by standards in Nineteen forty he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was in was relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I Want to back up with a minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler was sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards because that bad confessions come out diaries or published a you know ... ... documents are declassified and then you can really go back\nAnd really and that's what I like to do um some people right to make friends I write to solve murders on call me crazy so you can really go back in pieced together the snippets of of what was going on so I'm the decay inspiring with the Nazis firing\nA there's a large aspiring American history thirty three members and they were over here to assassinate and sabotage anything if they get their hands on um operation Pistorius' or was another Nazis firing eight members or they were created after Pearl Harbor\nOr they attacked salient targets and has a state and they were all caught and I believe each one of them except for one seven of them got the electric chair one got Thirty years in prison because he flipped on the other ones\nDid they ever get close to Roosevelt\nOh yeah absolutely they did but Stalin was closer\nStalin had infiltrated so much Roosevelt Roosevelt's I'm White House it was a it was incredible so this is it this is what I was saying about the parallels to modern day and people think oh this was Seventy some odd years every five years or whatever what have you\nOh this you know this was all history is not all his reasons repeating itself okay so here we have in the White House again\nI'm Roosevelt was basically screwing everything in the White House\nAnd here we have another up another president who's accused of all of these things prior to being in the White House and uh the the Russians had completely infiltrated the communists completely frustrated at the White House\nAnd we'll talk about that I'm sure it on the road and here we go again here's Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating his White House\nSo he'll give me an example of give me an example in in Roosevelt White House of some of the the communist and they had he here who are the first\nCommunist that overhead as there was a Monday house which was um Woodrow Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth they came that were involved in um FDR's White House\nI couldn't list them all uh there there were there were hundreds of them at least Fifteen high ranking officials and half the White House winnowing communist starting with Harry Dexter why all the way through the elder his\nThey were in all kinds of different uh and also Harry Hopkins which turned out later he was fingered in Nineteen Ninety you know talk about Harry Hopkins is a lengthy later so they don't get bored on go away it's more common [laughter] um\nThe or the White House at the White House had been infiltrated as in the following places that I could find the agricultural adjustment administration the attorney general's office the department of state the national labor relations board the labor advisory board\nOr the world productions or the price of administration the U.S Treasury Department U.S Treasury department was infiltrated by the communists was incredible and the public welfare committee\nSo I won't bore you one with a laundry list but it's in my book of all of the people who were you know who were in that list or who are high ranking officials in those are in that list of of people so I mean he was just\nCommunists were all around them Harry Hopkins actually it was the HHS secretary of state he was one of the architects of the new deal\nWas one of FDR's closest friends in confidence and he was one of the top officials who sent to you know obviously\nEvery FBI couldn't travel very well because of his affliction and you know the races in the wheelchair and so forth so we had to have someone fly over to talk of Stalin and so forth\nAnd uh that person was Harry Hopkins um who's Harry Hopkins actually was a friends of Eleanor Roosevelt 'em through the uh CPU essay the Communist Party United States of America which is still in existence by the way up north I mentioned that or not\nAnd how they Hopkins in down and get on\nFamously he was actually ... Harry Hopkins as time went by he was also Arkansas I could live my lease program to help the Soviets out So Harry Hopkins\nFamously got along with Joseph Stalin because Stalin was warming waters in America for all of this happen okay I'll get to that\nI Won was warming the waters in America for all of this happen okay I'll get to that in a minute\nOr he was Harry happens afterwards fire afterwards was fingered by a KGB the factor and I'm going to butcher this name I'm old they grew up ... and there's a name here I just simply couldn't even begin to pronounce they both identified 'em they were both KGB defectors they both identified\nHarry Hopkins is the mysterious agent Nineteen who is contacting the Soviet\nUnion about uh the the than on a project which of course we all know was a nuclear weaponry so here we have I mean there are informants and spies all around\nThe FDR so so the point where they he goes to the trunk conference\nYou know I mean that'd be a style and knows more about Roosevelt than Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt meeting at these conferences it was just it was incredible how how penetrated the Americans were uh at the hands of the Nazis weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill him\nStyle in writing information right he had\nPlans in the post war world of taking America was half communist anyway he had plans of taking over America and making them a full communist country with him as a ruler\nSo he was a little diluted in his own in his own right but how this all happened was prior to this of course this was a new ideology communism wow this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does this and that and you know we don't have to go to work in every word is provided for\nWell Stalin had sent invitations to 'em\nOr directors in Hollywood a union leaders are college professors ended with a target and they would were sent invitations all expenses paid to go over to Russia to see how this this work and\nThey went to a city in the city's names escaping me on the ... it is listed in my book\nIn the ... they were to observe how Russia did things and how everyone was care for how this working how terrific was and look at what we've done and you need to do this your country has your you know look at you look at your depression that's going on and so forth he really sees the opportunities Tamerlan was not a stupid guy\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how and they tried to recruit Hemingway\nYet had loudly so it was a fictitious pound that didn't exist there was made a cardboard basically\nSo they can village a Potemkin village\nAnd there you go um he sends all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country meeting her country\nInto this wonderful new ideology you didn't know anything about evil umpires you know in the new deal you got to cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings and the strength poison by Stalin spelling is the puppet master ... he's this guy would he managed to accomplish\nAnd his wife was incredible it was one of the six original members of the most of the revolution\nAnd he ended up there just to make fun of style and\nHe was nothing more than a he used to keep the party journals I used to call them\nComrade or what did they call them Conrad index card used to own a blur used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless when the party\nOne by one knocked off every one of the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nStanding stop I'm I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote that in his a quote from lenders will come redstone is to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after Stalin's death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\nMurder I gotta I gotta jump in here Steve will take a timeout Wilson picket taking us into the break with everybody needs somebody

you know so much of the post world are so much of the post war world\nIs a result and then in the ensuing Cold War and and all of that really is a result of FDR's frail condition he's greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference in your\nPain forty four when when that post war world\nWas really carved up and style and obviously you know took advantage seized upon Roosevelt spray on condition or and and I'm actually I really didn't know what happened to you you just was so out of it but I mean you look at those pictures of FDR at the the conference\nAnd obviously he's ... he looks like death warmed over like seven months before at the Tehran Conference he looks is as fit as a federal I mean ... what is going on with what happened in those seven months\nWell up until this point we've been talking about the bond that we haven't talked much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with them\nI'm at the hours being slowly poison from within the White House and I have to be very careful here not to give this book away but it was a type of poison let's see where are you thinking of America is the leading edge on things and knowing all these things and what they were poisoning with with something that\nWas plentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet but\nThe rest of the world certainly did Europe certainly some of those countries in Europe or Fifteen hundred years old maybe older so in certain situations they hit a jump on us\nAnd you know I don't think grandpa Walton would've known anything about poisoning or the after effects of this poisoning especially because they didn't know it was poisonous at the time so FDR as being slowly poison from inside the White House every time he goes away too Warm Springs Georgia\nTo sow his ailing legs\nAnd go on a retreat so he can mentally and physically rejuvenate himself he starts to get stronger every time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or so you know I [laughter]\nI did a little digging into this because it was just so what started me on this whole thing of FDR I thought it was a little suspicious and a little too convenient that in\nThe tiny march of Eighteen days\nA Roosevelt Hitler and Mussolini had all died conveniently at the end of the war I thought that was a little convenient\nSo this is what people ask me we just start looking into this for and this and that I also thought it was convenient that FDR just died of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's bunker I thought that was a little to get a little bit convenient so\nAnd when I started to dig in and I saw that the the odd deterioration of this president during this time period\nI said you know wait a minute I I really got to look into this I didn't believe it in high school when we were taught about it back then they actually taught history\nYou know I mean [laughter] but in the book you point out how he he doctors I guess Dr mcentire admiral a navy admiral mcentire his personal physician and his his cardiologist Dr Howard grew in\nThey were they had no idea what was going on and they were doing X rays and take doing all of these tests they were really clueless\nWell and this is where you know this is where the rubber finally starting to meet the road for me they really work with what they were thinking the American public just thought oh he ... himself out for us and you know he was the advance of polio and this and that and the other thing in\nThe symptoms of the his doctors were absolutely baffled he had a bunch of doctors Emma Ross McIntyre who's the White House physician he was also the vice admiral and in a certain ... surgeon general of the navy\nUm you know he was FDR's physician from thirty to forty five until he died a Dr Howard ruin was a commander in the navy a course FDR's a navy guy who's going to have maybe doctors\nOr he was chief of cardiology it but as though I mean these are heavy hitters they have no idea what's wrong with this guy no idea what they do is they take him to the doctor of the day and the reason why they're so baffled is because FDR is getting sick after meal times\nThis is my first hand something was wrong in his blood pressure would bounce he would go normal and then it would go it would go roaring\nOut of control three ten over one Ninety five or something and it would be up there and then it would come back and they were trying very hard\nTo every ... wasn't responding his body wasn't responding to anything that they were giving him\nSo we know when they when they got to this point they said look at you know Nineteen forty four is rolling around this guy's going to run for president again again\nAnd we've got to get to the bottom with how's it going on here so they send them to the doctor of the day Dr frankly founder of the way he clinic in Boston and he was a surgeon and he is the guy\nIn America at the time so he examines FDR march in Nineteen forty four\nAnd um when he comes out was is a ... a glaring statement which is now available online you can look it up with the History Channel basically saying that this is a dead man walking\nAnd the what he the laundry list of symptoms that he reveals that FDR has does not align with the advance of polio\nThey advance the aligned with the advance of poisoning FDR as being slowly poison\nStyling style and got him I can tell you that I'm styling wants FDR out of the picture or at least mentally incapacitated at the altar conference 'cause he wants to rule the world\nAfter yard he wanted to set up the for policemen of the world um the United states Great Britain trying in the Soviet Union so they could all police there quarter of the world FDR didn't want to share the world with uncertain Stalin didn't want to share the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world\nHe was a megalomaniac with what he did in the Soviet Union of course we didn't know that that wasn't wasn't you know reveal to us until years later\nWants it they died that was part of the and the ghosts\nIf you will to us until years later\nWho wants it they died that was part of the negotiation team in the U.S at ... on the way back from the altar or one of Roosevelt aids died conveniently also of a brain aneurysm\nWell there are people dropping dead around FDR of rain any resumes all over the place that no one writes about again no one writes about this or his name was ... and he was a high ranking naval officer he was on the way back I Believe from the wrong conference dies on this ship\nOf a cerebral hemorrhage he gets back he being FDR he gets back a short time later I'm FDR's personal secretary also named McIntyre into relation to the doctor Ross McIntyre he dies of his cerebral hemorrhage\nThe drug of the day is morphing rat poison in its\nPower was tasteless order lists and its circulating all over the place is a matter of fact styling got murdered or the rat poison waterfront from ... from the internal ... governor\nThat came out later as well so there's a lot going on with your friend is not what got FDR would have been to sudden it would have thrown up too many red flags okay Stalin wanted to deal with Harry Truman you want it to deal with Harry Truman 'cause he wasn't as political savvy or so he thought he knew that FDR was\nA a tremendous mine and he couldn't outsmart them\nOkay so here's you know this had to happen um for style and to get his way and we he had been so infiltrated the government with everywhere\nEverywhere as a matter of fact to thicken the plot FDR dies in front of two Russian Spies or he was having his portrait painted in Elizabeth assume it's off\nUm she was a Russian she was over here I'm with her

[laughter] it was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote so the uh the book being um the White House physician and that was a Ross and Ross mcentire were they in on the murder habits only new idea\nI I I couldn't say I'd have to say that they had good intentions they were just a little bit little ignorant maybe and\nAnd what happened to ... the Russian painter and her driver and and and um she tops husband\nWell they just kind of disappeared into obscure I mean at the time or two afterwards well immediately afterwards\nWell they packed up the uh uh uh Robbins and assume it's off and they threw loose Lucy Mercer who he was having an affair with among others um [laughter] and um they tried to get out of Warm Springs Georgia as fast as possible so in her book\nUm her being I'm sure with off in her book she describes the plight that they took to to get away from Warm Springs Georgia which I thought was a little crazy because if it was a natural death\nUm you know why I don't know why would why fleet a scene right right you know I mean if it's a natural death why still the records you know and there's a parallel here to the FDR's or to the JFK thing actually\nUm JFK shot in Dallas they break law to bring him\nTo a out of Dallas the autopsy should have been performed in Dallas\nThey break law to bring him to besides the\nThe law was the same in Nineteen sixty three it was it was a Nineteen forties\nNow the law was the same in Nineteen sixty three it was it was a Nineteen forty five they did the same thing they broke the law removing FDR's body from Georgia bringing it to the both of those so both you know both the JFK and FDR's body I removed illegally\nThey're both at but says though we're all kinds of fun things happen you know this but says that could talk you know ... and they they rushed this guy it's it's a little less than sixty nine hours from FDR's death\nTo him in the open being buried they couldn't get this guy's body in the ground fast enough\nNo north by the way and no one moment no autopsy knowing bombing it just went crazy\nHere and crazier and crazier all the way through\nSo I mean and there's other things in history to Richard I mean take a look at 'em you know not just this I'm going to be working on Princess Diana coming up next but there are other presidents in history who I also believe that the murder that they've lost over um Warren Harding\nWarren Harding was it was that was obvious this guy was murdered and there's another one that we thought about but as far as FDR's concern\nI mean the the [laughter] the information in my head just exploded when I started digging and digging and digging and it's still it's still boggles my mind you know the book has been published for a little while now and I still even after the book is one published you know I'll find a new fact and go wow I should have put that in the book I mean there's\nThere'll be a volume three perhaps uh let me get the calls here and he's an Alabama in the wild card line any good morning welcome to coast\nDonkeys are state I'm calling to ask you about some written music ... well several Eleanor Roosevelt garden party she said to my aunt who work at the state department and burns remind now\nI'd also like to me that's an experience with the blood thinner prescribe for my grandmother which was worked for in a ... has things all over like Bruce because it causes bleeding all in the body Montana or\n... pounds in eight year isn't\nThere you go like you don't you say it wasn't a warfare and with Roosevelt because that would have been too quick\nYeah it was it wasn't people around him they were disposing of with war for him because it\nAnd she's right if she's right I mean it's been the blood out to to the point where if you touch a person's they'll get you know either the their brains will either bleed or they'll have an ... or something or a cerebral hemorrhage and they'll also and of course I Know Dr but no my parents were both on it they're\nBoth on a variety of listener so\nLike my late father was as well\nSure because ... with any thanks for calling on\nThank you uh let's go back in the wild card line is it my dad in New York\nMy admiral Hi there good morning ah okay as quick\nA three part of an outlet sent over there at\nFirst I thought I heard um a gentleman on the air I heard wet said top ...\nOr so believe said that's the way with it and I'd like to know if he didn't really get with him and his theory around it I saw in ... and what is it the grasses so he would be someone that we talk about that new the new deal as\nAs a ah doing the right thing around that that that off for the so called Great Depression\nAnd thought like thoughts on that and laugh late he maintains about both a direction connection and they are both FDR and it's a towering stable genius if you will and the White House\nIn pain somewhat different because at the camera and then it's shaken a thing to have more to do with leading not even how he wound up as president and of course the money that he had to go to encounter writes in Saudi Arabia that like a lab or rape\nAct and of course the odd that do the a fifty fifty sad you know we know that he has a ... and ...\nWell my I had if I could just jump in because we're not talking about Trump I think if it's enough to put words in your mouth but I think it would be kind of facetious\nOr about the Russian connection with Trump but let's just stick to to FDR way we can do a whole show perhaps another time on on the Russian dos and so forth but and you're right ... a big fan of FDR I Know Webster a little bit and I've had dinner with him and and he waxes on about the new deal\nUh obviously Steve you're you're not a fan did you have anything to add\nUh no I don't know the man I Would love to meet him sometime uh as far as the new deal I think it was probably the right thing at the time I think it was an experiment I don't think anybody knew how it was going to go 'cause I Want it to my knowledge there's never been done before so I mean it\nI have no doubt that they thought at the time it was a really good thing it helped a lot of people um it just wasn't along sustaining campaign so\nAs far as the Russians and the current administration yeah I was kind of little facetious as to how how everyone is in whole history you kind of repeats itself but kind of doesn't you know um it's it's amazing how we have the [laughter]\nWe were right back in the same thing we have another red scare in in the country it's it's really it's really something else if only Joseph Joseph McCarthy were alive you know he would he would really enjoy this I think\nRight so I think your point there making there was that the the Russian connection during FDR's time was overt uh and today it's I guess you would to coin a phrase from a CNN if nothing burger\nRight I mean if I mean if they ever prove it with from which I don't know if they're ever going to um they may I don't know I'm not privy to that information but it's it's just interesting how\nHow hold it to the history is another red scare it's starting to repeat itself all over again and here we are Seventy some odd years passed its funny which is how history repeats itself becomes relevant actually a religious thing book I think you'll like it thanks for less than I ever growing up\nWe will uh we're heading into a break here at the er the bottom of the hour and then we will get to a more calls people are lined up in Chicago Pennsylvania Gulfport, Mississippi San Pedro California Sioux Falls South Dakota we'll get to as many of you as we can\nAnd here's the Reverend Al Green I'm so tired of being alone taking a break on coast to coast am [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nSecond of all I don't I've read up on this or that they would do and how it got away with all the stuff we wrote about God dollar that somebody to look at Roosevelt body really make sure the let's see if he would he would call 'cause I'm calling it a lot of that\nAnd I think it was for the story was that it was ... to ... he wanted Roosevelt Web cooking to break them up with a cold that the that Iran and uh you know and all that and got the you know he was afraid of but I I Can't buy the fact that uh that's all I Want her to death I I think he did not want to want to live on the part that mark my take on it\nAll right interesting John ... bad shape you going to die anyway All right Steven you want to reply [noise] um\nYou know there's a lot of people who read up on things and to the Victor goes the spoils okay a lot of the things that we've been sold 'em have shown slanted okay I'm not suggesting that what you said has been\nHe looks so better Nineteen forty four that was after almost two years of being poison\nSystematically poison that's why he look so bad in Nineteen forty four this wasn't from the advance of polio and it's filled it out very very plainly in my book so it's it's an interesting time in history is an awful lot of people who research vision I learned from every one of them I'm not gonna sit here and professional every little angle that's for sure\nBut um as far as silenced I wouldn't want to rule the world he didn't he didn't have any interest in sharing anything with FDR so if you say something to look in the in the in the coffin sent someone to verify what was going on he was already being that that was already verified from the two Russians were in front of him when he died\n... that that was already verified from the two Russians that were in front of him when he died\nSo if if indeed that happened and it may have I'm not suggesting that didn't if indeed that had happened it was probably just so he\nCould uh you know get recognition of the fact that we weren't giving them some sort of false propaganda\nHi John thank you for that to me interesting points there ah let's see how to James in Philadelphia Hi James good morning look at the coast to coast\nFrankie Richard uh but my guess for my question for Mr ... is just or banning it in your research for ... ah did you come across all anything about this just a ... a a attempted coup against a Roosevelt in the thirties and that\nUh if it did happen if you came across it how close was it a to happening and that the coolest ... uh it was a exposed by an army general ... medley butler in that one of the people involved was a I think was a Garth or\nDid you come across anything about the coup how if it if it's true how close did he come the happening\nUm if it if it did happen if there was an attempted\nCoup against Roosevelt\nSaid something that you discuss in the book like a deep\nUh James thanks for calling and I did run run into that information but it was after the book was published so you won't find that information in there I thought it was fascinating when I did run across it didn't make the book I'm Sorry I Wish it did um and ... yeah I don't really I don't know I guess that people say a lot of things I don't know how true that really is\nWhere the amount of people who are around Roosevelt\nWho didn't like him for multiple reasons I'm from you know suppressing the uh the the capitalist to holding office as long as he did it would not would not surprise me but I mean as far as as far as that's concerned\nI don't have any I don't have any great and I was into that I discovered it after the book but I did run into it so thanks for your call and I'm Sorry I couldn't be of much help there like I said I I I I Would be lying if I said I thought that I knew everything\n[laughter] I like James thank you for that Wayne is in Chicago Wayne good morning welcome to coast\nNike ridge or work on you or do you do your job do you feel good return from nine to

NPR committed suicide and that's why Eleanor hurry up and bury him so nobody knew about it\nI I've been looking for the man on the on line on ... for the summer of ... knock your firing but he gave a very compelling period it'd be very interesting to hear that man on and do your own right now to compare to know where do you think we're\nShort I've I've not I've not heard that before but I'd have to I'd have to look into that um I guess the question would be why why would he\nUm why would he do that I don't even have you have you ever come across anything indicating at any theory that ... that FDR mean tried to take his own life or did they can go next\nYou know that's a new one on me or I haven't heard that but again like I said I'm I'm you know I I Know what I Know I don't know what somebody else knows [laughter] I just I just I wrote this book\nAnd I ... I followed the line of facts that brought me to it and I found information along the line to operate it\nYou know if somebody else has come up with that I don't I don't maybe as quality of life couldn't have been great you know with the with the situation in the head with this polio I mean anything's possible people said that all this president committed suicide to um I certainly I certainly uncovered in who murdered Elvis I certainly uncovered information that the bones that but\nI guess anything's possible I mean if there is a situation where I can get on the air with the other fellow you know what I mean I Would respectfully love to do so\nI'd love to look into that town Wayne thank you for that can you hear me now ... wells in Pennsylvania we're moving fast You're welcome morning welcome to coast to coast\nBy Richard nice to talk to once again\nLikewise thank you\nWhy should I don't want that people know this job a nice uh motives jurors pact or anything but uh they have to remember that in Nineteen forty five when FDR passed away the life expectancy for men I Believe it was only like forty nine that sixty so\nThat's six to three FDR was already beating the odds soda ... big now\nAn additional medical science much ... than that or we can go back ... Elvis when Elvis died in Nineteen Seventy seven or the medical science compared to the day was permitted\nNow as I recall Mr obeying the uh I Believe I called the last time Mr oh Benny when John and he said that all this had no history of heart disease now\nUh with all due respect Richard his mother was born in Nineteen sixteen died in Nineteen fifty eight which would make her at the most forty two and she died and his father died relatively young I Believe about sixty seven so rich can we have to ask ourselves whether\nOr not it was in the genetic cards for outlets that level I'm Alive\nOr Steve can tell you that he's and then he talked to the person who held Elvis had heart in his hands and said that there was no less the do you tell there was no evidence of a heart disease at least none that I Would be sufficient to kill him I mean it may have developed later and it wasn't present at the time of his death\nRight Hi well thanks again for your call I'm Gladys died because colonel Parker she was ... was she like those okay\nHurdle Parker till Gladys that you're obese and I can't film you with Elvis and I wanted to take pictures with you with Elvis because people want to see all of us his mother because there was a rumor out that Elvis had shot his mother\nWhich was ridiculous so he said I Want you to take his diet pills I Want to you skinny so they can put you in pictures with Elvis I'm the diet pills and the alcoholism\nCombined is what killed her okay that's what happened with that as far as all of us is concerned in his heart um there was no real evidence of a heart attack I'm In a I talked to Dan Wallach who was actually on the autopsy and they took Elvis Presley is hard\nThey caught it they thinly sliced it\nEvery quarter inch to look through everything and they held every quarter inch part up to the light and they looked at under the electron microscope there was no real evidence of a heart attack there was no ... there was no hemorrhaging there was no nothing\nElvis Presley is heart was a little oversized whatsoever so we're all of his other organs he was\nA little oversized whatsoever so we're all of his other organs\nHe was ... years away from heart disease and you can clearly be said that um there was there was no uh Elvis Presley did not die from any sort of a\nA cardiac event now the coroner who said that he died from a a cardiac arrhythmia was telling more stories and mother goose here we have the autopsies not even finished the tests aren't even in yet\nHe's telling the world that Elvis Presley died of a cardiac arrhythmia\nOrder for him to determine that he would have had to listen to the beating heart cardiac arrhythmia can't be determined when Howard has stopped\nYou can't find a a a wacky heartbeat and wants to hurt speeding so that was the story that was put out there um\n\n[noise]\nOne suspect in custody another on the run I mean Fox News Eighteen year old to foggy meaner is accused of fatally shooting officer ...

Sayre\nAnd tonight this morning we're coming do you live from coast Toronto, Canada affiliate in depth radio news talk contests [noise] last night I mentioned this news talk ten ten the old C F R B had been on the radio for eighty years correction it's more like Ninety\nNinety years [noise] also last night\nOr should I say earlier this morning during the open line segment a number of callers shared their near death experiences or glimpses of an afterlife\nTonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time an alleged after death communication involving the great American magician escape artist\nHarry Houdini Houdini and his wife best were fears the bunkers of psychic ability mediums and the spiritual this movement in fact Houdini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and their fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving for unexpected punches was abdomen\nBy McGill University student backstage at the princess theater in Montreal Canadian connection there on his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his blood wide best he would do show\nThan more than two years after his death his wife best attended assailants conducted by medium psychic Arthur for during which for allegedly channeled the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to\nBy Harry and bass\nInitially best stated publicly and aside in witness testimony that she believed Terry Haddon fact communicated to her from the grave\nLater however she recanted and stated publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the ... despite this best continue to hold highly publicized say ounces in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nDuring all that time she said she received no communication from Harry finally after the last say also in October thirty first Nineteen thirty six best gave up saying ten years is long enough to wait for any Matt\nThomas ... is a writer and passionate seeker of truth on a lifelong spiritual quest\nMore than ten years ago Thomas wrote an article which he posted online titled Houdini afterlife experiment did it work\nIn it he argues it's quite possible Houdini dig communicate from the grave during assailants held in January of Nineteen twenty nine\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fan just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise]\nWhat do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother and Harry mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important\nPart in this whole thing I'm an Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI sort of out or in public didn't need any out her ...\nYeah yes yes I started to talk overview um some of this that play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow that part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience is how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of slow psychic act or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coated method\nThat that Harry in best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody method\nUm I think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to a and anybody that interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of ten words and the tenth word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one through can\nAnd number can can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry and best first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket ... All right what does the last two days it's on the coastline\nAnd they these were rich\nAnd pray answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so they would work these words into an easy sentence like quickly Harry I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural miss to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins the best held in her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty age and because she would say she's communicating to him verbal using these code words and she said quickly\nQuickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eight were in in the secret code emitted so so that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right makes size right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passed number can but they have a way of doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now tell please speak quickly look be quick and as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical\nDot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry I Know\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this code because after the message was delivered to bath and she said that it works somebody\nQuickly said hey this was all in a book is all already published in a book this is no big deal well I thought I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within a book but they wouldn't say the name of the book out of the people were saying it's unpaid da da da da da da da\nAnd then I finally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look in the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county\nAnd for all of the twenty five cents they would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out in eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just all of that may not say there's a link inside there to show you scan of this book\nAnd so that book does talk about those ten were and how it's used to form numbers but not out of warm were\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book\nAnd um it see I hear some bullet points about this that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coated word rose about that the secret message wouldn't code the word the leave and the actual\nSecret tempered message none of that with in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask you this is he also was a famous magician and he's a close personal friend of Harry Houdini so when this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book\nEveryone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that forward with a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important for you to point out\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini a and therefore it may have been possible for so much you know about that because\nNow we get into the say on and and uh we should back up and explain that on who Deanie deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this is actually true but allegedly he told them that yeah I'm a skeptic I I I'm going to a bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way\nTold them that ... I'm a skeptic I I I'm a bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way\nI can get a message to bass I Will try and then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Fort how did he how did for get in touch with best [noise]\nI ... just a minute but I just want to point out that I think that this work because back and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science Lindsey experiment checking into reality as it is a heartless machine\nAnd I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and how they look we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question\nUm Ford was reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry die [noise]\nOne of the clients is getting and reading and Harry's mother here it she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into this session and then hit on putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to that\nWell that gets this letter and she very bond in writing is the understanding I had\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul and spirit was surviving gap and so we got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur Ford pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue\nArthur Ford was well aware of who ... his reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he did Thomas\nI got to jump in here forgive me Thomas I got a jump in and got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and Bess Houdini here's Jean night taking missing to the break with do me on coast to coast am [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nThought you\n[noise]\nThomas resentful my guess is the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing a Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com at Thomas Thomas so let's get to the other say on\nAt a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nUm are there for it shows up and he Arthur Fort Worth the spirit name Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened\nAnd they were able to make it kind of a um like a show very theatrical show where hey would work with that the same way they worked when they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her\nWell he was very poetic with are very at times very touching and romantic and there were statements like throw a curtain and all of this but what they did with they put this pen key words on the table and then they decoded then and after it was decoded\nThe message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I wanted to explain that that nickname\nThat Harry used for her with Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song\nRight around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring and so here we called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was the coated was rose about ...\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and your language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd they didn't even know it does anyone know did or the Ford no that Roosevelt was the ... name for bachelor was this common knowledge\nOh that Roosevelt was the ... name for best or was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends um [noise]\nSo I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on his kind of set up\nSomeone said that uh there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he had he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah I just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that\nThey would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other were and\nAnd again he just he he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher ... just didn't show the word believe they used the secret coating message\nThat we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look can be quick in and these all windy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe yes\nYes and um and she declared easy access she declared it a success correct absolutely and I'm\nIn fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on set off this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary\nI Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence given to me by Arthur forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only hurt but three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that had happened\nI think so in effect of the\nNewspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around fourteen months after this there is a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now denounce that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever\nThat this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph or radical rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it read ... I Can't pronounce the name but don't or the ...\nName but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited Arthur Ford over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in a closet but they're hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange well the person that shows up is not really author Fort it's someone that's been paid in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says ah I paid\nMrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because\nBeth heard about it well the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so bass responded in a letter\n'em to that same paper where she just completely denies it there she's been a party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford said that they were in cahoots he's a liar\nI mean she's very clear in this letter goes on and on and I had never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted\nOn the website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nYou know and this was written to Walter wind chill the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter wind chill and he was um yes the social and go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the\nNew York evening graphic but it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters the letter starts off saying this\nLetter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity\nYou know I'm just telling you I was no party Danny fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he confessed and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further uh money's the water\nBecause although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened other than she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened\nIn one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in their communication you know and so and I think that this fester and she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends\nBeing labeled and not\nUm and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nIf anyone says they get in touch with me after my death to know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone\nUm so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sand and twenty nine was she re camping and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award a reward a ten thousand dollar prize to any one to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if he really wasn't boots with Arthur Fort he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer well that sounds you\nKnow pretty pretty iffy whereas if they were in cahoots he could've said I'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress to be hindered by some kind of monetary motivation you know would have been much more graceful you see it I mean\nBut it was just days after where she says I'm not going to pay the money [noise]\nRight so your your feelings are the best basically and she herself was and vowed to bunker for fifty years uh and so the social pressure from her family was just too much and so she she caved and she recanted\nThat's what happened um I think the subtitle of my as safe as something like that does misses\n\n[noise]\nIn Georgia I'm hands who sales Fox News shooting a police officer in
