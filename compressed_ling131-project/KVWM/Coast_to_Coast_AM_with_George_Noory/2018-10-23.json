more ah that will become a possible thing to do\nLet's go to John in Seattle, Washington welcome to the program John go ahead\nYou for taking my call You're welcome thank you for your your guess is Robert\nRobert Robert a great question because well I'm a girl we take 'em off here [noise] there's sort of speculative reverse is um\nYou know anything about this ... years ago but we're just talking about anti gravity but in the sixties and ...\n... you know the thing with the possible reversal of being able to generate orders for gravity and secondly you know anything about electrical record calls from\nA a I mean that those three questions but he's got one one more Robert ... one more okay one more\nYeah the third one is um what do you ... to design a space station like a memorial type thing to test I'm a human physiology reacts to Mars gravity\nAll right Robert let's take that one first go ahead\nAll right well let me just a run 'em down quickly then maybe a provide some detail the first one of the Learjet and anti gravity I don't know anything about that\nSecond question artificial gravity um which goes along with your last question of a spinning spacecraft yeah we do know how to create artificial gravity you spin the spacecraft\nCrates and typical force that mimics gravity and that's a uh in my view a a a a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage in order to ah prevent the deterioration of bone and muscle that you can't with 'em\nIn zero gravity for long range belongs for a long time so\nYeah exactly 'cause you you know anybody who just walks around on earth you know not an athlete just the person that you know walks around the house goes to the store they they get somewhat of a workout 'cause they're carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on their feet and and and and and and you know and moving it around a\nA worse in space just floating around in zero gravity you don't get that and so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity for use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and zero gravity we can but if you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition\nNo roller won't be able to do anything for you\nRight and then the the the third question was electric repulsion yeah I Know a fair amount of electrical pulse and\nI'm electric propulsion is using\nA electric or electromagnetic forces to accelerate at ... pounds to very high velocity she can get about ten times the exhaust philosophy with an electric roster that you can with the chemicals roster the problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot\nAnd that means that I'm\nYour power is limited and therefore you're thrust is limited and what that means is that electric propulsion systems\nAre kind of like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from zero to sixty in a week I'm not terribly useful for short distance driving around town\nBut if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that went all the way around the world\nOkay you floor of the car you know in San Francisco and um you know a week later going sixty miles an hour and you've reached a the east coast and now you can go\nYou're going sixty miles an hour and you've reached a the east coast and now you can go\nDriving around the world because your car and drive over water in this case but in any case now you you have a tremendous advantage in that your your your mileage is great but if you're going from earth to Mars and actually takes longer to get there with electric position than it does with chemical caution\nIf because it the time it takes to speed up is longer than the time it takes to get there\nOn the other hand if you're going from earth to Saturn electric propulsion would get you there faster\nRobert if you had to pick one man going back to the moon or going to Mars which would you pick\nPick Mars you would uh be costs you know I mean look we went to the moon fifty years ago or we're not going to inspire the next generation by doing things that their grandparents' generation did\nUh the science on Mars is far more profound we're going to discover the truth about the potential uh existence and diversity of life in the universe and bars has gotten much more resources to compare marched to the moon\nTo the choice in the age of ocean exploration Mars compares to the moon to way North America compared to ... you know Greenland was closer to Europe European scotch agreement long before they got to North America [noise]\nBut it wasn't a place where you could build a civilization that didn't have all the different resources\nAnd ah so Mars is is you know it's a much richer world\nBut you know here's NASA and frankly it doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars well then they say well then we'll go to the moon well when I say is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars then get on with it go to the moon don't come up with\nSome other thing that the halfway house you have to do before you go to the moon because if we can go to them and fifty years ago we could go to them and now\nI can you believe the next July will be fifty years since we went to the moon with the first time fifty years already wherever we're at the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the moon and if anybody told me then that I'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I I I Would have thought they were crazy\nYeah I Would agree east of the Rockies Joe's with us Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead\nI'm Sorry they can get to go to the mall but a couple of questions and the ...\nUh when we send out these\nProbes are what you are or where would you\nBe dealing with extreme heat even open space as opposed to the planet\nAnd would it be advantageous to us who kind of go to mercury though with some sort of probes in case back here we have waterway a global warming due to maybe solar flares combined with CEO to increase was\nUh in other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme heat and space help us to deal with it potentially back here and also what kind of person would profile are going to Mars\nUh how would you profile a potential candidate to travel on a ship come to Mars what type of personal way looking for\nAll right let me take the questions one time uh the first question it'd be hot and space if you're close to the sun um if you're a far away from the sun is called\nAnd uh if you're in earth orbit kind of depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\n[noise] um but um\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can't you can get the reason why spacesuit so why is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so you kinda have to watch that\nUh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people well okay\nHold on for a second the rubber we're going to hit the brake already going by fast food you Robert Ruben ... with us we'll be back well uh let them finish up ... questions there and a bit interesting what kind of a personality would want to go to Mars will be back in the moment on coast to coast am\nFeeling lost not by your radio grab your smartphone or computer and listen to I hard

August conference you're working on\n[noise] uh well we're having another conference a in August uh or actually this year it might be in September in Los Angeles\nI'm ... could a ... it's probably going to be at one of the major universities in Los Angeles [noise] um and ah\nI'm sure we're going to have all sorts of debates about things like is this lunar orbit gateway or is it a gateway or is it a toll booth okay you know we're going to have that one out\nUm you know we're going to have all sorts of presentations on the latest discoveries you know it there's a marsh probe on its way it's going to land in November ... insight and it's going to find out how geologically active Mars is so that's kind of land this November and we'll probably have\nUm a discoveries from it um there's also a new space telescope that just got into orbit um a couple of months ago which will be reporting data discovering\nPlanets going around other stars or am I guess it will have discovered hundreds by them and you will prompt discover thousands words and\nI'm ... I'm you know a will\nYou know since we're going to be in Los Angeles will have a scientist from Jet Propulsion lab coming over and\nTalking about uh uh all the latest discoveries from the rovers on Mars and the plans for the next one's a problem we have ... people talking about what they're up to I'm hoping to get blue origin people there too so we can hear from them\nAnd maybe some from the the the small entrepreneurial companies like vector space just got funded by Seventy million dollars to\nCreate small launches you know the we now have small satellites that can do what it used to take big satellites or to do and so small rockets make a lot of sense\nUm and um I I myself I'm involved and design of mission to go to the moon with ground penetrating radar with for satellites each of which are the size of a shoe box\nUm and so little watchers like this could really play a role I'm\nAll right let's take a few more calls for you what's going to the first time caller Armand in a bell gardens California go ahead Armand\nYes good evening George did you and your guest I just wanted to put something on your radar screen so to speak and that is that you may not be aware of this but there's a whole new paradigm for water planetary water on not only or but on march\nIf you're interested in learning more about it you can go to jail water I. M. G. L. dot com like international your water international and the reality is that it's already been well demonstrated on this planet\nBut a water comes from the back row below at whatever you got the ... the planet fractured\nWater that hydrogen and oxygen elemental hydrogen and oxygen and make its way to the surface and moved back\nIn areas that will go ... sure that happens quite often and on Mars the same effect is there in fact the largest well you know in the solar system is Olympic moms are bars where it gets over eighty thousand feet oh just for the ages there was a cold they're on top\nAnd that's what ... or by the scar city or lava flows that happen\nSo that's really where the water has always been on Mars and that's where the water is on this planet and it's time I think for the start factoring that to our calculations for Mars trip\nWell said rubber what do you think\nWell I I it sounds interesting we certainly know there's a lot of water on Mars we found the lakes found glaciers and there's probably more to find so I think he's on the right track\nDo you think we are the Martians that a long time ago either\nOrganisms flu hear from you know chopped up media writes a slowing off the planet or or maybe they had a full blown civilization long time ago and the skiing I think\nI think the former is is this a good chance is true\nOr not civilizations but a microbes on on meteors a because Mars um well a couple things first of all life appeared on earth almost immediately after it could\nWhich either means one of two things that life can evolve very quickly from chemistry\nOr that life was floating around in space and as soon as the earth was cool enough\nFor life to to prosper here the ... it landed in the seats to cold as it were\nUm and now if you think about that then you say here's Mars nearby it's being hit find meteors knocking chunks offsetting I'm flying and hitting the earth we're hit by Mars meteorites all the time [noise] um\nFlying and hitting the earth we're hit by Mars meteorites all the time [noise] um\nIf life could evolve quickly out of chemistry it live on Mars Mars coup before earth to Mars had liquid water before or did so life is is is a quick study evolving rapidly from chemistry would've occurred on Mars first and then it would have landed here\nSo there is a good chance that it came from Mars the the the the a and also that is supported by the fact that we find no organisms on earth no free living organisms simpler than bacteria and bacteria are really pretty complicated they have this\nShort of DNA in are in a whole alphabet for transmitting genetic information [noise] um you know or imagined you you've found a um an ancient manuscript that I had a complete alphabet along with all the punctuation marks and everything and\nUh it could not possibly be the first written document that they would have to be more primitive things before you know the complete alphabet and punctuation and comments and paragraphs and all this had been worked out\nSo uh but bacteria have all that so that suggests that they came here already fully developed\nCould've come from Mars or maybe both earth and Mars\nIn interstellar space\nI just love Smith how did you get interested in all this Robert\nSputnik that did it for yeah\nYeah well I was already somewhat interested I I was an early reader I was five when Sputnik flu\nAnd while to the adult world split it may have been a terrifying event to me was just great ah because what it was proving was that the um the space faring uh stories that I was reading we're going to be true\nAnd I can remember reading about uh like it a space dog in my weekly reader and later ah I'm ... and ... the next space dogs and you know I'm I have a dog today her name is ... and\nThe the struggle was the first off to come back from space alive and she even had puppies and Khrushchev gave one to Jackie Kennedy and um and her descendants are alive today um anyway so um\nI remember that that was cool I was a little kid that but I also remember how my parents were horrified over Sputnik was a little tiny thing the size of a basketball and you know Americans were just panicking how come well\nBecause if they could throw it into orbit it means they could throw it here a no words splitting it meant they could hit anywhere anymore yeah\n\nMurder at the University of

operation it was overwhelming running the day to day and being yellow it puts on the job I'm going to end it looking at that but what really connected with me what how passionate Oscar was about something a logical this operation\nWe started to get the next town that led to process blows databases child development when he became a geek out that than I knew we had to hire him\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are are vying mentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nUm there's a researcher out there Michael J. our who categorize these environmentally sensitive people um and what he found was people who are environmentally sensitive have ... you know long standing allergies chronic pain for the migraines fibromyalgia and just an overt sensitivity to light found\nMy city and smells more than maybe me and you do so I could walk into a room and be fine other people could walk in the same room and they smell cologne from all over the place they all get ashes [laughter]\nSo he's environmentally sensitive people actually way way way more paranormal experiences than the general population um there's those higher it's a really high number\nAnd what the thought is is these environmentally sensitive people are picking up on whether it's at federal magnetic fields more than the general population in other words they have a battery antenna or biological radio\nAnd the electromagnetic spectrum than other people so we all are we all have radios with basic equipment that tune into things but some people have really really really redefined are sensitive radios\nAre and they're picking up on things in it and detecting things in the environment that normal people don't pick up or the general population doesn't\nSo this ability to truly experience paranormal phenomenon it's it's more likely to be detected a registered among this group\nAnd I think that's a fascinating thing so we have environmental sensitivity which there's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real I think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environmental sensitivity\nSo there's science behind it and then there's also sign saying these people have even way more ghostly encounters why is that in that kind of where we go a little further into that\nTo some of these people brand didn't realize how sensitive they are picking up these things I mean did they know they get it\nI I think they do it in and when I went out there and I my research was done I had I talked to a lot of people who are environmentally sensitive and what you find is\nYou know not only or do they pick up on things or have way more paranormal experiences but it's genetics so their mom did to wear their dad and then their grandma and so forth and so on so this is something kind of like most\nYou know genetic diseases or or what not this kind of passed down from generation and listen they know they're sensitive to the environment um just by walking into places some people you know like I said get rashes\nUm they can be under neon lights some people almost allergic to electricity or so these types of people just experienced a different world and and believe me they know it affects them probably more negatively than it does positively\nYou know you talked about some of the reality television shows Brandon my a criticism of them because they always seem that they have to have some kind of goes Leon donor\nBecause it's television and you know they don't want to do their duty minute one hour program and not have anything happen so looks like they create these things and I think that kinda hurts the credibility of some of these uh ...\nYeah I think yeah I think it it it really does too because\nIt implies that\nEither people or misinterpreting normal things or there's over fraud and um you know every ... those those people who do this on a regular basis and are genuine do you know out of ten locations that you go to you might have one experience\nIt's really impossible to have you know thirty or forty experiences every time you go to a location 'cause then it's your money in the waters and I and then you kind of lean towards that that fried type of\nThing so we we talked about the individual who might have the ability to spot grows to fuel does more than others but what about the ghost did cells are there some does that come back more often than others or because they have an ability to do that\nUm I think it's really\nI guess which one is stronger in ... when you think about it is the person's ability to sense that goes if if I'm really sensitive to it I'm going to pick up goes way encounters a lot more than everyone else so I might pick up on a ghostly encounter a civil war soldier I'm very often if I'm really saying\nI mean a good a good radio or real good radio problems from Ukraine has the ability to pick up a weak signals from a radio station ... isn't that much that way with the person that if that person is a receiver\nHe or she may be more apt to pick up these ... things\nSteve or he or she may be more apt to pick up these ... things\nExactly yeah exactly so you know ... and ... and that that kind of boils down to the environmental person\nUm they're going to have way way way more votes encounters and um so I think it has to do to your prior question I think it has to do mainly with the person not so much that goes and counter the environment\nBut you have to ask you know hey I'm an environmentally sensitive person I pick up on all this stuff\nYou know I go from place to place to place throughout my day however\nOne location I'm picking up a lot of\nUm having a lot of ghostly phenomenon happened to me um the places pretty active whereas in other places so then you start asking yourself why why that place and why not the other places\nUm so then you have to go into why is the location have or um paranormal phenomenon ... out of other locations you know like those antennas we had the rabbit or one\nYou know why is this configuration picking up channel thirty three and this configuration as you know what I'm saying you have to figure out the right combination of things that happened for\nUm the TV to show up in a clear picture and the same with goes the encounters you have to figure out the right sort of ingredients\nAre variable line up the habit goes counter location is one person has to 'em and then there's there's probably other ones that I you know we haven't really identified at this point but the person not only their sensitivity but their internal ... electric\nA consciousness of all this stuff really plays into it it's really fascinating to me it\nReally is I remember when my dad brought home and he better TV down to you know there was the kind that didn't just move with the rabbit ears but it had like a little knob on it then you click\nIn brought into signals better that way too and I thought for use this technology amazing how times have changed Brandon\n[laughter] I remember those [laughter]\nDo you have or have you come across demonic spirits in your work\nUh no I haven't and I get that question a lot though the the team of question seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so\nI think you know when you have a ghostly counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's great uh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience was it good weather bad with a positive with this with that and I think when you start putting negative to it then you start\nFeeling like it's demonic ... demonic\nTeam is more of a religious perspective than it is sort of um you know like a\nScientific perspective so usually whoever classified this is a demon or um you know a regular goes\nI think there's more of a religious health to it um that's where I usually when I meet them at all it's just they're they're very religious as well um so I think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience\nUm and some people perceive it as good or bad I might receive one experience being really positive you might have the same experience would be terrified and the way the negative and then kind of you go toward more demonic part of thing\nSo I I really just enjoyed not joy but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the theme and label on anything\nWell with Brenda ... his book is called the ghost studies ... dot

talk a couple of them some of your favorites yeah\nSure sure ah so I have several real life accounts that I go over I'm the first one is actually because Halloween is approaching I'll I'll I'll go with this one\nPerson um trigger late [laughter]\nMy wife had passed away unexpectedly over the summer while it's been difficult I managed to care for the house of myself\nAs Halloween approached I was putting up decorations as the kids in a neighborhood usually love trick or treating my wife and I had bought a plastic pumpkin together when we first got married Twenty years ago we had places plastic ... plastic pumpkin and our window every Halloween\nI searched out for days looking for that punk until I finally gave up a few days after giving up I was walking down the staircase and I was shocked to see my wife standing at the bottom\nShe smiled and whispered check behind the workbench and then vanished I began to weep uncontrollably rushed out to the garage a huge smile came across my face as the plastic punk and was laying behind the workbench it must have fallen off the top shelf so\nThis is a a great example of a you mentioned it before and intelligent haunting goes interacting with us\nSo in this case you know the ghost during his ghostly encounter the ghost had a conscious and she was actually giving information that the husband wanted so they're aware of their surroundings they they're giving information they're not sort of confined to an area they're interacting with the witness\nUm they're not like routine specific like they don't just show up every day on this or on the twenty fifth of mayor on Christmas Eve or anything like that\nSo this direct interaction um is sort of the ... the cream of the crop when it comes to ghostly encounters\nA and these are the most rare ones that I've been talking with people these are the most rare when you have like um the ... in intelligence the interaction the giving information which is verified um this is sort of what we all seek in a way of those who investigate the paranormal\nIs Europe pecking order on the other side brand in in in your opinion on what's the word ... I mean who sends it goes back to do what it does it does it do it on its own war ... organization that's involved in doing that on the other side\nI'm a strong believer in in consciousness so you know who who we are as people are are personality our memories are um everything that we are um are after we die you know what happens to that right\nOr some people will say that we're just computers and when we die who everything of who we are memories are ... ... it just needs to exist\nUm and that's kind of mainstream science says view but when you look at things in\nYour consciousness survive death and it goes in and it continues to exist it's it could maybe it really be in the environment to some degree and I think when needed\nMaybe like when an example with the husband when needed he can sort of resonate or or link up with the consciousness of his past wife\nSo I don't think it's a pecking order as much as you know someone just really needs something and then they sort of resonates with the consciousness of of a path loved one and then these experience maybe happen\nSo yeah you know I I really believe that there's obviously things in the environment that we don't know about and the consciousness I'm electromagnetic fields all this stuff that really happens in the environment\nIs is really important or Michael pursing or who recently passed away but it was a neuropsychologist basically said and he did all of the numbers behind this but that\nThe environment holds enough energy for every every person that ever ever lived their consciousness to exist in it\nUm which means we have access to memories from Abraham Lincoln to Billy the kid it's it's all out there and the environment has enough energy to store all that and then maybe some people can just connect with that or resonate with that and that's when he was great experiences happen\n[noise] what do you say the skeptics Brandon who say these people who have these encounters or mentally unstable or something even worse\nYeah unfortunately I think you know when somebody tells you a ghostly encounter um a lot of people will just kind of say oh you're crazy and they kind of say\nJokingly but it really makes the other person feel like they're you know they might be crazy\nI'm so ... you know what I usually tell people who who skeptics or things like that I usually just basically kind of go over listen you know in in my experience it's all I Do all day is diagnosed um mental health and and um you\nKnow you see at all\nYeah I mean my job I I worked in the ER for seven years so I just did behavioral health assessment on med floors in the ER and I've I've done probably five thousand assessments him over the course of ten years\nUm so I Know how to parcel out you know significant mental health issues and all these real life encounters that I've come across um Ninety nine point nine percent of them are from people who were genuine and had a subjective paranormal experience\nThat's huge yeah you know and and I think that it's easy to say oh you're crazy or your this or that or your unstable or he'll loosen aiding or you're drinking too much or withdrawing or whatever the situation is but lives in uh in my professional opinion a lot of these ghosts encounters are the\nThe they're genuine and the people's eyes it's not the result of mental illness\nWell I've always found that skepticism as healthy as long as a true skeptic has an open mind\nMhm exactly exactly you know it's\nIt's really easy to beef you know a steadfast believer or a steadfast skeptic right because you can just engulf yourself and whatever your reading journals magazines books\nAnd it's really easy to sort of said everything is everything is not a goes there everything is it goes\nIt's being in between an open minded that's the most rewarding and challenging because you have to take both sides you have to read the skeptical stuff and you also have to read that believe the believers stuff and you have to have common sense in a way and sort of parcel out what's you know what's\nFraud are fake or just people being overzealous and then come up with your own conclusions and that's where you're right the open mindedness part of the central when it comes to being involved in the paranoia\n...\nI'm pretty much a majority of my life what changed you know I I\nPeople would tell me and I was really interested in Paris psychology like I said before but I never had to experience so I always kind of thought well these people who are having experiences maybe they're just misinterpreting things and just getting it wrong so when people were telling me experience\nMaybe they're just misinterpreting things and just getting it wrong so when people would tell me experiences I Would kind of sit there and as they are talking I wouldn't even listen to him I Would just sort of go over how to debunk yet or what could be happening\nAnd then I just sit back and you know I'm going to start listening and I started listening and I'm like oh okay and then I started picking up books like um Carl Young's collective unconscious do drugs stuff um oh Harold ... life feels\nGerman read Raymond Moody's work\nYes exactly a near death experiences all this stuff and you start reading it and you go wait a minute there's actually this might be happening and then you go deeper down that rabbit hole and you're reading research articles about untangle matter and then you kinda go wait a minute this is actually somewhat possible and then\nYou know as far as ... the and things like that I mean the research on that is growing every year um I I Know every year I'm reading more and more journal articles which statistically give credence to the idea that come up at the end ESPN the sigh phenomenon is legit\nAnd then you're like whoa wait a minute if this is saying this and he's ghostly encounters could be possible as well\nAnd that's kind of what led me into it from a skeptical to more of a believer part a thing\nIt was another one of your favorite storage\nRight I got a lot of them so ah we'll go with will go with one that's been pretty popular here recently has to do with dementia is um and just finished eating dinner and wasn't the kitchen cleaning things up\nAs that was placing items in the dishwasher I happened to look in the dining room I was shocked to see a huge black void about four feet high and four feet wide hovering above the ground I immediately thought something was terribly wrong with my eyes I looked away rub my eyes and then look back in the void was still there\nAs I walked closer I could see a mother and child inside the void the mother and child were sitting in the grass talking and smiling law enjoying the bright sunny

learning you're looking for and\nYou know it it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that there's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environments are resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling goes come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it\nWe've got teeth in Rochester New York Yankees\nYes I'd like to ask about possible early imprint teams\nOn the brain that might explain to an extent why people see go like others I've seen film of the baby ... chicks being fed by humans with hand puppets made to look like the mother so wouldn't return to the wild the tricks noted key in\nOn a mother conned or are you mentioned the window we're who was searching for the pumpkin and his wife appeared and then those gone I've never had any experience like that but the closest I've had over in the many years I'm now sixty three\nI Will rub my eyes in various ways all different kinds of figures\nWill appear before me a figures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have a occurred within me a different figures in all different kinds of actions some of them quite grotesque\nAnd I'm sure that those are not goes by definition but just kind of bringing us together and closing a one about imprint teens that lake with a window we're uh seen his wife saying look uh uh in the back of the garage I Can't imprint teens\nCan people be so emotionally attached to me like a husband who was white that he would see his wife worse than the rest of us would not and maybe I in my life with the things that the rest of you would not\nMhm yeah\nYeah it's it I don't think that's a tough one to answer I I think that\n... you know I I it's a little bit with a widower they were talking about it a little bit like he is resonating with something in the environment that's why he's seeing his wife he's not seeing Abraham Lincoln or whoever else so it specific to him there's a there's sort of a connection to him you know as as we're driving down the street in our in our cars\nOthers radio signals all around us but if I turn my radio stations in Ninety two point five I only pick up Ninety two point five\nBecause we're matching frequencies so with a husband and wife with with daughter and a mother they match frequencies and that's one of these sort of experience has happened as far as an imprint goes I'm if I'm understanding that the way you're you're describing it\n... there is I mean Carl young had this idea of collective unconscious\nSo were all born with these archetypes and the sort of a blueprint\nSo were all born with these archetypes and the sort of a blueprint for how to really manage life\nUm so we're sort of imprinted um with with with these archetypes and with sort of ancestral beliefs that are common throughout every culture that's happening\nSo this could be me here at Ohio or you know um people in other countries we all have similar sort of\nVision and stories and things like that so I think we're all imprinted I'm In a grand gesture but it could be more specific for cultures it could be more specific for families could be imprinted I'm with certain information so you pass that down to your family\nUm so it could be more micro that back row when it comes to this collective archetypes there out there so I think there is something to the imprint I I couldn't answer your question definitely but that's sort of my best guess that it\nIt does religion kind of change our views about ah these operations in grossly encounters\n[noise] yeah I I think it's it it changes are using it basically changes our perception of experience so you know you can have someone who is a devout religious person have the same experience as someone who is not the religious person might a perceived that\nAs more of um like we talked about earlier a demon or an angel or I'm a of a aside from from God or aside from a deceased person that they love\nUm whereas a person who doesn't have that religious tell to it my experience that as simply you know an experience or or um a mundane thing or a vigorous stimuli so everyone's\nEveryone's past sort of influences how we perceive any sort of ... paranormal phenomenon\nUm and that's what we talked about before you know the believers are automatically going to go to whatever they believe in and if they believe in earth bounce spirits everything is in our spirit\nA so I think perception religion or they play a huge part how we perceive a ghostly encounters a paranormal phenomena\nHave you ever witnessed an extra ... no I never witnessed that would you like to [noise] um [noise] as long as it's not yours [laughter]\n[laughter] you know it somewhat although I did interview while back and and I can't remember what I said but I've kind of like yeah I'd love to have an experience like that\nAnd then someone emails me as as careful what you wish for those types of eh yeah exactly\n[laughter] [noise] so I don't wish to be part of an exercise but scientifically are with my fascination I loved to sort of be part and sort of gain some information from that or knowledge\nI Am very curious about executions jumps and you know how they can get this demon this appearance demon out of the person's system and you know be gone and ... it's really weird and remarkable at the same time\n[noise] yeah yeah it is but my brain always goes to their to there's so much misinformation and mismanagement of\nThings like that and possibly fraud that I I'd have to be there to experience it for me to go okay yeah I Believe that\nLet's go to Shelley in North Dakota Hi Sally go ahead\nWell hi either you know I mean I'm\n...

visitations are\nCurrently she's she's not there anymore\nOkay we'll get your reaction to that brand and what do you think's going on\n[noise] well that that's actually becoming more and more common um and I've heard more and more stories about this in the last ten years but this this idea that\nYou know this is somehow um goes or utilizing electric electrical equipment to communicate so that's like phones hacked emails these types of things\nUm you know typically people will report they'll get hang ups from um a family members number who's been deceased for whether\nIt's five days or five years um then they'll get text messages from them you know after their death or you know these types of things and there's a there's a book out there that I'm a pair psychologist Dr column Cooper road called telephone calls from the dead\nWhich he encompasses a great ...\nLess a bunch of these um phenomenon that are happening and then there's phantom menace messages which has recently came out as well which goes over this as well it's hard to really know that to me I mean listen to the idea that um\nGhosts or consciousness or wherever you want to call it is utilizing electrical electrical equipment has been going on for a while so you know to to know the exact or how that's happening I'm not sure but anytime we talked about this and there were times anytime there's some sort of trauma or crisis or life threatening events\nLike she was talking about um it increases the probability of these types of things happening I'm so we we the only thing we can do is try to see these consistency there's similarities and then try to find the answers as best we can from the Bakken\nHow do you change skeptics mind Brandon ...\nAh [noise] I think you could um put some some doubt and education in there about what could possibly be happening or it's it's a challenging it's challenging because you know at this point goats are measurable phenomenon\nAnd the paranormal it's difficult to study in a sort of a logical scientific way and this is mainly because paranormal experiences are you know there are radical their episodic\nThey're poorly documented um their random and they're not repeatable it will which is essentially everything that the scientific method hate 'em for these things are are tough and and that's kind of what most people go into its fraud or mental illness or imagination um\nYou know we didn't matter is that a cop out though to be able to just to say that\nI I think it's an ... yeah a cop out would be an easy answer to it so that the idea is if it's ... if I'm presented with something that I don't know the answer to um rather than spend hours and hours of researching it I can just say the person's misunderstanding or it's fried or over active imagination\nAnd then I could go on living my life in my normal views and it doesn't blow my mind in any kind of way\nSo it's an easy way to sort of give an answer to something that you know it's it's pretty mind blowing phenomenon um but you know there's all this this stuff out there that that some people point to as evidence like pictures a BP's\nUm but there's really no follow up after that\nUm and then those things nowadays are easily fake\nI I think really if and this is kind of what I tell people out in a paranormal investigator is is you got to it's about collecting data about sample sizes it's about being consistent and what you do and that was over how you that's how you progress or advance of field\nYou know similar questionnaires at all these people are using when they do investigations similar methods\nUm you know if sample sizes huge in academia and with skeptics as well is that you know if if you have a sample size of three hundred people that's pretty impressive if you give questionnaires if every paranormal team gave a questionnaire to somebody and they did a hundred investigation of the year and there's\nYou know I don't know\nThree hundred paranormal teams out there your sample sizes getting pretty big and then academia takes notice because you have um a hundred thousand questionnaires that are just waiting to be analyzed and then you start getting some variable or um some similarities inconsistencies and then you have a measurable phenomenon [noise] so\nOr um some similarities inconsistencies and then you have a measurable phenomenon\nSo you know it's it's hard to argue I'm with someone who has a close mine but if you could just push him towards a piece of research or a book or something like that and maybe they pick it up then that helps\nYou know and that goes for the opposite end to what people are just adamant believers there's there's things you can push a more towards the middle with which is to me is the best place to be\nLet's go to

think that one of these outfits is going to get us to Mars right now [noise]\nYou know NASA is does great work with its robotic planetary missions Senate space astronomy missions ... that work in that field is ethic but ah the human spaceflight program is dysfunctional uh they claim they want to go to the moon but they're not even planning a reasonable plan to do that\nAnd um so I think it's it's gonna be one of the new kids on the block that gets us there\nAre you happy the privatization is taking off the way it is and that NASA is kinda like fading away\nI'm happy that privatization is taking off I Am not happy that NASA is a human spaceflight program as dysfunctional ah I'm not happy about that at all um the uh you know I ... it would be a disaster is NASA's robotic\nSpace flight program and space astronomy programs became is dysfunctional as the human space flight program but\nI mean it's really sad to see this program that I mean that storm have it in the Nineteen sixties doing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I was at a conference in Florida a month ago where a high level NASA official that actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said\nWe're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThe moon [laughter]\nWhat what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you got ... maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember that to die off so they can help people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who dealt that we went to the moon jump or joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the movies um and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station in orbit around the ... which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is gonna be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission I mean ... let me tell you what this they call this the deep space gateway\nYeah okay and\nI mean ... let me tell you what this they call this the deep space gateway yeah OK\nAnd let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay\n[laughter] the the the\nHere's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal I Want to read you an office in Saskatoon now you're gonna have to pay to build the building and you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year\nAnd if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a bill by pass on that they\nHad to deal and this thing\nThat I buy the ... and you'd probably sell me what you buy the swarm play and you'd probably want to sell me\nA lot better off with the swamp land then with this\n... ... ... you know with measles doing what he's doing falcon next base acts are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching NASA just kind of not do much anymore with manned space flights and it's it's just a poignant Robert really is\nWell it is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and ... built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon ah and\nAnd now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible\nUm I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we had a a major deterioration in the quality the political class in terms of its ability to execute great projects on it and act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan\nA chaos and the the the you know so there it is but uh I gotta tell ya you know\nI was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while would come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what what the incompetence who preceded\nUs uh you know want it to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the mood I was hoping bright it's fine would do that but he didn't he just went along and I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance through a witness the flight of one of the falcons a at night to another\nTeam back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the guys that night uh the they didn't know what it was he thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was big tech you alert to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time uh because sure we started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get him to be usable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that Musk has done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and and he's reduced the cost of space launched by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram perform us now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram traumatic\nIt's dramatic it's protect killer and it was done on a shoestring compared to um what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems\nI mean it was done like from one tenth the money in one third of the time that any one of ... was accepting would be normal and this thing um the result has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space\nAnd a number of other advanced fields that people thought were hopeless uh so okay Bezos has his own money he's got blue origin but we now have three small launch companies\nA firefly a vector space um electron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars a two to field a small launch systems\nAnd it even goes beyond the the us space industry we now have you shouldn't power startups getting funded because people you know they were looking at future parents all this is just never going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years\nAnd but people than say maybe it's not\nReally an impossible technical problem maybe the ... and um\nI gotta tell ya I actually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and I I can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around the table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be at a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably a start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what he's going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours ... coast to coast the\nBoys on your own and you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized rule users just point your iPhone or Android ... to ... dot com and enjoy [noise]\nA N pie is ah driven to want to do something great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money he likes cool things you can buy with money but that's not what he's about uh\nNow he he he really wants to do he wants to go down in the history books for\nDoing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that he doesn't just want to do great deeds he wants the terminal gory for doing great deep so he's not Mother Teresa he can be selfish he he\nUm and he certainly um\nI'm not above using people are and you know if you look at some of the things about him that um didn't come off so well like Kim getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand\nUm that that's the other side of it so you're a ... you know there is [noise] um ... you know a self\nAssigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it's it's selfish for eternal glory for doing great teaches you go about\nIt it's not exactly go it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology like the well he had\nThis is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great dates or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth you know uh\nUh when he gets that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core to to fight the friends because he he even though I mean the odds are more against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone\nSo you know that's must to a tea and um\nAnd and and so but really um [noise] you know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I I think must give us a hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that is a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant who goes out uh looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... that's what he's about but you know um\nHow would you ... just results Robert\nWell Jeff measles as much calmer I'm much more laid back yeah um\nI don't know these cells I met him once uh\nUh but that was certainly my impression uh and if you look at how the two companies are run a they reflect at a mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast a he wants everything done yesterday and\nUm the company takes chances\nAnd thus far um they're winning um bought is certainly a\nThere they pushed very hard bees owes the model if this company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush the cells strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why ... limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise]\nUm well in one sense it's obviously is a but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space sex is racing ahead of him so this is the you know SpaceX has the hair um blue origin the tortoise and ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know measles is at least ten times as rich as mosque\nOkay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also want a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA for the military\n... was doing it all with his own money okay these shows you know is the richest man in the world ah and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon stock each year sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has unlimited time\nI'm mosque knows that I'm you know in aerospace a cost just people times time\nUh the quicker you just do something the cheaper it costs people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no it costs much less\nUh because uh you know a space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still and whether it's moving\nYeah that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in that's ... what the what's going on with some of these latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOh yeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European bought all these experiments or ex discoveries by the way are being made now with a\nUm something it's not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar and his radar that can look through the ground and see what's on the ground\nAnd um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water\nAh and um but it it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment um it's been suspected by a lie\nOf microbial life a habitable environment um it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars it has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this liquid just exist in one place\nI think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth\nSome of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth are still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the ground water is is as it was billions of years ago and they've been down there and if\nThere was ever life on the surface of Mars it would have retreated into that ground water and it'd be they're still now then\nBeyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American Mars Reconnaissance orbiter has found glaciers on Mars at mid latitudes that is a a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA a million cubic kilometers\nOf pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust knows it's right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it's as far south is thirty eight or a north in the northern hemisphere Mars which by the way the same latitude a San Francisco\nSo imagine that there were glaciers in San Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC you know that's the latitude that these things are and what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not\nJust you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get at it with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people it's just strange some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think there's two they there there's two different versions of it\nOne is the scientist saying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay contamination\nYeah well that's like saying if you go to France you won't know if the people there are French or not I mean that that that because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean look if if if how do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did\nWell for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower there's all this stuff that they built in the past well if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and there will be fossils of it\nAnd I mean to to to say that fossils of life on Mars don't prove that the life you find there was there before is like the people who say that\nDinosaur bones don't prove that there were dinosaurs because God could have put the dinosaur bones in the ground and and and the world could have been made in seven days and there never was a geologic past it's all been a a trick by\nTricky gods and and um I mean it's just absurd um so\n\nIt's been three weeks as a journalist was

you know I ... it would be disastrous NASA's robotic\nSpace flight program and space astronomy programs became is dysfunctional as the human spaceflight program but\nI mean it's really sad to see this program they I mean that storm to have it in the Nineteen sixties doing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I was at a conference in Florida a month ago where a high level NASA official that actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said\nWe're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThem [laughter] what what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you got ... maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember that to die off so they can help people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who'd dumped that we went to the moon jump were joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station in orbit around the ... which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is gonna be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission\nI mean ... let me tell you what this they called us the deep space gateway yeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay [laughter]\nThe the the\nHere's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal I Want to read you an office in Saskatoon\nNow you're gonna have to pay to build the building and you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a Bill Nye pass on that had to deal and this thing\nIs that I buy the swamp line you'd probably sell me what you buy the swarm play and you probably want to sell me\nA lot better off with the swamp plant then with this ... ... ...\nMe a lot better off with the swamp land than with this\n... ... ... you know with measles doing what he's doing falcon next base acts are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching NASA just kind of not do much anymore with manned space flights and it's it's just a poignant Robert it really is\nWell it is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and knocked up built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon\nUh and and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible\nUh I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we had a major deterioration in the quality the political class in terms of its ability to execute great projects and and act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan\nA chaos and the the the you know so there\nIt is but uh I got to tell you you know I was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while would come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what what the incompetence who preceded\nUs uh you know want it to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the moon I was hoping brightest thing we do that but he didn't he just went along and I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance to witness the flight of one of the falcons a at night to another team back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the guys that night\nUh they didn't know what it was he thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was big tech you learn to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time uh because sure we started the space age with expendable rockets and you figure that fifty years later we finally get them to be usable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that mosque is done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and and he's reduced the cost of space launched by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram before must now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram traumatic\nIt's dramatic it's protect killer and it was done on a shoestring compared to\nUm what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems\nI mean it was done like for one tenth the money in one third of the time that any one of ... was accepting would be normal and this thing um the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space\nAnd a number of other advanced fields that people for were hopeless uh so okay Bezos has his own money's got large in but we now have three small launch companies\nA firefly a vector space um electron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars a two to field a small launch systems\nAnd it even goes beyond the the us space industry we now have you shouldn't power startups getting funded\nBecause people you know they were looking at future parents oh this is just\nNever going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years and but people and say maybe it's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the ...\nAnd um I gotta tell ya I actually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and I can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around a table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be at a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably a start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what he's going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours next on coast to coast they\nAlways on your bones and you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized grew mobile users just once your iPhone or Android ... to ... dot com and enjoy [noise]\nAh driven to want to do something great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money he likes cool things you can buy with money but that's not what he's about uh\nNow he he he really wants to do he wants to go down in the history books for doing something great for for human kind\nAnd and so that's the other side of it okay is that he doesn't just want to do great deeds he wants eternal gory for doing great deep so he's not Mother Teresa he can be selfish he he um and he certainly um\nI'm not above using people are\nAnd you know if you look at some of the things about him that um didn't come off so well like Kim getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand um that that's the other side of it so\nYou're a ... that you know there is [noise] um ... you know a self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's\nIt's it's it's it's selfish for eternal glory for doing great teaches you go about\nIt it's not exactly go it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology like the only had\nThis is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth\nYou know uh uh when he gets that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core to to fight the friends because he he even though I mean the odds of war against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone\nSo you know that's mosque to a tea and um\nAnd and and so but really um\n[noise] you know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I I think must gives a hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that is a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant who goes out uh looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... that's what he's about\nBut you know um\nHow would you ... just diesels Robert Well Jeff we use those as much calmer a much more laid back um\nI don't know these cells I met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh\nAnd if you look at how the two companies are run a they reflect at a mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast or he wants everything done yesterday and um\nThe company takes chances and thus far um they're winning um bought is certainly a there they pushed very hard bees owes the model of his company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush\nMeasles strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why ... limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise] um well in one sense it's obviously is a but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space sex is racing ahead of him so this is the you know ... the hair\nUm blue origins the tortoise\nAnd ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know measles is at least ten times as rich as mosque okay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also won a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA effort the military\n... just doing it all with his own money okay these shows you know is the richest man in the world ah and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon stock each year sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has unlimited time I'm mosque knows that I'm\nKnow in aerospace a cost just people times time uh the quicker you just do something the cheaper costs people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no it would cost much less\nUh because uh you know a space\nProgram is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still and whether it's moving\nYeah that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in that ... what's the what's going on with some of these latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nYeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European bought all these experiments or ex discoveries by the way are being made now with a\nUm something it's not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar and its radar that can look through the ground and see what's underground\nAnd um the ground penetrating radar\nOn the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water\nAh and um but it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment um it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place I think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth\nSome of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth are still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the groundwater\nIs is as it was billions of years ago and they've been down there and if there was ever life on the surface of Mars it would have retreated into that ground water and it'd be they're still\nNow then beyond that the ground\nThey're still now then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American Mars Reconnaissance orbiter\nHas found glaciers on Mars at mid latitudes that is a a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA a million cubic kilometers\nOf pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust knows it's right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it's as far south is thirty eight or a north in the northern hemisphere Mars which by the way the same latitude to San Francisco\nSo imagine that there were glaciers in San Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC you know that's the latitude that these things are and what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not\nJust you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get out with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people this is strange some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think so there isn't as\nTo the there there's two different versions of it one is the scientist saying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay\nContamination yeah well that's\nLike saying if you go to France you won't know if the people there are French or not I mean that that that because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean look if if it\nHow do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did well for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower this all this stuff that they built in the past well if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and there will be fossils of it\nAnd I mean to to to say that fossils of life on Mars don't prove that the life you find there was there before is like the people who say that dinosaur bones don't prove that there were dinosaurs because God could have put the dinosaur bones in the ground and\nAnd and the world could have been made in seven days and there never was a geologic past it it's all been a a trick by\nTricky gods and and um I mean it's just absurd um so\nIf you believe that uh you know the the fossil record on earth proves the existence of life on earth in the past in the air for that but life on earth in the present actually did evolve you're then you have to believe that if we find life on Mars\n\nOrder

yes also known as the presidential election lumber say yeah two years I Will\nBe we're going to go for a full two years this time\nAnd I think oh I think is going to be the last time re I have a funny feeling\nThat this election cycle for the presidency twenty ... twin ... is going to start\nTo years prior to the election I wouldn't be at all surprised and I think it would be the last time because I think Congress will actually passed a law that says\nThis is gone from the ridiculous to the sublime and they will make a law that says Ninety Days will be the length of the election process oh if only\nRun all the primary over the course of three weeks you have your convention and then you have two months\nOf course in three weeks you have your convention and then you have two months\nAnd then you have your election then that's it that's certainly in it surely would be intelligent\nBy the way former speaking of intelligence\nFormer speaker of the house Newt Gingrich I Can't believe you did that I think he's very intelligent personally and he was very gracious that's when you met who was medicine in line at the ... concert of all places you and I went to see ... is a bally's\nAnd we stood in line next to Newt Gingrich\nAnd his girlfriend at the time because he had just gotten\nWas it as girls they were maybe just me I don't remember I remember a I ordinarily walk into the RIAA\nAnd they were very cordial and everything well he appeared yesterday on Fox to explain why the president says that he will cut off aid to certain countries because of the caravans\nFollowed what kind of it's pretty clear pause seems for Iran as those numbers there are at least nine or ten thousand potential people if you count the ones on the Guatemalan border owner come North Sea the easy question they ask us let's say we open the border we welcome all of them\nSent pictures out across the whole planet helping you think the next Conway is a cat and then the caravan after that and the care of and after that\nAnd you have to question him either going to control the border so you're not going to control the water and as an American\nBut we're we're the most generous legal immigration system in the world we owe a million people year legally coming American how about getting Americans to be an America most of them go on to become American citizens so there's just a dishonest ally\nFor suggest that we don't have an of serious immigration program that is legal\nProblem we have is a lot of folks who want to break the law\nAnd if you ever had open borders as you pointed out the Gallup poll I think the number for all of Latin America and the Caribbean was a hundred and Seventy nine million people would like to come to the U.S\nAssistance to unsustainable\nSo the question becomes what are you going to do about it\nAnd the president who's inherited hey disasters immigration social between court orders congressional laws federal regulation is a total disaster\nHe's trying to get his rights I think it's important to stop this caravan him parks to send a signal to the rest of Latin America no you're not going to be allowed to come in and in part because in the process of stopping if we're going to learn a lot about the laws that need to be changed\nAnd frankly Congress maybe in the lame duck session how do we challenge ... not not not comprehensive reform let's say ten dumbest things let's just fix one step at a time and begin to make it possible to manage our board and a half\nI he forgot he was a politician there yeah\nUm I say this that there are at the risk of sounding like a broken record I still not sure why we can't just enforce the laws we have more\nBut the ultimate question you just hit it right on the head second of all out of all these people and that the caravan half of that caravan will dissipate\nWhen they get to Mexico City do you think so and so there and go to work there there's plenty of work in Mexico city but once again and this is not the fault of Donald Trump this the fault of the last five presidents\nAnd you know so question this ... and we were finished worm going OK okay the last five presidents have caused this and I'll tell you how they caused they refused\nTo help the Mexican government\nIf in fact we gave half the aid that we've given to Israel or Germany\nOr or Japan or anything else if we would've given half of that amount of money\nTo the government of Mexico to help them sustain themselves and build their own factories and build their own auto industry and their own oil industry and all these\nThings that people never would have wanted to leave Mexico because the living would be good there instead of ... questions\nOf pay will do that after this crime\nIf you want to end sonata it did nothing for in some out of it did nothing from Mexico City it did nothing for walks or or ... or can you even Kan coon\nIt only did things for the border towns or the Americans well the idea wasn't for Honda to move from Fort Worth the war is\nThe idea was for there to be a new industry in Mexico city\nWorld's largest city in ...\nIn Mexico city the world's largest city when when the eight million people twice the population of Los Angeles\nSo do you really believe that a a a certain percentage of this caravan that is coming here guaranteed will stay in Mexico and Brian new way to make life there is is that why and with the last caravan that came\nI did not read ... or any numbers specifically saying that ... you know percentage of them stayed on in Mexico and decided found jobs decided to make the dinner\nThat they didn't because once again the new word around the world and what you read in the paper if you live in Guatemala maintenance aries Honduras San Juan Puerto Rico is that America is taking names for asylum\nOkay political asylum these are not what used to be\nSingle working age guys trying to sneak across the border so they could come to the U.S and work I mean you and I worked with a lot of Hispanics sure ... south ... just part of I live in a three states that I've lived a majority of my life in our California Nevada and Arizona\nThe three largest Hispanic population who made the right right well single men would come across the border and they would work here now the problem with that was really not the fact there were a drain on our society because they came to work\nThey didn't come to go on welfare they didn't come to have kids because they were single males\nAnd what they were doing though was they were hurting the American economy by\nTaking a job earning five hundred dollars a week let's say\nPutting four hundred of it in a novel and sending it the mom or see that in Mexico city\nThey were taking five hundred American dollars living on a hundred dollars here and sending the rest of the money back home\nThat drains our economy mhm okay where if we had given them and I'm not saying given them and that term but I'm saying like we do all the other countries if we had given money\nTo the government in central Mexico and southern Mexico they would have built factories in stores and they would have done mass production for the country itself\nOkay and it would have been to come self sustaining\nAnd all of a sudden if the unemployment rate in Mexico and the ability to make a living there and feed your family and take care of them\nWas not even equivalent to the United states but let's say they had an eight percent unemployment rate or something to that effect\nWill there wouldn't be the desire for these young men to sneak across the border\nTo get an American job and send the money back to Mexico sure I there are very loyal to their family well yet nobody wants to be away from their family for an extended and
