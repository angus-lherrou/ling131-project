everybody's round the trial is ruined\nA one way or the other or tarnished at the very least right listen I Want to switch gears on you because we we've got such little time I want I Want you to hear something I'm always so you wrote held his guilt or another um absolute best seller number one bestseller\nUm I've always thought Manson was the most evil thing I've ever seen or heard a I think it was sixty minutes did an interview that just sent a chill down my spine trash and I go to science last night and I'd like you to respond to a direct I just heard you say\nYou leave Charles Manson to be an evil person based on TV appearances you might have seen try to consider that all televised interviews with Manson are carefully edited to make 'em up here to be crazy evil et cetera I've spoken demands in one on one for hours and hours sound him to be friendly interesting and even respectful\n... has a vested interest in supporting the idea that man's in\nIs a man to be feared he has a book does el elders filter through this man's ... is a human being like any other and the false idea of him as a crazy evil monster is nothing more than ... missed\nThis myth was largely created by ... and his perpetrated by the media yourself included you in ...\nSo he and his perpetrated by the media yourself included you\nAnd ... you have too much to lose by allowing the actual truth regarding Manson to be known if the truth about him and his actual lack of participation in the in the infamous ... murders became public knowledge but we'll see and countless media vampires would lose the best thing they've ever had a symbol of evil\nAnd you would be left unable to spend an evening evening of glad handing with Vincent ... I expected more out of you blah blah blah you want to respond to that\nWith a ...\nA ... well no no no way to uh it's from James in Seattle\nJames in Seattle yeah well he said that Manson or did not participate in these murders a Hitler wasn't that off with either but but Manson was the architect of a conspiracy to commit these murders he was convicted of nine murders is believed to be responsible for thirty five\nAnd I say thirty five because the Manson Family claims to have oft oh F. T. E. D. or thirty five people uh I've always refer to Manhattan is a very evil sophisticated con man someone who knows man and a lot better than I Do because he lived with my aunts and\nSaid a Charlie uh uh a death death is Charlie's trip death is Charlie strip or you want it to murder as many people as he could have if he'd had an opportunity you would not have stopped uh\nSo what does him saying the interviews now the charges they left the best part of him on the cutting room floor oh no well\nThat there was a little at a team of the um\nOf the interview that he had with Geraldo end with Tom Snyder years ago but but a man for himself has said you know that he'd murder as many people as he could of Haiti nice complicity in these murders obviously 'cause he wants to be set free\nBut he has said more than once if he had an opportunity had murder fifty million people apparently this guy doesn't know what's coming out of man says about Manson can charm people just like OJ Simpson cat\nBut he's an evil sophisticated con man who was a hero who is this here all my answer is\nYou know Hitler Hitler he said that Hitler was a tuned in guy what level the karma the Jews that Hitler had the right answer for everything you know so this is James I don't think he knows up I don't think he knows what he's talking about yes math and did not participate in these murders which made it a little bit more difficult to convict him\nI had to bring it bring him in ... uh by way of circumstantial evidence by showing that only he had the motive for these murders\nThat he controlled these people that they never would have committed these murders without his direction and guidance\nBut he's the one that ordered these murders and\nGives you a different man today well he affect me four letters a ... since Nineteen Seventy two Manson is very intelligent and he speaks in riddles a but there's usually some underlying underlying message the last letter I got about two years ago we just hopelessly garbled I could make heads or tails of at a\nTime when one more here I Would like to ask a sin as written a RINO\nWhy you consistently you Vince and oppose the release of Leslie hold on one of the three girls I'm acquainted acquainted with Leslie old friend of my wife also know her parents while blah blah blah and um apparently a her father now in the seventies tells me he's vowed to live to see his daughter free even if he has to make it to a hundred and twenty\nMhm well if anyone gets out obviously it should be left me for the simple reason that she was not involved in the five tape Margaret she's been convicted of right who murders but not the seven murders that the others and Manson of course this has been convicted of nine\nAh Lesley then out may be rehabilitated but I don't know I you know uh uh I forget the girl's name the lady's name I'm Diane Diane Sawyer or had had a special right on the the girls in Nineteen Ninety\nFive I think or Nineteen Ninety four and they made a good at ... impression as millions around the country saw them and they form the conclusion that these are female defendants or had been rehabilitated that's assume art for the sake of argument\nThat these girls are rehabilitate that this will never do it again or I'm not in any position to make any assessment of that I haven't seen them personally and since Nineteen Seventy one\nWhere people are are are not thinking clearly here is that there are assuming that when you're rehabilitated you're entitled to be set free is if that's the only reason why we incarcerate people write it certainly that's one of the reasons we put people behind bars\nYou know there's punishment\nThat yeah there's two other reasons one wonders punishment off and when we talk about punishment we're talking about justice I mean people think justice is fine but retribution as bad you know that's prehistoric whatever it is but how can you have justice without retribution justice is just that he doesn't miss a euphemistic way of saying retribution and punishment\nThere's another reason why we put people behind bars and probably the main reason if deterrence to set an example that's right we we put people behind bars we punish them to tell the prospect of criminals that if you violate the law you're going to be plenty\nOf documents that were on a time listening when one last question should Shirley Manson ever see the light of day\nApso often present no he was sentenced to death\nAll right my friend I've got to go to the bottom of the hour and when to let you go I got to keep you okay very good thank\nYou have a good interview in the morning or take care of my friends the number one a New York times best seller outrage find reasons why O.

Texas Yes sir of course\nI'll go ahead\nOh at all\nSure we don't screen calls turn your radio off\nOkay I'm Sorry I uh have got the answer in a roundabout way but I don't want to get off into the Gulf War I'd rather talk about this a missile launch from an ultralight airplanes\nTowards the towards the eight eight hundred flight now why are you saying all ...\nWell because I was a pilot Nineteen forty seven and I've been flying off the lights the last few years because I lost my license alkaline as they only air frame that you can fire a shoulder mounted stinger missile from because of the exhaust system\nIf he tried to fire one from a conventional airplane you would fill the cockpit here and every you were at and we're sure complete\nAt this early started this thing that was a pilot a policeman from New York and his wife were flying just about dark\nOver this beach area and they had they had come back and landed and they were being interviewed by CNN I Believe ... and CNN asked the question well did you see any other airplanes\nAnd it caught my era immediately on this pilot said that no we didn't see any point at all except an ultralight\nOut the altar light doesn't have any lights on it right and they all her life is a uh as I said the only platform you could fire a stinger missile from\nPeople generally don't fly ultra lights or at night do they\nNot unless they're a terrorist wanting some vehicle that they can launch an air to air missile when you're up three or four thousand feet or alter light it becomes an air to air missile ... rather than a surface to air missile right\nNow I've called defender that to the FBI but of course you never get any feedback from anybody but then then I heard two ladies there were three interviews with telephone people are on the beach\nTo out of these three people initially now we're all getting hit the feedback that that was a bright light and then that an explosion or the bright light at eight thousand feet which is a lot of confusion there too\nThat really ... they're going to say it was some say it was a thousand and I'm hearing figures up to Thirteen thousand now which is it\nWell I heard that playing last night the radar or the icon went off with a number on it and then they replay the radar thing and there are national blast was that eight thousand then they watched four pieces of wreckage fall for twenty five seconds\nThat they they claim they saw that the plane was was dropped from Thirteen thousand to eight thousand from from the cars they can measure it on radar and the plane was trying to be recovered they\nThey can measure it on the radar and the plane was trying to be recovered they said I don't know except that\nThey don't have any voice recorder unless they do have it they're not telling us and the plane then came apart\nAt eight thousand feet and the other for the four sections still shaped thing on the and ants radar when they replay the tapes show did crashing into the ocean twenty five seconds later on I just heard that last night\nYes are All right well look I thank you I I'm telling you folks\nIt it's impossible ... they have almost made it impossible to intelligent we discuss the facts of this case\nThey have so muddied the waters with regard to the altitude of the airplane with regard to the descriptions of the explosion with regard to a hundred witnesses talking about something headed up toward that airplane\nUm with regard to there is forensic evidence um regarding um a trek chemical race or there isn't there's painting or there isn't there was a major find with a hundred bodies trapped inside where\nThere isn't that it's almost impossible they have so\nFond of this whole case with um a discernible facts that it's almost getting hard to talk about\nBut I again I come back to to military pilots who were on a commercial aircraft and testified it was a missile now that's professional\nHigh quality I Witness testimony and and then you may recall that a a day afterwards we're talking about um is remember that they said no no we have now confirmed it is not a missile and then a day later opposite well maybe it is missile again\nWell damn it which is it\nA another word is I at this point is a missile a possibility probability or not and we get both answers I don't know what to make of that [noise]\nAre you considering a safe to

a single bad okay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um it's\nThe whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that\nBecause you can go deeper with no or external stimulus actions like\nI'm In many ways the same concept behind um the float chambers exempt in this case you are not floating you're you're in this this\nControlled unit and all the sound is

to put yourself by Nora beat technologies been around for a long time that it helps us to go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go on the eastern where would you and I know that anything pattern that you take people see it it's kind of a swimming I write\nWell there is a yes or relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis\nUm there's different progression that are used but it's basically a meditative type of program that's guided often guided where you would just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experiences during even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance\nPeople have passed life regressions mhm they have contact\nWith all kinds of let's just say a non physical being different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up to our inner self people experience different kinds of\nAh let's just say I opening in mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nOr for instance past life for ... a regression type flashes are quite common\nAnd there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself were the answers are where you can\nBegin to explore your true self\nAnd to open up to that awake into that multi dimensional self within you\nSee what questions could you ask yourself and then do you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal and you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal\nWhatever ... whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery because information can be\nTransmitted many different ways\nIt's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways\nSo it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information but uh people have all kinds of profound experiences\nAnd they awakened to\nTheir their true self and they're the answers within them\nMhm yeah so the implication that personal growth in the spiritual awakening that are\nHappening in these can really be transformational and I like it because you find your house and then I mean when you're extending you William have died in the direction that\nI Would have my own personal experience now my friend mine I think there's been a guest on the show before she said that she has in

assistance\nOr that's but that will happen in um in all the classes that can happen I that comes up in my class as well\nOr where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say to people that and there are people that have died but they are lost or for instance someone that may have died um quickly and they're just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI Know that that type of thing does happen quite a bit\nAnd um at at ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guidance it's called guidelines\nI'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in\nThat um and to let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMhm mhm so too\nHigher dimensional space mhm mhm\nSo to assist him in the

I mean these this is just real events that are happening the fascinating\nPeople all over the world I mean we're multi dimensional beans that's what we are and are biological body you know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very\nPeriod of time and then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness and another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body exploration\nIs that it's multi dimensional and that death is an illusion really I'm no no that's been said but once you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who are passed\nAnd you're doing this face to face\nThis is life changing you no longer need a psychic to act as the intermediary you you you're empowered to discover the answers for yourself\nAnd it's really to find out what kind of journey are we all on 'cause this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know what I did it you can I just interviewed Raymond Moody and like I show and you know the ... the grandfather and clean the turn a life after gas and um [noise] he had expressed to me after fifty years doing that is\nThat he doesn't know for sure\nThat that yeah life have to get things yes because scientifically it's never really been proven even though he's heard town and the poor people who live experience\nIs a nice afterlife ... nomination he still doesn't as a scientist as a whole new generation right now I Know for sure this\nIs exactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need\nBooks study research will never give you that kind of verification you can read a thousand books you\nCould spend your entire lifetime studying this topic\nAnd it's not gonna give you the inside and the verification you'll get\nFrom one out of body experience because suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour and that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards\nI mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\nBig and to get away from this big green and confusion in division I mean once you realize that you're you're not just a biological being you know you're continuing as you're involving beyond this temporary stage of development\nIt puts everything into a whole different perspective and I'm not the first time I mean this is not the Buddhist have been saying this for a long time that you know we're more than our bodies and that were involved in beyond the body and we are all life is evolving beyond the body this is a temporary stage\nOf our revolution\nYeah and I meant to say that ... the term near death experience sorry I didn't mean like a afterlife that\nHad to make new and I did my own Google Search on I just typed in near death experience in over twenty five million search on Google were not the only ones that are interested in is becoming more and more of a\nA phenomenon a popular topic people are interested in\nWhat beyond just for now I have been yeah you know sort of the election as here anymore but\nI Want to ask you because you had an experience like this if you were sick and you had this experience for you um you were saying can you use this out of body experience to help you in some way can you tell us about that\nWell in two thousand eleven I I've discovered I had a serious a stage for cancer of the lymph nodes and tonsils and I it was a shock it was ... come\nOn very quickly out a large tumor on my neck

so I I went through traditional ah because it was so quick and so fast I did a traditional medicine\nBut um during my recovery I was having some really profound out of body experiences and in a sequence of events which I did not itself initiate by the way these are just spontaneous out of body experiences\nWhich I was having why was recovering from cancer ... ah I had a cease healing experiences\nAnd it's difficult to explain this but in one of them I found myself in this this white cue it was like a twelve meter pure square cube was segmented balls\nI write about this and

I'm a belief system\nThat of course is nothing but fear fear is a controlling mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population and it's still used today right actively unfortunately the control um ... you know societies\nOr we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be a feared and ... that is one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when when you have an out of body experience you realize number one you were a mortal\nAnd it sounds a little grandiose playing you know that you know my God I'm more than my body I Am an immortal I'm I'm not some um week\nPathetic being that needs to be manipulated or told what to think I you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be and that's amazing

brains make in that way they truly they are insignificant when you can hear in in\nHow vast our our universe really is I'm Talking about I think beyond your body yeah\nAnd what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that\nAnd you know it and that's makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance a political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff could you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game it's foot here you the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer a pawn of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of a scene can understand that and get out of the route that we tend to get\nTo understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his Eric all news that\nWe never did kill it and you realize it's you know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves the greatest problem with humanity it's a lack of knowledge of self\n... that's the core issue involved in all the ills that face

question I mean not remembering the experience or memory loss in general\n... was a bit of both uh either long term memory and of the uh out of body experience itself\nBut not\nInterfering with your like everyday memory of needing to recall of certain things that you use all the time so to speak like war and stuff like that drive in things like that\nOh I Would say definitely not a I can speak for myself I think my memory is excellent and I've been\nHaving out of body experiences for over forty years or so I I well like I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory loss and ... and I'm here she is when you have a brain trauma but not so much the out of body techniques that doesn't\nJust served their brain memory patterns that All right\nNo I've not seen any correlation for that to um I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that have out of body experiences\nHave an incredibly productive and lives in their late years like Robert my road did and others that have written many books\nI'm In their later years let's say [noise] so if anything I think they're the opposite I think ah you open up potentially um certain pathways that enhance your ability to ah remember and to function\nSometimes the have you ever experience is Jamie an added ...\n... ... in\nThem than I can relate to that same thing that I'm trying to figure myself out that it's the you know yeah ... ... with the whole whatnot with my phone so\nGreat now that's great thank you so much for your phone call I appreciate it yeah that's\nOne of the techniques that William talks about is discovering yourself through out of body travel and I do like the fact that it doesn't end isn't associated with the TV I any type of trauma or a brain injury we want to avoid those they they're not fun\nNo no and uh unfortunately a lot of people do associate that too mhm um and it's and it's not the case at all now granted there are people do\nA for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obey because obese or an element of near death\nBut the two were actually even obese are part of the near death experience there are also independent of them\nSo it's important a distinction to make\nMm interesting um I let's go to Dave in New Jersey or well kind of line for hey Dave how are you tonight\nHey Lisa the coal is coming from inside the studio and\nHey Lisa the call is coming from inside the studio\nAnd testing [laughter] All right so\nThis is where am I get a little weird when I was a young boy I was growing up in a place called ... town Pennsylvania we moved there when I was about two and I started giving visitation that would this visit patients they gave me\nUm I first saw of ... and they account for the school where I fell down in this case load my hands of my days where there's a there's two girls and their mouths but in terms of scaling\nIt happened in ... when the when I saw the night before and the Dow but all they gave me a chance for our body I was younger I didn't know what it was how you liar own\nFascinating and very cool who can be beep economy in his room\nYes a cat and um there are multiple um experiences and reports of people that have ah let's just say knowledge of events\nAre not only in the past but in the future or what we perceive as the future you know it's interesting that you bring this up when you leave your body there is no time as we know we look at time is linear but yet those of us who have out of body experience is quickly realize\nThat for instance you can live a life in five minutes it's ... it's there is no time as we perceive it\nBeen non physical reality it's a whole ... all that that's why it's important to learn about the the dynamics of our true home are true reality which\nIs non physical 'cause everything functions in a little different than it does here [noise] uh and that's why it's important to begin to read or least learn about how non physical reality functions\n... and fascinating can you ask in a long it takes you called me and my ... and we can you ask in going into and out of body experience and media destiny question or\nHow does he get something out that really going into the future more than he giving out your parents\nYou can you can ask anything matter of fact that's one of the things I Try to um teach people is to be open to asking if you have a question as to get the universe is willing to provide the answers\nYour higher self or your higher mind however you perceive it\nIt warns to assist you if you're open to that assistance and there's no limit to what can be it let's just say obtained\nUm there's literally no limit ... have you have to ask\nYeah that's great um I can see that you are a wild card line to berry in St Louis Hi Danny how are you\nHi Lisa thanks for taking my call\nI had a question you your guest um years ago while we were out of town at night were really close to the past suddenly while we were out of town and I'm going back and I just didn't let my last\nHim to be in a casket so I didn't go\nOff and I was upset about that and I had this dream and that was at least about the time and I was chasing the suspect through a ... a law very familiar with but what I made the term\nI mean it was my dad he was standing right there and it wasn't fuzzy or not it was my dad ... and I said to him I just said dad and he he held his hand up\nAnd he said you need to settle down it's okay\nAnd uh I I wanted to talk to them with Eagle's actually fading out and I was I even said to him I said dad don't leave pleased Ali and he was gone and I woke up\nBut after I woke up I I get stressed that everything was all gone in I guess my question is\nWhy this dream of that 'cause I was stressed out about it and it was in my imagination or or does she think that maybe that was my dad actually contacted me from beyond you know life after death settled down because it actually works\nYeah I think it was I mean that's reported by my God countless people report that kind of contact and often it's perceived as a dream like experience\nUh the universe it's a continuum of consciousness and dreams are part of that continuum and yes the people especially in within thirty days of an individual passing\nThe the the chance of contact is incredibly high ... and often will perceive it and a dream like environment because we're more open\nWhen our ego mind is when we fall asleep or Hugo mind set aside and we can begin to experience is but yeah I think that was a valid\nAbsolutely valid or contact Mm uh I Know I've had that with my mother on many occasions and almost everybody I Know it's had some form of contact\nAnd that kind of regard with a loved one\nIt sounds very healing yes\nIt ... it is very healing I I think that's a wonderful experience\nAnd I think your intention was right to see if they're in a way to you remembered him rather than any casket and I think that's a really wonderful intention in you basically did this technique without intentionally near you and thank you for sharing that um [noise]\nLet's give it to me yes um west of the Rockies you've got rich in

goodness you pull out literally everything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait\nTill the ghost of Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom at the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost name sue\nOh [laughter] I\nThought it was just so precious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary friend when I was a child too and I didn't think much about it [noise]\nWell since started telling him what to do like oh in the beginning it was really sweet like oh sue made me eat those cookies that you told me not to eat and I'd be like that Phillies sue ha ha you know innocent\nBut then oh I I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about it and my first book haunted managing springs I changed the name\nOf the people and how old was your nephew at the time at this time next okay\nIn one night in the middle of the night he came into our bedroom crying and he was covered in scratch marks and he was bleeding okay he was bleeding and it looked like he had been bitten\nOkay he was bleeding and it looked like he had been bitten all over his body and I pulled off his shirt and he was bruised and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what is happening to you and he had his in his hand and I ran down to his room and he had cut\nThe ear off of our cat and he said that still made him do it oh dear you said stew I'm Sorry he kept calling it stew this goes through it wasn't sue I'm Sorry it was too\nWell it was after about two or three months my nephew had his speech impediment\nAnd really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners name the one that died now the one that did not like me anymore right for and before oh it was awful he said to me stupid doesn't once you any here anymore\nAnd then how would you do did you\nOh my gosh I was so frightened you just even to recall it and like I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell that story um it it was the ... we had to I we had no choice right had no choice oh what did you do that oh we had no choice\nAnd then if it's if it's to make matters even worse is like I told you I was having these um haunted wine and cheese parties\nAnd like I said in the beginning I just thought it was fun it was like oh that silly stew\nHe stole something again you know it I might find oh my eyeglasses in the freezer or or they might be missing completely for a week and then I might find them outside in the driveway it was just kind of ... and the beginning and and and fairly innocent\nBut what I really think happened was not only did we have the ghost of the former owner there but um because see remember it was hunted before we bought it supposedly\nSeveral owners or several people or men knows I'm just going to say\nThat what what we ended up finding out was that it was it the sign up for it all it is it's the stream lead strongly haunted still\nAnd you are still living there\nNo ... no after five years we did get out we got out and the day that we left\nThe day that we decided we had to leave every single doorbell and the house was going off with was a four story home and we had doorbell is on every level and we took the doorbell out that the batteries out of the doorbell\nOn the first level and then the second level and off we took those batteries out the third level went off it it felt like they were driving us crazy\nLike driving you out would happen celebrating what came of that place what would happen to me\nWell actually after we sold it then\nThe Maddox family bought it and this was in two thousand five and they just sold it about two years ago but wildly owned it and two thousand fourteen\nOn a ledge was voted number six on the nation's top ten most haunted places just behind the lazy boarding house\nBy USA Today and the Huffington Post\nWho would buy something like that\nAh it actually you know what about\nHow about true beauty what happened with this house is that it was actually bought by someone who turned it into a Buddhist a Buddhist retreat and it's wonderful because last I heard is that they cleared all the spirits away and that the houses happy again so I Am really\nWould take a lot of work\nBut they have done so much work than men with ... experts and they ah they change the gardening they change the direction of certain you know that really works\nIt apparently it worked because it's it's it's free\n[laughter] fascinating about a hundred\nYears yeah it was tremendously haunted and then later after you know let me being a historian and everything I Want to know why the house was so haunted and\nI won't get into that right now I did find out that there was a reason there always is anytime something tragic ... horrible happens it leaves a psychic in in print or bruises if you will that can be some by some people and I'm One of those people unfortunately\nWell at least you know that about yourself some people may feel it and not know how to interpret those feelings or interpret things that are happening in their lives and\nThis is so interesting that you should bring this up because I'm actually my children's stepmother um their mother died of cancer when they were one and three years old\nAnd so um they're both very smart people on both of them there have there a doctorate degree my son interesting enough um is a doctor at Stanford right now and he was the only one in our family who never saw a ghost when we were living it on a ledge or experience something paranormal\nAnd I really believe it was because he just didn't want to eat [laughter]\nNo he had an analytical mind do want to become a doctor and he\nTotally turned it out so all of these years I think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy until\nI knew when to know what he does his friends do you mind that moms go turn [laughter] and uh\nIt's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally [laughter]\nOh it has ... did you\nOh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling now used to live in ... springs right Joes little the history of that area\nThis I Believe this is one and this is the most haunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone\nI'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right yeah oh well this was his home base he used to hang out here all the time\nBecause we have a lot of lightning here you know where we live in the Rockies and um so he actually builds a lab on the top of pikes peak man he was fascinated with managed to springs especially because we have some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter of manatees springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we have and my hope this will shake my hand and never find true north I kid you not\nBe the end of the American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in the sacred places the trees actually grow kind of sideways and it's just curious about the hair on my back on my arms and my neck will go up um you can feel it um and the other thing that's curious about it is that\nBecause of these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the cliff house hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just\nCircling over managing springs like they didn't have any sense of direction like their innate sense of ability to find their way through north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of him type crystal in their brain and\nIt ... they he was saying he was speculating\nI still in their brain and\nI think he was he lets me because of the reading and not only in Britain for hunting and he said they were actually having a very strange manner fight like diving into buildings and and like how ... how the pilot [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about manatees Springs Colorado when we come back with my guest Stephanie waters I Am Lisa guardian listening to coast to coast am\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] well\nManatees springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nWhat have you right over their natural minerals springs that was sacred to them and that the natives actually curse the town after that and that's why it's so hot that makes sense to me [laughter]\nYeah it does yeah it does now you live there\nI Do ... and you like it [laughter]\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here\nAnd I am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened okay a year ago it was September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge\nNow this very old body it was awful he's suicide um come to find out it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started talking to people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a\nHigh incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism\nAnd I believe it's because the people here have not learned how to um process and they they don't know how to channel the energy of managed to\nThat is the legend that that's why there is so there are so many um artist answer thing or musicians that live in this town because they can feel the energy but if you don't properly handled this energy for the powers of good [laughter]\nIf you actually get into a negative mind spot or you don't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't\n... it will turn against you it will become a negative force\nAnd I know that because it happened to me when I first moved here ah and I see it happening to other people well that's one of them my a God son moved in with me a year ago and I said I was trying to help them out he was going through a hard time\nAnd I have this beautiful addict apartment two bedrooms and a kitchen and bathroom and I said he lived there for free just needed to get a job\nHe was only here for a week and he you know the ... the spirit a manatee Wilber took him and he goes I can see what I can feel it I've never felt so good in my life you know [laughter] well you got to be careful though he burned out and about a month [laughter] and it was really sad\nHow do I suggest people process that energy and wherever they live if it's a haunted house or if it's a a relative how do you channel that energy\nWell I definitely don't want to be around any negative energy anymore like I said I\nI Try to keep you know a healthy attitude about it if if I can call it that [laughter] because you have to think about this why is it goes here why aren't they lingering that can't be good [laughter]\nThere is on his own business right\nWell yeah but I mean that's that's that's a lot of anger too if you think about it and um what do you say that because you would have to have a lot of anger to these it to be petted here um if you are a full life and full of love and full of Christ consciousness whatever you want to call it\nI don't think you'd be tethered here after life I think that you would want to move on and toward the light [noise] um\nYeah you got a good point there do these beings want to stay tethered here to hunter disrupt people because they have a grudge\nWell some of them I Believe our conscious and some of them I don't think that they know that they are here still but they're they're all troubled I you know I Love these stories when people go on my bed and breakfast is haunted but only by a friendly spirit I'm like give me a great\nThere are no such thing as a friendly those Casper or otherwise\n[laughter] will because it why would they why would they state that's a good point\nIs it's ... it's doing and and when you know if this okay\nIt's troubling it's troubling and and when you messing around with this okay it it can it can lead you down a dark road okay I've seen it happen to my friends I mean\nI don't watch TV and I haven't for Twenty years and it's funny that I'm In this business because now all these goes hunting shows or on TV [noise]\nUm and I guess in the last year or two you hear all these stories about these people that are on these goes hunting shows and they kill each other and [laughter] you heard about this stuff I think they get involved into a dark force you know it's nothing to play around with\nOur own goes troubled and our own lives\nThat I Believe so I think that everyone has a different opinion now I Want to tell you something this last book that I just wrote was actually written because of a ghost\nI was called on the telephone to write a story to help this poor person who has been demonized for the last hundred years I helped her cross over by writing this last book and I have that that is a matter of fact\nIs that the forgotten jails in Colorado is\nBoth legends and lore of the Rockies by ship for and it just came out and the very first story\nTrue I Swear to God Knows about it [laughter] pardon jealous about it okay about its it actually begins in Nineteen eighty five\nI was a college student and I decided to go to this little mining town to um interview the owners of this old theater and I'm not going to mention the theater 'cause I Want people to buy my book [laughter]\nAnyway they go to I go to the theater and I have an amazing paranormal experience where I actually saw the former owner of the theater and she was crying and she was upset because her name had been painted\nWell I didn't know what to do when I got back to school I'm not going to write this story they are going to think I'm not ... I did not tell this story to anyone you know I've been single since I was a little kid so some times just\nPut it has in my mind and don't tell anyone [noise] okay so now flash forward to two thousand sixteen I have written for books on both legends lord of the Rocky Mountains and was quite happy to rest on my litter Rory laurels\nAnd I ... out of the blue got a telephone call\nFrom the Colorado alarm company about an intrusion signal on Harrison Avenue in those historians out there might know where that is but\nOnly a historian with no where that was\nAnd that being said this was a message left on my home number now I was getting ready to take a walk I heard the phone rang and I was like I'm not going to get it but something told me to get it so five minutes later I went and checked the phone and I'm like oh my gosh this is an intrusion signal at the at the\nThis place you know in the mountains and I'm like well call me I'm three hours a day\nAnd and furthermore I mean only I Would know where this place is 'cause I'm a historian I mean this was really weird not even the same area code or anything so I called the Colorado alarm can be right back and I said why in the devil are you calling me is your contact number I don't even have the same area code as as this place\nAnd it was a myth that answered the phone and it was a woman's voice on my answering machine and the man said I don't know what you're talking about lady and I gave him my phone number and he goes we didn't call your house and\nI said I got on my answering machine he goes I don't know what you're talking about you're going to have to take this up with a theater\n[laughter] I call the police department and I said you know your alarms going off at the theater and they go yeah get we're on our way [laughter] really next morning I called the mayor of ... a town on most of the name I called the mayor I called the theater\nI Hope everybody I couldn't nobody could give me an answer\nNow did you do have that voice on your side\nLet everybody listen to the first person I called was one of my dear friends dory spent my business partner she is a psychic she's been on good morning America she's pretty well known and and I said what the devil is going on with this and she listens to the tapes you know on my tape recorder on my answering machine I let her listen to it\nAnd she went into a trance and she did and reading and she we found out that I had the same birthday as the former owner of this I'm old theater\nAnd a lot more in common that was just mind ... and my friend said to me you were destined to write a story about this crying goes\nBecause he is very sad that she has been demon all these all these years and no one has hurt her side of the story and she wants you to correct it for her\n[laughter] you're kidding me and I said she goes no no I'm not kidding you so I called I called the um\nThe manager of this theater and I told her all of this I go I Know you're going to be ... I think I'm Crazy relation to this message and she calls me back and she goes I Want you to come up here by himself\nAll alone watch the the holes in the winter okay and I said well it's no fan for her and she goes I don't care come on up so I get\nThere and she lets me inside and she said if I tell you this [laughter] you know my neck is at stake that's why I'm not telling you the theaters name them\nAnd I said yes I Do understand that and she goes I cannot say that this theater is haunted because I lose my job and I love my job um but yes Stephanie this theater is really haunted and I need your help\n\nYou're listening to talk of giant nine Seventy Katie WM show ...

it because it had to get rid of all this this is this and that was like three million dollars right there but anyway just to make sure that their investment was not going to be flooded\nThey actually after five members of the Native American Indian canceled come here and do a healing right over the town and over this fall building\nAnd I actually read the article in the Colorado Springs does that and it said after they did the healing ritual in front of the spa building that five crows flew up into the air\nAnd not even being able to find true not north flew into the building and crashed I'm not kidding you you've got if you want to look it up it's easy to do\nLooking [laughter] isn't that an omen\nI don't know but you know what in two thousand Thirteen it flooded again it didn't work\nNow right that if feels like an elementary maybe they shouldn't build their again yeah we do not somebody with a concept I mean\nThere are certain things to be said for the history tours and things that are being done in these secret lands ... or ... being built and so forth where's the this fine line there to honor and respect the lore of that particular lane\nYeah I I say thanks every day you know to the good lord to the spirits that be to the land that be and I give there's a legend about managing springs that you're not allowed to leave and unless you ask for permission or less you're ready to leave you come here because you are supposed to learn a lesson you don't come here because it's a choice\nYou Mars summoned to this town\nAnd I know that sounds crazy but I have talked to so many people over the years\nAnd I always ask them I said so what brought you to manage to springs oh always the same story it was the weirdest thing you know I never planned on moving here and my car ran out of yes uh-huh and stories like that and when you hear so many of them you know this isn't a coincidence\n... interesting so let's go back to the idea of what to do if you are sensitive to these types of energy or maybe you have a ghost in your house or something that might be\nVisiting you what would you suggest to people that maybe don't want you want to do to transition want to move on already yeah\nSee I think that when someone dies now I I Want to ... this with make sure that I don't offend anybody is religious or spiritual beliefs this is these are just my feelings I think when someone dies for the first three days or so that maybe their spirit lingers but they stay here some people believe that\nTwo days or so that maybe this ... that they stay here some people believe that some you know maybe you just hang around to see her funeral and then you leave if you're not a ghost [laughter] um\nOther stay right up but if there is a lingering energy in your home get rid of it or move [laughter]\nUsually owns that particular place not\nSee eye earlier in the conversation I did say that my house has haunted that I live in now and\nThat I Want to say but the ... that it is it used to be the pikes peak Bible college has a very interesting history\nAnd anyhow the other day band that it is that the valley so than this time of year I actually heard choir music in my house I've lived here for Fifteen Years I've never heard that before when I ran into the dining room and then it it ceased\nI Know it was inside of my house I heard it my dogs hurt it they weren't ... going on\nI think that's a residual it's like a bird in time you know quantum says this can explain it better than I can but I just think of it is like ... ... you can still smell the burnt\nTill it's gone yeah\nI live in time make more sense where it could be a coming back into this dimension temporarily in a split second\nYes and see that doesn't have a consciousness the choir music that I heard did not have a consciousness we\nMean by that means it was just like I heard it in the room like some it was a bourbon time does that make sense to have a conscious it's yeah it's just music that I heard like\nThey came through sometimes believe it or not I can hear the trains that used to run behind my house mhm ran in over a hundred years yeah so yeah when I hear so I don't know if other people do [laughter]\nYou have anybody around that you could ask a much\nMore in tune with the higher laws of nature as I said delicately they can they can pick up on it to children especially that's why I Love it when when little children come on my tour is because um I turn it down a little bit so I don't scare them so much that the kids have a great time because they haven't been taught not to the\nRight to read so back to where people feel that they're afraid of ghost you're saying that they're not usually wanting to stay they want to move on or they should move on\nTo move on I think it would be like you know when you're hungry you just know to eat\nHow do you help but uh being do that how would you suggest or how would you teach someone to us this this goes to move on\nWell you can always try talking to it I Swear it works but would you ask\nI tell it or you need to move on you know you're not supposed to be here anymore and I know this is your house and you love it that you are not supposed to be here anymore your loved ones are waiting for you on the other side you need to go\nAnd just talk to them like a kind person would talk to anyone who was scared and confused the beans are just like they were on earth and some of them get hot here it's it's really sad if you think about these go centers that go out and our teasing them like they're\nLike they're like in the zoo or something you know\nHe's very nice looking Ghostbusters where they could vacuum them up and put them into two yeah when you asked this or you say to this this entity that might be hanging around and causing Mr move on ... ... why do people get scared\nI think that you know what goes hunting is addicting plus of all it is so fascinating we both been fascinating with what's on the other side and then once you have validation I tell you what it does not stop it that it's like gambling or something it\nOpens up a whole new world of possibility and I can't\nBelieve this happened and then you do feel special because so many people want a validation that there is life after death let's be honest\nAnd when you do have it happen it blows your mind and you will never forget it and you will never let anyone talk you out of what you saw the that's what happened to me when I was a child\nMy parents told me that it was because they drop me on the head when I was a baby imagine that so I mean they all my life I was told that I was crazy and I'm not [laughter] because\nOther people have had a habit enthusiastic I Would say [laughter] but now tell which do you started this wonderful conventions paranormal convention travels to various areas tell us a little bit about\nWell um we call it a moot movable feast like I said and so when we go into different areas the very very very first thing that we do is we contact with the local historian\nAnd the local goes hunting groups and we say we want to be your advocate we are here to help you and your community it you need to get rid of an ego we're here we're not going to be like those guys though were really like I Would call us paranormal psychologist\nThere's such a germ yes\nAnd that's what we do and we're very kind and we're and we try to talk them over or do whatever we can write a book\nThese so when you do the tours you have a group to come with you and it's more of an active type of tour right\nMy two words it's because of the town itself is very active and this is how I Do my tours um if you look at my website manage elections that time you will see that there's very little information on there\nAfter Seventeen years there's a reason for that I don't have a meeting sites because before my tours I actually do a prayer and a meditation on ask for the spirits which one wants to come out and talk tonight so the tourists do change night by night and you never know which spirit is going to come out and play quite interesting\nYeah does that do say with specific date and time and all that you think are not as validating\nOh no I didn't say that at all I'm just saying that's how I run my tours okay there are always different they always change because that's how the paranormal is it's always changing it's always different\nThat there are some spirits that are pretty consistent but I called is much like fishing I mean as much as I Love to go fishing sometimes I don't catch a darn thing and that's how it goes hunting is you just never know what's gonna happen and then sometimes you'll it'll be hot and you'll catch a bunch of\nGoes my goodness All right we're going to take a

mind just told you where it is I'll bet you anything that's ...\nYeah well that is I can still will vote you decided to suspect you of the house and you could tell by looking at that wall in the middle that it's further than all the rest\nOh my God\nSomething ... something in a yeah yeah that section of a wall but are you having about doing it anyway that if\nYou haven't done it for a reason

their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad okay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um it's\nThe whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus actions like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um\nFloat chambers exempt in this case you are not floating you're you're in this

considered to be light hypnosis\nUm there's different progression that are used but it's basically a meditative type of program that's guided often guided where you would just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experiences during even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience\nTeaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have pets life regressions mhm they have contact\nWith all kinds of let's just say a non physical being different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up to her inner self people experience different kinds of\nAh let's just say eye opening a mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance pet fly for ... a regression type flashes are quite common\nAnd there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore your true self\nTo open up to that awakened to that multi dimensional self within you\nSee what types of questions could you ask yourself and then you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggested that right after the exercise\nYou everybody receipt gets a journal where they bring a journal and you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever ... whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery\n'cause information can be\nTransmitted many different ways\nIt's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information\nBut uh people have all kinds of profound experiences\nAnd they are waking to\nTheir their true self and they're the answers within them\nMhm yeah so the implication that personal growth in the spiritual awakening that

happen I that comes up in my class as well ah where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say\nTo people that and there are people that have died but they are law store for instance someone that may have died um quickly and they're just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI think that that type of thing does happen quite a bit and um\nAt at ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guidance it's called guidelines\nI'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um [noise] and to
