George hours what I'm doing now in in minutes or in a union and you'd\nBetter be minutes on this show right could you imagine the taking hours\nUh you have a it's interesting just like the previous caller\nAnother moon and aries okay we're which means like from the path recent lifetime you've developed leadership skills that you need to bring through their kind of instinctual like being in charge being assertive without being aggressive so there was a kind of forceful part but your son sign Aquarius\nAquariums need to learn through groups through friendships through team kind of activities or global kind of things\nAre where you're ... you ... that are sort of close to your philosophy of life and what's in your heart and you're also going with high fees rising which adds if it's positive a compassionate empathic kind of energy and also it's like a quality\nInterestingly you like the previous caller had an enormous amount of Capricorn the previous caller had sun a Capricorn you have one two three you're five less devising Capricorn more than even when you have an Aquarius a Capricorn\nUm is worth Saturn is moving and so you also if you want to do this you're you're moving into a strong career cycle\nAnd I mentioned earlier you asked me George you know something really for two to good happening and I said Jupiter going into its own kind of ... well here's somebody Donna\nYou're born with Jupiter and said you carry through it's going to be homecoming for you over the next year a lot of Jupiter and Saturn\nSo do something in the world or something you know we're making a expressing yourself in society and kind of a mover and shake her ... even in your community or a neighborhood or your state you know to do something that you feel is significant and\nAnd worthwhile\nAlright Don good luck to you hope everything works out it's amazing mark how you're able to pinpoint individuals with astrology\nWell because it's kind of like if if I were a doctor okay and what\nI'm doing if you just if you said okay this person needs advice about their chest area and you put an X ray in front of me I just start talking you know the doctors thing whatever it is and it's right then you'd say okay\nUh looked serious enough that you know going to have to put you on antibiotics and then go back and forth a little bit will for how long you know and then come back to me it could be a pneumonia it might be bronchitis will will have to\nTake you know have have you do some you know the what happened so it's kind of like a Rorschach test the chart is\nIs so magical but it's like again if this were a beginner and they they'd be looking around and saying what do I do you know I see that there's the symbol for Aquarius there's Pisces there's some Capricorn but it would be like gobbledygook\nBut ... but when you have done it for forty six years you know if they're like on the website I have what's called the cosmic calendar which used to be walking a planet earth and now it's independent and that's where people can\nSee what's in the sky every day and they can\nCan subscribe you know for a year or two and we even have a new thing where they can try it for one week for less ... less than a dollar or a month or less than ten dollars it's it's kind of part of the new great there\nWell that's fantastic that's you've been doing this for so long and you know I I think it's important for people to chart themselves right into the sea the directions are going for advice\nMy whole goal has always been George again this part of by Pisces what I when I Do a consultation for somebody I hate to say that I mean I'd love to have them come back hey I'd like to do a deeper thing and you know I can do charts of compatibility with a loved one or a parent and a child\nDeeper thing and you know I can Detroit's of compatibility with a loved one or a parent and a child but my goal is to get them so excited that ... years later they would come back and say you know you did my reading and studying I'm doing it on my own if I can do that that is the greatest thing that I could do do\nCouples ever come to you mark to say are we compatible but\nWell I Will say that first of all I don't do this anymore\nBut I used to do a lot of marriage ... really ... but the thing is it's a very fine tuned I'm there we have we have reports that we sell coal friends and lovers and there's something called ...\nSo I I Would tell people to go to our strategy you poor thing and they couldn't put in their birth data and get that relatively quickly for me to do things is you know it's more expensive you have to do to charge you got to get back current information both people but basically astrologers have been doing this for a long time\nAnd it's and it's like you look at Venus and Mars for lots of love and or the sun ... matching up and all the different planets but it's quite complex but you can do it\nAre you like a human ... card\n[noise] [noise] well I've created to to row decks one with my ex wife each uh uh we did in ... which have sold well over a hundred thousand copies for the last like almost Thirty years so many different languages and she has done an enormous amount of\nPromotion of that and then I did baseball Toronto and I just ran into the Gulf War Philips the other day I hadn't seen her a while and that has not sold all that well because the publishers sort of will doing calendars but they had never done a terrific project so I've done to row longer than I've done astrology\nI'm going to give you our next a

putting in like close to sudden rise this person is a sun science Scorpio but you're not going to believe is the third time in a row we looked like we have another mood in areas that that is really took that's\nNot so unusual that yeah I mean there are twelve times three callers all within areas man that's my that's my audience\nSo again we have somebody and this is interesting traditionally Mars which I mentioned earlier is going to hit its own zero point of areas on December thirty one and New Years which is what I said you know it's it's traditionally a planet of war but it can also be a planet of energy a planet of passion\nFor a sports exercise and this person who just called um has the moon in areas conducting Mars and he's the son signed Scorpio and traditionally Scorpio was also ruled by Mars it was considered to the ancient Mars is night sign\nBecause it ruled the water side to this person has a lot of Mars a lot of intensity\nUm a lot of difference energy that comes through the Scorpio world and currently Jupiter is making a ... a a crossing just finished three times on\nThis individual is mercury so he the fact that he made it through on this is probably part of Jupiter offering a kind of blessing just that he's on here it and again I Would say to him he also has Capricorn strong\nTo do some kind of a study in metaphysics philosophy on people who have his science Scorpio need to really get into these things\nI'm sort of in a hot and heavy way and stay with it\nDo you pick lottery numbers mark\nI'm I I I often enter you know the different lotteries

shooting star affect anybody's astrological chart\n[laughter] um\nI don't know that that would actually do something although my favorite magazine as astronomy young at a Wisconsin I don't know if you get it it's beautiful and the credible gotten it for a long time and they just had it in the previous issue where there's a a free program I I don't remember exactly where it is I have an order to get\nWhich I think is really unique with the people can see\n'em they can plot like around America around the world when the moon would a cult of planet or star and even an asteroid two it's sort of comes close to what you're asking about and that's actually a software program so in the software world these are amazing things but\nMedia you know we have the you know the different kind of media storms that happen every so often like this one\nIn August you know the Perseids and different ones\nUm there there may be some effect with some people I think more psychic leave the people who like are prone to you know respond to earth changes you know some people tune in to earthquakes and\nAnimals and you you know things like that so I'm anything's possible but it wouldn't really change the charts so much\nAll right let's go back to the final cultures they line up for you or your next birthday is October Twenty one Nineteen fifty coming up pretty soon a birthday October Twenty one Nineteen fifty we'd go west to Albert in Tucson, Arizona hey Tucson how are you Albert\nHey good evening George good evening mark\nUnhappy upcoming birthday to you my friend\nOh well thank you hey another year oh there you know [laughter]\nThey keep clicking by do you have a question for mark or just want him to do reading for you\nOr he can do or reading my question which I've been kind of in a financial limbo for the last year so I was wondering if that was going to change and the other question is about you know it's love and money\nThe money go ahead Mr learner\nOkay ah by the way I did solve the aries three people in a row because there's something called the part a fortune in Arabic strategy which was developed a thousand years ago\nThey were all mathematically oriented that's where we get algebra hot and there's what's called parts like the part of the of earth part of marriage and so on something called a part of fortune\nAnd throughout the entire a segment there the part of fortune for Los Angeles and out on the west coast was an aries the sign that the moon was showing up in the part of fortunes very connected to the moon\nAnd the moon was also the moon as an aside cancer and is rising in the first house of self expression which is the kind of archetype all areas area so there was a reason that happened will this fellow now has a ... and ... is\nFrom from the path from another life or other existence is in the past this person has developed in this could be why the financial thing I'm\nMore of sort of the need for compassion may be working in religion and philosophy behind the scenes and it's not ISIS is not very much of a mover and shake her in the world\nSo as an individual people who have ... moon come in and they're more impact\nAnd path okay for good or for ill okay and some people with strong Pisces moon can get sort of pulled into they can become vulnerable you know to other people and lose their way but\nThe sun side of this individual is the sign of a partnership Libra and he also has Neptune mercury and Venus\nThere in that science so as far as relationship is concerned the keynote esoteric Lee for leverage is I Choose the way that leads ... between the two great lines of force and my mentor\nI'm dating Roger talked about lever as the great pyramid following the mystery of the things which is really Leo in Virgo the body of a lie on the head of a it'd be a woman\nAnd so the whole Egyptian mystery kind of tradition it goes back to the summertime is of cancer Leo Virgo and lever and so so basically spiritually\nThis person should study everything about the great pyramid and that would be very good because there's a lot of more about mysteries even Jesus going and being a potentially initiated you know two thousand years ago during those last years from\nYou know from age twelve or Thirteen to thirty three going all around the world India possibly to Egypt going to a glass and very and in England I mean these are kind of war but may very well have happened so study the great pyramid study Egypt\nA and get into things like reincarnation metaphysics that might help\nAlright anything else they're Albert\nAh no just uh how is my upcoming year looking\nWell Jupiter you have for planets list of buddies inside the terrorists are Jupiter is going to tick off what are called conjunctions to palace which has to do with solving problems\nTo get into a kind of study about how to solve your problems and developing strategic thinking and you'll also have Jupiter contact your Mars what's called higher on and series\nSo those are all unusual planets but that that their gifts from the heavens to Jupiter the king of the gods which has a lot to do with you know success however positive thinking faith Providence benevolence is really trying to give you some gifts here so hopefully you can use them\nNext up we're going to the Rockies November twenty in Nineteen fifty five let's go to Jane in Florida and she was born to two forty in the morning or mark\nWhat you're going fast the twentieth\nNineteen fifty five what time to forty in the morning ... am to forty AM let's go to Jean in Florida she was on her mind Hi Jane\n... how's everything oh I'm going to pay any question for mark or just reading um or how about getting home eating\nAll right mark general reading again November twenty of Nineteen fifty five to forty a\nL okay well uh kept her mom away [laughter]\nWell now we've got the beginning of Aquarius a where you have some strong energy is George and I do as well ... at the beginning of aquarium yeah and\nWoman who is called a has the moon with higher on which was discovered Nineteen Seventy\nA woman who is called a has the moon with higher on which was discovered Nineteen Seventy seven entire on is kind of the ... and the mentors so this brings up the idea of getting involved with the group or some kind of group process would be really good from a soul spiritual standpoint we're kind of building\nRainbow bridges between your spiritual life and higher destiny and your personality world but definitely\nTeamwork group were community were global kind of connections you've done this before in the past and it's still important to keep doing it just like the other a color your you're going to get the fortunate oh Jupiter energy you have\nAn asteroid called you know the planet Venus which represents represents love relationship or creative artistry in what's called the north no to the middle which is the moon's orbit they're all inside the terrorists are Jupiter is going to help you\nWith all of a sudden you're carrying energy that the the big issue probably in your life I'm being a sun science Scorpio and you have sun close to Saturn is you know uh you need to be the warrior the esoteric he noted for scorpions warrior I Am from the battle I emerged triumphant in every sun science Scorpio comes into life\nHaving to be daring and courageous but also off and having a lot of um challenges just kind of like the need to die to the old and then be reborn but we're Jupiter is moving\nUm is very helpful for you over the next a next year next Thirteen months it starts a November eighth and continues into the rest of the fall and into the new year so there are suspicious vibes coming up\nOkay any questions Jane um how about um your cleaning in my age how um yeah I see that yeah is that going to be thinking well if you don't\nOkay using to forty in the morning what's happening is that that planet is making what we call a square or right angle\nTo where the moon is and it's also you're at an age where you're honest is making a square or right angle to its own position\nSo what you want to avoid his nervousness and anxiety because in medical astrology or on that planet Iran has a lot to do with the nervous system\nSo when people are able to sort of meditate or study particularly a cult or metaphysical subjects or things like astrology encountered subjects\nThan you're using your energy is on the higher level your intuition is developing than good things are happening but if you sort of are not on a clear path of what you're doing then if you develop a lot of anxiety and worry and stress you know you're you're going in the wrong direction you got to get back on track\nStress really does screw people more oh I mean\nAnd here's the thing what people don't realize you know and I'm not going to say anything against eastern astrology but you know a lot of people as you may know they'll say oh you know I'm I'm doing invaded or Indian Astrology which is a different system you know over in India and it's ... it's ... it's basically the same class on the moon and so on\n\nThis is the Fox news alerts Denise I'm quick update on jak on

and he was no longer going to pooh pooh it as something or you know\nWhat was it changed him Gordon because something dramatic happened to more he went from being the project Blue Book consultant\nWhich was basically deny deny deny knew all of a sudden a staunch believe in you lose even having his own organization out of Chicago uh-huh\nI mean what what was that trigger points for him that gun I always heard it was the ... more on the police officer on ... that was a great\nCase they really did April twenty fourth Nineteen sixty four and I kept did a thorough investigation that case where this police officer saw a\nUm a landed craft with I think it was three occupants outside it a little ma'am\nUtah was flipped over car when he was driving into only got there and went oh my God\nThat's great that's a that's correct and and uh\nUh and then the thing ... golf\nOver a dynamite Shaq just missing it by inches\nAnd and the ... and throw away and and and a hot and it was quite impressed by that by that case I think that may have been the one case that that started them thinking that um maybe he should reverse stats took a couple more years to do it\nBut I think maybe a shock but lay it's something to do with it too because a a shock and and I'm Alan Hi Nick\nWe're a matter of fact a a high Nick was a ... sharks or mentors yeah that came over a close friend and a\nCourse his his book was published I think it was last\nYear was twenty seven I think so too you know about the fact that the hunting biography and somebody actually in England now hey a lady is working on a biography of kill\nLike that would be super I Know you should be quoted in that point because you were there\nMight make the world the I'm I'm In touch with her so cool I think I Will\nDo you see the media today is different from the media back in the sixties\nBecause it's my feeling Gordon that the media in the sixties really seem to be interested in UFO cases in took ... you took it seriously\nI mean Mike Wallace when he was on ABC in Nineteen fifty eight he was interested he interviewed key but they're all they're always seemed to be censorship going on there but\nI Know well I I can tell you back in uh in sixty seven are doing this last sixty six sixty seven the media I mean I was up some time 'til two o'clock in the morning and I kept a course wash cc\nFielding calls from is far away as Australia wow and uh Germany\nAnd I was on a\n... a a ... speaking radio program and journey it ... in Germany at two o'clock in the morning and the mail man would bring an twice a day huge sacks of letters\nSo the ... and ... and there were these huge flaps you sell them in almost every newspaper that doesn't happen much anymore\nReally you've been in Nineteen Seventy one\nIn Nineteen Seventy one I was um in because the Maryland and that's all you're talking about McDonnell now right\nWe were you were you interested in UFOs and things like that then\nOf course yeah as a matter of fact a a gym McDonald was out of her home if he spent a course you know move again as they McDonnell was the number one I'm advocate matter of fact he tried so hard to get Titanic to change his mind\nThat he had just slammed is sit down on on next desk and and said that high and it\nWas it was um should have come out\nAh for a serious investigation but but anyhow Hi Nick you you may recall if you've read and drill holes excellent\nBook you know that are on the program yeah I'm Still in contact with her although she's Ninety two now I Know it isn't that amazing you know and strong she\nShe's the writing or all memoir but um but ah\nI only a week or so after he left their home and return home to Arizona his body was discovered in the desert he apparently committed suicide oh no it had been suffering from a polar a depression type of thing ... the Ninety eight it or in any other scientists back then to bring this subject\nThey're not the Ninety eight at all and and the other side is back then to bring the subject\nHe really did he was a great story for us to\n... or was it was a great friend technically that call and myself and my wife\nWhen I was Twenty one in Detroit or as a radio reporter my first interview was which dancing Friedman\nYes and he's still he's still going strong you slow down a little bit but he says that\nThe white told me about two months ago they retire when he wished eighty five I say ones that go to a stand and he says oh a few days or\nHow old are you Gordon can I ask you to who good for you know we\nWe need you to keep this message out there what is your gut tell you about you know who's and whether this plan it's being visited or not\nMy gut tells me after doing all the research writing this book reading mysteries of the skies measures of the guys was the first book\nEver written in Nineteen sixty eight\nThat what back I'm beyond that went back\nBefore the cannot Arnold case ha ha and matter of fact I went into the national archives in Washington D. C.\nAnd town ships are wailing shipped kept them log\nThat actually described in his own handwriting or death that came out of this guy went down into the water came back up again and then circled the ship and then that off at a tremendous to it\nAnd and this was like in Eighteen forty eight or something like that while there was another case that I found also in the national archives\nIn the seventeenth century where I'm at a sub men were rafting a a a ... or trying to paddle a raft down the muddy river\nUh in in Massachusetts\nWhen they saw this huge Dick this that came out of the sky I started drawing the raft up\nRiver against it and then it it left it up out of the air for a little bit flopped it back down into the water and took off this or that it had a lot of those things and and a lot of that was um in my book masters of the skies you in perspective\nDo you know people like John Mack and um\nNo I didn't know John Mack and all I see I told you about Nineteen eighty to ah\nTo when I started this book are working on this book about two years ago so I was sort of out of a one on things other careers as a writer and editor and I wasn't much until they are really a constant day by day\nInvestigation of this now now France is at is I'm at the ... website which you may be familiar with that a marketable job job allow it Eric ... Aldrich and re Fowler and others\nAnd keeping 'em all of these reports and right now they have a series of reports from the Nineteen fifties\nClassics I Know they're just classics that really are would you believe were being visited\nAbsolutely I have no question about it I I really believe that and after a writing my book particularly in a uh\nWe're close with a ... oh yeah we've been I bid on ... aliens on the History Channel and ... these incredible stories that have been going on since almost the beginning of time here are just remarkable and\nSaid oh I Know I Know and the History Channel ... showing in oak goes back to ancient Egypt\nAnd Jordan hold what's this we're gonna take a quick break but we're gonna come back and chat more about your work flying saucers from beyond the earth and the next hour we're going to take phone calls with you right here on the coast to coast to\nCoast insiders the new version of that goes to goes to a a map is now available Rawhide bone in now Android ... listen libre on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today\nHe\n\nAh [noise]\n\n\nIt can be used as a currency but right now we see it being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now\nJust over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people on on it\nYou say you make it easy to own bitcoin in your ... talk about that\nGeorge we do all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account sell it for you any proceed you accumulate will be retained tax deferred until you take a distribution\nKevin if our listeners want to learn more about the bitcoin are re what can they do\nThey can call for free\nMore about the bitcoin are re what can they do\nThey can call for a free book at one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black man IRA dot com that one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black man IRA dot com\nThanks again Kevin once again you can call for a free market one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty one eight hundred and five seven nine sixty sixty or visit block meant I R E dot com\nOn news radio Katie WN and\n\nThen we'll come back to goes to goes Gordon Moore with us as we talk about his latest works flying saucers from beyond the earth is website is his name and it's linked up at ... dot com some of these cases in your book or just bring back just amazing memories\nAh I used to remember how excited I was every time I read a brand new UFO story and just looking at them employing sauces from beyond yours a direct elect all these all these stories all over again are amazing\nYeah yeah well I I kept some good files which I I took her three through the years and I've been a ... I've been wanting for at least the last ten years to do this book and finally got around to it and uh\nHopefully it's my uh it may be bus on song but I think I look at me and maybe even about this subject\nAnd why do you think the government really has not just use what we know why don't they tell us\nWell I think they're coming close with this latest program at the Pentagon and I think it's the closest I've ever come but um I have a theory and it it it it may sound kind of a court case but uh I\nThink that we have known all along where these uh uh saucers come from and that we've been actually exchanging perhaps technologies with I mean it it sounds like a far out thing is that something keel would approve of it in his heyday\nA matter of fact he was reluctant to put out any of the occupation or reports until I wrote the vote strange effects from the left I was in Nineteen sixty nine which was really a nice cat publication\nBut for the first time we got into the the occupation cases and uh\nAnd and and things like that but of course he is the main focus was to get to ... hearings he managed to do it twice since Nineteen sixty six Nineteen sixty eight and he has the great hopes for the University of Colorado\nA UFO project matter of fact I call my chapter on that liar liar pants on fire of the University of Colorado UFO product project\nBecause we are just sent them a ... there are out of some of our best cases\nAnd I'm In the long run they just\nAlmost completely ignored them\nI remember when the ... report came out and kind of who who do you lose\nThat was January of Nineteen sixty nine now and from that time on\nAll the funding for night cap a went out and then a a a there was an not kept staff member who was also had the CIA connections and I think the CIA had been trying to take it over\nA for some time of course Roscoe, Illinois quarter who was the first chairman of the night cap board after ... took over a was the first director of the CIA\n[laughter] yeah yeah what do you think to see how you wanted to do tonight camp just wash it\nWell I think that's part of it but at the same time I think they wanted to keep it going as long as they had control over it\nAnd um but ... didn't believe that even they call a didn't believe that I tried to persuade him that\nThere was a a staff member named Stuart Nixon who had a who had a practically admitted to me that he was a CIA plant and but the date for some reason didn't want to believe it\nUm which which struck me kind of I'm off balance because uh actually that was the one that before I ever came on board I think it was\nSixty four maybe sixty three were to CIA agents came into the office and they went through the night kept files of thoroughly over a period of several hours and\nUm\nSo I think they knew all along that uh you know that they have a certain amount of control over it but uh and and kill\nA\nI don't know I I just don't know how much kill really new I really believe that it was a CIA took I think he believed the CIA was willing to let my cup continue um\nAs long as they can monitor\nIt as long as they could monitor right and I I think he was shocked to as I was when he and I were suddenly fired at the end of Nineteen sixty nine\nWho fired you a\n... um I think it was a joke of Brian he was the say CIA contact the\nDid you have like a ... or\n... or ... feet CIA member and ... and and uh and Colonel Brian um\nAnd also do it for a day and a a heart crap I see a connection store next and it was the the the a plant in the office had CIA connections\nAnd uh I think they were just trying to see how they could eventually take it over and not make it look like it was a CIA takeover\nHuh I mean wasn't my cup ... independent private don't organization\nIt was supposed to be yeah exactly\nWho ... who who who had the authority to let you go and kill too you said\nThat's correct he will use the founder\nYeah I Know but but the thing is that the we had a board of governors\nAnd I'm In early sixty nine they appointed a key how the president or not he was the director first they appointed and the president and they appointed me the vice president because they call at that time had left and taken a more lucrative position\nAnd uh uh but and by the end of that year it took less than a year for them to a closed down the er organization but I think they had been a\nA a a\nReally monitoring us all along MFA we even that's we haven't caught the Airforce and one or the kill an hour on the phone now can you hold live a hundred miles south of Washington DC he wasn't in the office at all that often maybe once every two months or so [noise]\nUh and we were talking about a UFO case and with all of a sudden we got to click on the phone and we heard a voice that said well major Quintanilla this is Don ... of course accurate quite mellow was the air force spokesman at the time\n... the horse accurate Clinton mellow was the air force spokesman at the time and then we had another cat a situation where he wanted a to ask me if I were joined with him and creating got totally false case\nAnd then having to be a ... and so we created a case where UFO had landed but there were occupancy and there were special effects the ... like those magnetic uh affects aliens walking around and they actually showed up a and one of the project Blue Book reports\nAnd of course back in sixty eight sixty nine I think it was we published the project grudge and Blue Book before so it was the first time we were able to get those reports shaken loose from uh the Airforce or through the freedom of Information Act\n... did you ever know a former in the late Apollo fourteen astronaut gr Mitchell\nSo now I didn't know I'm a good I Know of course but he had a UFO citing I Know\nWe uh we knew him he was a staunch believer in UFOs\nThat's what I understand notch was um\nAgain when I was Twenty one years old I interviewed Dr Benjamin Simon you recall that name\nMinute Betty and burning hell not psychiatrists that's right that's\nRight that that that hypnotized them and that was the case and I have um investigated

mines\nSupposedly they met with him yeah yeah\nYeah I heard something about that actually I met Harry Truman one of the title story behind that it wasn't about UFOs but actually came into my father's the marina and Nineteen forty eight\nAnd it was shortly after a Puerto Rican nationalist tried to assassinate him\nOh I remember the ... and uh my father asked if um if we can make the president because that that can actually told us he was on board and uh so I said well wait I'll ask him and he\nCame back out he says while he can't come out outside and make themselves sane by everybody

only website where do you have others\nDo we just started a great bear enterprises that's what I Want her to a seven stars of the great there it's very exciting fate of the art very beautiful which one do you prefer that we use a grape enterprises my daughter has just been the Web\nMaster and Web designer it with very very beautiful and all kinds of new things on their super what are you going up to lately well that that's what we've got a full time right well pretty much\nUm and getting into the world of pod cast beginning things with the e books and other kinds of things that we've sort of been wanting to move into and suddenly now with the state of the art website we're really getting going with that\nYou were with me years ago and when you were first on with me ah our executive producer Lisa line who thinks the world abuse says I'm going to give you a special guest teasing mundane astrologer right and I want what what what are you giving me somebody who's mundane for\nIt it's it's actually uh I I guess\nIn the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much it's it's really earth astrology global astrology\nIs relative nations of world leaders things like eclipse is new moon is full moon of major planetary Lyme it in other words that's kinda the opposite to doing personal horoscope readings although I've I've been doing that just as long um for the word again now people think of mundane kind of\nJust ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results the same mundane astrology and personal horoscope type readings\n[noise] no I mean well you're dealing with the same plan a\nFine line there there's a fine line isn't there\nWill again kind of ... the maker causing rather than microcosm and so people who are in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things that they prefer to look at the big picture of national events current events the way the world is and when\nI was growing up it's just kind of the way I was they read the the ... the world book\nUm you know the almanac the world ... book affects every year we'd come out back in the fifties and sixties it's still going after a hundred and fifty years actually mostly for sport like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports baseball football and so on\nSo I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course a President Kennedy came into office with the with the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was I was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there\nAnd I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation and the world probably because of it\nAnd I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation in the world probably because of that particular event\nMarked tell us exactly what is strongly gee is\nWell what we're as I said before as above so below this goes back to ancient Egypt the idea of a a a a being called ... or the the thrice great ... which is the actual\nEgyptian Greek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly there was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and mathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know\nI'm a ... the modern astrology we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy who is also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so much and\nI also studied all kinds of things ... regarding Atlantis or when I first got in the whole field I got into reincarnation meditation metaphysics\nAt the pinpoint community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about retrograde planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just if we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective here Leo nothing the pilots just keep going the ordinary cycles\n... has an eighty eight day forward moving a orbit around the sun um we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away and the astrology we use is what we were called geo centric\nEvery so often all the plot of snow this is not the center moon George but all the planets\nWill tend to appear to go in reverse from our vantage point uh it's kinda like uh this is the perfect metaphor you're at a train station and you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours\nIs going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you end up kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're kind of ... in your direction but they're like going the other way and it's confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde motion\nSo what most people have tuned into all over the decades\nIs mercury going in reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth perspective for about three weeks at a time and what's amazing now into the than Eighteen if it's only went to Google or as far as one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde your and then you click on images\nIt's their little George with all kinds of things like stop science and wrote signs saying mercury recreate don't go here don't go there because people are actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going reverse\nIf you have five different astrologers would you get five different kinds of ... at any given time\nUm well let me answer one way if people who really studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades very intensively if you had say a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same charter somebody with the same event\nAnd you ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and\nOther things over the years because I've been on during the election times and often you know people want to hear predictions you're going to go however astrology\nReally works best in terms of ... uh as young said and he studied it or not just psychology and UFOs and ... dollars and everything else but he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I use is called before whatever is born at a moment of time\nHas the qualities of that moment of time it's because time should not be thought of is like I'll meet you at ten o'clock in the morning at such and such a place\nSo that people think of time has kind of a convenient system it's really a power and so when a person is born and they have a particular astrology charts at at their first moments that they take their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around in a great circle\nAnd they're in different signs of ... and his trawler puts it altogether and reads it as a kind of I'm almost like a spiritual genetic code to interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but\n... ... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of\nSolar energy lunar energy and climate or energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above some low so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most astrologers kinda who have been around the horn a long time will come up with a similar result\nArgue psychic too or just the Charlotte\nI'm Glad you asked that question I okay if I say out to the public my my son is in Pisces which tends to be at least as I understand that sign rather reticent to to be\nA for instance do welcome to planet earth for Twenty years I'm not somebody who likes marketing and advertising and commercial stuff I'm much more focused that's why the mundane astrology on our church will things\nAnd so I'm fundamentally um I ... which is interesting you ask me that because I have been very psychic and intuitive\nBut I don't broadcast it but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most\n... in sports or astrological psychic like okay stay with us mark Martin a break we're going to come back and talk about world events how they affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with the astrologer and his website great barrier enterprises dot com Martin Lorna\nDo forget to wander ... beyond belief with your jewelry\nJust log onto beyond belief dot com\nWhen the American revolution was one is in the same year that Iran is was cited by sir William Herschel and ironically and bath England um but at any rate that planet has just gone into tourists okay and tourists as the main sign of money\nAnd ... New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two and so not yet but in all five years\nOr you're on a spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional\nSoda things coming out of left field shock since surprises Iran us will cross over the sun the solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back\nUh which takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six he get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three\nAnd that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers of my field people look at these kinds of things like a a nation's chart of nations are boring like people if you can locate the birth time of country cities have charts\nStates of the union have charts but America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in a number of years including a probably market changes but I don't see it right now\nWhat about crypts those\nNow crypto does this this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology\nIt's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred and Ninety four years\nThe ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which the largest planets they've been actually looked at by people going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were chart and believe it or not because they didn't have\nA all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrologers they were ... they just didn't have the scientific kind of\nThings that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ... but basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water so to make a what's happening is in Eighteen forty one every Twenty years\nJupiter and Saturn have been an earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know it\nBut what's gonna happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now\nThose two planets Jupiter and Saturn merged together at the beginning of Aquarius\nAnd then for the next like a hundred and eighty years all the Jupiter Saturn going to be an air side and the point here is that crypto currency is are more connected to the air element of things that are more a theory that are more on the line that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension\nThat we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties of the banking world the corporate world and all that so that we were ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes\nYeah I guess you could say that\nA very stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new and my daughter has created it really beautifully it's called the Astros flash it allows me to do some shorter things so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit so I've got a couple of things on grey parrot prizes in art or a earth Aquarius news zone so now earth Aquarius news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius news segment and grapes or enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening\nWith Brett Kavanaugh and and Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this well you can you predict if he I mean today one of his college a right wing and says I Can't call them a friend but said that he was a drunk\nWell you know it's interesting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother died of alcoholism\nYou know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum\nOr the president certainly speaks his mind sometimes to some people too much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not um he could withdraw I mean you know it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday\nI don't think it I think it's going to be hard to prove anything\nThrough um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big and what I did is I looked at the charts for the moment of Thursday when the session began you see that's part of mundane astrology always look at the heart of a person although you can do that\nAnd I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an international thing with the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a truck just like a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart\nIs very descriptive of that whole time all last Thursday\nCan put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed astrological each speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus in the science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexuality Venus is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it\nI don't think it'll happen but well yeah\nWell the thing is is that ... there's too much unknown but if I Would hazard a guess you know I Would just say there's certainly pushing forward it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal is if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative with somebody else is going to be nominated\nIn ... in his place so it's not as if it was like who would be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there that is squeaky clean well I think\nThat would be because they've been saying that uh a\nLot but my question Mr learner you think you'll get\nOr not I'm not at your logically speaking\nYou think you'll get confirmed Yvonne I'm Out of your logically speaking\nWell Esther logically we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take\nControl he used to hazard a guess I'm not that side of the equation\nYou still didn't answer me you know I think it will get confirmed\nThat you do okay All right that that that\nI that might be one I I I I'll be wrong on but uh\nWell it'll say now you at least you took a stand\nRight because when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um were so many of the predictors and you know these forecasters were were all looking at everything\nUm I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably win that she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan\nWisconsin a Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million and that turned the election to the electoral college and Trump won\nSo amazing work now next stop let's talk about Kim Jong on in his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think what do you think it's happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this'll this'll be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other or people who come on often about Iran and the world situation I think it's a done deal that they are going to have nuclear weapons when and they're never going to get rid of him\nBut what's gonna happen is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing um in other words it'll be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false one or not a kind of you do these kind of things that no other president would have ever done and you try and just sort of like make things nights\nAnd then eventually you know right now they just said the other day or the secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize by the end of of the president's administration I don't know if you've caught that did you see that and\nI sure did it was like we're wait we want them to do it tomorrow last week why they dragging their feet and then during so [laughter] I don't know if it was late friday or something oh you know as long as they do it within the next two years were fine what you know and so I just I've seen this all the way through the danger I think I'm In all of this\nThis personal diplomacy we don't know of Kim Jong un it's gonna be the leader tomorrow the next day in this country at least we have a succession of how\nAre you also don't know what he's doing is a trick\nExactly so you got the tricky thing\nWe the other thing is uh in astrology this was very important Donald Trump's sharp President Trump's choice is known we've known as exact birth time for decades it's not a mystery Hillary Clinton's birth time could have been twelve hours off nobody has figured it out it's not talked about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it\nSo she was kind of an unknown quality in terms of her chart okay we didn't know whether she was morning or evening we don't know the year of Kim Jong un\nThere are reports of his word in Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five is definitely a Capricorn son we know that we just don't know the year and I think that the north Koreans\nAnd people in that part of the world they're really into astrology and things and they want to keep it a mystery\nMark telling me something with regards to astrology are we going to have a good year for the rest of this year I mean people are uptight they're unhappy I'm Talking about general not everybody\nI'm so glad you asked me that because right after the election of the mid term on November six which has during what we called the dark the ... interesting day so who the heck knows what's going to happen on that day with a vote\n\n\nPounds in two hundred thirty four I'm Damian than a Fox News that's how many people were killed in friday's earthquake on any and I'm On the numbers rising sharply today many more feared missing hundreds have severe injuries\nWe'll say now that sixty five thousand seven hundred and fifty for hiring and buildings have been heavily damaged critical ... again it's just a quake at least within a quake quake by us you know I mean people thought that they had survived the earthquake within this you know I mean it's like\nA sky news is mark stone in Indonesia where there's anger because the government held by the name and reach some areas Democrats are now questioning it Brett Kavanaugh has the temperament and the Supreme Court and they claim you trying to mislead them at last week's hearing they also demand the FBI question more

breaking reporting in an online newspaper format he's done thousands of astrological consultations and mark welcome back to the program\nOh thank you George glad to be here\nLooking for is that your only website where do you have others\nDo we just started a great their enterprises that that's what I Want her to a seven stars of the great there it's very exciting state of the art very beautiful which one do you prefer that we use a grape enterprises my daughter has just been the Web master and Web designer with very very beautiful and all kinds of new things on their\nSuper what are you going out to lately well that that's what we've got a full time right well pretty much\nUm and getting into the world of pod cast beginning thing was with the e books and other kinds of things that we've sort of been wanting to move into and suddenly now with the state of the art website we're really getting going with that\nYou were with me years ago and when you were first on with me ah our executive producer Lisa line who thinks the world abuses I'm going to give you a special guest teasing mundane astrologer right and I went what what what are you keeping me somebody who's mundane for [laughter]\nIt it it's actually uh I I guess\nIn the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much it's it's really earth astrology global astrology if the strategy of nations of world leaders things like eclipse is new moon is full of major planetary lime\nIn other words that's kinda the opposite he's doing personal horoscope readings although I've I've been doing that just as long um so the word again now people think of mundane kind of just ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results the same mundane astrology impersonal horoscope type readings\n[noise] no I mean well you're dealing with the same planet fine line there there's a fine line isn't there will\nAgain kind of the make or caused them rather than microcosm so people who are in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things that they prefer to look at the big picture\nOf national events current event the way the world is and when I was growing up it's this kind of the way it was they read the the the the world book\nUm you know the almanac the world ... book affects every year we'd come out back in the fifties and sixties if they'll going after a hundred and fifty years actually mostly for sport like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports baseball football and so on\nSo I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course a President Kennedy came into office with the with the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was I was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there [noise]\nAnd I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation and the world probably because of that particular event\nMark tell us exactly what is ... is\nWell what we said before as above so below this goes back to I'm ancient Egypt the idea of a being called ... or the the thrice great ... which is the actual\nEgypt and Greek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly that was at the AT T somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and mathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know\nI'm the modern astrology we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy who is also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so much and\nI also studied all kinds of things we regarding Atlanta\nOr there's so much and I also have studied all kinds of things ... regarding Atlantis or when I first got into the whole field I got into reincarnation meditation metaphysics\nLived at the ... community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about retrograde planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just if we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective here Leo nothing the planet to just keep going the ordinary cycles\nMercury has an eighty eight day forward moving a orbit around the sun um we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away and the astrology we use is what we were called geo centric\nEvery so often all the planets now this is not the center moon George but all the planets\nWill tend to appear to go in reverse from our vantage point oh it's kind of like\nA this is the perfect metaphor you're at a train station and you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours\nIs going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you end up kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're kind of ... in your direction but they're like going the other way and it's confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde motion\nSo what most people have tuned into all over the decades\nIs mercury going in reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth perspective for about three weeks at a time and what's amazing now in two thousand eighty and if you if someone went to Google there's far one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde your and then you click on images\nIt's their little George with all kinds of things like stop science and road signs saying mercury recreate don't go here don't go there because people are actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going to reverse\nIf you have five different astrologers would you get five different kinds of readings at any given time\nUm well let me answer it one way if people who really have studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades very intensively if you had say a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same chart of somebody or the same event\nAnd you ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and\nOther things over the years because I've been on during the election times and often you know people want to hear predictions you're gonna go however\nAstrology really works best in terms of ... uh as young said and he's studied it or not just psychology and UFOs and ... dollars and everything else but he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I use the scope before whatever is born at a moment of time\nHas the qualities of that moment of time it's because time should not be thought of is like I'll meet you at ten o'clock in the morning at such and such a place\nSo that people think of time it's kind of a convenient system it's really a power and so when a person is born and they have a particular astrology charts and at their first moments that they take their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around in a great circle\nAnd they're in different signs of the ... and his trawler puts it altogether and reads it as a kind of I'm almost like a spiritual genetic code to interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but\n... ... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of\nSolar energy lunar energy and climate or energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above and below so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most ... kinda who have been around the horn along time will come up with a similar result\nAre use psychic too or just the Charlotte\nI'm Glad you asked that question I okay\nIf I say out to the public my my son is in Pisces which tends to be at least as I understand that sign rather reticent to to be a for instance do well kind of planet earth for Twenty years I'm not\nSomebody who likes marketing and advertising and commercial stuff I'm much more focused that's why the Monday and astrology on our church will things\nAnd so I'm fundamentally um I ... it's interesting you asked me that because I have been very psychic and intuitive\nBut I don't broadcast it but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most\nAnd I ... in sports Russia logically psychic like okay stay with us mark where in the break we're going to come back and talk about world events how they affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with the astrologer and his website great beer enterprises dot com mark more\nDo forget to wander ... beyond belief with George ...\nJust log onto beyond belief dot com\nWhen the American revolution was one is in the same year that Iran is was cited by sir William Herschel and ironically and bath England um but at any rate that planet has just gone into tourists okay and tourists as the main sign of money\nIn ... New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two and so not yet but in all five years\nOr ... spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional soda things coming out of left field shocks and surprises Iran us will cross over the sun\nThe solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back\nWhich takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six he get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three\nAnd that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers\nAre my field people look at these kind of things like a a nation's chart of nations are boring like people if you can locate the birth time of country\nCities have charts states of the union have charts but America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in the number of years including a probably market changes but I don't see it right now\nWhat about criminals now crypto does\nThis this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology\nIt's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred and Ninety four years\nThe ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which the largest planets they've been actually looked at by people going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were chart and believe it or not because they didn't have\nA all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrologers they were ... they just didn't have the scientific kind of\nThings that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ... but basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water\nTo make a what's happening is in Eighteen forty one every Twenty years\nJupiter and Saturn have been an earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know it\nBut what's gonna happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now\nThose two planets Jupiter and Saturn merged together at the beginning of Aquarius\nAnd then for the next like a hundred and eighty years all the Jupiter Saturn going to be an air side and the point here is that crypto currency is are more connected to the air element of things that are more\nA theory that are more online that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties of the banking world the corporate world and all that so that we were ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes\nYeah I guess you could say that\nA very stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new and my daughter has created it really beautifully it's called the Astros flash it allows me to do some shorter things so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit so I've got a couple of things on grey parrot prizes in art or a earth Aquarius news zone so now earth Aquarius news which is still a website we\nHave a smaller earth Aquarius news segment and great their enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening with Brett Kavanaugh and and Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this well then you can you predict ... I mean today one of his color Joe ... says I Can't call um a friend but said that he was drunk\nWell you know it's interesting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother died from alcoholism\nYou know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum\nOr the president certainly speaks his mind sometimes to some people too much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not um he could withdraw I mean you know it it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday\nI don't think it I think it's going to be hard to prove anything\nThrough um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big and what I did is I looked at the charts for the moment of Thursday when the session began you see that's part of mundane astrology always limits and try to a personal though you can do that\nAnd I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an international thing with the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a chart just like a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart\nIs very descriptive of that whole time all last Thursday\nCan I put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed astrological speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus in the science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexuality Venus is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it\nI don't think it'll happen but well\nYeah well the thing is is that ... there's too much unknown but if I Would hazard a guess you know I Would just say there's certainly pushing for it it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative with somebody else is going to be nominated\nIn ... in his place so it's not as if it would be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there that a squeaky clean\nWell I think that would be because they've been saying that uh a\nLot but my question was alert you think you'll get confirmed it on\nUm astrological you speaking\nWell Esther logically we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control\nHe used to hazard a guess on that side of the equation you still didn't answer me though I think it will get confirmed you do okay All right that that that's something that might be one I I I I'll be wrong on but uh well I'll say no you at least you took a stand\nRight because when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um where so many of the predictors and you know these forecasters were were all looking at everything\nUm I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably win that she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan Wisconsin uh Pennsylvania\nLast those key states by small amounts Michigan Wisconsin\nA Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million and that turned the election to the electoral college and Trump won\nSo amazing work now next stop let's talk about Kim Jong on and his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think what do you think is happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this'll this'll be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other or people who come on often about Iran and the world situation\nI think it's a done deal that they're going to have nuclear weapons when and they're never going to get rid of him\nBut what's gonna happen is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing um in other words it will be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false whether or not a kind of you do these kinds of things that no other president would have ever done and you try and just sort of like make things nights\nAnd then eventually you know right now they just said the other day uh the secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize by the end of of the president's administration I don't know if you've caught that did you see that\nNew I sure did it was like we're wait we want them to do it tomorrow last week why they dragging their feet and then during so I don't know if it was a late friday or something oh you know as long as they do it within the next two years were fine what you know and so I just I've seen this all the way through the danger I think I'm In all of this\nThis personal diplomacy we don't know if Kim Jong un it's gonna be the leader tomorrow the next day in this country at least we have a succession of how\nAre you also don't know what he's doing his trek\nExactly so you got the tricky thing\nWe the other thing is uh in astrology this is very important Donald Trump's sharp President Trump's chart is known we've known as exact birth time for decades it's not a mystery Hillary Clinton's birth time could have been twelve hours off nobody has figured it out it's not talked about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it\nSo she was kind of an unknown quality in terms of her chart okay we didn't know whether she was morning or evening we don't know the year of Kim Jong il\nReports he was born in Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five is definitely a Capricorn son we know that we just don't know the year and I think that the north Koreans and people in that part of the world they're really into astrology and things and they want to keep it a mystery\nMark Toby something with regards to astrology are we going to have a good year for the rest of this year I mean people are uptight they're

have successfully completed negotiations on a brand new deal to terminate and replace NAFTA\nAndy NAFTA trade agreements with an incredible new U.S Mexico Canada agreement calls us embassy a sort of just worth [noise]\nBe the name I guess that Ninety nine percent of the time we'll be hearing us MCA has a good drink too high of loan NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars then it's a much higher number than that\nWith Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money at the last four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four auto jobs lost about twenty five percent of birth order jobs even more than that\nNo one four four times what does it stand for all I Know I
