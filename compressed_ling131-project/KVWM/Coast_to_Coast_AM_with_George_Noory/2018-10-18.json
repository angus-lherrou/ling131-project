I'm a conservative everyone knows that I'm the guy that almost won I lost a forty three\nSplit decision in the saddle case I'm pro life pro gun on the far right conservative the Rush Limbaugh and most of it's not even the liberals want a free hand out okay\nBut the college tuition is technically and legally attack because it's money go into an arm of the state government college and were being over tax that don't know the role as a matter of fact the private colleges about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and\nHere's the thing okay we spent a lot of money on our military\nAnd it it's too much really we spent ... you know even as a conservative we spend a lot of money on Social Security\nBut we can only cut those things a little bit the um the third or fourth thing it's probably the tax dollars are being used to make er Yankee college loans and we don't need to spend any money of that not only does it put the tax dollar on the hook and it can crack the dollar like Greece remains a whale a Georgian\nAnd I'm Alan by the way I'm Alan was good enough to make me the leader of the Florida group and\nI Hope he's gotten on an equal talking a little too much and you know [laughter] but this and I I Know all the reason is here's the deal OK almost ten percent of the tone that his college dead and and it's going to craft a dollar that the only thing if we get rid of the what the lab and get a credit card\nIdaho okay with that line but let me get a credit card it'll save the tax dollar and it'll save the student is college will drop like a rock\nAnd the I I look out my raped me because I'm a conservative and they provide jobs in hospitals complete looking here if we can get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get but look he can get bankruptcy repeatedly for millions in bailout and handouts\nAnd if all these rich banker any college is going to get the written on the standing looking here ... that that that those are the two beneficiary and here in\nAn okay and they use these are All right we uh got your point there ... Allen\n[noise] you know I I he said a lot there but I appreciate all those points and he's exactly right you know if we can throw seven trillion dollars into Afghanistan and Iraq\nI think we can throw maybe a trillion or so at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view\nYou know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow I think on balance that would probably be a good thing it would return prices\nBack down to rational levels are and you know it would it would um really clean out a lot of the sort of socialistic uh nonsense that's been allowed allowed to creep into the system but ... but ... but in particular it would it would lead to lower prices\nWill go with all the debt right now Alan would you are just a white to clean\nWell I Will say that if you had a minimum bankruptcy protection is or not restored so that people can go to a judge and according to the wisdom of a judge I'm settled that debt according to their means if that does not happen\nThen we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a nonpartisan guy but I Will say that uh the Democratic socialist particularly in New York are starting to win elections on the promise of canceling all student debt\nAnd [noise] you know I don't think that is maybe the best solution because there are you know forty percent of the people are out there\nAre able to successfully repay their loans but that is exactly what we're looking at very soon if at a minimum the bankruptcy writes that the founders demanded aren't returned\nWhen you do have salaries teacher salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[laughter] yeah that's right um you know my best estimate\nIs that the colleges are so flush with cash right now there are so badly overcharging their students by and large\nThey could probably suffer eight thirty percent if not forty percent reduction in the student loan income that they are currently receiving and still be able to keep their doors open not have to lay off one person\nAre currently receiving and still be able to keep their doors open not have to lay off one person a and you know be able to service all the students that they do today so I think there's a lot of capacity there for price reduction in academia um\n[noise] so yeah I mean and the industry long program tomorrow would I agree probably be pretty devastating to a lot of schools [noise] um but certainly there's got to be a middle ground you know and with bankruptcy back with the department of education having to contend with the same bankruptcy laws that every other Linder has to contend with\nA that would go a long way towards compelling them to crack the whip on the schools to lower their prices improve their quality and decrease the amount of time that the students are having to stay in school now to get a degree\nFirst time caller mark in Provo, Utah Marco ahead\nWell George you said they can't or they don't force you to take student loans but when I started school I was on a full scholarship even pay for my books but the federal government makes you go to the student loan counseling so I went\nAnd I told the lady I'm I don't know why I have to even be here among full scholarship and she told me Will Hunting if I were you I Would borrow as much as you can put it in the bank and earn interest on it\nOh boy I Would love to sue her this did you end up doing that\nOh yeah and then life happens the money disappears yeah you know ... over fifty thousand dollars just in interest on my student loans oh didn't loan balance is a hundred and three thousand dollars just like Helen ever pay it off I Will die owing money\nDo they harass you mark\nNo I'm right now they got me on some ridiculous thing where uh my payment is zero um I did a double major in a minor and some point I did need student loans but uh the irresponsibility um I just I I Would have never tasted that crack had she not pedaled it\nWho makes actually exactly well what do you think Yellen yeah these these loans are\nPushed on the students way ahead of any scholarship or any other um any other aid that where you don't have to pay back I mean the college and some of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them\nA private banks and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's it's just disgusting and you know I might actually add um the repayment program that that a mark is on uh it's probably the income based repayment program\nSo they're a bunch of government programs out there that sounds like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness there's income based repayment but what all everybody out there needs to know\nIs that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where\nYou work for a you know if you work in a college or hospital other nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people praying for that forgiveness are actually getting it\nSo the rest are being disqualified and they're being left owing far far more\nSo mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan show so that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I'd be our program and actually get the loan forgiven\nOr and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income so twenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed\nSo the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know seeking to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nWas gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit the inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nNow and we're gonna come back and take final goals with you in just a moment here on coast to coast am\nGoose insiders the new version of the coast to coast\nAm members now available

couldn't believe the high prices not long afterwards I decided to take a chance and with no experience in the industry I quit my job in sales for a fortune five hundred company and I started a business selling custom lines on the Internet in two thousand ten\nLines ... dot com was born I not only guarantee you love our blind I offer a bitter free guarantee meaning if you are blind don't fit

E. R. dot com\nThat goes on news talk radio Katie WN and Katie Jay\n\nAnd welcome back this is our final segment with Alan ... as we talk about these student loans scam Ellen are the student loans that are out there now hurting or helping the economy\n[noise] well I I think it's clear that it's hurting the economy at this point\nUh you know interest alone on one point five trillion dollars more than Ninety billion dollars a year\nOr so that's money that gets taken away from home purchases or you know business formation a auto ... you know other ... big ticket items that improve the economy [noise]\nAh so certainly is hurting in that respect a and you know it's it's also hurting in a number of ways that are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people a straddle or you know strapped under ... this these sort of debt levels\nTypically the sort of oppressive type of debt [noise] um this really can make people do bad things um you know make people do things for money that they wouldn't other wise do I'm also forces a lot of people into the underground economy\nA and certainly those people will pay no taxes and and et cetera so so it's really hurtful in many ways that are maybe not a parent or to the naked eye\nLet's go to Paul Fresno, California to get things started here west of the Rockies ball go ahead sir\nHey I'm very grateful you think Michael thank you very much Georgia now them I'm graduated from college two thousand Fifteen just before it closed down [noise] I'm I'm One of those fortunate case who are at one point three to aloe we're talking about that actually got um most cars that were given\nI uh got thirty four thousand thirty seven thousand but I got you know that I owed forgiven wow how'd you do that and regulations I appreciate that they you well I I did a little bit of a hard way ah\nThere's something called a binding and what that is is that like a lifting of pretty much like a courses you cook or a trade that trade you Joe yeah and what it is is a bit of of course he'll uh the reason they're in the situation is because they both by ...\nSo if you are from a certain ... to a time period at the end of the school I'm pretty much that's when they committed a that broad\nSo it actually took me from I Would have to say December you've dealt with it being too around August of two thousand and fixing to get it all but given what I did is I actually wrote Kamala Harris an email I'm surprised that we bonded\nUm but the avenue that I went to get all that forgive added right a cover letter I submitted a pretty much what the government had to put an ad that pretty much uh put it all out there what I'd gone through no\nAt this summit transcript that to a a cover letter transcripts and pretty much all the information that I actually had the proof that I went to college\nYeah it was the fraud that that got it reduced I guess right\nAh yeah so that's one of the main things I put there because if you see many of the college commercials what being a problem with his life long job placement of cooking [noise] so what how I false\nAdvertising yeah exactly so when the schools shut down there goes your ... ... ... there goes your life like long but at the right you got that right or interesting Alan isn't it\nYeah that you know and that's a good point and I maybe I should have brought up at some other point and show there is some breaking news now where if you went to particularly for many of the for profit colleges they get caught lying just like the just like Paul mentions\nSo they'll misrepresent their job placement rates and you know say oh you know average earnings for your degrees this much and these could be lies and so there actually is a rule that was put in place by the Obama administration where\nIf your school ... you then at least on paper you have available to you an avenue called defense to repayment where you\nAt least theoretically you can get your loan cancelled and I I think I'm Paul is probably one of the very lucky few that has seen does work successfully for him [noise]\nAh but I Will say that even just yesterday I'm One of the federal court struck down an attempt by the department of education to\nSort of delay and slow walk this this program so as it stands now today there's a bit more hope for people who are light to buy their colleges are then there was a a couple of days ago um now I Can't say for sure what the results of this will be\nBecause believe me the department of education has no desire or intentions of forgiving anybody's loans if it doesn't absolutely\nHave to uh you know under gunpoint practically by the legal community but [noise] um but there is a bit more hope today than there was before so if you're you were lied to by particularly for profit college or you may may may possibly have some avenue for records now\nWhile you know with all these credit card fraud that's out there and just credit fraud indeed I mean if you get a letter from a collection agency for some debt you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy of the note and they don't provide it to you they're up a creek aren't they\n[noise] well that's right and not similarly for student loans we find a lot of a private loans the underlying note uh ... well first of all the loan has been bought and sold so many times that whoever says they owned the note actually does not owned a note and they have no business collecting all that long I'm\n... now there are other there are some avenues that the lenders can go to they can say that the note was lost and they have other avenues to prove that as a valid note but that certainly is something to be aware of\nAnd I should also say people who have private student loans are not federal student loans they do have statute of limitations so somebody comes up to Twenty years hence and starts demanding money from you for a private loan than almost certainly that loan is not\nA private loan than almost certainly that loan is not\nLittle suspect little there you suspect\nUm and you want to look into the statute of limitation\nLaws that govern that particular alone depending on where you live or where he took up alone\nTo go to pat and Minneapolis used in the Rockies Hi Pat go ahead\nI worked in a Social Security office for a while and I figured out that at ... at least one of the agenda as if the destruction of the Social Security program because there are families with co signers of grandparents parents and the student none of them are ever going to get any Social Security\nFor an eye out on a question and I think Justin alright yeah if I own a house and co signed on one of these student loans\nThat does that lean on my house so that when I die instead of my air is getting at it's collected for a for a student loans yep\nIt goes to the lone first doesn't it\nWell that's a yeah that's a great question um to her first point\nYes Social Security wages are being garnished as we speak for student loans and what is even more disturbing I see legislation out there right now it has been passed yet but I see legislation out there right now which offers a loan forgiveness in uh in return for people for going\nTheir Social Security when they when they reach retirement age\nUh so there are some people at work in Washington DC very busy trying to figure out how to take away Social Security benefits down the road from student loan borrowers\nInteresting is that what did you have what other things that you want to say family\nHas already where multi generation the grandparents and parents and the kids they're never going to get any Social Security but it just you know that if you have if you want to help the students\nAnd tear up the already you write a check to the school or a money order or other travelers jak or whatever and then the kid brings yet you know says well here's my transcript for the last semester you want to help me this semester\nAnd when you hand over or whatever you're going to help them with don't forget this pet give them a pat on the back and say the whole family is proud of you for being such a great student and such a hard worker\nWell that's part of being a good parent that you've got to do that with a child\nYou know I might also comment on the the the question about coast signing off I urge all parents to never ever co sign on a student loan for a student that's just\n\n\nPresident's briefing on crucial game blog ...

in aliens at the end again I've seen a lot of you know you pick up the the media um reports of this you go on to the blog some forums you see a lot of speculation\nI was always taught at the ministry of defense you know when I was doing analyst ... for example and briefing you must always differentiate between ... you know and what you think\nAnd that's not a skill that everyone practices when they they make films documentaries but I Try to be rigorous on that and and when I'm speculating I say I'm speculating and when I'm not I'm not so\nHopefully even though there are large parts of the story we still don't know I'm only ... about where we don't know those things\nAre absolutely what's the bottom line with what you really know what's happening\n[noise] I I didn't want to I don't get too far into spoiler [laughter] but I think I think one one thing that I can say which I think gives a pretty good summary of of what I think has gone down\nIs that I Would say there was and I use that would deliberately a believer faction if I can call it died within the U.S government\nAnd some of those people were permanent employees and some were contract is and this believe a fraction of the phenomenon was absolutely real and and they were to write and that of course\nDidn't entirely know what to think of it\nDidn't rule out the possibility that they were dealing with something extraterrestrial paranormal and actually then that believe a faction became or or certainly interacted with an overlapped with with a tip [noise]\nAnd they effectively I guess gotten the chance to use those those beliefs and those hypotheses within government with taxpayers' money and and that of course gives us in an interesting opportunity to find out about ... because\nOf course he was often an interesting opportunity to find out about this because I and I hope we'll we'll have time to get into this late but now with coast talk of congressional hearings to to get to the bottom of this but\nBut the bottom line drawn the question is is that I think there was a believer ... they made them move\nThey came up again some wrote a couple of different road blocks one right book which they simply go to a point where you know they they looked at this and\nAnd they investigate it but because they didn't get a definitive on the feeling was that they taking it as far as as they couldn't what else can you do the other sort of ... that they had this very controversial if they hit a\nCold is a religious road block from from from senior people in the Pentagon who frankly for the UFOs from the paranormal with him on it and therefore didn't didn't think what we should be having anything to do that\nWell what do we\nDo we want to have anything to do it\nI mean um it it was studied whatever the it was but I I as I say that there were people in the ... the law\nWho who's deeply conservative religious beliefs\nLead them to think that that they are dealing with what they don't make a demonic\nPhenomenon here might come up come up again there's a couple of times in in the u._k. as well at the ministry of defense in fact one of one of my bosses was I'm a ... you know they're pretty extreme with this\nAnd in the the the individual who wrote that the classified intelligence assessment\nOn on UFOs in the ministry of defense code name project come dying he would have wanted to go too far down that road he had some slightly old beliefs as well and there's a passage in the Bible\nIn the book if ... if I think it is where it refers to say as being the print the power of the air and in fact I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious\nPeople get the idea that UFOs might be demonic\nYes and there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\n[noise] yeah and it's frustrating ... than because and and it's almost\n... ironic in another way that\nThat you know you have a bunch of people in in the the the the the IRA elsewhere and and in the u._k. in the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon and we should be\nInvestigating it researching it in a ... a scientific manner and we come up again skepticism and you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect\nUm but that skepticism isn't the soil to Nicole or intellectual\nA human that skepticism that I think most people\nI associate with that concept it's actually ... it it's a the probably trying to put the driven skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the end picking 'em\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things that they call it just in one sense it's swapping one arguably fringe belief\nFor another so we'll these ... these people were skeptical told they would believe it but they would you believe us in some some quite Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back in ... more right here on coast to coast or you\nKnow you can show up dates and connect with other ... fans would you do in the ... million Facebook page just go to ... dot com slash goes to go see him in the like button [noise]\n\n\n\nBecause I Am on news talk radio KB WN and Katie Jay\n\n\nWelcome back to coach the cultural back with Nick Pope Mick do you think at all but the alien\nPresidents appears to have any kind of threat to us as a human species\nThis is a problem we grapple with a lot at the ministry of defense and fight the law to oil in the ... year program to find them\nThe what's now being a ten year program to declassify and release them go heavily into the question of whether there is or isn't a threat and how could you tell and who should make that assessment and in fact um it it gets quite fractious\nUm between different divisions in the ministry of defense and and some of the the\n... make quite amusing reading as as the intelligence people are telling some of the other people you know who do you think you are to suddenly put yourself into the role of of of an intelligence\nAnalyst and and you know you that's not your job and um what what the intelligence people\nConcluded they they made a a kind of analogy um they said I'm a and if you don't mind I've actually going to document in front of\nMe home please give us a call ...\nYeah this is a this actually hasn't officially been released yet I'm there will be tonight it\nWill like I'm the second in critical question is do you a piece represent a possible threat to the defense of the realm we could argue that assuming for the sake of the argument that something exists\nThey have never shown any hostile attend intent and therefore kennel represent a threat however Russian neck coughed attempting to penetrate the u._k. I defense region in the Cold War never showed hostile intent but they certainly represented a threat to us\nThe only logical conclusion that we can come to is that we do not know if you ate piece represent a threat to the defense of the realm\nAnd so this this gets quite interesting because\nAh parts of the the ministry of defense was saying to parliament the media and the public know there's there's no evidence of any threat here we we look at these things to see if there are any different interests but no no no threat\nAnd yet in ... and ... they were trying to fight documents saying well look we just don't know we have not yet made a proper\nAssessment and so we we can't tell\nYou simply can't sell well what about the alien abduction phenomenon I mean wouldn't that be some kind of threat\nRight it would be if a if we could\nAbsolutely say that it's it's physically rail and not not some sort of combination of hoaxes and psychological delusions and\nAnd an other misunderstood phenomena the the other thing is of course we don't really know what's going on some of the people who claimed to have had these\nAbduction experiences say that it's really really traumatic and and suddenly researchers like bought Hopkins and Dave Jacobs where we are always\nSaying you know that this whole style and it's it's a threat on the other hand people like John Mack and and some of the other people have taken more new agents spiritual view of this\nTalk about healing and things like that and he goes back to the idea of who who can really say and I know this sounds bizarre but in millet treat 'em\nThere is actually in a ... for um working out whether there's a threat to our knowledge or rather this this\nIs a kind of them\nWe don't know the values but intelligence and military sickles we say that threat is defined as being a a construct of capability plus intend\nSo so you look at the capability you look at the intent and then you work out whether this is a threat and if there is\nWhat ... what kind of a threat it is well we have some idea about the capability of you I pay and and again the the file the ministry defense files stay quite clearly you know speeds and maneuvers\nWay in excess of anything that we've gone so the capability we we know has\nA higher value what we don't have any idea about is intent if the if there is an intelligence behind this phenomenon frankly we don't know what it is we don't know what it once we it may be unknowable in the u._k. the astronomer royal so Martin race\nSpeculating about extraterrestrial intelligence and and uh gender and motivation said it may be trying to process to try and figure this out he said it might be the analogy would be trying to explain quantum mechanics\nAnd the well we don't know what it is we don't know what they want what can you categorically say next that it's happening\nI Can't say that abduction is happening no I I don't know that but I mean visitation visitation at\nWell what I can say is that there seems to be strong and credible evidence that you pay a rail that they do routinely penetrate are already defense\nRegion I'm In the u._k. the U. S. and presumably elsewhere\nAnd they all seen by pilots they are trying to on radar they performed speech and maneuvers that we count much so in that sense yes this is a real phenomenon and of course we've now seen which brings us back to the tip\nStory we've now seen those declassified videos of of navy F. Eighteen super on its chasing some of these things\nNow is a matter of fact let's talk about the navy jets what's your take on\nWell so far we got three free videos I'm pretty amazing too yeah\nI absolutely I've I've sat down and watch these things with um pilots\nWith I I've actually being in a situation where I\nI've I've watched these things and been sitting around a table with with a commercial airline pilot and I'm retired military pilots and we've we've ... this around and\nAnd nobody's saying that this is is bike or anything and of course of course it's it's not um [noise]\nWe don't know again and I I'm not one of these people you know sometimes I listen to to people being interviewed makeup announcer for everything\n[laughter] I'm sure you've probably interviewed a few of them don't want to name any names I Hope you will will respect the fight but I'm not afraid to say I don't know\nWell I Do I mean because you're not a skeptic by any means but you're a researcher and a darn good one in saying that you don't know that's fine with me\nYou I mean I I'm not no I don't think time I'm a skeptic ... a a ... I'll I'll believe everything kind of person and again let's be honest there are there are quite a few in this\nThis field I mean the wheel real life in my experience of looking at this government the real real situation is is far more complex than than real or not real and skeptics versus believers\nThe idea that there's ever going to be one solution to the U.S how you mystery is is I think you know crazy I I just don't think it's going to pan out that way but but to go back to your question\nI just don't think it's going to pan out that way but but to go back to your question yeah we've seen those three videos um we know that there are a more videos and vinyl I think will be something that will come over the next\nFew weeks and months there is always the pressure going on behind the scenes to say well come on this doesn't happen in a vacuum these sorts of incidents have been going on for years um we have a number of pilots on the record talking about this there must be many many more videos Lou ... has\nSaid that there are other people involved\nIn in ... less have said that there are ... of course none of these people\nWant to preempt ... the the the the the IRA and and any other agencies involved might decide on this I mean I think if if people start talking about stuff that's genuinely still classified and the government hasn't released those people will end up getting a knock on the door\nWell we've heard that happened before having yeah where do you think\nYour thoughts are on President Trump's request for space for\nWell it's it's it's interesting and it's certainly cause more than a few rumors and\nConspiracies I guess in one sense I'm not maybe I'm not surprised and maybe I don't think it's going to as big a deal as as some people do I mean clearly the United States Air force hats\nHas um it's space came on so it's not as if you notice is\nThe millet treat Hassan known for a long time now that there are getting to be to future battlefield and vital spaces that count in any future war the fifth is cyberspace and the second is I went to space", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Show Low", "day": "18"}
