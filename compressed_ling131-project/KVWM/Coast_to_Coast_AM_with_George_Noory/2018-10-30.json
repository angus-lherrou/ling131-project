forward ... ... is it right now we have a polarized country in the country is polarized\nJust like it was in the sixties early seventies because we have a huge population of young people and a huge

said how she felt without screaming without putting you down for your views and that's what it's all about that's the way it should be\nExactly yeah so so might make a comment today and it would be thank you for your position it's like you for that yelling at me\n[laughter] let's go to zero in Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead\nKen two questions though it it talked about the wall Street Journal having more patients that are ... and one issue than ... people have said it you know then\nAnd how this is an information explosion basically people pick and choose a their information or even at a a professional level what what to emphasize in the sense that if you look at Japan people use still like\nTwenty years ago the people just work twenty four seven almost and it just hasn't worked at it and then the federal level in Japan for people with that high octane\nA drive to a stay at the office to hide or whatever [noise] ah so maybe they're lacking creative conscious something my second question will be about Amazon or\nI Know they get criticized putting out small from prior does and I can understand that but at the same time the stuff you can find on there that you can find locally even a even under your for example I got I got this great gloves shoveling my neighbors snow\nAnd that's the main thing I but I couldn't find them locally I got 'em on Amazon from like Minnesota\nI go for the first question again [laughter] ... inside just rolling on Long Island hey I'm from Long Island too but what was the first question go ahead and give us a synopsis again Joe\nJoe\nYou know that it does for example of explosion that video you know like half with everything people get on a smartphone and I think of as video based\nJust how should people if they're trying to move ahead or in the world just pick and choose how they consume information what to emphasize our because it doesn't necessarily work out to put this clandestine into something whether it's just so so much information like\nYou like a carnival ifs ands or on the ... what good does it do the ... it's just too overwhelming\nBut where's your limits are where's your question on of information that we get is it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know if if um\nAnd of information that we get is it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know if if I'm a ... a lot of aid that the Gen white kids the millennials are actually tuning it out you could ask them simple questions about you\nKnow what's going on in the world and they can't answer it but so so how do you sift through this which you have to do is you have to compare several sources that's and that's what I Do when I Do research and when I Do presentations I really don't come to any kind of conclusion\nUnless I've compared a variety of sources and that's what helps me with information\nAnd in terms of Amazon I think Amazon is just you know ... what we did when we opened the Internet we opened up the world we we just ... is our view\nTo the interests of the world and I think what's what's going down with Amazon is just something that's naturally transpiring and I think it's just going to get nothing but bigger you're going to the commerce is going to change everything about commerce is going to change\n[noise] we've got a company that shift radios they make radios and they make darn good radio see Korean company and I I used to get my radio from them long before I started doing this show\nAnd it was simple you you go on line you order what you want it's delivered to your house in some cases it's free shipping based on the deal that they've got at any given time\nI mean you don't have to park your car you don't have to spend money and gasoline you don't have to find a crowd it's a it's it's amazing it's amazing I mean\nIt's infinitely easier you know when you look at the boomers what how do you do business with a boomer you save them some time you make their life easy and you don't rip them off this was perfect\nAnd so Amazon is is is going to do nothing but a grow a you know and that online retail ... feet you know the temperatures that word is now it's probably going to twenty percent thirty percent\nI think so too they hurt bricks and mortar but I mean the the the goods are still being manufactured um the Amazon employees zillion people um some of which complain about their job they're um or conditions and things like that but I mean they're they're retired people so\nThere's displacement so when the bricks and mortar stores go really the only big thing to get hurt and you know some people are out of work but they can find jobs elsewhere it's the real estate that just sits there what's going to happen with that stuff\n[noise] that's a good question you know I Know that a a commercial real estate is you know as you know suffering some issues right now some serious issue\nI mean if you were an investor would you buy a mall right about now\nNo no no but but it but I certainly would buy residential you would I Would buy residential every day of the week yeah it's a seller rent out yes [laughter]\nYeah in fact a you know I I have a house in um but ... Springs Florida and I and I have a house in in ... Connecticut and a half and half of Connecticut's four thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just rattle around in it and what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it we'll get we'll get to come up with an executive rental forward\nAnd and that is going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people will come into all areas that don't want to answer so let's let's got to be very big\nWhile you've got the company like air being beat up the rent outhouse houses and I mean yeah I Know people who own houses and they solicit through air being being exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that\nReally they're very happy ...\nOh yeah and I am subscribe to that\nWhat you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes\nOne of the things that that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and that that's going to remain in place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that essentially demanded\nA you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force that we've ever had\nIs a very young right now and just entering the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them ...\nOh yeah cages the direct dot com K. G C direct dot com on go on my Web site by a book for me and I'll sign and and uh uh personalize it for you\nIn ten years from now we can sell it on ... for ten times what we pay it\nAnd you can also get it on him [laughter]\nAll right stay with us we'll be back in the moment what's modeled phone calls with Ken ... we come right back on coast to coast they [noise]\nThe coast website is now streamlined for mobile devices great news if you're a ghost insider who simply want to enjoy our website on your moon visit ... dot com on your iPhone or Android rose [noise]\n[noise] oh\nIron works shakes had rhino safe dot com\nAmerican Made an antique styled our seats are part art part furniture and all security\nAnd if you like the classic look of our rhino iron works apes we also feature beautiful matching tool chest and furniture with hundreds of thousands of satisfied customers and to a huge network across the U.S we've built our reputation on having the best built best looking and most convenient\nShakes with great surface and warranties and you can get on line financing\nSo go with the best and get style convenience security and true peace of mind with rhino safe dot com today not sure I Know save dot com rhino safe dot com\nOn news talk radio Katie WN and Katie Jay\n\nAnd welcome back to the coast to coast we're with skin going back as we talk about trends what about India can they do in the same thing is China or are they in a different position\nThey are they are really in an entirely different position and and but they have their own problem there about one point four billion people in fact we're not really even sure how many people are in India but we we ah my best guess is there's more people in India that there are in China\nBut they have about a two and a half trillion dollar or GDP and then went ... and ... may sound like a lot but when you compare that to the United states with twenty\nTrillion GDP there's really no comparison so it it's it's not India is not an up and covered the biggest problem that India has is wealth distribution they literally have haves\nAnd have nots yeah and there's no\nOne in between and uh they they don't seem to be able to get a handle on that\nWhen when you have the haves and have nots aren't you creating civil unrest and everything else\nYeah you would think that but they're kind of a passive people but I you know I I don't know you you you would you would think that there would be kind of an unrest ah because they're poor people are really poor and the rich people really rich\nAnd that's not what it between\nLet's go to Josh in Toronto, Canada hey Josh thanks for calling\nGo ahead good evening gentlemen how are you doing great thank you good I'm a longtime listener love your show George here at every night even from are out there\nThank you Josh thanks for hanging in there with us so long\nAnyway I just wanted to touch base on an Amazon thing I don't know if you or your ... can I don't know if you hurt but\nA Amazon is opening now Amazon Go stores and they're planning to open up a many many more three thousand in total by the end of the twenty Twenty one have you guys heard about that I can I have not\nThe water goes stores are Josh\nAnd so basically you go in and you pick up or I get the most popular items and you get it right there retail wise that have online though at a retail store Amazon Go you're walking you pick out at the items that they have there\nAnd the most popular items I guess that that month or that week or whatever and you just pick it up and go get cellphone charger things of that nature uh\nInteresting then I bet they would use their website to let you know what products are going to happen in the store at any given time\nI'm sure and that that's a great thing for me or of the older generation or don't really feel comfortable with the computers they can just walk in it got what they want and go it's Amazon Go\nInteresting take on Sundays it earlier Amazon Go soon Sam is on go I've got goes on my mind with Halloween coming up to him you know\nThe thing did the concern that I Would have about that is the same concern that I had with Amazon taking over a whole foods and that is a when you have a brick and mortar store retailers details of very very\nDifferent a kind of business at Amazon has succeeded in so I don't know let's let's see what they do with this\nThat could be intriguing yeah could be I ... you get up whenever ...\nSometimes ... uh people that are successful get caught up in your own success and think they can\nDo everything everything that's right yeah and\nSo the the whole whole foods thing is sort of successful but I don't know I really don't know if they're going to make it with that\nLet's go to ...

an awful lot of questions and I've done a lot of reading and I've met people like dean raven who are just you know wonderful and very easy to talk to and explain difficult things and from what I understand what I Believe is that the the paranormal the paranormal world is actually the quantum world so by studying quantum mechanics\nAnd how that works I think I have a good idea of how the paranormal world works and I've come up with a model or how I I fit in what what I understand to be going on\nAnd tell us what that model might be\nWell the idea is that uh that I okay I I'll I'll

because you know it's in the subatomic world but if you take it up to the macroscopic world than you think about that ah that\nI I'm not in any one location and and that and and that's kinda how how I see it and and I think that that helps me understand how how this works and\nThe the other thing is these near death experiences that I've had a like for instance I think we have many forks and what I call forks in the road of time I talk about that in the book\nWhere we experience a maybe a near death experience or a close call and I've had a couple of those\nAnd in one dimension I think that's where it comes into you know a different dimensions\nI think that we we might die in that particular thing that that incident and in others we we live on is if that didn't happen uh and and sometimes we have knowledge of what the incident might have been or maybe sometimes we don't\nAnd uh and then we can have many of these forks and the road of times throughout our our our lives and keep going from one life to the next ... but at the same time that we're doing that there's this\nSpiritual part of us so there's actually two part there's the physical form and then there's the spiritual form or that it that is eternal and that's where I come up with the uh the title of the book which is timeless that that we don't really ever die\nIn in time Lewis you have documented thirty four ... cases that happened to you have there been more you just didn't put them all in the book\nYeah ah [laughter] there there's a lot more and I have I've already written the second book it'll come out next year I call it timeless deja vu\nAnd uh I have twenty eight more experiences and I I I I kind of wanted to test the waters with the first book okay I have I saved some of the more well I'll just say a little bit more bizarre stuff for the second book based on the reaction of the first\nOne well sounds like we're going to have your back about the same time next year huh\nAnd I and I yeah I plan to release it about you know the late summer early fall and and then I I also have a third book plan too so I I there's a lot of the incidents the they keep happening\nI I was going to ask you about deja vu because we'll save a lot of it for the next book but you had mentioned the experiences where you know you may have died in one life but not in another do you think that\nSometimes we might have memory of other existence is in other parallel universes and that's why we have deja vu\nI I Believe so in fact uh I I remember as a as a kid and this is interesting because I think children are very open to the spirit world\nAnd this is interesting because I think children are very open to the spirit world or the paranormal world but there it that's kind of over the years it's kind of a through our education system or sometimes maybe by their parents are different\nOrganizations it's kind of a you know drained out of them but I remember as a kid thinking I Wonder if I have already died and I'm somebody else now I think I Am and it's and and I don't necessarily remember a previous life experience from that but I I remember thinking that a lot I mean a lot\nAnd ah so I I I think that's interesting that that children have those those are you know those kinds of feelings but I'll give you an incident that happened just recently with me and my son we were driving here in Southern California and on a sub surface streets and I I look down just momentarily I don't know what it was something that dropped onto the floor\nMonument or whatever and I looked up and when I looked up and I thought it was just a split second here I was hurdling through a red light oh it was terrible and and how old's the sun or he's he's Eighteen okay he's sitting in the in the passenger seat and freaking out\nYeah he he is and we're going through the intersection and on either side of it is a car you know two cars coming right at us so what was going to happen that I can see was that we're going to get T bone from both sides and just you know ... a pinch between the two\nUh and uh at that moment everything slowed down ... everything's slowed down and it was if I had all the time in the world to figure out how I was going to\nManeuver your way around a\nYeah and the next thing I Know I I I maneuver through and next thing I Know we're on the other side there was hockey and going on and the cars went and everybody was safe and a time got back to normal speed again\nI mean I I think that I think what what happens is that we had we had glimpse the quantum world at that point and then the quantum world and in the paranormal world as my friends have told me there there is no past there is no future it's all just an eternal now\nAnd and that that's what I felt like and I and then I thought\nThis is probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time because then another dimension which\nWe might have had this horrible accident in ... knows it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour oh at each other like that you know that there could have been people killed\nAnd it's at least seriously injured and ah and we were unscathed and so were the other two cars thank God but um so it's like I I that is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh\nExperience where I I uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm\nUp at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception passing the north end to with the island there is a a to bridge fans that go from the mainland to\nWhip the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass island and we always used to stop there when when we went camping and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that\nThat that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak up for the\nYeah exactly ... and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff and then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stocked and once again I felt this this light in this warm\nAnd the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was yelling\nSomebody's watching Uber's there's a there's some helpers out there for you I Want to come back in a moment we'll talk more

WN and Katie Jay\n\nAnd buckle back to coast to coast George ... what you were back with Bruce show love the show Hi ms book is called timeless Bruce what about any demonic situations you've stumbled into that\nYes unfortunately the boy that is that is also out there in the paranormal world and the spirit world\nThat is also out there in the paranormal world and the spirit world and sure these things as far as I understand have never been human never will be human but they are very real and very scary out out to a couple of them\nI'm One of them was a uh when I was about Eighteen years old I was in a very low place in my life very uh down I was a not very successful I dropped out of school a out of out of the University of Washington as living at my brother's garage sleeping or on the concrete floor in a mattress\nAnd a ... just ... the night before this incident happened I I had cut across\nYou know I I was Eighteen but I was still acting like I was a little kid I still cut across yards and jump fences and stuff because just to you know 'cause I it it just an old habit yeah anyway I went through the yard of of an old lady who all of us in the in the neighborhood thought she was a witch\nAnd uh she lived alone and there was a story I don't know if it was true that her husband had died and she left him there for a month and told the neighbors complain that you know there was something\nSome kind of odd smell and then uh anyway so she her legend grew by leaps and bounds\nSo I was ... I was cutting through her yard and I saw a candle light in the window and I just momentarily look in there she was and she was very scary looking person she had you know this gray hair that was kind of shooting off and all direction yeah she had this\nShe had the old ... syndrome right\nYes she had the ... camp as it turned out cancerous or on her nose and she had me I felt like a deer in headlights I was just frozen and I was just staring at her and she had it was either a it was a candle yeah she had a candle in the window\nAnd she was just staring at me and it it just scared me and finally I broke away from her gays and I ran to my brother's garage and I\nAnd I and I you know went in to to I fell asleep well\nLater that probably early in the morning I woke up to\nA very frightening site or at the foot of my\nThe mattress bad that I was sleeping on the floor there was like a a column of fire that was coming up out of the floor and I thought this is the worst during this is a horrible dream and so I pinch myself I slap myself\nAnd no I was awake in this column fire then spread over me an arc from head from foot over my head you know probably six feet in the air and kind of like an art and like pulsating fire like a current a fire going over my head\nAnd it and if that wasn't scary enough there was also this this very dim what I Would classify as the demonic low gravelly voice speaking in in ... just these guttural tones\nAnd I'm not sure how long it lasts it it might have just been a couple of minutes but it seemed like it it took forever\nAnd ah it it was very very frightening and it was it was horrible and and I after it was over I was you know my heart rate was way up I was sweating\nI immediately called my my girlfriend and and uh I told her you know there's something terrible happened she said well you know once you come over in in in the morning and I did and I explained it to her and she looked at me and she said uh\nWell you know uh I think maybe we should call a psychiatrist what do you think and I said well just forget it you know maybe I just made it up but of course I didn't and raise it happened and I I think it had something to do with this this old lady I think that I had frightened or or major angry\nAnd something had been some and and I it was a terrible terrible thing\nAnd that that that's one of the experiences I've had it's one of the most scary things that's it that's ever happened to me and just as as I remember it as if it would just happened yesterday I could feel the heat I could hear that gravelly voice that just seemed to fill the whole room and yeah it was it was it was horrible\nWouldn't want to go through that again would you\nKnow no it was it was it was very real very reel to reel and er nothing that it it's like I think what happens is that these kinds of things you know when you're at the lowest point in your life and that's when you're susceptible a and I I think that that that they seize that opportunity\nI think so too I mean they they know when you're down they know when you're on drugs or you're drunk yeah\nAnd that's when they get ya and they get you a good time I don't want to dwell too much on the demons but tell us the other story well\nThe other one ah also of a foolish kind of thing a ... there was actually a um I was in Germany I was a soldier in Germany at working at the prison the military prison in Manheim West Germany when it was east and West Germany we're West Germany\nAnd uh there was a a a counselor at the prison of all people counsellors like a senior in CEO and he\nWas into a a a witchcraft so he had invited me and my girlfriend to his his room to because he was bragging about what a you know powerful war locker which or whatever that he wasn't\nAt the time I was kind of I'm kind of interest that kind of you know skeptical been interested so we went in there it into his room and he had this very frightening set up you know the very typical Satan worshipping kind of stuff upside down across uh a goats had kind of thing going on and candles and\n... and that stuff so I said well I you know I don't think this is anything that I'm interested in and they got my girlfriend and we left and\nAnd he was being very very spooky and very scary about this whole thing and and uh so I decided that I was going to look into a a you know this kind of thing so I I I thought maybe as a defense you know I maybe I should try to one up and you know and try to scare him or something and\nAnd uh and I also felt like maybe he was trying to move in on my girl friend too so I had a little bit of that you know kind of thing going on competitive thing\nSo I I went to the uh you know for soldiers they had a art rooms or like arts and crafts areas and and uh there was a a um [noise] uh ceramics instructor there and he's I asked I'd like to you know do something with some clay and he said gave me some clay and\nI had been looking at a demon knowledge the book and or or no no he had a demon algae but that's what it was\nAnd I was fashioning a a what I thought would be you know some kind of scary looking head and it turned out to be a demon head you know that I have fashioned and this was just you know very stupid to be doing this and as I was doing this this guy took notice of me this instructor and he had this demon knowledge e books\nAnd uh he said you know I'm very interested in this what is this your doing I said well I'm just trying to make this scary looking ahead to scare this guy and he said well that's\nThat's very very interesting you know I'm very interested in in demon algae and he started to get really strange you know just like the counselor at the prison he was acting very strange like they were maybe birds of a feather or something\nAnd uh so I finished this demon head and I got out of there and I took it back to the ... and I took it to my girlfriend's room and she wasn't there at the time but her ... her girlfriend a roommate letting in\nAnd I set it up on her night stand and there's like this mirror behind it and I said okay I'm going to freak her out and then I'm going to freak her out and then we're going to go on freak out this other guy and get them to get you know get away from us\nSo I set up these candles around it stupid right\nSo uh I was the was the intent was good right\nIt was it was maybe a good intent but it was playing with stuff I didn't understand so I'm sitting there looking at it and the girl friend left or I mean the the uh the roommate left and I was just there by myself sitting there staring at the ... all of a sudden it's lips started to move\nIt left and I was just there by myself sitting there staring at the ... all of a sudden it's lips started to move and it started to say things in that same kind of guttural voice that I had heard of before I joined the army and that that other incident that I told you about\nAnd uh it was it was it was pretty scary and I thought at first this isn't real but then it kept happening and then my girlfriend walked in\nAnd she immediately so what are you doing and I said well your roommate Libyan and then she said what is that and she pointed to it and I said oh that's the thing I made to scare you know this councilor guy\nAnd she said you know that's very interesting because when I was in and she was telling me when I was in high school I made something that looked exactly like that and I had to throw it away because it started to interact with me\nAnd I and I said well hey that's what this did you know and she\nShe freaked out she grabbed it she opened up the window and from the third floor she threw it out the window into the dumpster that was down on the in the parking lot and she said you don't ever play around with that kind of stuff\nAnd uh so that was the other kind of demonic or incident that I that I had so that the the big lesson there's don't play around with things you don't understand even if the intention might be ... somewhat good\nAre these are forces that you you don't want to play around with it and if you are at a low point or you invite them and that's when you can have trouble\nYou think you invite them in with a weed you board\nOh I I don't play around with we'd you boards at all I think they're very dangerous\nMeat you ... you you you hear the

you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it seeps are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet wouldn't it be great if there was a safe that had to look up a beautiful antique so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino\nAnd I I look directly into this window and there was a man standing there it looked like a man and he was very dark and he was a in kind of in the shadows but I could see there was a figure of a man and he was pointing at me\nAnd and I went out with the\nVoting thing or I Hope\nNo not believe it will just it just seemed like a guy but he was moving in a very strange way so I looked at him as soon as I think he recognized I looked at him the vibration stopped\nSo I I don't know what he was doing or what what reason he would have for doing it or what you know obviously you had some kind of tell the kinetic

that when you went through that red light and you made it through all lives loser reason you still here have you figured out what the reason is yeah\nYeah and uh it's it's related to what this vision I had two years ago my friend gene who came to me and told me it was time it was time to tell these stories to not be afraid to tell the stories people will come it's kinda like the old you know field of dreams build it and they will come\nA and that's exactly what what has been happening everything that he said uh is that I I I think I Do have a mission I I I I Know that you know I I think the fact that I\nHave all these credentials and stuff maybe that helps people accepted more but it it it's unfortunate that it should be that way but I think it does kind of a you know give people the idea that uh you know maybe he's he's more credible but\nI you know I don't know but I I I Do know that I I Do have this mission to get these stories out and to help people understand and to support people like a scientist like dean rating and others in trying to figure this out you know and and are\nYou know very chronically under funded because there's you know there's it's difficult for them to get funding and I think this is it's probably one of the most important things that we can we can do in our lives is is try to figure out how this the spiritual world works\nAnd it and it gives great comfort to people when I although I don't I'm not a practicing medium I Do I I Am able to to to do it and I I share this with my friends and family members and and people who uh you know who asked me\nI don't do it for money or anything just do it because I feel it's a service to my fellow a human beings\nAnd it provides them with comfort and and it doesn't work every time you know a ... and I know there Charlotte thins out there and and yeah\nFor it in and it doesn't work every time you know a ... and I know there Charlotte ... out there in young and there are some real people that do shows for a living and I don't I don't ah you know the grudge them to make a living you know fairly being as long as they're providing a a a decent service for people\nBut uh it it is it is real it's very real and uh they've tried to that is one of the more difficult things for scientists to research although they've noticed\nThat when people say they're having a spiritual connection that later proves to be you know you know they got some things right about this person's a loved one a there is certain parts of the brain that they can pick up I guess some kind of imaging I don't know if they use an MRI what they do but\nUh so there is there is something that doesn't prove necessarily but it does show that there is something going on\nUh in in there is a a a connection being made 'em and uh so I I I that that is the mission that I'm On the mission I mine is too is to convey what I've found out and what I asked my friend Jean and\nAnd uh I there's another lady that passed on three years ago she was a colleague of mine and a good friend and I also have some contact with her and I've asked them a lot of questions when I go on this walking meditation that I Do quite often\nAnd uh and connect with them and and the things that I've learned are are are are pretty amazing and I I Want to share them with people and I and I I feel I I that I have to do it it I Want to do it but I feel like I have to do it too it's kind of like all the books I've written all the plays that I've written\nI felt compelled to do it it wasn't just something I sat down okay I'm going to write a play or I'm gonna write a book it's always I feel compelled to do it I have to do it\nAnd I'm more than happy to to you know to to do this and and help people and I think I I have helped some people\nLet's go to the phones for you if they have a story I'll have you evaluated for his Bruce up it's just a question then take it away Thomas a lawyer California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call and Bruce ... while I'm is my question Bruce I'm you spoke about your mere accidents in the intersection\nAnd job come up at a question or comment is angels appear to be non denominational they appear at Christianity and Islam Hindu was some Buddhism dour some and and all of the indigenous\nTraditions around the world whether they're called angel surf being supplied whatever my question to you\nSuch you metaphorically dodged a bullet in that intersection\nHow can the average man they average woman develop cultivate if you will a close personal relationship\nWith their guardian angels day by day even hour by hour or something that is changeable with absolute certainty\nWell that's that's a that's a very good question and I I Will uh started off by saying that that everybody has\nThese abilities are often the light lie dormant sure because of you know ... when we were children we probably had you know pretty equal abilities and there's some people that have a little bit more than others but then\nThrough the experiences that people have the the accepted more and more and they're closer to the the spirit world so I'd say doing whatever you can to get a closer to that spirit world some people do it through meditation\nI just let it randomly happen because the door seem to be open since age for so it never quite shut\nSo things kept happening but now I've\nI've learned to through meditation or what I call walking meditation I'll explain it I I Can't sit still very very long so I I have trouble doing the lotus position you know kind of traditional meditation so I I go on a walk and uh that's when I can get into the I guess what scientists would call an alpha brainwave state\nAnd at that point is when I can I I'll say a prayer a and I I I Do believe in God and I say prayers even when I'm not meditating but any way I Will I Will ask my guardian angel or some people practicing a professional uh mediums will say these are your spirit guides you know\nUm and I will ask them to help me\nTo connect to those that are that are passed on and to receive whatever messages they have\nAnd uh and and to help people if they have messages they want me to pass on to their loved ones which is usually what it is and\nI I Would say just having a practice of that I Do it almost every day my foot has hurt right now so I haven't been able to do it so I feel kind of stifles but the last couple of days but uh\nMaking a practice of that type of mindful meditation and\nWhat my spirit friends tell me that in what they told me to tell my students in the class\nIs to have what they call focused calm\nTo be focused ... be very calm and as you were doing this meditation and it will it will happen it might happen slowly it might not be you know like a an immediate you know like an epiphany or are very profound at first it might just come slowly might even think it's your imagination but it's not\nIt'll it'll keep building day by day and before you know it you you have you're more in touch with these things and you can also when you when the door opens\nYou'll ... you'll go back in time and see oh my gosh I've had these experiences before and maybe I didn't I didn't recognize it so it it goes like backwards in time as well once that door has opened\nBruce Lee ... go ahead yeah\nNo that's the best way I can I can explain it I think it's a it's a life lifetime journey and and everybody's at their own pace you know like I tell my students you know some people say\nYou know I'm like thirty five years old and these kids are like Twenty years old and I'm way behind you know I've been you know taking care of kids and working and now I'm going back to get my degree and I said everybody has their own timeline that doesn't matter you know we're all

I came on the air ... yes and I thought the email is still there um hopefully you'll get to watch sometimes so we're going to put me in fact for the local media of okay\n... I wanted to ask your opinion about TV peace and um I actually have this is the first probably George from coast to coast I have an actual recording\nOr if I eat eat the last about two or three seconds and I want your opinion on this one here we go\nOh\nRenee ... [noise]\n\nPretty scary failing yeah\nWell it's a weird so what do you think it sounds like like of almost like a motorboat doesn't it\nWell the recording was he got in my mom's bedroom um I've got an old fashioned tape recorder and there are ... to ... run for about two hours every night\nAnd it's been very quiet it quite well ... I Would check the outlets to see if there were some shorts or any where my sister and I and there's a lot I actually have two of these recordings a father sat problems if you like to park it's it's really bizarre I heard that I Can't explain it uh\nWhat about you what do you think about ... BP's\nWell uh yeah so um electronic voice phenomena um I I I think that\nThey can be very helpful because the it folks in the spirit world that are residing there we'll we'll try just about any way to get a hold of us especially their loved ones\nUh I hear all I've heard all kinds of stories you know that sometimes they'll uh items will be misplaced for a while and then all of a sudden show up in a very unique location to you know to give you a sign\nThat that they're there and that they want to connect with you and I think the voice phenomena could also be a a you know something like that that they're that they're trying to reach out and and and that is what I encountered when I Do this walking meditation is\nThat they desperately they desperately want to connect with their loved ones and pass on messages and sometimes it's very sometimes it's kinda sad sometimes it's a you know regrets too which is a very sad thing\nBut are often times it's just messages of love and and you know that they're okay not to worry about them anymore\nAnd what do you mean by could be sad [noise] [noise]\nWell I had this one experience where I connected with a lady had asked me if I could connect with their father I did\nA and I got some of the things you know you don't get everything right 'cause there's interference you know like with anything else yeah uh and uh I got some of the things right and then he told me and I I sensed in him and sadness and kind of some like he had regrets and I said\nUh I sense that is that something you'd like to share\nYou know with me why you feel that way and he he said well no and I don't want you to tell her that I have this these feelings either\nAnd it was it was very hard for me because this lady was very much wanted to connect with their fathers or want it to tell her but I I couldn't tell her and I am not going to say that the names or whatever but uh\nSo it it sometimes it's not always you know rainbows and lollipops you know was was it emotional for you\nIt was it was very emotional I was sometimes they you know their messages make me you sometimes tears of joy sometimes in this case kind of I felt this man's sadness or in in the spirit world so I\nYou know it it's kind of a tough one I did not know relieved that and I'm hoping that if I connect with them again that maybe he'll give me permission to help her understand what it is because I'm sure she's probably feeling the same thing and maybe it's an expressed by her\nAnd his ... his saying it might clear the air so to speak and maybe create a better connection and\nAnd then you know that's what I'm hoping but I I Can't force these things you know just like\nMessages from my you know ... from my spirit friends they you know they want me to connect\nA and I can't force myself on their loved ones if they're not willing to hear you know the ... what the message is you have to that there's a time and place you know\n\nYou mean with hatred and killers I'm Carmen

Amazon crushing bricks and mortar stores\nYeah you know you say crushing the Amazon or you know online retail is about ten percent of total retail effect crushing anything\nIt's that shares was cabinet anachronism anyway you know ... the the retailers that are having problems right now are having problems because they're having you know their their their model is not correct not because of Amazon\nYou do you think they should've adjusted that they could have prevented some of the things that have happened to them like toys R. us and all the other places\nOh yeah oh for sure yeah toy so that makes me crazy you know I I started um uh yeah I ... if you follow toys are us on in the wall Street Journal in you know it's it's sexually gone now and now an Mattel is a higher there fourth\nCEO in four years fourth CEO and four years why because the CEOs that they hire can't come up with the magic sauce to a reverse the the sales decline of of a hot wheels and Barbie dolls\nYou know what the real problem is is that what you have what they say in the you know read the wall Street Journal article just a few months ago that said that ah kids now are so enthralled with their phones the iPhones\nThat they're no longer a you know they no longer have any consideration for hot wheels are Barbie\nDolls the real problem is there are fewer kids about twenty five percent pure kids under ten now\nThan there were ten years ago you think maybe just maybe that has something to do with their ... their sales declined\nYeah could be it could makes me crazy and you know us as seriously if you have a twenty five percent decrease in the size of your market I don't care if your if your General Motors or or Amazon\nOr your ... you know your sales are going to decline it it they're just they weren't born they don't exist\nYou know they don't but how do you look into a crystal ball can make these predictions if you're running a business\nWhat it what you do is is it the what's the most important question for any business any business you know I I I was a [noise]\nOpportunity to speak to the chief marketing officer in the hospitality industry about two years ago and and everyone was there see it at a shark him as their health care and was there and Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with the hospitality industry\nAnd they asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now and and uh you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room and it was about twelve people in the room and sitting around and round table\nAnd and they ... their answer was\nYou know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how to market on social media and and American Express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation why are you know how they think how they buy\nGeneration why are you know how they think how they buy and\nHilton says it's it's about new products it's about making room small on your lobbies bigger you know what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it's all about demographics isn't it\nYeah is it because if your market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market but you know it it for about Twenty years they could make their products fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand\nAnd all of a sudden sales started trailing off\nThis was Nineteen Ninety eight and I and I said a\n... so your your sales are ... are are going flat and he said yeah what do we have a demographic issues as the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis\nAnd and I said uh who's your customer and he said and Eighteen to thirty four year old man and woman Eighteen to thirty four actually what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he said what we can they don't fit in the product anymore\nI said you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes I said the last baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said it was a pause and he said Nineteen\nNinety eight and I said what year and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nThey said what does that mean that is what that means is you know you're you're laughing gas just checked out of your hotel\nAnd their their sales went from eight billion get this George eight billion to two and about three years while why because they're not paying attention to demographic you know if you want to count money count money go ahead knock yourself out\nBut if you want to understand where money came from it came from people\nHelp people and you will understand well isn't it simple to Ken to talk to that demographic you need to go after eventually and find out some of the things they enjoy\nAnd look at those trends you find out that you know if their kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people I'll find out from them what did they do what do they like where do they go did they go to movies do they not and then the judge yourself to that\nGeorgia too smart [laughter] but but you did that doesn't that sound like like logic yeah common sense it's not so common volunteers had that\nYou know I I Do um\nI'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down and I said that's the boomers everybody you see that the boomers all sat there\nAnd they'll say okay if you are born before Nineteen eighty five sit down and ... and another large group six out of ... and I said that's connection there that are about three people standing and I said this that's why the Gen Y or the millennials\nAre born ... or eighty five but two thousand for this eighty seven million of them I said you want to know about the new market you you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here\nAnd it makes me crazy\nEl ... you got to adjust because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed yeah what's happening with what's happening like companies like McDonald's are they on top of things they used to be marketing geniuses something slipping\nI Know you don't you want to tell people I'm should McDonald's same store sales are off you know it their all their increases are coming from um their overseas operation\nI I I I tell folks I said listen it generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children I said and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years\nYou ought to three ends up of a food it's called nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is mc Donald's famous for its not nutrition [laughter] no it's it's for French\nFries garden listen to what they tried to say heart people have the impression that it's not nutritional food\nIt's exactly correct and and so that's that's their problem they they are if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food\nUh in in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell good food you can't sell you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts\nWhat's going on with population trends are are they shifting down to\n[noise] yeah well you know it's funny you say that uh in Nineteen ... we we have a new generation is called Generation Z and Generation Z started in two thousand five and they will they will be\nA but they will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully born yet [noise]\nBut in Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven we had a record year in the United states we we we have four million or three hundred and sixteen thousand babies were born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier uh\nWhat's happened since two thousand seven is is the the population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies the here and and so this Generation Z will be smaller yeah\nThat's a big trend Ken stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls with you next hour Iran coast to coast they\nGet Daily Show up the right to your inbox for free with the coast noon newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com [noise]\nYeah absolutely if that does it it it's mysterious to me why everyone doesn't think about this because it precipitate almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\nWell it it has to a large degree um\nThe\nYou know and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that [noise] if people are still people when when you have\nA large number of people that are consumer or a specific product in a small number of people that consume a specific product\nThe large number of people will consume more now I Know that sounds ... but the the ... the smartphone has a only aged folks in their ability to consume\nSo uh it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint\nBut you have to keep in mind that the thing that drives commerce of the thing that drives you know consumption is the number of people in the market period\nThat that's the that's simple isn't it\n... it almost sounds ridiculous doesn't it ... I mean ... who is out there saying well okay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then there's ... people consume\nSmaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause the the uh let me give you an example of it you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers are Twenty years ago in in vast quantities\nAnd then the the um [noise]\nUm the automobile companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of SUVs to a generation X. as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing departments that have kept on firing their their chief marketing officers because they couldn't come up with the secret to\nSelling as many SUVs to this other group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation I don't know if I have to make it easy for small\nGood point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to me a couple of days ago and she said pop I you know kids are age you know what she calls herself for Cuban she's a young woman now ah we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah in you know it it's funny 'cause I'm kinda figured that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today or the babies that are born\nAnd that's all about you know demographics\nAre born uh outside of wedlock and they're they're born outside of a of a marriage um the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture a where Seventy five percent of the kids are bought outside of the\nThe uh uh marriage ... it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that so whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that\nHow much can you affect change\n[noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing\nI think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do in right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh you know you go back ... forty years\nAnd ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies but the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the to a sex drugs and rock and roll what happened to the ... the boomer hippies\nLip became Republicans [laughter]\nIn all cases\n[laughter] no not at all cases but you know if if you if you look at [noise] [noise] [noise] that this this is ... let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise]\n[noise] ah [noise] between the ages right now of thirty four in fifty three we have a diminutive puppy a population of of indigenous people that were born here\nThey were there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five an eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million bond between forty five or sixty four [noise]\nWhat does that mean that means that that that particular population could not a ... support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population\nAre superimposed over where the heavy lift or should be ... where is it with you know our our strength should be in our population it's actually smaller\nSo the net result is a you know ... ... instead of having a you know ... ... and they should have had and have nots with with a cushion in between\nOf generation X we don't because they were never born we're losing that cushion\nYeah well what we did and as you so you you had people saying that the the United States is is broken because we have have the have nots but middle age and and I'm In\nA middle income uh our occupy exactly the same space so if you're middle ages small and then your middle income is small as well but it's a demographic issue it was just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nI'm\nFrom well had the Pittsburgh today on Dame Anthony Fox news\nOr semi

five thousand troops before the official number was raised a fifty two hundred troops the U.S air force plans to airlift in addition four hundred border patrol personnel as well\nI don't know how they're going to handle Seventy five hundred people what are they going to do and these people keep pushing it come across the border a brand new jet airliners tearing a hundred and eighty nine passengers and crew crashed into the sea shortly after takeoff\nFrom Indonesia's capital Jakarta prompting a major effort in the region that soon turn some rescue to recovery when officials disclosed that there were likely no survivors\nThe lion airborne seven thirty seven Macs a aircraft that just taking off from Jakarta when the pilot requested to return to the airport just three minutes into the flight something very horrible happened on\nThat they believe all one hundred eighty nine people are dead\nOn North Carolina high school student was shot and killed after a fellow classmates open fire Monday in a crowded hallway at the start of the school day the officers responded to the shooting officers took the suspected shooter\nRight now it doesn't apply to as a student at the high

people and injuring several several others has been named as a forty six year old man his name is Robert ... hours\nHe is definitely an anti Semite to regularly complained on social media about the president in what he said the infestation of Jews Howard Bloom with us She's an expert on the human mind Howard what the heck's wrong with people\nWell there is a big connection here between the caravan of Seventy five hundred you just mentioned marching up here from Honduras\nThe fourteen letter bombs that the Democrats last week the killing of a lot of people on Saturday at a Jewish place of worship in Pittsburgh and Russian disinformation they have something in common\nThey hate filled rhetoric of a new bully boy underground a violent right wing underground that has roughly fourteen member groups\nAre ... [laughter] it's overwhelming\nIt just doesn't stop have you been very well thanks how are you\nI'm good everything's good in a you know but if we can take key to some of the things you told us a year ago and things are going to tell us tonight we might be able to get through some of this\nYeah we'll get through and I sure hope so I I have every conflict where do you think of Amazon crushing bricks and mortar stores\nYeah you know you say ... Amazon or you know online retail is about ... percent of total retail effect crushing anything\nIt's that fears was cabinet anachronism anyway you know ... the the retailers that are having problems right now are having problems because they're having you know their their their model is not correct not because of Amazon\n... do you think they should've adjusted that they could have prevented some of the things that have happened to them like toys R. us and all the other places\nOh yeah oh for sure yeah toy cigarettes makes me crazy you know I I found it on a yeah I bet if you follow Toys R us on in the wall Street Journal in you know it's it's it's actually gone now and now a metallic a hired their fourth\nCEO in four years for the c._e._o. and four years why because the CEOs that they hire can't come up with them\nOh in four years fourth CEO and four years why because the CEOs that they hire can't come up with the magic sauce to a a reverse the the sales decline of of a hot wheels and Barbie dolls\nYou know what the real problem is that what you have what they say in the yard to read the wall Street Journal article just a few months ago that said that the uh kids now are so enthralled with their phones the iPhones\nThat they're no longer a you know they no longer have any consideration for hot wheels are Barbie dolls\nThe real problem is there are fewer kids about twenty five percent fewer kids under ten now than there were ten years ago you think maybe just maybe that has something to do with their ... their sales declined yeah\nCould be it makes\nMe crazy you know us as seriously Georgia if you have a twenty five percent decrease in the size of your market I don't care if your if your General Motors or or Amazon or your ... you know your sales are going to decline\nIt it they're just they weren't born they don't exist\nYou know they don't but how do you look into a crystal ball can make these predictions if you're running a business\nWhat it what you do is is the what's the most important question for any business a business you know I I I was a\n[noise] an opportunity to speak to the chief marketing officer is in the hospitality industry\nAbout two years ago and and everyone was there see and at a shark him as their Hilton was there and Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with the the hospitality industry\nAnd I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now and and uh ... you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room there was about twelve people in the room and sitting around and round table\nAnd and they eat their answer was you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how to market on social media\nAnd and the American express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation why are you know how they think how they buy and Hilton says it's it's about new products it's about making room small and your lobbies bigger\nYou know what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it's all about demographics isn't it\nYeah is it because if your market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market ... you know it it for about Twenty years they couldn't make their products fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand\nAnd all of a sudden sales started trailing off this was Nineteen Ninety\nEight and I and I said I'm\n... so you're you're ... are are going flat and he said yeah what do we have a demographic issues as to the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis and and I said a Hoosier customer and he said and Eighteen to thirty four year old man or woman Eighteen to thirty four and I said what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he said what we can they don't fit in the product anymore\nI said you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes I said the last baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said it was a pause and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd I said we're in it and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he said what does that mean this is what that means is you know you're you're laughing gas just checked out of your hotel and their their sales went from eight billion get this George eight billion to two and about three years while what because they're not paying attention to\nYou know if you want to count money count money go ahead knock yourself out but if you want to understand where money came from it came from people help people and you will understand\nWell isn't it simple to tend to talk to that demographic you need to go after eventually and find out some of the things they enjoy\nAnd look at those trends you find out that you know if their kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people find out from them what did they do what do they like where do they go did they go to movies do they not and then the judge yourself to that\n[laughter] Georgia too smart [laughter] but but you did that doesn't that sound like like logic yeah common sense it's not so common volunteers had\nThat you know I I Do um I'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down and they say that's the boomers everybody you see that the boomers all sat down and I'll say okay if you are born before Nineteen eighty five sit down\nAnd ... and another large groups that found it and I said that's Gen x and their tender about three people standing and I said this that's Gen Y that Gen Y or the millennials ... or ... or eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them\nI said you want to know about the new market you you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here\nAnd it makes me crazy\nWell it's it's ... you got to adjust because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed yeah what's happening is that what's happening like companies like McDonald's are they on top of things they used to be marketing geniuses suddenly slipping\nI Know you know you want to tell people I'm see McDonalds same store sales are off you know they're all their increases are coming from um their overseas operations [noise]\nI I I I tell folks I said listen it generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children\nI said and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years is it if you want the three ends of of a food\nIt's called nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is mc Donald's famous for its not nutrition you know it's\nIt's for French fries\n... trying to say heart\nPeople have the impression that it's not nutritional food [noise]\nAnd the exactly correct and and so that's that's their problem they they are if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food or in in the supermarket and then if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell good food you can't sell you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts [laughter]\nWhat's going on with population trends are they shifting down to\n[noise] yeah well you know it's funny you say that\nUh in Nineteen ...\n... we we have a new generation is called Generation Z and Generation Z started in a two thousand five and they will they will be a but they will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully born yet\nBut in Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven we had a record year in the United states we we we have four million\nOr three hundred and sixteen thousand babies were born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier uh\nHappened since two thousand seven is is the the population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to uh just uh\nA over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies a year and and so this Generation Z will be smaller yeah\nThat's a big trend can stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls with you next outward Iran coast to coast am\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the coast zone newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com boom\nYeah absolutely it does and it it it's mysterious to me why\nEveryone doesn't think about this because it precipitating almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\nWell it has to a large degree um\nThe [noise]\nYou know and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that [noise] if people are still people when when you have a\nA large number of people that are consumer or a specific product at a small number of people that consume a specific product the large number of people will consume more now I Know that sounds ... but the ... the smartphone has a only aged folks in their ability to consume\nSo uh it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint\nBut you have to keep in mind that the thing that drives commerce of the thing that drives you know consumption is the number of people in the market period\nThat that ... that that's simple isn't it\n... it almost sounds ridiculous doesn't it ... I mean who is out there saying well okay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then there's ... people consume smaller amounts of stuff\nBut if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause the the uh let me give you an example of it you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers\nAre Twenty years ago in in vast quantities\nAnd then the the um [noise]\nUm the automobile companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of SUVs to a generation X as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing department that it kept on firing their their chief marketing officers\nBecause they couldn't come up with the secret is selling as many SUVs to this other group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation at five and a kitty for small\nGood point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to me a couple of days ago and she said papa you know kids are age you know what she calls herself for Cuba but she's a young woman now ah we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and you know it it's funny because I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today uh the babies that are born and that's all about you know demographics\nAre born or outside of wedlock they're they're born outside of a of a marriage um the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture [noise] uh where Seventy five percent of the kids are bought outside of the\nThe uh uh marriage ... it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that though ... whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you affect change\n[noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing\nI think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do it right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh you know you go back forty years\nAnd ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies with the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the to a sex drugs and rock and roll what happened to the ... the boomer hippies\nLive became Republicans\nIn all cases\n\nIn all cases\n[laughter] no not at all cases but you know if if you if you look at [noise] [noise] [noise] that this this is ... let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise]\n[noise] ah [noise] between the ages right now of thirty four and fifty three we have a diminutive puppy a population of of indigenous people that were born here they\nWere there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five an eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million born between forty five and sixty four [noise]\nWhat does that mean that means that that that particular population could not a support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population\nAre superimposed over where the heavy lift or should be ... where would you know our our strength should be in our population it's actually smaller\nSo the net result is a you know ... instead of having a you know ... and they should have haves and have nots with with the cushion in between of generation X we don't because they were never born\nWe're losing that cushion yeah well what we did and as you so you you had people saying that the the United States is is broken because we have had the have nots but\nMiddle age and and I'm In\nA middle income or art occupy exactly the same space so if you're middle ages small and then your middle income as small as well but it's a demographic issue is just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this to be a ... let's use Facebook as an example you know they they've got the billions of people on line or they've got huge amounts of advertising dollars because of what they do socially\nBut I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to do is becoming a change there were I think advertisers you begin to say I'm not sure we're getting the bank for a dollar a year or you were converting these into sales\nBecause the market may not be what we really want what's happening with that\n[noise] a Facebook is kind of strange [noise] entity if you will and I tell folks listen it if you're if you're not paying for it you are not the\nCustomer you're the product um as far as I'm concerned and I and I've got a Twenty one years experience in the marketing industry\nThe Internet are uh advertising is a bottomless pit you have no idea what your pie none and there's no way to a reference any kind of success except return on investment so you you spend money on the Internet\nAnd and you just cross your fingers and hope that your sales go up your sales go up you you don't know if it's if it's a relative to how much money you spend on the Internet but uh what what's happening with a a ... a enterprise there is is not good it really isn't\nI mean it's huge but there's a trend here and to me the trend is very negative\nSo that it is it well in ... with negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally disingenuous I I don't trust 'em or Facebook at all I I really don't I don't think I I think you have to understand George that everything that anybody writes on on Facebook can\nBe analyzed and then the ... and and that analysis put people into categories and those categories uh our sellable and and what the secretary does with that information is sell it to anybody who pay for it\nSo there there's there's there's no security and anything that you put on Facebook nothing\nAnd well what about you know some of these wacky jobs you know the idiot that killed eleven people in the Jewish synagogues ... the guy who sends out these bombs these pipe bombs they use social media to kind of ... their hatred um how can we can't catch them a little sooner\nYou tell me I I really don't know that Robert ... in a a Caesar salad and they are they are truly whacked jobs and um I don't know that that's that's more um a\nMore understanding of of of a of a psychic graphics and demographics as far as I'm concerned\nKen what's happening in the housing market most younger people aren't buying houses they're renting what's gonna happen\nWhile they're renting because they had a trillion dollars of student\nLoan debt yeah\nYeah but don't worry about it now what we're what we're literally facing with um a kids is is you have eighty seven million kids that are between fourteen and thirty three years old the kids are finally moving out of their parents' basements are throwing loyal as trophies they don't deserve\nAnd and that they're starting households and getting married you know starting a household is you know could be an apartment
