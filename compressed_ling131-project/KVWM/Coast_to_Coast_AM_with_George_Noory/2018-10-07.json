to go with the person that John at each other\n\n\nIt's a\nVery bold so each team now has been hit with an an sportsman like conduct\nTo leave that hurts of course because it takes the ball down now to the Arizona thirty to kill and its first shouted yeah we'll go rank already just about the edge of it\nYou know that's the only place\nAfter the fourteen your past play another fifty yard so that since I had to be a twenty nine yard to pick out for the bears don't have to use a time out for years on the thirty seven years we believe receivers\nPlace where fires that has\nCaught up to thirty yard line\nAnd inside the twenty five\nTwenty four goes ... ...\n... yards on the way\nOut of the twenty four Cal going in a hurry here down into\nAway it will take the snap out of a shock and awe and

Jim Malley invitation all this coming November always an exciting event and that\nThe field this year is absolutely stack but we want to mention the surfboard presentation which just took place\nBetween the first and second quarter as this evening and\nIt's really a fascinating tradition a that it's been going on for a couple of years now can you tell us how this tradition came about\nWhere we are trying to teach a treat all of our teams alike and and one of the ways that we do that is we give them all presidents and\nProbably the biggest in the most prized president is the surfboard um each each of us or surf boards in their eight of them they go out\nA all have the injury of each team's name on these boards uh and it has our logo and\nUm what better represents Maui and

that wherever you want it in your trophy case are owned a slice of the your\nFans can all be a appreciative but also proud\nAnd and you mentioned eight of those surfboards going out to eat the individual schools in the field this year's field is unbelievable and Arizona side of the bracket they start with Iowa State there's also ... in Illinois and then on the other side do because they fear Barbara and San Diego state I mean that is just an unbelievable field\nWhere we think so but um you know every every field that we get we feel like who's going to be the best in a certain and this one is no exception I think you can make a case for this being maybe the best deal at least at this time\nBefore uh before we're bounce the ball or made a pass or shot or you you can make a case for all eight teams getting to the finals and even winning the tournament\nAh now obviously ah the opposite is also true one of these teams going to come out of here oh in three ah and if I in Mali

where the a ... kind of control a lot of this book and they had the ball for almost thirty five minutes tonight and ran\nEighteen more places while kids did tonight uh the Arizona defense just kept ... out of the end zone and that's the bottom line I mean you can give up yards a but if\nThe other team doesn't score just what you're in good shape and so the bears tonight at four hundred and Seventy six yards of our fence but came away with just Seventeen points again thanks to the\nA tremendous effort by the Arizona defense in that second half of the turnovers the stop one fourth down twice tonight the wildcat stopped calling on fourth and short of that one uh on fourth in one down at the three obviously will go down as one of the place of the game\nTonight oh yeah amazing stance or they they had to Fordham sense of like that too early in the game or a member of the quarterback fumbled it on the fourth and short so they they've improved in that area I'm In ... and it's a good the timing of it is good because I mean their their their defense is starting to really starting to show up now well\nAgain there on the field for Seventy seven plays tonight yeah that's asking a lot and it says a lot about the condition you know the guys and I just I just thought the energy level that they had a just kept building through that second half and\nLet's be Frank I mean when you're forcing turnovers when you're stopping the opponent or that just brings more energy and even though you're out there and you're probably a little tired\nA guess what when you're playing when your team is playing like that or it just feels good All right let's go down to the locker room a chicken with head coach Kevin some congratulations coach I mean this was a heck of a game in that defense in the second half about as good as you could ask\nThem it's a I think you can tell by my voice right now is it a a there are a lot of things going on here [noise] you know but we can there's a lot of things we can take some confidence from particularly or defense and and\nYou know in ... in games like this there's going to be games were some things aren't working and\nGames like this there's going to be games were some things aren't working and uh you know ... you often says ah you know your job is to score and more points than the other team\nNo matter what the situation is the difference is struggling but you know we struggle outfits and our defense\nCame up in a big way in a you know turnovers is there something that we were we struggle with early in the year and obviously um are are defense is a nice job of not only create turtles big reading points in with the turnovers and that's a difference and\nI I just want to go back to the the second half of the last two games your defense or your two opponents USC and Cal I've had a total of Fifteen possessions offensive possessions and the second half the last two games your defenses forced you know those two games six turnovers\nFive points they stopped the opponents twice on downs and just to scores one by USC won by Cal tonight or I mean\nThe defense who's on the field a lot in the second half yes we're just talking about the fact that their energy level all almost seemed to be picking up even though they were out there so long\nYeah no they are like I said I think are\nThe big deal is is that you can gain confidence from this you know because we've been kind of hit or miss their\nUm and can we put it together and as you said you know we put it together in the last two games and the second half which is encouraging\nA I think you know just a a personnel situation you know losing Tony last week but getting getting him back on the field or paying the getting the rotation with with school or in Tony in band in there\nGet those guys off the field and keeps them a little bit fresh or you know so you know and\nYou know you got guys that are playing actually on defense right now that didn't play the first couple three games you know so it's a different it's a different personnel group um they're they're more experienced players but uh\nCertainly we we don't want to be ... we'd like to play the first half also like that so that you know but uh to their credit again this group\nOr even the games we've lost I don't think anybody can ever said this team has ever quit\nA throne think they can say they say a lot of things we have done everything always right but you know the energy level in the sideline from both from all three phases because it took over three phases you know to win the game\nOr we can talk about a bunch of place but I Do want to go down to the un when Cal had fourth and one down at the Arizona three yard line that stop obviously one of the biggest place of the ballgame any just give us any you have to take us through that at all\nNo I mean we we've talked about it you know the the time out and just to get organized a\nFor what they want to do a offensively again you know we've we've been on a couple of these situations on fourth down or our guys have made the stop 'em and then that's very very difficult you know and in a you know for just a name for\nA recount knew that was going to happen um but\nYou know even though it is another big part of that was even though we didn't drive the link to the field um after that\nTo score ... points on the board we were able to flip the field by by we'll running I'm getting us back to midfield after that situation in because the whole third quarter it became a field position gay\nRe had horrible Phil position they they had great Phil position or defense held up in in uh that that whole series of for their own series and it has to be able to drive the ball the midfield and punished and knock them to change the whole field position the game in the in the late in the during the whole forth\nYou can't get frustrated like that and you definitely can't get him on the fence I mean they're out there working just as hard as we are in our job is to stop them and their job to score so when we feed off each other like that that was when we start pulling away from teams but I mean we're excited to get back out there we didn't want to stay on the field\nYou got a short week now before going up to Utah which is short we're going to be like and what do you feel what do you what is your got till you going forward\nBack to south game um this is a big conference game for us I Believe they beat Washington today which is huge I mean I was there for ... excuse me my bed after which is huge because Stanford has been rolling right now\nBut I'm just going to be at their place as it's going to be a harsh environment expected to be loud but we just got a good players on a defense and get the ball with\nWell

enough refreshing the\nManagers social science\n\nY\n[noise]\n\n\n\nI'd be like your like your latest book is about ghost hockey team and investigating what to look for what to do and also um what it used to be like\nIn the past and what the difference is now I die I found it interesting that you had said to me or that people will go into cemeteries and bell asked to talk to the spirit were years back people would get why why would you want to talk to a stranger\nYou know maybe call upon your family member or somebody you know it's true like I don't\nKnow that was that was that was one of the things that I uh when I was researching my book are investigating goes to I mean that was it's basically a survey of of the scientific attempts to to contact the dead I'm ranging from basically pre history\nA but primarily through the the er you know the Victorian era I put up with today's you know ghost hunters and all that\nAnd what you find is that the the idea that I mean people have been talking to the dead for millennia I mean that's you know there's references in the wake of an indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know you have lead to make bath banquet so there's there's there there there's no shortage of go see in literature in history [noise]\nBut you know typically go were or if it's typically if ... if you want to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you'd be talking to 'em your your your great grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently um and the the idea that somebody would\nGo into like a haunted house where the the Myrtle plantation or a you know clearly house or you know what what have you\nGo to a hundred location\nAnd talk to some random spirit that happened to be there and say\nHi can you give us aside and you don't know me but tell me about yourself that that's that's a that's a relatively new phenomenon um and it's the fact that you you know you go back to look at the the the ... that were held in in the Victorian era of offers upper class\nUh places and they would have you know a lady if they have carpet the key and the and you know they've tried to communicate with the goats and then you had the the spiritual is era [noise]\nUm and you had people like Harry Houdini ... research the Marjorie ... and all these spiritual if the you know came to the states and Kate Maggie Fox and and and they're you know their their stuff and so\nAnd then the hair you price and has researching all that and then you sort of fat for two of the the the ATP idea and you know the economy was phenomenal and the idea that you can record to communicate with ghost\nA cruel quite noise and fruit based on a broken radio that switches channels are and then you fast forward to\nTo the modern day goes contracts with the the TV shows and all the spin offs and ghost inventors and all that and it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of the sorts of things and what sort of techniques have been tried and and you know what works and what doesn't end and how do we know\nYeah I can say that you know it's already kind of creepy Annapolis spooky enough for even scary enough when I did get some sort of interaction when you were going to try to talk to spirit\nYet some sort of interaction when you were going to try to talk to spirit teaches um it's it's scary when you get somebody talking to you but\nPeople take that step further\nAnd they poke in pinch and you don't know who they're poking at ... I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction you don't you don't know if that's going to be somebody nice or not and that these states go home with you you know that's where\nI grew up in a haunted house last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer going sledding or looking up in the sky lights I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um and you talked about exercises and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long it changes like you know folks quick provoking quit provoking you don't know who or what you're talking to\nAnd that's what they're what's that you're not doing yourself and you have over there by ... whatever maybe they're\nRight you don't know what it is that the evil or not evil or what it is at All right I mean\nUm you you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that scientifically\n... there's a couple of things you know one of the first thing you do is um you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes investigations by itself\nUm and as I said I I come to a more science based uh someone's he's skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I just knew everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe any we're you know found as that goes and so\nFor the first thing that I Do when I go into a case is try to establish\nA water the false viable claim that is what exactly is being claimed you know if someone saying that there's there's a mysterious found or laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what what exactly is is is going on there and the question is\nCan we tested repeatable right it is it is the sound that comes up you know every every full moon\nI'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the ghost hunting you see on TV uh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality\nTV and ... the the reality\nYou know in in scare quote um and I and I've been on many of the TV shows as you pointed out I was a sort of them you know on both sides of the camera on this\nAnd you know and my my point of view is always\nYou know I I don't make fun of growth on her 'cause I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do with and do it right you know bring science to uh bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem that I often see\nIs that go centers on TV you and not actually just across the board is is that you know the supplies even you know amateur groups across the country is they typically engage what's called the anomaly hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know ... or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops whatever it is and they're the they're they're sampling the environment looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these reading and walk around we'll try and promote goats and the sort of things and then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them\nThey try and look for anything we all look at this at at three oh eight PM I Am you know we saw this thing and the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate\nThe original claims they're the ... the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are eat to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets ... pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the infrared cameras on and we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part ... part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that\n... that in almost all cases\nThey don't they don't have a good grasp of of of a of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample located so for example you'll see what goes on are going to a location maybe there's a team of them and they'll they'll take readings for three hours or six hours whatever else and then they'll go home and analyze them\nThe problem is that's not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um paranormal or abnormal you need to know what's normal and whatever\nReadings you'll get you're walking around with the detector magnetometer whatever it is what I'm reading as you get over that six hours that there can be normal variation that you want to do this you know only happens once a week or something [noise]\nThis is Benjamin Radford that we're talking we're learning about\nHe is describing investigating guess his theories his thoughts his book and we've got more of that coming up stay with us to go see him celebrating Willis ... [noise]\nOne news radio Katie WN Katie Jay\n\nCoast to coast am kind of you will is here\nWill is wean is what's going on right now and we are talking with then human Radford he also is an investigator mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating dose and it's um\nIt's very interesting book it talks about ah well let's let's bring him back on year then we were talking about uh how you investigating how you first go in it to an area where somebody says there's these things happening\nAnd I want and here's a question that I Want to know is that I I really don't know and a lot of people I don't think they have any clue either but everybody tries to be cool you know\nUm when you look at a picture of photographs\nAnd someone says this is talk and you know some ... there's a lot of really great people out there that they really have things happening and they have great pictures of possibly something\nAnd I love that I mean we all want that but then there are some people out there that want to thank teams so when you do see a picture\nHow do you know what his photo shop what is not photo shop what might just be a glitch ... might be a maybe a light reflecting off or the difference between in orbit and he said gosh how the analyzing\nPhotos tell us about that\nYeah no that's that's a good question and I have to say that that um you know I I've I've probably looked at\nA two or three hundred and photographs or over the years that people have sent me I'm I'm a same with the ... on the on the default recipient of a trip a cup of photos [laughter] usually means the dogs in Texas but I I have to clean up to them afterwards\nAnd I have to say that I've rarely encountered hoaxes um I have on occasion but I Would say probably Seventy to eighty percent of the the the ghost photos of them sent\nOur our ... by sincere people who just photographs something weird and they yeah they're not lying there not a hoax who met not try pulling over on me they're like hey can I flew him they're just like hey this is weird you know can you can you help me figure this out [noise]\nUm and so you know I I go into each case um you know trying to you figure it out and to help them as best I can and so one of the things that I encourage them to do and I I Can't always do this myself because you are I if if someone sends me if a photograph I Can't just drop what I'm doing fly off to you know to Denver\n[laughter] researcher goes photos much why not because I haven't trademark Willis Wayne and gotten real is often [laughter]\nTo split it with me that's all I ask you\nKnow but it's um so so there's a couple of things one of them is that is I went one possible I Try to go to the the location or was filmed and try and figure it out so you mentioned earlier um one case that I'm known for which is the Santa Fe courthouse coast case\nHappened about I don't know maybe ten years or so ago and it was in in Santa Fe New Mexico the capital a which is about an hour north of here and it was a video taken outside of a a courthouse and it was a really strange glowing or the thing that they crossed this is real and camera [noise] um\nAnd it was you know it was it was seen by deputy uh so you know that there's probably [laughter] that would that make that gave them credibility right it's a deputy on the court of\nCameras though the likelihood of this being a hoax was was that dropped off considerably at that point [noise]\nUm but what I ended up doing was ... I went to the story um it was made national news and people are you all this weird thing over\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I ... I went up there and investigators night I went and I went to the courthouse I looked at the camera and I talked with the deputies I interviewed people\nAnd I had some ideas of what might be\nUm and I did some experiments I eventually you solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the video or the photograph and he tried to figure out what or alternative explanations right so I usually I make a list of\nThree four or five different things you know could be could be an insect could be a hoax could be a ghost is there is there something I mean so\nYou just basically any anything that is even remotely possible I Try to lift those and I tried to rank them terms of what most likely which which things can I scientifically test where things can actually you know investigating falsify\n'em and you just basically go down the list and and that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the important uh and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's\nThe photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell they came from but but when possible it's good to try and replicated so ... for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood\nAnd I said you know a ... are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was a sort of image does he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well again it's it would be I could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back and different state but I said\nYou know if you if you do go back there if you were still there go back and tried to replicate it you know take take take the photograph\nAt the same place ideally at the same time a day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might might be might be mistaken for a ... a an image of a face or something\nI see cell and I get that I get that and but you know I guess that did\nThat thing whenever that might be is just there like you said in it might be people might think that uh\nWell I'll give you an example of one of which\nI was gonna say you're one of it is um you know if it's on the one question comes up is the other people see it right and so this is I write is often the case of where\nYou know there's there's an extra for example behind standing behind somebody a and actually I was sent us an example this a couple of months back and they said oh this is the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there's this sort of weird goes the image\nOr just behind her to the left\nUm you what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of ... you know it's hard to be conclusive about it without more information but I noticed that no one else around them notice\nArt to be conclusive about it without more information but I noticed that no one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who are you or nearby and no one is looking at this you know strange image to the left and so that suggests that that they probably didn't feed the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI got ya got ya hey you know it's it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see with the eye and some things are picked up from a certain angle and not another angle um that means just\nYou know there's some things that are seen that it just is\nThe way the shadow is and just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked out that that's I mean it just looks like there's no way it could be anything else but something creepy or you know worthy of\nA shame that this place was hunting for sure you talk about uh goes hunting equipment to men has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work\nAnd and by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking to measure that that we can't measure right now it's all a new science you know\nWell yeah I mean you know one of the interesting aspects of ghost investigation is um is the uh you know of of for example I was I was doing a TV show called the mystery quest a while back and I was there with them goes hunters and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and\nAnd they they brought in all this all these are the ghost of the equipment and just you know there's cameras and ... there's always like you know probably Seventy thousand dollars for the gear\nAnd it was all set up when the cameras and lights and I are all that sort of thing and and I talked to one of the guys who brought all his stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera I mean I ... this wasn't like a gotcha moment we're just hanging out we were finished shooting or going back to hotel is it I said why do you think\nWhy do you think it is that we don't we still have good quality evidence of goes\nUh I mean even to this day and again this is you know six seven years ago said you know even the the evidence of him getting a better it's all these blurry or of and this and that and he said well I think that I think the problem the basic problem is that ... that we don't have the technology to does that ghost and said\nYeah but if that's true if you believe that then why why did you threaten you bring in Seventy thousand dollars was a\nMan yesterday and\nI said I got to be mean here but it's like you're on one hand you're telling me that that oh well we can't really detect goes with all the gear well then why do you have all this gear and he he didn't really have an answer so you know one thing to keep in mind here is that is that is that you know if girls can be seen with the with the naked eye\nFor [noise]\nSworn in volume

the night with two friends that dumb this wall before\nThat it took about an hour and a half and at some point during the journey back he said it was about ten states I Believe [noise] uh if I Know

so concentrated\nAmount to the activity happening it I don't think it is quite unique I think places like they say exist all over the world Oh yes yes\nProbably fortunate corny but you know I'm fifty five years old so some people will be working you know in the day job quite a bit longer than that and I'm I'm fortunate that I I'm Still you know to to devote\nImmerse myself in the twenty four seven and that's what I'm doing so probably on highlighting these things I'm not embellish in them or ... you know that I'm probably bringing all this stuff out because the people of the local village is you know them to them from the ...\nThe ... the secular the very very secretive type people not by people keep themselves to the so\nYou know when the animals will be ... to ...\nKeep themselves to the cells you know when the animals will be ... two months and months and months before it anybody said anything never made the local papers the police are aware of it was over safety shape being killed now as well as their about just and I thought boy says we just discussed [noise]\nYou know ... they didn't want to say anything they they just wanted to keep it to the shows the finer unfortunate family those livestock ... is affected by in this particular area\nOr said he's got to do because it just couldn't afford not to for insurance purposes you know the place of being there with night show the night cameras or you know trying to find out what's responsible\nAnd another one is being done during the night\nAnd they've seen nothing the he's once again it's it's an incredible area of the states with salt to ancient earth works\nIn the desert there always seems to be a link to these ancient to areas not like I said previously the ancient people they knew about these places they might not have understood them any more than we understand them I mean I don't profess to understand them grown able\nI think they place the their places of reverence on these loans because he knew he was special\nAnd they talked about it you know they talked about it where our generations now are like oh don't talk about how to keep it quiet they talked about it back then they named the areas\nAs soon as you would know what that area was when you're walking into like that I I like that I Want to know it you know it's scary hill that I'm going on or something I think a location need to be named for what they are [laughter]\nAnd and then you know you're getting yourself into I don't like when names were changed so that they you know there's no recognition of that area you know maybe they you ... you somebody wants to sell real estate there or something like that you know I I Want to know what I'm getting into but you know some of the things that you talked about is\nYou know when you mentioned the werewolf gunman in big but\nI ... that they never went toward the people you know as prey um they were kind of mine in their own business doing their own kind of things and stories um\nAnd I got\nA study on it that they did like creating fear I think they like the I think\nThen there's this there's a there's a there's a sinister type of intelligence to

going to have been going to go to the beach and like that's really cool are you there was a monster there so I'm Wondering over there you know people taking photos\nAnd so that that that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and Africa and elsewhere or you know I I happen to be there anyway and so I turned into investigation one I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean it just is\nWhat it is you just can't help but it's it's in your blood and that's what you do you you would if you were at that beach hanging out there with them you would just be you're just dying\nI flew to eat I mean I can relax a little bit that despite you know just by one of my friends will tell you I can relax I can show but you know I'll give you one quick example I was in Newfoundland uh about ten years ago\nAnd I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking icebergs and part of the reason that I went there was because uh there's been a series of lobsters are the that have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are they washed up there but uh so I wanted to go investigate some of that and there's also Spring Hill jak citing up there but as I was up there I came across um of political weight crushed and\nUm and it's this little you know ... it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake month there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot\nA metal sculpture thing this thing as you enter the town in the town of the population is like three or four or something\n[laughter] I went to the car I'm like I put on the break but I got a [noise] I I Can't pass a lake monster come on site and you know my friend rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\n[laughter] well it's better than stopping for the biggest you know world's biggest a ball of yarn or something like that right that's right I'm with you [laughter] that's great stuff okay so\nI'm I'm before I go on you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween so I I Google that bone found your article that you've written 'cause you you do a lot of writing your author of course\nBut you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too\nBut I saw this great article from you and I was like oh my gosh here's the guy you know and ... looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody who was writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so\nSo tell me about the origins now we're ... we're just now learning the origins of Willis wean the jealousy origins of the Halloween\nSee this or that I I I Want the two hundred years from now when people are researching or will when they're going to come up with this conversation [laughter] I Love it my grandkids will be be all over it will be like that\n[laughter] I Know you're one of the things I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not big on the on the holidays meaning of Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamental is the the the conservative from them to get all touchy about that 'cause they think it's really to the cold which not but it's it's what it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into and that's where I really love\nIf it was basically something that everybody can sort of jump into and that's why I really love Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy as a fascinating history I'm\nBasically Halloween a ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of folk work these events and holidays there's not just one street lined back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime\nBut basically increase it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic or deal with festival called a so when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much of a French about just because it was that it was so long ago and there's no the film ... records or pre sparking fragmentary\nBut it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest\nAnd it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the solstice ... and at the time when I'm you know the the snow's falling in you know plants are dying um so it had this connection to uh to darkness\nBut it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we ... we think we think of the darkness as being you know something faster but to them it was very it was more carbon an analyst point of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons\nUm and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so it wasn't scary it was like yes there was a time to you know to store it rains and to give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this and that [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the um uh the the the separation between the world with especially thin porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry boat or what have you there in their own world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day\nThe the the uh the barrier between them becomes more porous\nUm and so this is why uh the the began talking about how\nSpirits would or would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to uh see spirits and they were basically all around us and it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world's were porous\nUm you know the barrier between them but also um ... leader incarnations of Halloween it was also that uh time is porous\nAnd so what you find is that a whole would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when I Would be for a time for prophecy\nSo it was this notion that uh you know there's our world and that there are there other worlds but it's also the barrier between the present in our future\nAnd so uh for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different customs that were there were involved Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them but there were ideas for example that the that are on for example woman born a Halloween would be able to tell the future\nUm and they would be the prophecy and oftentimes the prophecy a was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was often times there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would uh be with a light a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look look in the mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection [noise]\nUm and so all these sorts of another one example was a bombing for Apple you know if you're not new the apple bobbing and there was there was a particular Halloween tradition that if you cut a pie if you kill them apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he tossed it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband\nSo there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and past and present coming together\nOn my way may I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] I Do it you know the midnight right\nOn willfully night\nThat's right will swing [laughter]\nWell what about um you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know 'cause I I get there are people that say Halloween a saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um you know I always see it is fun I see it as a I\nI mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think this fall whether I think an orange and black collars yeah I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which isn't the goblins and they're very fun fun thing that's how I see it\nAnd it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it and the traditions out of that and and uh I I don't know I just wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're going to have to take a break here but what we have is Dan rapper with us\nHe is an investigator and and into all the things that were into a as ... folks here that want to learn everything um but he also you know there's a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also\nGoes hunting too so stay with this kind of well let's hear it's will is we don't know what you might hear [noise]\n\nAh television shows around that time in Halloween and that where the sun was a little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the great I'm In and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires ... Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like it sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kinda\nSuperman or something like that they can do that anytime of the year\n... detainee creativity to go to target and put on you know a Batman mask can we make make some of them out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do up you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love it all\nAbsolutely you know I mean that's that's one of the you know that that's really what's associates course these days um although your Halloween was never really mainly a children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty before that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids it\nWasn't kid centered as it is today a it was it more of a community thing again sort of if you go back to go back to solve when and the the the early a Celtic version of it which were very antagonistic and and again sort of dealing with the changing of the season and darkness in snow and all that\nUm but you know so you you had that and then that sort of what happened was that um that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know obviously the next day which was a to honor that the church a church every week to gone to heaven\nAnd then also got wrapped up to a whole whole day which is November second which bills are wrong for the full purgatory\nAnd so there was this there were it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan\nI'm a you know ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that and then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with all things in a whole day\nAnd and again they were bringing a bells and sometimes the Dover wrong to keep away or demons and scary things could loud noise for such a scare away the evil [noise]\nUm and that sort of transform a little later on into the modern costumes because what what happened is\nI'm a you know could we are talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that uh it believe that a drink so I went to drew leaders would wear animal skins\nI'm there and sometimes animal heads like antlers whatnot during the ceremonies and they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm but then later on during the late Eighteen hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food\nUm to the poor during Halloween praying for the dead\nAnd this again the ties back into all hold to it because the idea was that um that on that day or the soul of the word purgatory you know they were they were basically trapped between heaven and hell the needs to be prayer prayed for\nA and so the the wealthy members of the communities would basically a higher out there were ... they were subcontract prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called ... which type of bread\nAnd in return for paying are preparing for the purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs rituals are going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food or or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn up\nA course that would lead or translate into a [laughter] the the the uh the public and I'm looking at a candle Atlanta the candle in it and the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for\nThe idea was that they would these members go out to house so you know yes will prefer if you have a member of your family who's a who's passed on um new with you know holding up this this turn up with a candle to think of this late as the sole which wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the turn of sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you asked me to read that one that's when the pumpkins came in because the pumpkins associate course they're they're bigger they're if they're more fun to carve and their associate with the harvest and that that sort of how the the trick or treating ethic came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn it's now move on [laughter] ... says Munch on with little olive oil salt and pepper um so where do you think candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in is that like right after the fifties like you were talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean if it was interesting because because again the sort of the things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because for what happened is that if you think about it you know again there was the the mom and going on this and that\nAnd then uh the the during this time or the the jitters had pretty strict social and so\nUm and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween was a time when when young girls would would ah would pining away and with full you think of you know who which which cute boy they were married in the next town over who probably had three or four of the time knows\nBecause that's what they did um but you know that that's what they were doing so so while 'cause if you think about like\nDuring this time this is when people would go from house to house in the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nOr you would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era so if that was typically sort of a young men you know you Mr this young man's project and the the girls and women would tend to be more indoors and that's where you\nMr this young man's project and the the the girls and women were tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the prophecy in those those sorts of things so so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they weren't\nPeople we're no longer you know going from house to house asking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold and purgatory [laughter] that's it that's a little that's a little a lot
