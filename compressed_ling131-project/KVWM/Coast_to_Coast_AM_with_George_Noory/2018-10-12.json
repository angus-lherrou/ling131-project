S. like there is in Puerto Rico now and that is one difference\nThese Puerto Ricans are not um don't have that sort of tension and that polarity that's the one thing I can tell you because I'm sitting here and I haven't even seen a bar fight there the last any crime where where I Am\nHere is the fact that the Hispanics in most African Americans are voting democratic big deal ... what what was his point\nWell he well he's saying that that you know the the rich people don't like that these are people are going to vote blue and we got this blue red war so when they see Puerto Ricans he's saying come to Rochester well we don't like it but he said they're not as high skilled while I'm telling ya in Orlando they're not saying that they're they are basically\nA reinvigorated Orlando there's four ... four hundred and fifty thousand Puerto Ricans now in just Orlando in a million\nIn Florida and those million which which she is right about or tilting the boat all all the key Senate races up and guess who they're appealing to\nThose Puerto Ricans the Republicans and the Democrats Rick Scott and Bill Nelson running for Senate in their boat courting the Puerto Ricans 'cause they're five percent of the vote and that's enough to swing an election and they do and\nUsing that went on democratic ... isn't that what our democracy ...\nYes it is it is\nLet's go to Greg in New Jersey taken away Gregory\nRight yes my question George and good morning I like to say I live in a congressional districts in northern New Jersey\nWe get thirty percent of our federal tax dollars back the blue states subsidized the red states and the and the state that receives the most was Kentucky with an idiot McConnell was I'm a destroys me nuts if the market for fifty years we subsidize the south in the southwest the northeast us until the mid west\nAnd I was ... um for your guest\nI've been reading Financial Times for many years and what you're saying it's was a column every week scaring the heck out of all of us with with what you're saying\n... will be closer to home I'm about four years from retirement if it were thirty five years almost forty years\nBar entity which is nationwide but some through New York\nOr pension was over funded in the late nineties it took a horrendous hit with the ... the tech stocks and then two thousand they almost obliterated like yeah we have a meeting of thousands of is about to retire right all high tech guys and gals the whole thing\nWe have a meeting in about three weeks that are into the\n... and I don't trust in the body on Wall street I think there should be a ... year teen set up there if you will again and I'm pregnant rose bushes should come from heaven and come back\nBut the thing is what we ask our financial people who are running our pension fund with their fancy suits what are they doing to dissipate this problem and I'll take your answer off the air\nYeah you know real quick they these two problems not only the stock market starts collapsing everybody's been driven end of the stock market because quantitative easing monetary policy's push down long term\nMarket because quantitative easing monetary policy's push down long term rate that you can get on safer investments like treasury bonds and corporate bonds and things like that which pension plan should be more and but\nBut you can't get your seven to eight percent returns they used to get with a conservative combination of stocks and bonds so everybody's gone more stocks stock start collapsing\nThan they are in trouble the truth is as much as it's counterintuitive a pension plan today the best thing you can do what we're telling people right now this this break up and ... is going to make bonds\nOr corporate bonds and treasury bonds long term more attractive if that thirty year treasury bond goes up to four point three percent we're telling our subscribers this is likely to happen in the next several months for the next year at the most\nYou're going to want to lock those and not only to get a four point three percent return on his way better than almost any stock dividend but those bonds will appreciate\nWhen stocks collapse and the economy slows down an interest rates go down bonds like falling interest rates so right now is not the time to buy these bonds but there's going to be a huge opportunity for investors\nAnd pension funds to locked in quality bond it's only the quality bonds that did well in the great depression AAA corporate\nTen and thirty year treasury bonds lock in those things for appreciation and for higher yields and don't be in stocks the worst place to be for pension plan is to do what everybody's that run into stocks and collapse and you also write about blue states subsidizing read\nWhy I think this time around it's going to be the blue states that succeed against red policies that they don't agree with but most of all they're like okay see what happens to your red economy when New York and California when the northeast and the west coast succeed from the union it it would it would be a problem\nLet's go to Thomas in ... California Hey Tom go ahead\nHey George thank you for taking my call sir Harry your research is really appreciate it um [noise] I mean you know you brought up earlier that a corollary to depressions and major recessions\nIs war and\nYou could argue that the world today than\nA third world war that's a proxy war you know in places like Syria Yemen the south China Sea et cetera and one global corporations cannot compromise\nTheir differences in the global boardrooms\nThere's a shooting war just like World War one world war two Korea\nVietnam and on and on so don't you think I mean a limited nuclear exchange could turn the tide of states into a third world\nCountry in a day or two you know with a lecturer magnetic both cetera what is the probability of a shooting war\nYou know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan\nI'm ... but what we're saying and zero hour we we trade global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge in the world war one people don't realize globalization global trade collapse sixty percent\nBetween World War one and World War two with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising terrorists just like we're seeing now everything's happening like happening this works it it it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole everybody loses or at least most countries lose\nAnd and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether it ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea they can definitely be stuck there there's no question there's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because\nNobody's big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have is there's there is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one somebody hit us they would be dead long before we would so I think that\nKind of a good thing we're in in the early Nineteen hundreds me Nineteen hundreds no there were major countervailing power that's how you could have World War two but we're going to definitely have\nA political huge political views this trade war we said in zero hour before this became of it this is going to last\nTwo to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and there there could be some physical or but there's certainly\nGoing to be huge a political and trade wars and things\nLike ... and Harry with us for coming back from final phone calls with you in just a moment on coast to coast they\nGet Daily Show up the right to your inbox group ... with the ... new newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com [noise]\n\nSelling custom lines on the Internet in two thousand ten lines ... dot com was born I not only guarantee you love our blind I offer a bitter free guarantee meaning if you're blind don't fit for any reason oh remake them free of charge you only pay shipping\nAnd that kind of has made it even easier checkout lines can you know two of sailors shades ... first and only shades installed without screws or tools 'cause because listeners take up to fifty percent off any learn here just use the coast and check out that's Blinder dot com lines\nT.

colds here here we thank you again for the amazing information you always give us\nYup love to reach people George because people need to hear this\nJason in Portland, Oregon welcome to the program Jay ... go ahead\nYeah Harry I Want to ask you about a particular sector of the market is the new secular and has to do with the ...\nAnd I happened to it in mid July just before the huge and in the canopy gross but the average company which happened to be pretty good timing and I took a portfolio and actually doubled in value\nOn the ... fifty thousand up two hundred thousand portfolio but my question is would you um with this kind of be offered a little bit particularly and feel the uh election this November because there are several states that are looking you or that outlet on the ballot\nAnd if they legalize usually when that happens there is a kind of an upcoming or would you pull out of that are now because of this age of uh what you're talking about taking place\nOr you know yeah that's a good question because I mean first of all this is a long term trend and even block chain and crypto currency is our but all of these industries above all these these are hot sector like this will get hit strongly\nWhen we have a downturn because first of all everything gets hit but that the strongest sectors get hit the most 'cause they bubble up the most and people don't understand that same with high in real estate is the best places are going to crash the most in history has shown that so\nYou do that I mean I I Would say in this case you may want to hold on just to the election and see if there's a pop but yes I Do think center in such a hot sector take your games see what happens in the next few\nYears especially the next year is going to be critical and then yeah things crash that is a good sector to get back into this\nIs a long term social political Trent it's gonna go in that direction although there may be some backlash and the downturn just because people get a little more conservative for a while but but you are in a good sector but yes I I don't want to be an actor\nWhen it when things crash and and and that's what a lot of people and there's a lot of people say well this sector will do All right because I went and the great depression than tire thirties and look for one any major sector toilet paper um utilities movies you know boos you know things that people would maybe use more in a downturn\nAnd and because of that collapse and valuations and that fear factor everything went down I couldn't find anything any major stock sector that made money in the Nineteen thirties only the high quality bonds that so yeah take your games yeah\nAgain in your case I might just see these elections pop and then then go the other way or do fifty fifty you know it it's up to you but there is danger there you're right about that\nPeriod when they when the bottom falls out hunting you know was hit the bottom oh you ... how do you know when the pop back in\nWhat will again I mean we have clear we look at past corrections I mean everything is different this is not\nYou know the eighty two thousand eight to nine correct and it's not like the seventies correction stock corrections back then were fifty percent\nThat's more typical this is more like these great resets\n... de leveraging of a bubble debt and financial assets which of course stock is are the leading ones when that happens Seventy percent is kind of the minimum you look for in up to eighty and in in the Nineteen twenty nine crashed eighty nine percent for the ... eighty nine percent so\nI'm looking for levels like that I think my range is Seventy five percent minimum up to eighty five percent that's when you start looking to buy and again we have the same thing on the flip side for bonds right now if that thirty year treasury bond which is a been a three point four percent recently if\nThat gets up to over four percent between four and four point three percent that's when I started by even though that's the best thing in the downturn it's\nToo early to buy that right now if you're going to park you might just be unsafe\nShort term bonds and CDs and T bills and stopped to preserve your money next step is moving to the long term quality bonds and then\nAnd and and he sectors I mean commodities while in emerging markets overseas will probably bottom first and then developed countries stocks and then real estate so there'll be a succession of buying opportunities\nSo I mean and stuff like that you're in a good market like like like like a marijuana pot industry especially the medicinal side which is a slam dunk winter long term [noise] wait for the guy you may get to buy into that a little earlier than something like you know home builders\n... put do good Kentucky first time caller for cello Alan\nHey George a lot of the show you Sacramento correct me if I'm Around here but red states are Republican yup okay ... Democrats were Democrats or make then\nDid you not say earner or did I miss I understand you've met you said the fabulous read during the\nCivil war\nThey they would have been they would have been more even though you know they called Lincoln a Republican back then the Republican Party was not the same I Know my father help build the Republican Party in the south and help get Nixon elected through southern voters\nAnd that's a whole different part of your head to convince a lot of democratic politicians and senators that they were really Republican they were Democrats traditionally all the way back to the civil war so\n... the Republican democratic label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean read is Republican blue is Democrat in the present time frame and then the Republicans in charge now\nIf you do see a major downturn I Am just have to tell you from history it is going to favor the Democratic party just like it did in the thirties where you had Republicans who were coming into that when things crash they go to the people that are going to hand out money to the people that the you know the Democratic go to the Democrats\nIn a downturn in a boy in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation\nA downturn in a boy in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation that favors the Republicans we are\nOur long term research shows we are going to switch from Republican era here to a democratic one for a number of decades and that's just something you know the blue people are gonna like that the rich people won't but all I Do is report the facts I'm I'm not\nPart is and in my work Republicans are always going to be here Democrats if it's a play of opposites that's just as important as men and women and booms and busts and inflation and deflation and every other play of opposite\nAnd it goes back and forth the same thing the west has dominated the world uh since since uh the industrial revolution well guess who's going to dominate in the coming decades and even century it's going to be the east\nAnd that's another trend we can clearly show through cycles so so what we do\nIs just show people here's the trends this sector that sector inflation deflation\nThis country that country blue red I mean we can do all this stuff the long term it's surprisingly predictable\nAnd that's where Congress get it wrong comments think the short term predictable I'm guessing when I tell you I think this thing's gonna top now or so many months from now I'm making an educated guess that may make me sixty to Seventy percent right but never a hundred when I tell told people Twenty years ago baby boomers are going to peak in two thousand seven\nIn the economy was going to slow down and his ears that was not a gas that science of when people predict money just as accurate it wasn't life insurance actuaries will tell people when they die collectively\n... let's go to Gordon them Lakeland, Florida and the wild card line in born in by the way next next week we're doing a show on student loans\nOh wow what a coincidence now any yet\nUh George and Harry thanks for taking my call traditional I'm greedy or intro\nNow first off I'm rolling conservative if you put in if you ask you Bill who's this Gordon over in Lakeland, Florida that last for three decision on the ... thing I I did better than Jeb Bush it'll find me it'll tell you my last name I'm not going to tell them to you I'm pro gun a pro gun rights I'm fiscally conservative\nSo when I say that they both ... than a liberal Democrat and the Republicans have tax students to death\nOr with college tuition and not done anything both parties are bad and voters in both parties don't want to be over tax tuition is a form of tax money go into an arm and the government both political or both Democrat and Republican voters wanting to get back in a minute ride\nAnd they they don't lack abortion although one is more favorable so I have a question for you\n\n\nWhen you reach the sea jak ally and Fox News tropical storm Michael now offshore from Norfolk, Virginia boxes it reached the ocean water as it re strengths

on the ceiling may looking at my body and bad I had stayed home from school I never miss school but I had a fever that day and I didn't go to my mother said\nUh George you don't go stay in bed and I I took a nap and I woke up again in this time I was looking down at myself I thought it was a dream man what a at that point it's lamb ... back into my body\nI woke up I was jarred a I'm a loving years old I don't know what the heck happened to me now but eventually I got my way into a library you know weeks later\nShe stumbled into the um psyche grown section I guess and found a book on astral projection and sure enough I said that's what happened to me but I've not been able to do it since at least in my awake moments\nWell in my case also with the ... it was completely spontaneous I wasn't trying to do it I didn't know anything about it um I just like you I just found myself voting on the ceiling letting down at my body and dead\nBut you know there there are ways to produce and out of body experience how there was a neurologist in Montreal Dr Robert Penn field was able to his mapping out the different areas of the brain and he if he put on to co stimulation on the right tempo car taxes able to produce and out of body experience [noise]\nThat that doesn't tell me the out of body experience originates in the bay and that tells me that the that ... will protests the out of body experience\nUm and you know the types of out of out of body fences we had was quite straightforward\nUm they weren't complicated but some people as you say it can be called astral projection around novel people can leave not just their their body but they can leave the room they can leave their house you know they can actually traveled to different locations\nAbsolutely now do you find that to the people who tend to have these kinds of experiences are believers in the paranormal or not [noise]\nI'd say no not at not at not initially because when this happened to me I certainly wasn't a belief or I didn't even know such a thing as possible and I've just kind of learned about the paranormal as I go along and as I have these experiences\nHave another strange experience I had when I was a student um when I was Nineteen years old and has the second year medical student ... examined the night before the exam\nAnd when I went to the exam the next day the first question on the exam at the same as the first question in my dream\n... you have the answer that you knew\nExactly so I felt like that dream helped me past my exam but I didn't tell anyone about it because it seems so unbelievable in fact if someone had told me that story I probably wouldn't have believed that\nThe name of the book is called the borders of normal with the subtitle a clinical psychiatrist you by the way de stigmatize has paranormal phenomena tell me about the book\nWell one of the reasons I wrote this book has you know as I say in the subtitle I'm trying to de stigmatize paranormal phenomena because what I found and this is my own experiences well when people have these experiences they tend not to talk about them because they think people are gonna think they're weird or their strange for there's something wrong\nTalk about them because they think people are gonna think they're weird or their strange for there's something wrong with them or they're losing their mind something like that but\nI'm trying to say that a lot of people have these experiences it's quite normal to have these experiences\nI mentioned that the word paranormal for example the ... para I mean beside so we have paralegals where it can be fed lawyers have paramedics Paralympics and so on the parent normal I mean beside normally doesn't mean abnormal\nAnd there is still to this day a lot of stigma attached to talking about these phenomena and I find when I give her reading or if I give a talk somewhere people come up to me afterwards and share with me things that have happened to them which they've never told\nAnyone so I'm trying to make it more acceptable for people to talk about these things and that was really what motivated me to read but\nDid you ever come across research from a psychiatrist who has died named Dr shift ...\nNo I'm not familiar with that she or her oh her in a it\nWas my aunt and she she went to a Oxford University and she got her degree in psychiatry yet and specialized in all kinds of things and then decided she was given all that up to study telepathy\nAnd when that's all she did she wrote a couple of books when was called breakthrough the creativity of but she was convinced\nTotally convinced that Aleppo the was the real deal and and again the psychiatrist seen that and so you're the only only other psychiatrist I Know that has really jumped into this\n[noise] oh well I'd like to look for that ... that sounds very interesting I'm breakthrough to creativity I'm definitely gonna look for it but\nYou know they're in on books written by physicians about near death experiences for example even Alexander ... who's having yeah and his nearest surgeon\nAnd marry the Neal she goes to heaven and back to the north of ... of course Oliver Sacks he's in there are just to go to the cause of this nation so physicians have written about these things but I haven't found another for ... who's written about paranormal\nYeah you're going to enjoy the meat you know she just did the the devoted her entire career to that uh she uh she passed away in a very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in radio\nFell than there oh no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show her no that's terrible it was just ... or ... how did you get them interested in a lot of the\nShe just always was and there were some things that had happened to her and she just decided to do something to this and she's going to study it and she she went into it in a big way\nWell that's good but I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my ... medical center in New York\nWhere they were studying deemed to let the the\nThe ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had Sanders and receivers\nAnd BBC rates were in a sleep lab\nAnd they were hooked up to an e G for um the AG could measure what we call Graham sleep rapid eye movement and then once the ... gene state\nThe Centers for giving random images and they were told to concentrate on those images and try to send them to be the face and they found that people were more susceptible to ... to ... the when they're asleep and it's also true that people are more susceptible to a lot of the when they're under hypnosis\nSo there are ways to augment leprosy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the ... more Dr mini majors with us his book the borders of normal [noise]\nGo students ... the new version of the coast to coast am apple is\nNow available for I don't know Android for not only listen live on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n[noise] that's a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased fender relatives\nUm that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he thought his late sister he mentioned oh they don't you mentioned her name she's out in the hall and there was one study that was done in a hospice\nWith dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm someone who's coming to take them and they called they didn't call them vision they called them visitors\nThem and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors and as they got closer to death is visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these visions weren't disturbing at all they were very comforting\n[noise]\nSo yeah I think those those deathbed vision to a very common now one interesting thing about death bed visions is that sometimes there are shared by people at the bedside there was one case of a woman in India who is dying and\nShe says someone a deceased relative who came to take her to the other side and her three sisters who were at the bedside also saw the same person\nYou know that's unusual isn't it\nIt's unusual but there's been several cases like that three of in some cases where the medical personnel at the bedside side of the same vision that the dying patients saw\n[noise] and that's interesting because you know people who have deathbed visions the skeptics would say well that's because they're on medication or because they're confused or because they have a shortage of oxygen is the lack of oxygen to the brain they tried to give some kind of physical explanation for it\nBut it's visions are shared than those explanations wouldn't be valid because the people at the bedside wouldn't have a shortage of auction their brains and they weren't on medication so um it's hard to know how to explain that\nAnd there again the people who have these visions aren't necessarily believers in the afterlife but these experiences are quite common\nWhen Steve and Steve Jobs from apple computer died many you know that he was quoted as saying\nOh wow wow right now what\nDo you think he's he was making reference to\n[noise] well I Know some people who are dying tell their relatives they see a beautiful landscape a beautiful vision you know\nI'm a bright white light you know a spiritual beings you know I'm a feeling of unconditional love you know these are some of the things that I imagine that Steve Jobs is experiencing\nYeah that could be that could be no skeptics of course say what the you mentioned that you know it's the body itself is doing all these weird things near the moment of doubt\nHow can we argue against that\nWell there was one study of um cardiac patients who had been assassinated after cardiac arrest\nAnd this study was done by a cardiologist\nAnd he said of of the the patients who who died in ... Eighteen percent of them have in your report in the near death experience but if that experience is due to a lack of oxygen to the brain than they would've all headed because they all had a lack of oxygen the brain not just a ... a small percentage [noise]\nSo you know that's one thing but then the other thing is that um these experiences are reported around the world not just in the U.S there's a lot of cross cultural studies that show that these experiences are in many different countries and they'd be getting reported throughout time\nAnd one study looked at patients who are on medication versus patients who weren't on medication and the patients who weren't on medication who weren't confused and who didn't have a shortage boxed into the brain had the same experiences and were able to report them just as often as the other patients so [noise]\nUm people are skeptical I think for a good reason and I think it's good to be skeptical\nBut it's also good to keep an open mind\nWell that's that's true in ... you you've talked about under deathbed visions that they sometimes see a little bit more than just a family member they see other kinds of visitors as well explain that\nWell the other visitors aside from family members they could be someone that they were very close to or sometimes they report angels coming to the others I'm coming to take them to the other side\nUm especially with children and there was a pediatrician melting Martha Stewart is dying children and he said the dying children didn't report deceased relatives because their parents and their relatives and friends are all still living\nBut they've reported the angels that we're having to take them to the other side I had an experience at my father's funeral where I thought to angel is one of the other side of the coughing\nDid anybody else you\nKnow so I could say I know they were a part of my own grain no one else saw them but in my own mind I saw those angels and they were just as clear as day standing right in front of me\nAnd I had the idea that thought came into my mind that they were called minutes during angels and they had the idea that they were minister and my father to help them make the transition to the next level of the next world\nAnd they were the most beautiful creatures and I didn't know what to make that that\nThat's really when I decided I Need to start telling people about what's going on because\nWas too much for me to keep to myself\nDid they see you\nI don't think so oh okay I don't think there were there for me I think they were there for my father\nRight so they didn't acknowledge you know even though you saw them\n... the fate [noise] now the other thing is when you say in terms of deathbed visions you know um if they were produced by certain chemicals\nThan my with the um visitors only ... the people who are deceased why wouldn't they be other people as well the other thing is sometimes these\nVisions of these people they're the person who is dying doesn't know that there may be a a brother or sister who had died is the case where there was a car crash and ... uh one brother died and the other brother was near death so that the brother that was near death\nHad the vision of his dead but it but he hasn't been told that his brother had died in the same accident he didn't know that there was that and there are other cases like that to where the the deathbed visitors the person who is dying didn't know that that person was actually that thing because the family wanted to spare them the knowledge\nPre cognitive dreams give us your thoughts on what they are\nWell there again I've had the cognitive beams I mentioned one above the they're very powerful\nAbove yeah exactly they're very powerful and the question is how do we know if it is a pre cognitive team or if it's an anxiety dream because often and you know when people are sleeping during the teams they try to protest things that happened during the day or things that they're worried about\nSo you know for example I talk about Abraham Lincoln two weeks before he was assassinated he he had a dream that he was murdered now we could say that that was a peak cognitive team that we could also say that could have been an anxiety dream maybe he was worried that someone was going to kill him\nMaybe I think you also had a dream where he was in the White House and he walked up to a soldier who is standing by ... and it was him in the casket\nI heard of that too yeah yeah so that could have been a ... but in other famous person who\nReported a peacock interview with Charles Dickens\nReally I didn't hear that\n'cause when he would put out a new book you travel around the small towns and villages and he'd give readings and so on so one night before he was given\nAnd villages and he'd give readings and so on so one night before he was to give her reading into a new town where he'd never been before he had a dream that\nIn a group of people came up to them after his reading and a young woman in red shah introduced himself\nHer with four words she said I Am miss Napier so when he woke up he thought that was very strange she didn't know anyone by that name but he remarked that the dream was very vivid and pre cognitive dreams tend to be very vivid\nI'm often when we wake up in the morning I beams start to fade the pre cognitive dreams stay with us and we remember every detail\nSo the next day he went to give us reading and sure enough after the meeting a group of people came up to him and there was a young woman wearing a red shah and she was introduced to him as Mick Napier so so this stream was a pretty cognitive dream and he didn't know what to think of it\nOr how to explain it but he he ... he had that the cognitive dream so I'm ... and some people for example Larry ... a person has written about\nYes ... cognitive beans and he's written about when should we pay attention to a dream how do we know if it's a peacock into team or not and he said we should pay attention to dreams first of all the misery current or if it's especially vivid or if it involves death\nI heard of a case recently where um this woman told her husband ... that she dreamt that she and her children died in a terrorist attack and this is\nA number of years ago there was um [noise] I don't know if you've heard of it there was a air India\nDisaster ... there was a terrorist attack aboard an air India flight from candidates Vancouver and this woman was going from Vancouver to visit her family in India and she was going with has been children but then the husband decided he had some work to do in Vancouver he's they'd be hiding behind and he was going to meet her there\n\n\nI'm\nLike oh head south or see now the cleanup of

that just overwhelmed you that you did not expect that you came across when you were researching it and put it together\nBut I think the most interesting thing with the deathbed vision\nYou know because I Will acting that I didn't realize how common that was no we've we've certainly heard a lot of a near death experience and visions and out of body experiences associated with near death experience but I wasn't really ... with a deathbed visions or the visions of deceased loved ones that are also very common\nThe death bed visions do you think it's the body's way of making death a little more comfortable for people or is it something that is strictly outside of the physical brain\nI think it's both I think it's a combination because I like\nTo look at it and the point of view of the body plus the mind of the most ... plus the spiritual life so I think that for different components in each one is important\nWhat has been for you the most dramatic case you've come

with Thirteen Years old she said she thought lining light light and heard a voice which he identified as the ... coming from her father's garden\nSo these experiences have been documented by many people throughout the Bible and throughout the history of the church so I think there is a connection\nYeah they're most definitely is just remarkable how this works Manny ... it's it's you know let's call it the God factor or whatever it might be but it's out there it's real yeah the big question is why sit there and the first place what do you think\n[noise] the fifth the fifth and it came to my mind is that out there to make our lives more meaningful\nIt gets that the different level or a different dimension to where I live and that somehow if that's something to feel like what we're going to even if it's a painful experience to have the meaning it can have some value\nAbsolutely okay let's take some phone calls here for you we will be again by going to Joe in Long Island New York hey Joseph go ahead\nHi Maddie I Want to ask you a little bit more about the trains\nAre interestingly I had to drain recently that began with a preference of the day it set of a poll the first and I ended up at the beach I go on the water from Little Rock but this other people's ... and I'm usually wall which would be the case had I Want\nBut I never really had a dream where it started off given the ... the day which was the same date\nIn real life so my question would be with your dream about half\nThe next day which was you know you had the first question it's it's almost like the dream was a personal coach for you [noise] ah so I ask you about that you know what you think indicates that trains are going to a really acting\nMaine pointed sixteen [noise] so I think to a certain extent you have to take out those parts of the dream which you feel applied you in which can be helpful for you and your daily life\nSo now to Joe yeah that that was good yeah\nOkay very good next up we're going to marry in Seattle, Washington west of the Rockies merry go ahead\nHigh high ... so ... because I won't right on the dream state he's talking about my father is the most prominent\nBefore he died a week before he died I tell people my father walked up to death in ... than in ... with it I'm Serious a week before he died he was talking to people he was just so happy he said\nHe wouldn't tell us why you sit in a week before he yeah he told the neighbor are you ready to die\nAnd she was shot she says oh I don't think about that and no rights and he he was is\nUnusually ... being the night he passed it was three in the morning I was sixteen he woke me up at three in the morning and I was so silly that\nOh my brothers and sisters and I knew most of his brothers and sisters were dead they're out on the porch waiting for me and he said I'm going to listen and I was so he said look what keeps you seal I looked out the screen I didn't see anything and oh so he ah\nI went back to sleep because that was so sleepy three in the morning he over there we laugh I didn't know it was woke up the next morning and my mother's like have you guys see your dad\nAnd I told her I said mom he told me last night he was going with his brothers and sisters and she was like shocked she\nRamifications but I did yeah and my dad I think he was part native or something but he always told me he's playing older people in the native culture get old you said they go out in the woods or somewhere and they die I've heard some people in Alaska did in Cairo jackets just go out in\nKnow the water and that's the way he did he want\n'em to the area that used to be an Indian burial ground area and they found him like two weeks later and I think some of us\nIn the south some people are really spooky you die in a home it likes brain that stuff to it or he didn't want it frightened to kids I think it's I think it would kind of had a fine I don't know but he knew he was dying when they found it he did not look like he was struggling they did it look like you get that from where I'm just ...\nThat's a that's a great story in in many these visitors who come to us whether they're nearly departed or strangers but the business is there like a rule or a mission for them\nWell if you're talking about the visitors that people\nWho are dying have definitely there's the mission because they held a company that person to the other side\nAnd it's especially on what your caller was talking about her father and brothers and sisters came to visit and then he went with him to the and then they found his body two weeks later so I Would say they helped him accompany him to the other side so yeah I Would say they have a mission for sure\n\nStorm moves offshore jacket on Fox News the storm that was

fortunate that we did not lose the astronaut and the current one room absolutely thanks Marty Marty Baron his website is name Mike Barrow B. A. R. A. dot com\nWhile a story that's been all around the planet over the last several days as seems to be getting even worse now the Turkish government\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're monitoring well what did the indicators I mean the market in the last two days is really taking it on the Jim what's the cause for that is it just panic or ... what's happening\nWere well two things in and actually they both relate back to the good old Donald um last week you saw 'em treasury bond yields you know the yields on on the risk free ten and thirty year bonds\nShoot up I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this would happen we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to four point three percent in in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and high or low it so\nYou know that that was the first thing that happened but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean is this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be cheating and a lot of ways by\nChina's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh\nIf China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a world wide a downturn in crash and so so it was rising interest rates\nAnd um and and and more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about for the last month at twenty six forty\nI'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it you know was fifty five hundred not you know and then a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I had this kind of limp rally for years and has been waiting to go back and we said look at breaks twenty six forty that that's a sign that China is starting to go down again\nAnd it and it did that and the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign\nThat there's something wrong and and again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking oh it's just more interest rates note the interest rates was the first whack these last two days had a lot more to do with China and Trump\nIs really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways and Trump has been losing the economy with tax cuts and all this sort of stimulus and stuff\nAnd that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes grows to go up temporarily and what does the Federal Reserve is going to do they're going to raise interest rates that what they do it the economy's overheating they raise interest rates if it's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous\nAnd and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I've created this great thing and the trumps wrecking at no this was predictable he's not\nYou know he's got some you know gut feelings we gotta do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences of things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pull back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose one happening like you were you in a couple more days of downturns tomorrow if we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people start saying there's something wrong here\n[noise] [noise] yes yes we're we're just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this at the beginning of the year markets peaked in in late January real kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough\nWe had a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent different markets but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped right about here you know where we are now and then it kind of like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude\nWhat happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay there's things over and they start selling insured in the market\nIt happened very quickly you'll see you know I've seen this the last seven stock bubbles throughout history everything from the Nikkei and the early nineties in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two crashing in every other one in the last century including the tech rack and recent bubbles\nThat first crash will be thirty two percent on average in the first two and a half months\nYou know there were people get walk and that's the sign that that's the only way you know\nWell you know there were people get walk and that's the sign that that's the only way you know that the bubble has finally birth the problem is by time dot coms people are already in trouble and they're panicking and they get whacked hard so\nThe danger side is that we keep going down and and and literally the markets to look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just a bounce after\nYou know fourteen hundred points that may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far but it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers Seventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred twenty five thousand um to doubt if\nThe market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders are going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds to keep going up\nThat this is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not fifty for fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy eighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash\nWill happen in the first two to three months typically and that's what make bottles so dangerous uh uh you know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross child wants to know when somebody asks what what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man where he said you know I always sold a bit early\nBecause that's how ... this was a bubble this isn't a normal bull market\nThat correct so nice staircase manner and goes down bubbles go up dramatically and they crashing in half the time and they crashed twice a is dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this\nThis is a once in a lifetime of fat and it it the science to me you're building we've been telling people man this looks like a top here in the garden top here we only get\nThe good part is we can gauge as if we only get a normal ten Fifteen Percent or so correction by the end of the year that we're probably good for one more route one more Trump rally into next year before this thing blows but the\nRight now though the odds are shifting towards a it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will this be as bad as that time period\n[noise] well this is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George ... decades in advance on demographics the baby boom picking\nAnd and and and causing a down turn off the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and and their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nLow interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kinda like went sideways and didn't the laboratory debt emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy trillion more\nOn top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world\nAnd those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble\nChina is slowing down and like I said they have the biggest that Bob ... of anybody in any time in history and when China blows that we're we're going to be worth ... so my view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and the stock crash\nBecause they stop at with massive money printing they just literally stop if they just filled the pop back up with money that was draining\nThis time more debt everything's\nMore stretched the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a fifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty per\n... absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come back curious dance with us his website is his name Harry Dent D. E. N. T. dot com couple of his books include the Democrat demographic cliff the sale of a lifetime in zero\n... the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for iPhone in now Android ...\nListen libre on demand anywhere anytime good acoustic ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the companies that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a super bubble I mean the tech bubble took five years to build the dot com crash came in the last year and a half\nUp six to seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies will not have well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if you'd upon Amazon there oh my God I was\nYou know like a you know a hundred and fifty dollars and now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies\nAnd you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued in a bubble like this but they're also\nGo down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down Ninety three percent that ended up being that was it ended up being the greatest company in the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing so\nThat's the secret and and the other thing is even at the earnings of companies if companies are so good that they keep their earnings flat instead of declining the valuations on stock how many times earnings like people will pay\nThirty times earnings for the typical stock right now are thirty in in sixty or eighty for the best tax talk does collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down fifty percent even if its earnings don't decline and then of course most companies' earnings do decline so that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you see you have a secret indicator looking at some of the dangers what is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know it it's called the smart money\nYou know it's almost it's not a secret\nWell I Know I Know them believe me Wall Street won't if there's any way so you don't have to worry but but what what happened to their the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups stopping in and then when things go down there the ones that jumping and by when when when they see the old investors are over Boston in stocks overvalued they're the ones that short first\nI mean they're in the know and and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks they eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff [noise]\nWell they you can measure\nThis action whether there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is that dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes\nI mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions in the futures market there ahead of everything\nAnd so the market's gonna open down it opens down right at the open where it opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves that may well that's when the dumb money and most people would stop or something to protect them so that's one of those reactions made that's the ...\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit shorter do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour into the clothes so they measure this indicator measures but the smart money is doing versus the dumb money and the smart money\nHas not bought this rally in fact they'd been shorting it they've been betting against this rally ever since that bottom February this year after that crack now they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to\nJanuary top early this year but once that crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is declines and smart money buying and that\nHas been a strong warning signal to me uh in in recent months into our subscribers\nAre you in Puerto Rico now\nI Am in Puerto Rico and I went through a hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here and Michael both of them similar force but this storm\nHung over us for twelve to fourteen hours in Michael at least pass through so I Know what\nThese people are going through it is unbelievable\nUh to watch everything I mean windows blown off all around me you know you walk out the next morning and all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stuff it it it's just unbelievable it's it's like can you know God's got angry or something you know into through a temper tantrum looks aren't you moved there\nWell I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and coal labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has the acres in Calais wrote to islands that are like St Thomas and or or St Croix or St John\nAnd and you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there in in I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family\nFor many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working on this place\nSpending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade was when I first started coming\nIn I said to my why don't we move here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality on a corner the price of South Beach Miami where we used to live\nAnd and we're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport which I get to twenty minutes an advance they don't even check your id they just wait to see how you're going to tilt below al I'm not sure I liked that part\nWell it's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane flight it scenic I'm I'm I leave my condo doing and landing on this island and one hour\nAnd once I got down here I realized I could qualify for some tax advantages here which are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living in the crypto geyser coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses that can qualify there's real strong tax advantage so I'm living much cheaper than a man of great climate I can still fly to New York\nIn four hours director Miami in two hours and then almost anywhere in the east coast\nIs now it's difficult if I'm coming out your way if I have to go out to California which I just did for a long time that that the long haul now but I tell ya I I like it down here they been in a recession there's no civil unrest a recession for twelve years\nWe're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent here and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\nAnd then I'm just going to see what happens in the next\nAre so many years are the big banks down there [noise] yeah\nYeah yeah about in in ... down here and actually a lot of the banks are by bank of popular and Santander are Spanish Banks because this is by origin more of a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but they there are ... George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service\nSo people either just because they think we're in Zimbabwe or they charge some huge X and there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special pasta sauce and things like yeah but otherwise man this is a good deal and\nYou know I'm Down here for other reasons but I'd say people ought to be Americans\nOught to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower\nFor people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower um\nBy the way they vote in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that that they are allowed to vote in our elections\n... most important they are allowed to freely mover immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities and then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico to put their kids to colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then\nSometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving\nTo the United states why sixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they end up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants from Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people that's why\nThey have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides the U.S [noise]\nIt's better to help create good jobs down here the tax advantages rather than just out now subsidized Puerto Rico because the U.S as always always robbing the best people and again it it's they're more professional educated people that are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\n[noise] so I Want you to you is your best impressions on what you think will happen economic lead over the next year this country seems to be mired right now here in um conflict\nEmotion it's unbelievable I've never seen it this way yeah and I think it's going to affect the economy one\nThat does is another reason I'm kind of happy to be here and watch what's going on this was a major theme for the first time in this zero our book\nThat that we're not just seeing a major boom peak globally in a major bobble and debt bottles and all this de leveraging it and that that's going to make the next couple of years very ... what you do to leverage debt these bubbles burst I mean again somebody stock account is worth two hundred thousand\nOne day and then a year or two later it's worth fifty thousand you know like what happened I just lost that money and it's not coming back this time you know my home was worth three hundred thousand now it's worth a hundred fifty and I'm underwater and I can't even ... to take advantage of the lower rates so\n\nMichael as finally moved out to sea name Anthony Fox news ever doing damage and causing flooding from Florida and Virginia\nAnd rain in the wind was so strong you didn't know what was going
