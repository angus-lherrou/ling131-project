no it's it's the one gift that you can visit or use every single day and tomorrow and the day after that [noise] and for that\nSingular perfect present that's all wrapped up in a boat for this planet and every one on it it's the great pyramid of Egypt\nYou don't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving\n... the great pyramid is forty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly leveled and walk pointing exactly true north south east and west and it's been looking at us for\nNorth south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years\nAllegedly and yet we know nothing about it\nA few short decades after Cleopatra's rain is Barrow any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egyptian history was forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read I highly ... nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they would travel to Cairo and they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that you know and the answer\nAir quotes we don't know you know but it's really big [laughter] that's that's it\nIt took nearly Eighteen hundred years to figure out the language and you would think that with all of the expedition to Egypt over the centuries that someone sometimes somewhere would have shown up who knew how to read write or speak any of it\nBut it never happened\nAnd although today we know about the Rosetta Stone and the quest to the code everything the great and eat eat Egypt shunned amnesia that was already happening and in full swing centuries before Cleopatra committed suicide\nAnd and so I started reading a little bit more and uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I had to you know I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and I've met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shark or a few months later and um you know it's just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing\nA few a couple of years\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those ads linked tonight on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add to coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the paper section everything listed in the row a new is the first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight\nUh you and a Robert football and Robert shock sat down and started discussing uh the the ... and ... at least that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\nYeah what you know this is a this goes back to override mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the two gentlemen yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I thought to myself if if an architect ah builds the three pyramids a and a line and and want it to align them with the three belt starts off or when\nThey had to be some kind of record and you know it was it your clauses believed that uh the architect of the great care of it the first one of the three with him you know\nAnd so I looked at the stature I started looking at the statue of email and they were looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while I so I looked at the statue and that was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of lying this on that are on the pedestal if that statue\nUm I noticed it and then I just cut up with a back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the uh the book the that they just have co authored origins of the things which is amazing ... by the way\nIt is yeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section is developing a you know something that he knows what dreams the law which is you know in front of the parts of the ... between the positive things and\nThere was a a so he was talking basically about the things in the sky and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about this things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the servants were built if there was a things then it's it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been a mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remembered the lion is on the pedestal\nOne thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page Robert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or\nAt the um I think it was caused the origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast and I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out less than a minute\nIt was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out let's admit it and we uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight yeah why is it that the mother gives a plateau in general but you had the great pyramid the grades banks\nAre two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBut is not documented the anywhere\nIn Egypt in history where you would think\nWell you know the ... love to write everything they love to go to tell their story and not only that but taxes and in accounting and seasons everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except\nFor the great strengths and the great pyramid why is missing in history\nYeah that that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy um I mean being you know the one answer you could give us that maybe we just we haven't fought the records or the records were destroyed\nUm but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or maybe total absence\nUm and of course that was the problem with it stinks you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nIn scripture that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to have to take a look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we saw something that leads to things um\n[noise] the pyramids we um you know when you are next so that when you buy the great pyramid there is a tune from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years\nAfter a you know who fu ...\nWas alive and if you walk into that too is actually a reference\nTo the great pyramid and also to the ... in in in the two of its called the whole rise of coup fool next to it it's the um the you know the the conference great so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid\nSo they called that cover is great and who was driven was called the allies with Google\nAnd so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot so and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is declaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou ... yeah you would expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have but but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction\nAnd forget about the other something about how was builder who built it or the year was built you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that's how it is very computer all\nThe way to have auditors um you know fifth century but see now this was in during personal rule um two thousand years after the fact and and what it is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know are you saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plot so and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years\nUm and there were machines that were hauling up the box but you would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just is confusing is Lugar each things yet we also have the same issues and if it wasn't for the dream Stella well and the inventory Stella\nWe may not know anything at all but\nThe world the dream still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn of the um twentieth century that may be ... most of the fourth who is the author of the dream so between the positive things that he gets the ones who built it that was actually being debated\nUm but ah and there is a there is a small\nReference to cooperate but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that he does definitely does not say that he built it\nUm and so that's the dream still at the end mentors the law the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that what ... what I think overall I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same at the ... the Greek name Cooper was the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that the human towards the ... says very under critically with Google came to the ... things already existed in fact it was broken he repair it and then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid of his queen Knutson\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now this coast to coast damn are murals to be church or get my news said ... and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nMind them ... and I just log on Tuesday in\n\n\n\nOur guest is my new said Sunday and my new uh we were talking about the inventory ... and the dreams DOMA right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward\nAnd in the dream stolen a top most of the fourth says mentions and in illustrates two ... thinks is there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second ... thinks\nWell there's two things is there I Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second ... being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a ... is there a second stinks\n... it's a great question um uh so that was for that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the seconds things uh as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's ... it's a great question it's a good point um there are actually depictions off a double headed things\nAre and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is a ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nAnd these depictions are um you know they're on mistake herbal\nSo so the answer to this question specific to of course it hasn't been found there is there are stories uh Arab historians referred to an actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build mosques\nSo they're they're apparently was physical things\nAre on the other side of the Nile but it's there it's things buried under the fence or that the west of a conference here that it's possible\nThe\nAim and tore Stella you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repaired this beings but build the great pyramid there are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just a repair guy\nBut then he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why the discrepancy\nYeah uh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as yet of course each opposes most causes do not accept the inventories either as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we culture this argument so we're actually seeing is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but\nJust to be fair to both sides um so to your question\nUm they're the uh you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egypt she means to me to repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the ... the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the ... the combination is set him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a a is a is a strip affects where you know the pyramid building has mentioned and the the verb that this is not\nFurther a qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuilt\nUm is that a hundred percent poof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the ... of ... that was found in ... in the red sea\nYou know they're saying well you okay this is the hardest talks about to a store and being ... a ship to ease uh uh but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course has done a who you mean it was a ... interview you out with and the other day he made a good point you said that uh he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was backfield\nAnd so that means that if you ship Portuguese that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up to courses and then you ... so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their own mind about it\nAnd there was a quite a bit of relatives are you a pyramid like who who is dealing with uh also on the gays a plateau right it could there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramids\nThere are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes\nYes yes there is a there is a reference to a hit Knutson um hit Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who is in Newton so she was supposedly is queen\nAnd uh he built up here of it for her the southern most of the three ah off the three a queen permits that are on the east field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid and uh\nBut you know even tourists though it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting distill a because they're saying there's no evidence that they knew it was a print says so again Robert chocolate and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that she I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we we think is the poop shows that she was a prince says so that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then there's mentions of ISIS and hot or a an old Cyrus\nThere's mentions of ISIS and hot or\nA an old Cyrus on this that law and that those are much further reasons why she pauses reject this though because they're saying\nYou know if this were an old ... story or at the time of coup who these ... ah you know as as an aside as we're not yet a work being worship there were not official states sanctions or in the eighties\nAnd we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nUm but you know it's it's a contentious I I don't want to make it sound like we have the ads or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nThere's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids\nAre crumbling they don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same answer with the same pair\nRight and those would be more simple to build and you would you would expect those to be just as elegant if even you know more complex yeah but they're not and they're the stone work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know walked off there still owns\nAnd so what we're seeing are is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just call me that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went through a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few things stolen that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality of you know there are smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I but I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old King I'm I'm a you know middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the workman ship definitely declined um after the old kingdom\nNow let's get to a what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yes after we have been told over and over again\nAnd it just it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there well clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is one of the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing um and ... and what I liked about it is that it was non invasive um you didn't have to drill old she didn't have to you know like a\nA ... the early explorers date used dynamite sticks to blow themselves into these monuments which was awful and nowadays uh it's kind of like the pyramid is telling us you know you wait until you have the technology to to find out about me or without destroying me and I think now we're getting to that point\nAnd that's also what I wanted to do I want to really get some information out of the pyramid without you know I'm putting my hand on of course the chips in government is protecting the monuments and I completely agree with that they're making it very difficult for you know invasive studies to be done because they want to protect the monuments and\n\n\nCan't change

I Believe dates to the middle kingdom and and reaches back a most likely a probably to him or taps time so um yes there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians I'm\nThe second part yeah Ken Mitch and which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a degree that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so\nUh as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was a southern Egyptian culture and that script was mostly phonetic 'em and evidence from that comes from two um UGA\nA king scorpions and that is I think were the African roots lie\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt uh probably from Bhutto\nAnd brutal was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably myself with Amy uh with the live on\nAnd so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a ... so it was picked a crafts\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in South what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa and maybe you know ... maybe I'm maybe even further south in that\nAnd she brought up another really good point uh before we get to the break we got about thirty seconds Manu ... the Greeks adapting ah the etymology a chemistry coming from candidate right\nYes the issue I think she mentioned his thing so uh my uh we we think that speaks was making before uh before Africa game I think it was we were think it was the lioness and her name was make heat and by the way that's also probably an African of African origin\nLet's take a break right here coast to coast am it's all Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long or get tonight my new saves da de his paper is right there click on his website a coast to coast am we're going to discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us [noise]\nFind them more about tonight's gifts to log on to ... am dot com\n[noise]\nHuman ah me\n\n\nLearned for yourself ... all the ... men do one for innovation by US News and World Report I learned to drive with Arizona State university for more information about on the one line talks live ... that's ... three five ...\n... am on news talk radio candy WN and Katie Jay\n\nWelcome back to the coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church I guess tonight and Manu safe side they were talking about are the great pyramid and the discovery of not only chambers inside of the great pyramid\nBut his formula in his white paper they published last week and how to locate them and I want to say really quick Manu\nThat Twitter I expected this uh is is going a bit nuts right now and you can follow me on Twitter at a ... and post your questions or comments about Tonight Show\nEither of for me or or buy new right there and this question just came in before we get to a\nA page out of three twenty eight of of of this report a minute this is the question this is from ... Kim\nShe says is it true that the measurement of the great pyramid or possibly coordinates and that those coordinates point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinates to haven't\nHaven't yes um I haven't heard that proposed\nIt's great to see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coast audience and and I guess like yourself there is so much information out there but there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid\nYeah and this is one of those questions where\nThe math of the great pyramid has revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and that they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alison green who is looking he's a Shakespeare expert and he has been able to connect uh the uh the title page of the ... Shakespeare sonnet\nTo the coordinates a lot to heaven but uh of course Allen might say it is Evan Wright a ... to the court and it's of the great pyramid and civically uh the the coordinate that Alan ... discovered\nA fall right next to the ... which is next to the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have 'em on coast a a very soon probably next month\nAnd his you're absolutely right in the title page of the sonnets with Shakespeare\nAnd his work Allen greens work at deciphering that page and what he's revealed\nIs I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it\nIt's it's absolutely incredible and we'll have Marcos next month okay so now as the the top half of the pyramid yes a U.S said at the beginning of the show let's get to this it's a page number three twenty eight everybody in the ... the ... were a reporter PDF\nThe top half you had said at the beginning of the show possibly six to eight additional chambers where we have been told there are none\nBut right and so um you know when we talked about a um a confident Rudolph got to break last time a Jimmy\nUm remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring a found is when you get to guns and brings door\nJust before the the the four off the off the off the canal drops suddenly there's a depression\nAnd the way he isn't Turpin one of the two ways he interpreted that is that must be a space\nThat allows that forward to cave in slightly so that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know the courses that we've just been discussing is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in\nAnd that might correlate with uh if I go back to three twenty six will quick\nThat could correlate with of course that marked with twenty fifth um and and then that let's go and so you know there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and uh this particular space not been a detected by me on again\nNow the row let's let's let's get to this for a second the or the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting at ... eighty four which is a shaft\nUm and uh it it going up words every body of one of those seven a and I'm looking at it here as it continues up these are rose layers of the construction\nThat have a different sides in a different thickness on these roads right\nRight right yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as the show and going all the way to the surface and that is incorrect so I just use the illustration of an old ... I'm so that that particular chef did not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of forty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basically establishing in the lower part of the care of it I'm proposing that every single one of these courses associated with hearing in other words they space at designed space not that you know an accidental space\nIt designed space that correlates with each one of these particular courses\nNow you just got back from Egypt yes we have to discuss the ongoing move on a project their which uh did help find this cavity this new chamber above the grand gallery\nYou describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nRight so I saw a new detectors being place um I if I'm In a different location and last time so last time the detectors we're facing\nAt this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up the grand gallery to the chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes and I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confirm and there was confirmed that they are scanning\nNow for the audience tell them what the ... on detectors actually do where do they used for\nRights that these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so when cosmic radiation hits the atmosphere of political call them you want is created and to you on as\nA negative they charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier ah than electron but it can pass through solid matter if it's travels at the speed of light is lifetime is just over two seconds\nI'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs and in this case you can basically quote unquote ex wait a pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then uh it showed ... then you have a chance\nTo see a space or because the yarns will travel more rapidly through open air than you know through solid still and so if you have a space in the past way of what your of what you're looking for then those nuance will arrive more rapidly and they and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors placed in the grand gallery could they be used to find\nThe\n[noise] the chambers that you were proposing and in the upper half of the pyramid\nIt is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifact jewel and I think they using this angle to confirm that the big voice is real\nBut it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of scan that yes that there could be some some at the lower once maybe a you know on the graphic if we go back\nUm let's say seven twenty fifth and sixth twenty fifth it's possible that if there is a\nA is if there's a space on the northern side on the northern half of the pyramid that it will get picked up by the scan um it's also possible they put they picked a place in places that we don't know for example a you know the uh the chamber's above the king chamber\n\nHouse for the White House to reconsider an arms deal with Saudi Arabia I mean Fox News lawmakers on both sides of the aisle concerned about the disappearance of a journalist\nUntil the u._s. news what happened to Jamal because she'll be Democrats and Republicans in Congress say bill push a mood to scrap one hundred ten billion dollar on sales to the Saudi Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio on CBS face the nation say even implying beyond you still on the table was not good\nEnough money in the world for us to buy back our credibility on human rights or if or if we do not move forward and and take swift action on this\nSaudi leaders have denied any involvement in any harm done many of those shows the president said there would be severe punishment but stopped short of calling all the orange ...

likes to call rocket failures but the article is right there and you can read all about it over at coast to coast am dot com I'm ... church now our guest tonight is my new as safe as our day\nWe're talking about his new paper that was published last week\nThat seems to show up formula for finding new chambers in the great pyramid more beer phone calls him more with by new when we come back after this short break that says coast to coast am [noise]\nTake one Adam of nitrogen and bonded with one atom of oxygen boom you just created nitric oxide a miracle molecule your own body makes that fills your cardiovascular health keeping you vibrant but as we all age our bodies need help generating more natural nitric oxide super beach by human\nUm I can tell you that the uh you know the roasted ... um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a a chronic a person that was chronicling the court was a crucial\nAnd he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there's another light pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves\nAre into this things and looking for chambers and then you know the one that to me just mention of course we know from seismic analysis that there are ... there are states is under this beings\nAnd one of those spaces specifically which is what Robert truck or a was studying uh years ago um is has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a man made sort of features and we think that um that might be something that's of interest\nYeah he did the seismic research there and the both of you are looking to go back a with another research expedition to hopefully drill right\nYeah yeah first well what we\nAre what we would like to do first is to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced uh five small graffiti and maybe electric conductivity studies and to really get a very detailed look\nEspecially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know if you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven and ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw a space about two meters\nA deep and uh and and then Robert uh you know did his studies ... a couple of years later\nAnd Robert is estimating that this phase is five meters deep so we have a little bit of a death problem and then of course you know that's I have often marketing or drilled in that area\nBut we think that they missed it uh and I mean they are they the the drill angles to shallow and they were too far west from where we think the chamber is so\nThey didn't really ah you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them in of course they had other reasons why they were drilling so he wants to do is you know just like a you know it's like a radiologist you know the first one to do a non evasive study and really finding out the space\nAnd we'll be having a good idea where it is then with permission of course that we're try a small probe into that space and see what's in it\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey has talked about and there's this this this rumor has been going around yeah we're quite a while it would just be great to finally uh put this to bed wouldn't\nOh absolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water and in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of the valley temple and thinks temple and there's a little depression and it's wet\nUm you can just you can just see the the water coming up and if if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber\nAnd so you know if if let's say if we find a chamber or the very first thing we have to do is to a very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue\nWhatever it might be inside um you know sufficient enough itself becomes very difficult project but it's doable Robert thinks it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly\nSpeaking of those things that just came in on Twitter this is from baldness a on Twitter and I have heard that it does things may have been a woman's face and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small for its body\nYes well if we think we\nThink it was a female lie and so that part is partially we agree with that yes I don't think it was a person's head so um but we think that was a lion is there before and the head of the line this was ... into a what we see today\nNow um I Know that you tend to be a little reticent to talk about alien jury tee when it comes to geese I leave all doors open myself but this comes in from Lucien on winter and and and\nThis is I'm just gonna have to read this directly as in Egypt in the images it seems like all of the pyramid to Mexico had been alien in this spacecraft depicted somewhere any comments\n[noise] yeah I I Know I I remember reading this long time ago and I've found myself in agreement with that uh that's\nOne way you could read it I you know I think that was Eric ... data can invite that originally that he's too she's talking about the ... yeah or the right to ... or ... of a car ride\nI have I have that's our topic is in my studio in the bunker and I have a reproduction of it hanging out in the wall right and I stopped and I look at that my new and I don't have any other way to look at that\nAnd I look at that my new and I don't have any other way to look at that step for the controls hand controls an oxygen mask plane was coming out of a a rocket motor on the bottom\nI I you know I don't have any problem with that I I think this is a this is one way you can explain it and everything is it this day and age everything is on the table you just said it we're going to Mars\nAre the odds that there is in Tel I Know somebody recently published an article saying that there may not be intelligent life out there but I think uh I think there is it's very likely and especially the physics of of a of the universe you know the holographic universe I don't know if people are following this\nBut it you know this one way that you can explain everything as a projection and if that's the case\nUh that just like Robert ... proposed in cosmic war is one way you can explain some of these contacts is it may be a message that gets broadcasts across universe through you know through um ah through a cotton fields\nAnd that message ends up on earth somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid\nUh I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is but we have to have some proof I I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see some solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line route Robin Vancouver Rob really quick before we hit the brake what do you have for my new\nAbsolute owners beat you guys really quickly a notion struck me when you talked about structured space a look or make it quick couple of quick jumps in laws are\nLooking at the idea of a Greek scare the architect from all the trauma ... super big jump talking tempers a farming old knowledge building big ... structures\nAre who's to say or he could do you know I guess people assume that the ... the uh periods are solid but could they not maybe just say structured spaces be are filled with ...\nI Know you learn to rocks and\nEverything is you know arches the Saudi big cavities like the temple\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that's exactly the conclusions that my new is presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight voids could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been I have to mention shop you know so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this is the logistics basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and just scan from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is that I think it's possible that the scanner was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm seeing that could be the logical and shop you dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know if you have to pay for a but he still thinks it's possible that the logistical spaces in it but you know beat out of it may so we agree there are probably space is up there and um I just want to have a quick uh cause\nThe pyramid of course who it's is it hot spaces inside research is in the sixties ... pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know what was your amid buddy ... all we have is built on each chamber\nWell let me jump in I've got to take a break right there but it's just something we need to talk about when we come back our gas my new saints day this is all the great pyramid on coast to coast I'll be right back stay with us\n...\nUm we\nCosts because I Am on news talk radio Katie WN and Katie Jay\n\nBack to coast to coast am on

some excellent work on a ... a basically tracing biblical stories back to Egypt\nUm and so you may find some answers or you know with him so I think he's producing a television series and he's with books about it um those are great documentary a couple of years ago by I think in the whole knee if I remember this correctly\nUm but yeah I think it's an interesting subject I think uh I think the uh the early Israeli lights um when they were in Egypt um I think\nUh there is for specially Joseph I'm that's what the role is describing Joseph real figure and a live in a in a in a place called a virus which is in the delta\nAnd had a palace and was that was basically a a into them in the pyramid and he was such an important official that the court\nAnd I'm a and then all of a sudden I'm you know this virus community disappears and this is archaeological evidence at well piece together\nUm and David Was basically saying that uh where are you worried historians got it wrong is that they they were looking for the biblical story in a in the new kingdom and it's David role is fighting that it was probably a couple of centuries earlier\nThis or just came in on Twitter this is from Jay and Jay says I heard that surgeon tools were found in the ... pyramids that doctors use now true or false\nUm I well what was found is that a is a a tool that looks like a ... or like ... like a fish scale\nI'm ... I I'm not sure that was a surgeon's tool but of course we don't know um it was found in the I think it was in the northern ... a shaft of the queen chamber by a wait a minute Dixon\nUm and he uh and it's now in a British Museum a with a with a ... with a granted ball but whether or not that was a surgery ... and ... other than that I don't know of any surgical tools found inside of the games up here on ms\nLet's go to bill up in Oregon bill you're up next on Kos added Manu\nEmanu Hi Jimmy yeah the really academic discussion tonight and I've got nothing you know nothing against that I congratulate you on your discovery\nBut my question is um okay so I just want you to speculate a little bit\nIf these chambers or for construction in engineering could they be like for instance for architects to put gold on the Internet or could um if their theological\nCould be you know some sort of burial chambers for for those are the king wanted to proceed him into the um afterlife\nYeah great question yeah great question bill\nI'm Glad I'm Glad you asked that because I Will speculate that I I'm I'm looking for just ... I think because there is obviously I'm proposing up to ten chambers I was thinking well what if it's your logical what could that be and I think the answers the and that\nSo in the ... are they are in the ... was known for the center of the worship of the nine major God is kind of like the pantheon of of the ancient Egyptians\nAnd I think ah these chambers are dedicated to each one of the year these and and the one that's dedicated to sauce is the one that is the crucial chamber\nOr wherever we may find the kind of things that you just mentioned are but I'm suspecting there could be piracy both in their uh with inscriptions\nI'm so that would be very exciting is that if we're if that were ever to be found\nA but I think it's along the lines of that and if it's a logistical then I'm all I think I'm withdrawing he'll do I think this is still on the table that there may have been spaces there that help the workers to pull up the stones or to the top it's possible\nUm and we'll just have to wait for the next scan I think the next ... will give us some new information\nNow I have heard some rumors minute that they have already gotten the inside of the the new chamber above the grand gallery and have removed items from there and they will be on display when the new grand museum opens next month\nYeah I I I'm not I happened to those rumors but um I Am a I wouldn't be all I wouldn't be completely surprised let's put it that way\nIt would certainly help the tourism I mean ... that's right\nWhich has dropped off I have heard you know you just got back from Egypt I haven't heard from so many friends that have been going to Egypt for decades\nAnd that you can as a tourist because ... years past it was crowded all the buses were there you had to wait in line there was a you know thousands of people on the gives a plateau but today you can burn truly be the only person there\nYeah I had there was a couple of days when I felt like that to me I I'm you know it was not\nThere were there are parts of think he's a toll where I was the only person walking around besides the guards and the camel riders\nSo yeah tourism has been down and they um you know they want to build a new museum and uh and of course they have to if they discover something they uh they are going to show it to the world so that people come and look at it I that's why I'm hopeful that if they have something that they haven't shown us yet that we'll we'll find out about\nThis uh this is from Twitter this is from David I Love this question actually did the Nazis research Egypt areas as

I don't know I don't know for sure I Know that Germans this was before before Nazi Germany um there there was of course German activity on Nick he's a plot so there was actually a great American

I see the south side yes um there is\nA rock so Robert scan did show on both sides if I remember this correctly or there were spaces under under the flanks of the things which were extending backwards yes\nUm and uh\nBut I mean I have no ... I don't know you know if when you when a antiquities goes and investigate those things that they're all published a data you know there's no way for me to know what they found\nUm you know so your guess is as good as mine but I Am based on based on the chamber under the left part that we think exists and we think it's a manmade chamber\nI Am pretty sure that's not a blind chamber I think that chamber may just be the entry all to something that goes further back\nYou know um and so yeah I Am with you I think uh I think there is more more than than we know and maybe they know it and they haven't published it\nJ widen or ... told me that he was down in that very same area\nAnd he's walking around he was alone and there was nobody around him so he goes to the back of the things in the south side by the tail and he looked down on the ground and he sees what do you think is a piece of wood covered with dirt\nYeah so he he leads over grabs the wood picks it up and it's a a piece of plywood\nAnd he lifted up and looked and it was an entry way it was a tunnel going straight down\nAnd as he was looking into the whole a guard came up and yelled at him he dropped the wood and he was escorted out of there yeah and he's a Jimmy I'm here to tell you I no matter what\nI personally lifted up a piece of wood and looked into a tunnel underneath the south side of the rear flanked by the scale of this things and he saw himself but yet they'll say that it doesn't exist but he saw with his own eyes\nYeah I I don't have any doubts about the veracity I think that's there is there's there are spaces under the things the main question is does it go anywhere or there's just a blind pouch that's the main question\nYou brought up something else too about I'm Andrew Collins now his his that is one of the craziest videos I've ever seen\nHis his that is one of the craziest videos I've ever seen I mean ... and his nerve wracking and if you've got claustrophobia in any way you watch that video and you almost can't get through it\nBut he did find a a tunnel a that started up in the north west corner where the bird uh two was ... and he finds a hole in the back of one of the tunes are for these birds that were there\nAnd it turned out to be hundreds and hundreds of feet long that stretched out and appeared to continue underneath the pyramid complex there wasn't supposed to be anything there then he high wash who had denied that there were any tunnels there\nLater went on to his own expedition and film crew\nAnd went into the tunnel complex which again wasn't supposed to exist but it does\nBut there's also a potential pathway from the site or from the ah the old Cyrus shaft\nUm you know that's I I don't know if it was ever explored but I Know Robert was down there Hamas was down there filming and it was actually a documentary years ago\nI'm In you know he was really excited about the shaft um of course Egypt poses a telling us that these are you know late period shops and these are not from they don't dare to the old kingdom\nUm but you know I'm not so sure it might be that the upper ... the I'm Talking about the specifically I talk about the oath Irish chef it's possible that the upper two layers are they taking them but the the\nLower level is much older we we don't we I don't think we know for sure and it may protect um but yeah without a probing um nowadays we have the technology to pro very small spaces um but yeah it until we get the data we just don't know\nYeah you're talking about the two of us iris\nYeah the to write the access is on the south side of the ... of ... cost way uh and then that's how you and then you go under it and then uh it's three layers or or three levels rather and the lowest one is the one where you had the ... and water and the surrounding database and had sort of the shape of the ear cliff\nFor house I'm a and a and you know it had this conference inside and and that the four pillars around and it was fascinating ah you know this uh some the symbolism of it but the dating of it I I'm a little bit doubtful about the official story\nWell he went down almost a hundred feet and the and the pillars that were surrounding the area where there is our topic is again underwater or those four pillars had fallen over but it was something that was also supposed to exist on the key supply into and there was\nThat's right and so any inventories the right you know we talked about it earlier there are so Robert and I think there are the the the MIT dimension of the house of Cyrus\nOr on the inventory steal it actually may be referring to to that or ... or Cyrus shop we think it's possible that it's referring to that\nOr chemicals to now my cleaner is saying that Congress to them is a late period to belonging to a no official call 'em ... cop or something like that\nI Can't remember the name but again this is the same issue you know how do we know for sure that that wasn't a an older to him and then it was being intruded on it we don't think we know\nAnd ... before we had to the break ... ... how much do you think is still love to be discovered on the gays applied to there's an awful lot of sand there\nYeah but well my my favorite place to look at it and and of course Robert Robert favorite place to look would be a besides the you know uh besides that left paw is in front of the two temples if we could dig deep in front of the temple is you know where people now do you uh watch the light show\nOr that could be the actual entry to this passage\nThat we think is under the things it could be in front of the things temple and then the other thing is we I predict inanimate towards the paper we're predicting\nThat there may have been also temple or east of the valley temple and that was dedicated to Cyrus and that would be also underground so that would be one of my favorite place and then you mentioned as things on the other side is there's things on the west side\nYou know of course if that's a great place to look a is there another sings maybe those three places will be my favorite places to go\nWhen you look at when I find the most intriguing about the gays applied to of course everything facing west in Beijing the Nile uh there's there's a lot there had been to reasons with the causeway and the entrances and so forth but\nWhen you look at the original survey maps that were done in the Eighteen hundreds of the gate so plateau there is an awful lot a that is behind the uh the pyramid complex facing\nA west in northwest there's a lot there and\nUh not only were the tunnels represented all the way back into the uh early Eighteen hundreds but there is a construction then is represented in those original survey maps that really hasn't been explored sense\nYeah yeah that's right that's right there there are some places in Egypt that cannot be explored because there are military zones or you know for example the the northern a pyramid of why it all Ari on\nA you know this is an incredible amazing place\nOr with the huge trends and this Oval Office placement\nUm but there's nothing nothing going on since the sixties because it's a military zone so yeah I mean to your point in the in the west the old way out and I do notice for a fact I don't know if this was a military zone right now but you know some areas are basically off limits and yet their secrets hiding under the fat and potentially\nAnd who knows what we're going to be able to on earth them\nWe'll be right back this was coast to coast am stay with us\n[noise] um [noise]\nNever missed

pyramid is finally starting to give up uh some of its mysteries so with that let's let's get right back to the phones are we've got one last segment here let's go east of the Rockies Larry out in Jacksonville, Florida\nA good morning new thought hey morning James\nUh good morning Larry and how were you in the hurricane were you okay\nAh where I'm located Irma got me but I'm I'm located on the

okay over on that side\nWere good on that side we've got a little weather but rain and whatever but we're good\nAll right Larry what do you have for my new\nSomething quick or Edgar Edgar Casey reading Edgar Casey on Atlanta is a paper bag right it might be interested in reading your does life for a for for march Nineteen sixty eight\nRight he talked about between ten thousand eleven thousand period or the migration of the carpet in return\nAnd then vote voted in conquered ... one of the leaders of this trial will re tall or Edgar Casey\nWith reincarnate it of course I'm we're all on one if they were basically the chamber the paper and then you can train for it if not a to write a according ratings you might check that out if they do it's very and lightning\nAnd the original capstone with court or the pyramid pyramid granite and it which produces under pressure five electricity\nWe made a all that's all right hand and they'd be written that\nI've heard the theories yes um especially you know the electricity theory I've heard about that of course at gr Casey energy the tell your current current the Nile is\nRe routed it did route\nAre addicted to meth or under the pyramid and the uh the purpose of it with to generate a electricity\nWell Larry let me ask you a question instead of you asking my new a question\nAre you ready if I can answer absolutely if the uh you know in Christopher done and others have talked about uh the\nThe pyramid being a machine and possibly a generator power and energy or if that is the case Larry what would they have used it for\n... to ... to a group by a labor free energy\nYeah you know what and Larry thank you for the phone call my new that's exactly what a Christopher done\nUh as I said to me last week while he's talked about it for years of course um it wasn't a big revelation with me but that it was energy for the for the people of Cairo in Egypt\nYeah you know you know what I really love about Christopher done is that he\nHe looks at the observations and he puts it into a model that is a completely covered by prejudices and biases he just fits all the observations into a model and that is he you know if I if I were to an investigation he'd be the first call to\nHave him on board um you know so I yeah I he's amazing absolutely I I Love the interview and I've read has worked before and very impressive first\nLet's go to wild card was go to Carol in Charleston D.C\nCarol you're up next on coast how Hi Carol hello Carol\nQuite several years ago ... last name why won't go found found I

far as I Know or to them is not discovered but you know maybe it has been discovered and it's not published as possible\nAnd what was your second question Carol\nAh without being in archaeology is how do you go about getting involved with one of every third grade [noise]\nYeah that's a great question I so yeah I have to I Want to make sure I explain to every one so I'm not an archaeologist I'm also not a credential Egypt causes this is for me it started as a hobby and all of course it's a serious endeavor\nOr you have to be associated with an Institute a research place or university which I Am now I Am a you know a source affiliated with Boston University\nUm and so then you can apply for permits and you have to you know you have to do the application you have to\nUh they have to review the application and they may say no and you don't have a recourse um you know so we'll have to see if they allow us but if it's not me it's okay or somebody else you know my my I think you know I wanted to get the information out there are other people can see it other researchers\nAnd they might be able to get a permit to investigate further and that's okay with me\nYou should do the same thing Carol are you researching on your own now\nI'm thinking and and what they found and I carry ... added that and that's in a nationally twice\nYeah and and Carol ... one of the things that that I like to do and I encourage others is blog ... research and and and publish and self publish yourself\nAnd and continue because once you start to do that because I Do it myself and and certainly so does my new that others out there\nAre attracted to you and they will find your information and then they started sharing their information with you and you suddenly have a network right in front of you\nSo I I encourage that I encourage blogging and creating your own website just like my new did and and look what happens in the end let's uh let's go east of the Rockies is going to Manuel in San Antonio Texas you're up next on coast man you\nDon't do you how you doing and I know a thing over the participating or what I what I wanted to know like the gentleman that called for\nA film that there was that a bird or something\nOn the hieroglyphics on on the the the\nTwo of the team but there was also one in ah in Peru and there's a little one the mythical if those ... I mean the thing thing if the ... the same thing oh that's a good question to\nAnswer your question I wanted to know how can we get all these ... be bored and they laid off the bad blood money they called a lotta money stuff in there\nYeah you're absolutely I'm not hearing I'm not hearing the question\nI mean he was saying that you had brought up a why you answer this question that why hasn't this been brought up before and it always comes down to money that's where this was his point but the first\nOr the birds are that are represented a throughout different cultures around the world on a different temples and and pyramids and why we're seeing it over and over\nRight so the big the the the most important question in my mind okay which is probably the same question that uh you know a ... early research has worked confronted with when they looked at the Egyptian ... lives\nIs if the symbol is the sound or if it if it actually means what it shows uh that's probably the most important questions so when you have a bird in an Egyptian a text or most likely most of the time the bird is not\nWhat is the the the symbols that's not me I have nothing to do with the bird it ... it's basically a sound so when you see an all it's the letter M. it has nothing to do with it all actually when you see the fall and so that's horse\nTo\nNine Seventy\nHankins schizophrenia between the U.S in Saudi Arabia I mean Fox that question I said I've been making journalist Fox's are now Scott\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio said on CBS face the nation no question how important the Saudis are to American interests liberal\nSaudi Arabia is an important part of our Middle Eastern strategy they are a key leverage and hatch point against Iranian influence in the region\nBut the reason bipartisan sentiment against allowing a multibillion dollar deal if the disappearance and possible death that's your mall 'cause she'll be linked to Saudi leader\nCan get threatening to retaliate against any sanctions state run\nLinked to Saudi leader\nThey can't get threatening to retaliate against any sanctions state run news agency is saying the kingdom and turkey are working together to determine what happened cleanup and recovery continuing and the Florida Panhandle in the wake of hurricane Michael thousands\nOf National Guard troops and tens of thousands of utility workers are scurrying about the Florida Panhandle attempting to clean and secure roadways restore power and water and an order of Florida's governor Rick Scott find survivors number one search and rescue we're still um\nWe're still completing that and President Trump visits today he comes to Florida first Eglin air force base than to robins air force base outside Macon Ga both which took serious damage the president is already signed disaster declarations in Miami Evan brown Fox News\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markel are headed to Australia with a baby on board Kensington house announcing this morning oracle is pregnant the sixteen day tour with Seventy six and gauge includes visits to Fiji Tom ... and UCLA\nThe two are coincides with the Invictus Games you need a sporting event founded by Prince Harry and twenty fourteen getting sick and injured military personnel as well as veteran an opportunity to compete in sports this is the first international to her for the\nDutch is a Sussex since their wedding is Fox News [noise]\n\n[noise] what it is this is our heart because now more than ever we nice houses or [noise]\nWhere you need Fox Nation or the Fox news favors you already low of\nLosing memories are going to be very PC hell no policy seems more like ... dot com\nGriswold when it's on Fox News to\nAny questions for me it's always going to happen [noise] if you call it sounds like you're on pushing an agenda [noise]\nYou're not home on your tongue says they're going to rely on you\nOne of the advantages of having to say this bill as long as you're able to the top\nOf what is real what is of course who has watched jobs over the last one was on Fox News channel real moves real honest opinion\n[noise] a deadline and\nThe war in Syria as the country's president goes after the last major rebel stronghold\nRussia to agree to deal last month creative officer around the probably just a place where President Trump has on Syria stock or Russia like I said what do you described as a reckless attack\nI'll give it to be a code jihadist fighters rebel forces must go on the inside of the Syrian Government fighters with me on the outside jihadists have until today to withdraw from the bus or if the deal collapsing aid agencies avoiding a humanitarian catastrophe ...

in Los Angeles California standing in on this beautiful Sunday evening I hear your host Jimmy church tonight\nMy guess is my new save Saturday\nEverybody let's get started listen to me every body wants the gift that keeps on giving that special gift\nOne that you don't put in a drawer and forget about no it's it's the one gift that you can visit or use every single day and tomorrow and the day after that\nAnd for that seeing your perfect present that's all wrapped up in a bowl for this\nAnd every one on it it's the great pyramid or did you ...\nYou don't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving\nThe great pyramid is forty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly libel rock pointing exactly true north south east and west and\nPointing exactly true north south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years allegedly and yet we know nothing about it\nA few short decades after Cleopatra's rain as pharaoh any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egyptian history was forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read I highly ... nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they would travel to Cairo and they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that\nYou know and the answer air quotes\nWe don't know you know but it's really big [laughter] that's that's it it took nearly Eighteen hundred years to figure out the language and you would think that was all of the expedition to Egypt over the centuries that someone some time somewhere would\nHave shown up who knew how to read write or speak any of it but it never happened\nAnd although today we know about the Rosetta Stone and the quest to decode everything the great and eat eat Egypt shunned amnesia\nAnd and so I started reading a little bit more and uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I have to you know I I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and I've met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and ah and I met Robert shock or a few months later and um you know it's just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing a few a couple of years\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those ads linked tonight on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the paper section everything listed in the row a new is the first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight\nUh you and a Robert football and Robert shock sat down and started discussing uh the the strings and published that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulb started going off that got you involved in all of this\nYeah what you know this is a this goes back to override mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the gentleman yet the authors um I I was a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah builds the three pyramids a and a line and and want it to align them with the three bell starts off or when they had to be some kind of record and you know it was it causes believe that uh the architect of the great care of it the first one of the three of us have you know\nAnd so I looked at the stature I started looking at the statue of email and they were looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while I so I looked at the statue and do something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a lie in this on that are on the pedestal of that statue\nUm I noticed it and then I just cut up put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the uh the book the that they just have co authored origins of the things which is an amazing book by the way\nIt is yeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section is developing a you know something that he knows what dreams the law which is you know in front of the parts of the ... between the positive things and\nThere was a a so he was talking basically about the things in the sky and he developed a part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about this things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the ... field if there was a things then it it would have been such an amazing monument that there should have been a mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remembered the lion is on the pedestal one thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page\nRobert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or at the um\nI think it was caused the origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast and I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than admitted and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just\nIt's the minutes and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and we uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight\nWhy is it that the mother gives a plateau in general but you have the great pyramid the grades banks\nAre two things that dominate everything that you can achieve for miles\nBut is not documented the anywhere\nIn Egypt in history where you would think\nWell you know the ... love to write everything that he loved to go to tell their story and not only that but taxes and in accounting and seasons everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except\nFor the great strengths and the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nYeah that that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy um I mean you know the one answer you could give us that maybe we just we haven't found the records or the records were destroyed\nUm but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or maybe total absence um and of course that was the problem with it stinks you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nIn scripture that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something that leads to things um [noise] the pyramids\nWe um you know when you are next so that when you buy the great pyramid there is a tune from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years\nAfter a you know who fu ...\nWas alive and if you walk into that too there's actually a reference\nTo the great pyramid and also to the ... in in in the two of his call to the whole rise of coup fool next to it it's the um the you know the the copper is great so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid\nSo they call that cover is great and who was driven was called the lives of Google\nAnd so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot so and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is declaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou earn the pyramid yeah you would expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have but but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction\nAnd forget about the other ... about how it was built or who built it or the year was built you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that it is very computer all\nThe way to have auditors um you know fifth century but see now this was in during Persian rule um two thousand years after the fact and and what it is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know you're saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plot so and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up to box but\nYou would think that he'll just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just is confusing is the great things yet we also have those same issues and if it wasn't for the dream Stella while and the inventory Stella we may not know anything at all\nBut yes\nThe world the dream still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn of a um twentieth century that may be ... most of the fourth who is the author of the dream so between the positive things that he is the one who built it that was actually being debated\nUm but ah and there is a there is a small\nReference to cooperate but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that he does definitely does not say that he built it\nUm and so that's the dream still at the end mentors the law the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that what ... what I think ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same at the ... the Greek name Cooper was the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that the human towards the ... says very under critically would Kuiper came to the part two oldest things already exist that in fact it was broken he repair it and then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid of his queen Knutson\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now this coast to coast am primarily to be church or get my news said ... and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nMoney to ... and I just log on Tuesday in\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nOur guest is my new said Sunday and my new uh we were talking about the inventory still in the dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dreams download briefly before we start to move forward and end the dreams della\nA top most the forum says mentions and in illustrates two stinks is there and desert box just tweeted is there a second ... thinks\nWell there's two things is there I Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second ... being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a ... is there a second stinks\n... it's a great question um uh so that was for that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the seconds things uh as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question and it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed things\nAre and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is a ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nThese depictions are um you know they're on mistake of all so so the answer to this question specific golf course it hasn't been found there is\nThere are stories uh Arab historians referred to an actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build mosques so they're they're apparently was physical things\nAre on the other side of denial but it's there are things buried under the fans are that the west of a conference pyramid it's possible\nThe\nAim in tore Stella you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repaired this beings but build the great pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just a repair guy but then he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why the discrepancy\nYeah uh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned is yet of course Egypt colleges most Egypt causes do not accept the inventories de la as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we culture there's arguments so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so to your question\nUm the ah you have to go to a texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS and the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egypt she means to be a means repeat again and\nIf you combine that symbol with the with the ... the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the ... the combination is pet him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a a is a is a strip affects where you know the pyramid building is mentioned and the the verb that this is not further\nA qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuilt\nUm is that a hundred percent poof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the ... of ... that was found in ... in the right to see\nYou know they're saying well you okay this is the hardest talks about to a store and being ... a ship that he's a a but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course has done a who you mean it was a ... interview your hat within the other day he made a good point you said that uh he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was backfield\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour I took ... that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up to courses and then you back so later so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind about it\nAnd there was a quite a bit of relatives are you a pyramid like who who was dealing with uh also wanted to use a plateau why they could there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramids\nThere are you oh you mean in the human torso yes\nYes there is a there is a reference to a new thing I'm Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who is in Newton so she was supposedly is queen\nAnd uh he built a pair of it for her the southern most of the three ah off the three uh queen ... that are on in the field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but\nIn the human towards though it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting just because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a print says so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that she I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we we think is the who shows that she was a princess so that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then there's mentions of ISIS\nSo that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then do you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or\nA an old Cyrus on this that law and that those are much further reasons why she pauses reject this though because they're saying\nYou know if this word ... story or at the time of coup who these ... ah you know ISIS on his eyes were not yet a work being worship there weren't not official states sanctions or in the eighties\nAnd we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nUm but you know it's it's a contentious I I don't want to make it sound like we have the outs or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nThere's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids\nAre crumbling they don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same hands with the same care right and those would be more simple to build and you would you would expect those to be just as elegant if even\nYou know more complex yeah but they're not and they're the stone work is is is just awful\nYeah well they I so the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know dropped off there still owns\nAnd so what we're seeing are is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just call me that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality\nOf you know they're smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I but I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old King I'm I'm a you know middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the workman ship definitely declined um after the old kingdom\nNow let's get to a what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yes after we have been told over and over again\nAnd it just it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there well clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is what are the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing um and and what I liked about it is that it was non invasive um you didn't have to drill holes you didn't have to you know like a\nA ... the early explorers they used dynamite sticks to blow themselves into these monuments which was awful and nowadays uh it's kind of like the pyramid is telling us you know you wait until you have the technology to to find out about me or without destroying me and I think now we're getting to that point\nAnd that's also what I wanted to do I want to really get some information out of the pyramid without you know are putting my hand on of course the ... government is protecting the monuments and I completely agree with that they're making it very difficult for you know invasive studies to be done because they want to protect the monuments and\nTalk nine Seventy Seventy\n\nSaudi Arabia threatened to retaliate if the U.S sanctions on name Anthony Fox news\nWe're going to get to the bottom of it and it will be ... to me or

the subject of the show tonight\nUh you and a Robert football and Robert shock sat down and started discussing uh the the snakes and published that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\n... yeah well you know this is a this goes back to override mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the two gentlemen and yet the authors um I I was a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah builds that three pyramid a and a line and and want it to align them with a three belt stars for when they had to be some kind of record and you know it was it causes believe that uh the architect of the great care of it the first of all of the three it was you know\nAnd so I looked at the stature I started looking at the statue of humor when they were looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceived it that way\nAnd and so while I so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of the line that's on that are on the pedestal if that statue\nUm I notice that and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the uh the book the that they just have coauthored origins of the things which is an amazing book by the way it is\nYeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section is developing a you know something that he knows all the dreams the law which is you know in front of the parts of the

things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the Puritans were built if there was a things then it's it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remembered the lying is on the pedestal\nOne thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page Robert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or at the um\nI think it was positive origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast and I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out less than a minute and\nWe uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight yeah why is it that the well the gays applied to in general but you had the great pyramid the grades things\nAre two things that dominate

away so there's no way you can say that um that he does definitely does not say that he built it\nUm and so that's the dream still at the end mentors the law the other hand is very direct it

I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same as the ... the Greek name who posed the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that the mentors the law says very under critically when ... came to the ... things already exist that in fact it was broken he regarded and then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid of his queen

great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nMuch more of us and I just log on to go see him\n\n\n\n\nOur guest is my new said Sunday and my new uh we were talking about the inventory Stella and the dreams della right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward and in the dream stolen\nA top most foreign says mentions and in illustrates two things is there\nAnd desert Fox just tweeted is there a second ... thinks\nWell there's two things his there I Know there Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second scenes being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a ... is there a second Spanx\nIf a great question on a so that was that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the seconds things uh as the celestial springs in other words the constellation Leo [noise]\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question it's a good point um there are actually depictions off a double headed things\nAre and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is a ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nAnd these depictions are um you know they're on unmistakable\nSo so the answer to this question specific golf course it hasn't been found there is but there are stories uh Arab historians referred to an actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build mosques\nSo they're they're apparently was physical things\nAre on the other side of denial but is there are things buried under the fans are that the west of a conference pyramid it's possible\nThe\n... you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repaired this beings but builds the great pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just to repair guy but then he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why the discrepancy yeah\nUh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as he had of course Egypt poses a most causes do not accept the inventories he has a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we counter this argument so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so it to your question\nUm the uh you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egyptian means to be a means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the ... the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the ... the combination is pet him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a a is a is a strip of ... where you know the pyramid building is mentioned and the the verb that this is not\nFurther a qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuilt\nUm is that a hundred percent poof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the ... of ... that was found in ... in the right to see you know they're saying well you okay this is the ... talks about to a store and being ... a ... a\nA but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states and what it actually states is that ... was\nBeing shipped to ease up of course has done a who was a ... interview you within the other day he made a good point you said that\nAh he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was backfield\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour I took ... that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up the courses and then you back so later so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind about it\nAnd there was a quite a bit of relatives are you ah you know pyramids that coup who was dealing with uh also one of the games are plateau right could there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramids\n... are you oh you mean in the human torso yes\nYes yes there is a there is a reference to a hit Knutson\nUm Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who is the new things so she was supposedly is queen\nAnd uh he build a pyramid for her the southern most of the three ah off the three a queen permits that are on an empty field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid and um\nBut in the mentors though it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting to spell out because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a princess so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that she I in fact was a princess or at least that we're saying we we think it's the poop shows that she was a print says so that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then there's mentions of ISIS and hot or\nA an old Cyrus on this Stella and that those are much further reasons why Egypt poses reject this though because they're saying\nYou know if this word ... story or at the time of coup who these ... ah you know I sort of size we're not yet a work being worship we're not official states sanctions or in the eighties\nAnd we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nUm but you know it's it's a contentious I I don't want to make it sound like we have the U.S or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nAnd then there's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids are crumbling they don't even looked like they were built by the same engineers or by the same answer with this\nKnow for\nTrump versus sixty minutes I'm name Anthony Fox news\nNever knew how dishonest media was I I I really mean I'm not saying that as a soundbite\nAnd let's see me as his lovely song on what on several issues including immigration\nEven when you left
