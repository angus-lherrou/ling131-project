A. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com call now\nIn Christian prophecy even that shows that what's on the other side of this revelation will completely changed the concept and leave behind even the identity of what was the Christian what it was to be Muslim what it was to be Buddhist all of that will be left on this side of the door\nAnd what's on the other side is completely different that's all I can do right now\nI I Can't look ... by without asking you about the middle east and then we'll start taking phone calls and winding up your for you but what's your take pathetically on what's going to happen in the middle east with Syria and Iran and this whole situation\n[noise] well it's unfortunately with all the things we've been talking about specifically since twenty fourteen when I alerted yuan coast to coast and everybody about how we are now in Cold War two point Oh yes\nAnd how it it follows the prophetic a place where the flashpoint as the middle east I mean one of the one of the ten predictions I made in ten production for this year was how we'd come much closer to a a war with Iran that's happened [noise]\nUm Syria is an ally of Iran and it is always long story short the\nThe not Saddam's prophecies that are quite clear about this is the two eagle kings of the north get pulled in this as a Russian double eagle and the American bald eagle ... countries get pulled in because of their allies their vessels\nWhich are described in an anagram as Arab vessels by by dialing Rob in in French\nOr that that kind of a rebel against their their their masters and drag Russian America into a war\nAnd that can happen with the issue of Iran even last few twenty four hours is there we've rescinded a peace treaty that we've had with Iran since Nineteen fifty five of course it was with their dictator the Shaw after we overthrew their government two years earlier that was democratically elected\nThat doesn't get told you in the u._s. press\nWho by most of the deck right most\nOf their yeah CIA took him down to help the British Petroleum I turned ... teams are Iranian oil [noise] and then they helped train the survivor which is as worse as bad as the gift shop on Germany and terrorize the people as one of the reasons why the Islamic\nThat's why they threw the shah ...\nYes and so so this bad comedy here and we're basically blindsided to our side or in this and we need to take a look at how we kind of gotten here ...\nNow so so we have a situation with ... which really got me concerned in August where it's the last province where fifty thousand al ... affiliates\nWho we've been supporting\nNot just the city in Syria for\nSyria yeah we're going to make their last stand against the Syrian Arab Army and the Russian air force\nAnd the Turks were also involved what happened in eleventh hour just before it started is um aired organ of ... or ... the president of turkey and Leonard who hadn't got together and made a pact\nTo not do the offensive to create a buffer zone a demilitarized zone and take the time to do something to help the people the three million people half of which are are are\nAre refugees all crowd that area and it was a horrible but what's good about that is it's it's an attempt not to have this thing happened I Know from my sources that there were a lot of uh the ... stage and film the White Helmets and who are basically al ... is a A R [noise]\nUh had already taken children and use them and some gas attack that says story I'm trying to track down\nAnd we're going to be broadcast is still is he started as a once again another false flag that Syrian regime had chemical weapon eyes them and that would have caused ah [noise] you\nKnow we have thirty Russian warships as this time around and the the uh near equal number of American ships crowding eastern Mediterranean long story short we have a lot of military potential in a tight area that if a miscalculation happened they could get serious\nAnd and so and then one thing can lead to another into a\nNuclear confrontation I mean the missiles of\nThe missiles of October in sixty two could become the missiles of October ...\nIn sixty two could become the missiles of October twenty Eighteen or twenty Nineteen [noise]\nUm the astrology kind of points to and some of the deadlines Nostradamus gave to a long and short deadline if if we kind of move up what may be the official start of the Cold War when the Russians announce they achieved a parity in March first this year\nThey delayed they're putting delayed his address to the nation Russia and any so he could see what what the military changes the rules of engagement was going to happen with the Americans\nHe I I actually quoted law the speech and it shows it's very interesting look at how we've\nBeen an arms race again with Russia because we pulled out of the ab a missile treaty\nAnd which was a seriously destabilizing move to unilaterally do long story short they had to create a new system of of weapons that could be a deterrent to was surrounding Russia steadily with a Eddie ballistic missile batteries\nTo basically be able to shoot down their missiles so they couldn't defend themselves\nA very very destabilizing move a hardly reported\nSo the Russians declared in March first it pretty much we're in this Cold War and they have now made a parity you know interestingly enough fruit and drops ten billion dollars off the eighty billion dollar budget of the Russian defense\nThe same time Trump adds another thirty seven billion to something that's passed seven hundred billion if you add the other side to it were really spending one point one trillion dollars [noise]\nUh on defense spending in our military ironically it's half of what\nUS people produce monetary lead GDP every year which is exactly what happened at\nThe same time when the Soviet Union collapsed\nIt was paying half of its money into its big military uh and it collapsed we're doing the same thing so\nUh it it it reminds me of prophecies of ... spirit was channeled by studio ... and ... who is considered the Swedish Edgar Casey Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd um because he channeled similarly and trance and he ... he would say things like ah you'll see the one side of the Cold War with China and Russia have become more free in America would become more like the Soviet Union and least in this economic sense\nThat's true ah with more censorship it's happening to alternative voices you know the that's also a ... I Would say for my own experience with journalism that we are definitely looking more and more like Soviet Union I grew up with than the country I grew up with\nNo that's that's true in in ... in the last minutes we have before the break them will take final calls next half hour you're writing a book about celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain who committed suicide ... this this intrigues me why are you doing this\nWell I've been watching ... two thousand five I've learned so much about his unique rebellious but really an unorthodox way of\nKind of dragging me along to see the world many of the same places I ate and then my travel ... kind of taking us through a journey through the stomach\nTo really meet with people when people break break bread they they they it it's a connection it's ... it's well I was saying earlier in the show how we can we need to talk to each other rather than polarized both\nHave a big bank would have all the red Republicans with blue Democrats break bread together like Anthony would do so anyway\nI watch the show I also saw this brilliant man his doing what a lot of potentially brilliant people and he's also a seeker a spiritual seeker in a true sense because he wasn't buying into\nEasy a rationales of belief he was really questioning things and of course seeing the world like he was he was seeing the darker sides of it as well\nAnd it wasn't a surprise to me that he committed suicide because I feel\nAs much as I Love him I also had a similar things issues in my own\nLine really let's talk about that John when we come back in the moment and then we'll take your calls those have you on hold just hang right there\nNever was a detail in the show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com [noise]\nTV room gas us on the dot com and download the human ... absolutely and I do go us on deed on common since my now that us ... all access it it's not us on TV it's just a hoax\nStone sang like canning accounts

nation cancer we stayed [noise]\nLittle things and learn everything stance ... supply he starts at ... ... am\nOn a news talk radio Katie WN and Katie Jay\n\nAnd welcome back coast to coast George story with you John ... with us uh we'll get to your calls in just a second I just have one more area to talk with John about and he's writing a book about the lead celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and boy\nYou sparked my interest John because it sounds like you had a very a similar situation what happened\nI did it's really a a tale of two suicides a and both of us committed suicide the reason I Am speaking to you is because\nMy experience with suicide was a spiritual suicide rather than the usual what I call mundane suicide ... most people encounter\nUm basically in the mundane suicide I contend that you end up with your pain destroying the body mind that you're that you're mystery of solace living in\nBut in the suicide that happened to me rather than the one that I was indeed mundane Lee going to do [noise]\nI saw my misery and my pain commit suicide and I remained [noise]\nAnd so this is one of my most intimate autobiographical tales of the whole other dimensions of\nMy life from all these years I've never known this way I was\nI was I was walking through a golf course in San Pedro California I just come back from India and I was still in the tender opening kind of broke out of my shell of\nMany lives being with my my teacher in India for the first time and when I came back in the world the world that was not a place that supported this kind of individual flowering and I was having a very bad day\nAnd so I was walking down this beautiful beautiful a golf course adjacent to the trailer park I Lived in\nA overlooking Santa Catalina island in San Pedro cliffs and that's what I was walking it just dawned on me says I could just keep walking or be on these cliffs and plummet down three hundred feet into the rocks\nAnd I was going to do it because suddenly\nIce had this amazing unexpected experience of life and death suddenly being very tangible unclear I got to see how they're really one they're really they're play of compliment trees or in our fear they're a play of terror and opposites\nBut what was happening to me the feeling was that try to describe it but it's beyond birds really beyond belief\nIndeed it was like um it was descending on me faster than myself and I thought okay this is happening because I have made the decision to throw myself walk over this cliff\nIf I turn away from this I'm going to lose this amazing experiences over taking me this mystery of life meeting death\nSo I saw this little eucalyptus tree and I sat\nUp against and I said okay for throwing myself over I just wanted to feel this and take this with me over the edge\nAnd so I sat there just going inside and feeling it at some point I felt this electrical energy just rise above the ground through the roots of the tree and throw me forward face down into the crab grass or I just began sobbing sobbing and suddenly\nAll of that thank God all of that so that otherwise I wouldn't be killing ... no not at all\nUh and and there was this moment after I cried it all out I turned and there was a little eucalyptus trees and it was just shivering it sleeves in Santa Ana wind and it was just this moment where ... sky the earth tree existence love me existence see\nEverything that's created out of it as a phenomenal creation rising and falling as something absolutely integral significant\nAnd I had this feeling that so much of what society does to make us feel insignificant when you go in even at that moment of life meeting death insignificant becomes in significant\nI it's so the story is really an ... it's a it's a jump from what I usually right about it's a whole other level of talking about these things that I haven't done since I did the messiah is a book back in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSometimes my these books you see I I don't write these books they right they use me to write themselves and\nI had no idea until Anthony Bourdain died\nHow deeply he his his suicide how much he was loved and how many many people were shocked in the story I talk about the moment that inspired me to write this book I'm In a cashiers line\nAnd there's this old lady and she's doing something looks like she's never done before she's pulled actually a magazine out of the rack and looks at it at the people magazine of an seaboard Dane and I watched how she touched his cheek on the picture the way she did it was so intimate\nAnd beautiful and that's when I realized yeah I Love him just as much and I think I think I understand what he was going through\nHe was not a man to believe or in\nFairy tales and imaginary stuff and that Santa Claus is going to save him from his ... and all that it's really pretty practice and and and and people like that when they die and I always feel there's a person that has the potential to become a an awakening one\nAnd I as I have been in my private life which I'm sharing more and more now in this period especially now when there's so much turmoil when there's so much\nA mixed and polarity my inner life now as a meditate or is now coming more and more into my work because it is still ... point this center of silence in peace in the cycle of life that's becoming stronger and stronger that\nIs what I can share with all of you meditation the science of self observation is is what what more and more I always thought my\n... is is what what more and more I always thought my my work with evil more and more and it's still prophetic but it's going to have more of my own authority through my own experiences\nFuture let's take some phone calls here in the ten minutes we got left Thomas in ... John Home Tom\nHi George thank you for taking my call and John while [laughter] it's hard to follow your sharing of your experience somehow but my question John yes for a person to walk in the world to be a participant in the world\nHow can they develop their own centered mess so to speak such that they are not enough what dead on a fact dead on touch my personal and planetary astrology\nWell what I can only suggests and I think only anyone who's honest and heart to heart with anybody is all I can suggest as my own experiences the meditation techniques that I've been using since Nineteen eighty\nAnd ah so my answer to that is if any of you listening to this resonate with what I've been saying [noise]\nEspecially with the issue of suicide in life meeting death [noise] um I Am on a path where I can say there is a way to look beyond and not be touched you can be passionate and deeply into life but you're not overwhelm jury you can be a Buddha and the market place but not of the marketplace of the world\nAnd that was what my teacher talk show and that is what I've live since Nineteen eighty since I went to India to see him for the first time and so with that said if you go to

didn't have any qualities attributes of characteristic that normal people have this war began to feel like I was blessed George\n... ah you had to work with these kids who appreciate that that is when I started trying to pay back for just being normal so I thought a prayer life I always had a career like when I saw the ... all the prerequisites for white had this ... I mean it is for kids that have nothing going from I even had some kids in my classes I had these\nTerrible Kansas and I would draw for them and they always they want the joy so I Would give them like coloring books in crayon and they would try so hard to keep those those those are cut that the ... in in the lines are with numbers more\nBut some of them had says terrible if your Kansas said they would rule follow in ... or a coloring they withdrew in ... was in school you were at well I was just\nIt was yeah I mean the special ed teacher had different classes you know and just happened to be in these classes it was yeah children like that okay\nAnd what would we clean it up for them it was nothing to rule because they did that all day long and it didn't mean anything to them er and er so anti but you know they learned a skill that they were never going to use or you know there was no really cure for them back then even tell you just really no cure\nSo as a special ed teacher had a lot of time in my hand and the kids needed two hours for lunch for the teacher said would help feed them\nUh there's no papers to correct\nThe bigger kids that hadn't been in the room used to move back as long as I enrolled us you know when you see a tractor trailer pull up to a warehouse and they put out there was a sign roles and they put the boxes on him to shut them down and you know there's a lot of them don't you know yeah so this is this still supply I enrolled us\nIn my class I'd line up the kids\nI think that we can get it box but it on the line well he was flooded out to the next kid they because they would open it up is flooded down to ... put something on the side of down to the next ... tape it you know so that's what they did if I had plenty of time so she was I Know how to park and so I had bought into the nightclubs and I believe this is a real prerequisite of what why they steam and came to this house\nWhen you're doing one or two jobs John\nYeah I mean I think it's best that they didn't take up much of my time at a two hour lines I didn't have papers to correct you know so I decided you know it gets going to do this too so um\nYeah so uh uh ... you know people at night and look at all I Know a lot of 'em real stand that people but there was a certain percent of people out in the dark side of things these people like little wicked have control of course the alcohol or drugs or commit adultery looking for anything they can get their hands on\nAnd the good parts in these people were atheists they went to the coast a little bit\nMe to it I can get along with anybody I can relate to anybody and this type of behavior the enemy ... over the years I noticed that a lot of these people die from accidents like car accidents overdoses suicide cancers\nAnd ... and I find that with these people in and they knew them you know but I felt that these people like ships in the night without a rider any way that I Would take them to do with a ... or the wind was blowing that was fine with them and they die mistake that I thought nobody should die\nIn the last rings unusually high\nYeah unbelievable and so um yeah I just didn't think they knew how to live

can't coach so he couldn't work anymore so I tried to visit in between my you know going from school my school job and my night job or we work together I mean it was like a friend you know I Know you had all these problems but you didn't know that ...\nI Know it had this ... yeah it's about forty years in a in a few months and he died within a few months but that would go visit them and I would try to talk to him about God but he wasn't interested at all and he was even more busier now George because of the diagnosis he had died he died in such a terrible state he died in the state and I want you to die and\nUh I I felt like helpless form now in my religion to has been told that people fall into hell like snowflakes from the sky especially if there's no one to pray for them\nSo I started praying for him and all these other people that I knew in bonded with and they felt they were friends of mine that would ask God you know don't send these cells to held it unless you go to hell until I finished praying for them\nNo matter how long ago it gives me on this planet no matter how many grains of sand they still got less than an hour glass that's what I was going to do and I believe now that was the prerequisite of why this human creature this compelled to possess my house\nAnd they'll build up mosaic through your piece by piece right down there every single detail\nKnow do what we can really as you well let me ask you this little job to do this demon smaller you to the house basically or was it already there\nAbsolutely not absolutely not really I've never had like a and I've never you know I never had a ... invited to speak to here I never had\nAnd I've never you know I never had ... invited to speak to here I never had to say on I never use a week he bought or I never use terror card I mean I I Believe that opens the door for me to like this to come in and I don't think anybody does that because I now I think\nIf you were allowed to speak to come in hillbilly you harm I think you're committing him it was worse you know you're the only other time you had\nNo there's no doubt if you if you invited in each coming\nYeah that's what I Believe now but you did in violence is\nAbsolutely not I've learned a lot from it I learned that it has a methodology will discuss that too but the only other really other time [noise] ah well you know I thought that I worked in ... that's why I wrote that book anyhow that's the best selling book and then if you're interested in any of that do have some funny stories about the rapid Chris Brown\nThat's such a topic we don't touch we don't let which we don't we don't get into that topic oh okay [laughter]\nBut anyway people probably why it was basically what you've seen on the outside but go ahead\nYeah OK study on the other time that I ever\nKnew about a person who encountered it he meant that I Believe was because my brother my brother Paul he we had this a rare a blood disease that runs in the family and my my thought that was unfortunate to get it and it killed them very early in the sixties had heart ...\nThank God rather was unfortunate for you to get are you OK yet but she has me\nAre you are right yeah what with the ... disease oh I haven't\nI I've been back with that yeah oh yeah ah the doctor who well let me tell you what happened to call you and I'll tell you\nSo poorly racked up and he had the same symptoms like that at Penn State out nine one one they can they come and they take 'em to the hospital and\nAt the hospital he dies on a hospital bed and when I went to ... and later on me on it you know and I heard that he died on the hospital but after the doctors told me sit down and when I died on a hospital bed I left my body\nIs that I left my body and I watched that doctors frantically it and they're ... trying to get me back to life again if they'd be late and not uncommon and\nYeah and the alarms going off and that like when I talk about that\n... mentioned a spiritual dimension he step into that room and he was still he still thought he was in a hospital room you could see what was going on with his body isn't that hospitable he said to me it and it and then there was a dark side of that room he said and demus came from a small team is not like\nBig ones like three for for for toys I came to me\nAnd it would ... me and it was starting to hold me answer that dark area of the room which I which I say that because they have a ... type and I believe that where we overlap him at fifth dimension and uh they were dragging him into that talks romance and I finally got back to life he was able to get back into his body\nAnd he had to make daddy why didn't even though I'm not really that big of a person that you know I don't understand ...\nWhy would even call me and I was like boy I really don't know\nUh I don't know if anybody but no I Know that you know all of us are right at the same way like I said you know got a religion ... confirmed in our religion he was too but he dropped out and okay and they didn't go to church anymore okay he met a woman he didn't really married what okay again I tell them you know you got kids\nThat you never gave them a religion could anyone you can't even ... one\nOne prayer maybe it's like a ... not well I well I don't know maybe get a big kick in your but sometimes when you when you're passing to that ...

encounter with a devil that I Believe that you know I Know my brother wouldn't lie to me about it\nAnd he wasn't really a bad person I mean okay he left his religion like we talked and then he he lived his when he didn't get married to him and he raises kids they didn't have a religion so\nUh you know I felt that may be but he said you know to me ... you know when I died on that hospitals that I left my body I watch the doctors frantically trying to get me back to\nLife again with the fifty ladies and the nurses running back and forth sticking things my aunt and you could hear the alarms going off it was but he was in that like that they mentioned that overlapping dimension I guess\nAnd he said there was like a duck part of that room which probably never was there when he was in the hospital but when he was in that overlapping to mention there he says even came for him and he asked me what why to demons ... man I was like for a really don't know why why you know I just don't know how to explain that either\nI I never had this problem I never had a problem like this before uh before I had this adverse and in my house\nBut ah I Wonder about his lap and he's like he's completely one hundred and eighty degrees turn man he's a very religious man now\nThis experience scared the heck on moving\nA cab them better believe it I mean to actually\nBe dying dying and then\nYou know leave your body that's something you know he's going to remember his ya may still young guys only like forty years always got a lot of life ahead of it but he now has a very religious person but ah he encountered this statement but the one that I Can't that was very different like I tell you the the ...\nYou know what was the first episode for huge on the demon showed up one yeah\nYeah okay so let me explain to I live in New Jersey like the middle of New Jersey right in the ... area I have a house it sounded like an acre property\nHoboken argue\nAlthough [laughter] pretty far from there is a good hour or so are you from hulk Hogan and no\nNo she's not sure what to do [laughter]\nOh yeah [laughter] well I was born in Brooklyn that that that far from home but now I live in New Jersey so Oh yes oh I just wanted to say because I had a best selling book I was able to retire and I didn't have to work with those I Love those kids believe me\nBut I ... I I stopped working but may not have to work at ... I guess you just stop\nAnd I stopped ... bought something at night and I love bartending at night but er and that but I stopped but I still know about those people and I still pray for those people and that's a big ... big prerequisite of why I had the separation\nSo now I'm In New Jersey now so I'm doing fine yeah I have a very uh elaborate for life uh I I retired from my like my job as a special ed teacher retires that not working at night and I miss those people a lot too\nAnd I have this nice house and it sounded like ... okay about a hundred and fifty feet from the street is on a hill you come into the house and the the garages are under the house and you pull your car into the left and you go into the garage is in the back door the as you come into the garage\nAnd then between the garage is George and the basement is this big indoor\nAnd other ... I have three boys here growing up and I think a little bit bigger they wanted to a little more room so I had the basements finished and uh I cut it in half and I had the apartment filled down there so my first wife gets older he wants to more space uh he moved down there yeah you have your own interest\nYou pull your own spot to come and go as you want to say yes\nYes it was nice so then he goes to college anymore that second boy watched as parliament and so he takes it he goes to college and moved out my third boy he watched that a farm and he ... he was in there he he was he had this whole time so he's a when I had\nTo he was smart one free rent\n[laughter] yeah well I didn't mind you I Believe that we had this big house and then like when he he he went to college he moves out but he got a job\nAnd then he said you know can I moved back home I just want to start my own business as they come back home because I mean we got its big house and my wife has this empty nest syndrome sure you know what I mean so I I like having a ... a company to somebody to come upstairs and have dinner with you once in a while when when you saw him he wasn't home that much but he's moved out since then you've got a great often took us but anyway he's here the whole\nTime so that the upstairs and so in the basement you come in that that I enjoy this step that go up to the kitchen\nWas a big kitchen the okay if you're in the case and you can almost hear that or an enclosed\nAnd the next to the kitchen is living ... most of the time George and uh that's what I like to I I go to the gym in the morning to meditate in the afternoon I meditating at night and meditate so I have a pretty long for a life that I took I did get back to my artwork because I Am good at that as a small little towns that God gave me you know\nSo uh I'm doing that and everything's fine to it for years\nAnd I've been praying for the last cells that I felt well last fills every day for years and I was like I said I'm going to do that until whatever time I have left here so everything's fine\nOh and then had bank yeah so then yeah I'm sitting I'm sitting in the liver and that I into\nA downstairs I'm by myself and I hear that I into her ex slam lucky you normally wouldn't even hear it some in the in the living room right here it's like it never was lamb before and I'm thinking to myself\nAnd you know somebody's open\nOh absolutely you in the house at twenty five years you know every noise in the house you know\nSo I'm thinking I said what what's out there but I don't think my wife could even if she came home and sleep that like I don't even think he gave slam that do that hard\nAnd maybe my son can I don't know why he was dude I looked at a car accident or the girlfriend broke up with them or something like that so I'm thinking what is that I get up I go to the kitchen I looked downstairs usually when somebody comes in down near the puts up with the lights on still talk to you so I go into ... and I have a\nA surveillance system here right they look into the cameras and I roll back the cameras ten Fifteen twenty minutes I have nobody was on the property I look at the cameras that face the garage doors nobody nobody open those garage doors and look at the camera the faces that door into back nobody went through that back door ... and or\nWhat you put your distinctly hurdle\nOh absolutely slam no like slant\nI didn't know what at the time that we're going to discuss this this creature was using his methodology on me and had a message wasn't it was telling me that wasn't here for social call it wasn't passed them through with\nAnd I explained that in a minute so I go I look in the cameras nobody was on a property in the basement I got\nI got bars on windows but you can get out as a you know if there was a fireman how can you disarm lock them and jumped out too so I Know he couldn't get anybody if somebody was trespassing I couldn't see them so I cos I turn the lights on in the basement and I go down to the basement not looking everywhere\nAnd you you're pretty convince you think somebody's in the house don't you\nOh absolutely no actually but I the only problem is but when I'm looking around I feel like I've been in the past twenty five years I feel is menacing sinister I'm In is like the only word to describe this like evil like an\nEvil just then I ...\nYeah I'm looking everywhere I look down to the steps and like any where somebody could squeezed himself into behind a washer and dryer in my son's room underneath his bed in his closet you know in the furnace who am I look I look at my frantic look and I still have this horrible feeling\n[noise] so I'm thinking well I I Know I looked at some satisfy looking to the cameras nobody came and nobody broken but I still have this really menacing sinister feeling that come upstairs and hit them\nAnd I'm thinking about it and then I you know then all of a sudden I hear\nThis wedding steps between the basement and and and in the kitchen and here's something I really heavy because like I could hear when my wife comes up to seven hundred and twenty pounds my son comes up the steps\nThe it's like I could hear when my wife comes up to seven hundred and twenty pounds my son comes up to ... hundred and Seventy pounds I Know what those steps down where you get something very silly crossing those steps and thinking to myself I just shut down here you know nothing was here\nOr somebody coming up the ... [noise]\nYeah I feel something very heavy slowly coming up the steps I get up again I go over that I look there's nobody there\nSo I'm thinking we were you harmed her own armed at this time I I have I have a a registered gun you know he did okay\nBut I but I didn't see anything so you know what I mean I looked in the cameras that look through the cat was if I ever saw something that I Know I I didn't feel like a you know but I don't think of I I kinda was wondering if that had that feeling of something very menacing sinister\nAnd I think it is but could this possibly thing but then I tried to shake it hooks us because he like I've just the guy I don't think that's you know it's\nGoing to ask what John where are you convinced that there was this creature demon in the house\nOr when it actually I actually had the ... but I Want to try to build up to that before actually tell\nMe we're running out of time so we're going to get to really yeah oh ... or do we have another hour though yeah we're taking calls an hour\nOh okay so okay so my wife comes home he said if it's the first thing she says she comes in is like a\nA a you know it's everything All right with you or is everything right where they have to feel something really weird in this house and it's like yeah I Do too low you know but I don't know how to explain it but she says she's sitting there and I didn't know one of the time that this this creature who was here with Sally was telling us is here is is is that in the house is in control of the house it was using his methodology on and", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Show Low", "day": "04"}
