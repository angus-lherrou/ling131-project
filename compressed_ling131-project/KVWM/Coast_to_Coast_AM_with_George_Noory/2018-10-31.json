Peter ... this is our final segment strange frequencies the name of his latest book what's on tap next to Peter\n[noise] gosh that's a really good question I think I Want to see if I can find enough you know my last book was about rock and roll this book is about technology I Wonder if I can explore this and some other way some other part of our culture and our human experience\nLet's send some ... here for you as they continue ruling in Joe in the Bronx age oh go ahead\nGeorge ... hall is well\nGood yeah uh Peter you mentioned earlier that you didn't think that spirits possessed vocal cords\nSo I had an experience or when my brother visited me or if the passed away um [noise]\nThat immediately after the passed away but several years later I'm I was having brightest block on the singer songwriter and ah I was stuck on a a song without uh any uh you know a inspiration\nComing to me at the moment and it was during the day and he uh he walked past it for them I did\nAnd he said just get it done so at that but it ... you're saying that uh they don't possess a way to generate their own voices that that's why they're using technology than hell was that voice generated\nYeah I mean that's just another experience I mean I I don't say that I was I was commenting on what people who are based on what a Jew and had said that even the pie researchers might respond to her idea\nThat indeed there couldn't be voices but certainly or experience is one which thousands and thousands of people throughout history and had\nYou know and I got to tell you Peter that uh you know since people have been investigating goats and haunting from the other side for so many years do you find that these sightings are more prevalent now or are the less than before\n[noise] well I think it feels more prevalent because we have access to information that you know so quickly so I think everything feels like it's more because you can hear about it more more often\nBut certainly there is an increase in general I think in an interest in um alternative spirituality you know I'm you know there's a a huge increase and an interest in with a\nAnd Neal paganism right now I'm a lots of people who are experimenting and reading about writing about witchcraft\nUm so I just think that overall there's an increase in people's needs to be seeking\nUm some alternative ways of thinking about a spiritual experience but I Do think that we just live in an age where you know information is just overload enough and so certainly it feels like there's more but I think that either experience as a human beings have been having as long as we've been we've been on the earth\nTo go to Anthony in Asheville North Carolina first time caller for Cy Anthony\nHi George thanks for taking my call and tell you for your service fell and they'd be better at\nAll thank you you too\nUm I'll get right to it um my folks and I took a weekend vacation to Charleston a couple of years ago and they broke the old hotels for historic and kind of spooky would walk this [noise]\nAnd uh [noise] that Saturday Night or stay there and I had a strange dream where I I'm going to encounter to\nOther world we ... I could not describe them or they didn't have a warm but they had a presence and and um [noise] I said you argue and ah not not for a week but you know you're you're in the dream state so\nUm there there was communication that I Can't quite pinpoint either but there was a very clear conversation that very clear were used 'em\nI said are you an alien or are you in April there was one standing in the back and there was one that was communicating with me he said\nI Am an angel I Am an arcane journal and the only ... I was aware of it this time with Michael ... Michael he said no I Am ...\nI don't think very much of it woke up the next day my parents went to Penn math future um I don't practice so I decided to go for the city and um while they were there\nI'm not far from the ... which house I was sitting on a stone wall\nAfter I'd walk around a little bit of touching my breath and I see this old Anglican cemetery across wrote\nCalled St Michael cemetery so I take a stroll through there with all the old gravestones is really nice and I walk 'em up its place tatty corner sort of a at an intersection where\nYou can walk and truth from one side walk and exit on to another sidewalk which was Ninety degrees from it\nAnd I'm a walk through\nThe entire length of the trail there and whenever I caught the other exit I noticed that\nIn with cement and there wasn't any other one of the patient and the cement up until this point almost to the cemetery let's see so wrong strip in the Senate and it's up right now and so I Can't read it so I stopped crossing\nA turnaround I read it and it says ... ...\nAnd I know what you think about the ...\nYear you got an Anthony thinks greed synchronous Peter\nYes yes certainly I mean those are experienced a little bit outside my will house to be able to a comment on directly but I'd love to hear what you think George\nThese strange things happen all the time I I Am a staunch believer that there are\nStrange things happen all the time I I Am a staunch believer that there are no coincidences uh-huh I you know there's locked in things happened but I Believe that said takes over and does all these incredible things the sink when the cities of life\nAre done for a reason I mean it's it just happens\nI guess it's all about how we respond to them though correct yep absolutely how we pick 'em up see I think\nAll of us as individuals or centers and receivers\nOf information through telepathy through all kinds of vehicles and we're constantly doing this with individuals and the more and more you get to know somebody the more tuned in you are with them where you say something and they were about to ask you that question\nYou know what's in it happens and I'm sure Peter it happens with you\nOh absolutely I've been married for Twenty years it became one mind up half the time yeah\nIt really is Rick in Buffalo New York taken away Richard go ahead\nThe morning George wanting professor thanks so much for taking my call and I'm a I'm a I just want to chime in real quick on this whole angel thing I'm I'm I'm God believer a crisis follower and I make no bones about it uh obviously I come into this conversation with a little bit of a bias but\nUm I guess the cost and I wanted to get those those of us in the audience that are of like mind is that is to use caution with the amount of emphasis that you put on trying to seek out\nThe guardian angel aspect and and I guess we get dangerously close to worshipping the the angels in worshipping the people that God's putting our lives to help us\nI'm a father I've got a young kids and it wasn't until I got it that I really understood the whole concept of love like I Do now I Believe God loves us very very deeply so much so we can't even understand it and if my kid you know got hurt and got sick out whatever I needed a seeing eye dog for example\nAnd my kid loves the dog my kid loves the dog but then my kids love my dog that I gave him to help him get through his handicap more than he loves me I guess as a father and my heart would be heartbroken that I Would lose out on the full relations but I Would have with my kid and I guess to the extent that many of us try to\nSeek out the angels more than we seek out God the father of God the creator I guess there's a danger and losing a full relationship we can have with our God\nI think it's a different kind of love Rick I'm you know it's it's like with your children if you have three kids you love them all but differently\nPeter would you agree\nYeah yeah yeah and I think that it gets to you know why people are now ... with the idea of saint says well that they gave us and then it goes back to what we're talking about overall about how human beings really need a direct experience and I think you know\nNine Seventy Seventy for\nAnother immigration issue before the midterms I'm Carmen Robert Fox news President Trump\nFiring up the elections by targeting illegal

special guest professor slim king joins us\nTo talk about Harry Houdini for a moment here who did he was a Hungarian born American the illusion is stumped performer noted for\nHis sensational escape actually first attracted notice of vaudeville and the U.S\nAnd that is Sherry had ... on a tour of Europe where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up Sunni extended his repertoire to include chains ropes slung from\nSkyscrapers straight jackets underwater and having to escape from an old his breath and ... sealed milk can with the water in it\nNinety dull for thousands watched as he tried to escape from special handcuffs commissioned by London daily mirror keeping him and suspense for an hour and another ... buried alive only just able to ... himself to the surface or merge you know the state of near breakdown\nNow ... suspected that these escapes were faked Houdini presented himself as a scourge of fake spiritual is he was obsessed with trying to communicate with his dead mother and went through all kinds of mediums and people to find her he was not successful\nHe told his wife the best that when he died they will try to communicate he will try to come back\nHarry Houdini died on October thirty first Halloween Nineteen twenty six in Detroit Michigan\nOn October thirty first Nineteen thirty six ten years later that the Knickerbocker hotel in Hollywood, California they conducted a say on ... to try to find didn't reach Harry Houdini\nWho do you have one of the substance is that what happened yes yeah it was a\n... so it saps assault through they had two operations\nAnd then they gave him some mysterious serum that they'd been working on but nothing seemed to work\nDuring those seven days he had time to go over this afterlife experiment that he invests it worked out and they'd had it since the early Nineteen hundreds or since before Nineteen Thirteen they had this it's a two way code that they'd worked out if\nOne of them died that they would use this code contact each other and so he had a week it took him a week to pass away he was so strong\nAnd so they had a week together to fine tune this code and then about two years later she gets uh the actual code from Arthur forward\nNow how does our to forget the code what are the you know a a medium trans what happens\nIs Arthur Ford was a trance medium he wasn't like I'm a Marjory or you know the er which from and\nWhere would be ... or she's like was he was he liked Whoopi Goldberg in a post\nThat he just goes into he puts on a blindfold and goes to sleep okay like like Casey\nAll righty goes into that ...\nRight he just goes into a trance state they have to write down everything that happens and then he read later he doesn't really always remember what goes on attendance subconscious but he consciously doesn't really remember uh all the time what happened so they transcribe these fans so he started having these than says\nIn one of them he contacted Houdini some other about a year before this\nAnd then he starts having these dances and he starts getting the code now the Houdini messages actually in three parts it's one word than a nine words that spell another word and then she it's a two way code\nI'm Beth has five words in\nFrench that she says back to him uh-huh now does that make sense to you everybody I talked to a Ninety nine percent of them only think of a one way code you have you're on the other side one word or something you're going to get it across and then they're going to know that you're there but\nHoudini was sharper than that Houdini said listen I'm over on the other side I Want to make sure she gets the code that she's the one who gets right I Want to make its shirts her so she has five words in French that she gets back that come back to him\nSo this was an ingenious coat really at because it's take it's a ten it's like Fifteen words wow\nWhy why was Harry professor obsessed with either trying to come back spiritually or to even let everybody know what was going on\n[noise] well ah as you know Harry had to be first\nFirst had to escape\nRight here with us as Scott pollock just had to be first I don't know if you know that Harry was the first guy to fly an airplane and Australia\nYes he was that's true I heard him so\nHe had to be first in a matter of fact he did a great movie called the grim game about that so uh and he did several movies he he was really multi talented guy\nUm I think he would have been I think he would have had a movie um career you know mogul yeah it had he survived he invented what they call now the dailies uh in in the movie industry he invented that\nRussia cuts right\nYes so he was a you know awesome\nAnd all these different ways so he was going to be number one and if he had to come back from the grape to do it he was going to\nDo he was going to do it and do you think it was successful\nI I Know ... all I Know that the code and the message that he gave was exactly the same message that they that they had agreed upon you didn't know that for a fact did\nComfort professor bash his wife's\nBest was in tough shape ... best was pretty depressed that ... you know her husband had died\nAnd bass was um she had developed some what I Would consider bad habits she spent money like crazy and she uh\nWhile he was alive and after died while he was\nAlive and after he died and so\nIf you remember Nineteen twenty nine when the message came back ah all hell broke loose the none of her magic friends really wanted to believe that in any way\nAnd then later in the year the stock market crashes and she loses not only all her friends she loses all her money\nShe was arrested in the stock market yeah oh she loses\nShe loses all her money oh she was arrested in the stock market oh yeah oh\nShe loses the majority of her friends the majority of her money and now she's got this bad habit of spending money like a grows on trees she just\nAnd I guess Harry left or nice little sum huh\n[noise] yeah he liked her a part of the uh they pay double a in Denver or whatever for his ah\nInsurance insurance the insurance was twenty five thousand dollars\nWhich in Nineteen thirty six it's probably a lot of money that\nRight product that's close to a million dollars um so\nThey doubled that because they said it with an axe that because it's got punched and so it was the insurance company that came up that uh that can happen you can't get appendicitis from being punched and so they were proven wrong in court\nSo she got a thousand so she was rolling into now and then she they put it all in a market and she lost at all now\nYou have heard of the curse that killed Houdini yes what is the curse\n[noise] now Houdini had a three part show the first part of the show with magic mhm second part with the FTC apology scape we're doing gate\nThat was where the water or Chinese water torture cell or the uh the milk can skate and then the last part towards the end of his career he would go after the spiritual life and he would have had this um confrontation with them ... itself like confrontation right\nWell at some point in time\nHe would say I've had enough and he would get up during the third part you would go out to a palm reader of somebody or a\nOr that he considered fake and you would go in there and all the reporters and everybody to be following him and he go in and find a couch or something and they pull out like an incandescent down that goes in the dark or some of the I found it I got you you know and and they're\nProbably attached to a string or something like that\nRight so ... and of course the the medium so just what a what do you do it and that I didn't I have nothing to do it that\nWell they honestly didn't because\nI I'm a magician and a magician always has what you're calling out there's always a way out you work it into your magic trick if you have a magic trick you might have two or three different methods on how it works and there's something else he switched to the next one and you switch to the next one ... and and at work\nSo you're assured of success and so in his magic that's built in in the state of course I'm I guarantee you had two or three keys in there you know and all that failed and he couldn't get the T that's come out and kiss him and she got the appropriate tea in her mouth\nA and just spit it into his mouth\nExactly uh-huh he always had an out he always had a way out while it was the ... the same thing for the spiritual spiritual is because he had an agent\nAnd she would go into town and she would find some or hanging fruit she would find some a medium that were obviously tricking people\nBut some she couldn't find what they're doing French couldn't catch them so she would pull out something from beneath her clothes and like stuff it into the couch and\nSo later who had a sure thing that he could come back and expose them even though they didn't know anything about it\nIt seems as though that somebody somewhere puts a curse on him\nRight so he did this with Marjorie Marjorie was the uh the which from Boston\nUm hold on for ... seconds a professor where we're at a break but we'll come right back and talk about the ... that killed who do you\nDo get to watch our TV show beyond belief with George ... just log onto beyond belief dot com\nSees\n\nA [noise]\n\nSelling custom

R. E. F. that James Randi educational foundation had a million dollar one here\nWhich they never had to give out\nRight they never had to give it out but they I don't think they actually let anybody who could actually win participate\n[laughter] um well they're all like you for that one\nYeah ah well they can they can deflect me all they want I don't think they played fair and they finally shut it down and they're just giving the money whoever they want a that is interesting that they were taking in about one point five million dollars a year talking about a million dollar contest so they were coming out way ahead\nSo ah anyway that uh\nThe Scientific American has the same kind of thing going on so they're always going to Marjory he's saying on says so they set this up with six of these and Houdini goes up but he doesn't send\n'em rose ... that's the agent that easily sent ahead what he does he builds a box kind of looks like a sauna he built this box and he has um\nJames Collins build it for him and he builds all of a Houdini props and it's it's designed so that only mean his head in our hands can stick out okay so she can't get at anything so who dean he's got to make sure that she can't\nProduce any trickery so they are doing one ... and everything goes according to plan and\nUh they have what they call a ballot box it's a little a bell inside of a box and if they push on the lead the bell rang and they always put the box outside of the reach of me now\nAh and in this particular instance they put it between Houdini\nLax so there's no way anyone could get at it well in the first ... the bell rings so the second fancy brings in the box and he puts her in the box is going to stop it right and they put ... and the second ... the bell rings so now he's so now he's\nGot a picture and ... we talked about before about there's always an out you have to he has to fix marching Marjorie because he's actually already written a book about her\nHow he's you know exposed her yeah so he's got this book is going to put out so he has to expose her so she comes in\nUh everybody gets around the fans and of course\nMarjorie has a spirit guide and his name is Walter when it's Marjorie brother so Walter\nShe goes into a trance and Walter comes out and just starts cussing and swearing and cursing at Houdini and he says why did you put this foul thing in here why are you doing this why did you do this I'm cursing you\nAnd this is ... and this is his parents saying this right\nThis is the spirit saying it through Marjorie\nAnd the spirit Walter puts a death occurs because\nInside the box is a ruler one of those rulers holds up into three pieces yup is one of those all kinds and it's in side the box the only people that had access to the box was Houdini while and a James calling\nHow soon we're was the ... a professor and then Houdini ended up dying\nWell the ... he cursed him and some people say that he said you'll die in a year that that's a you know people debate about that\nBut he died in two years he was totally dead this big strong man died in two years after being cursed by Walter scare him\nWell actually Houdini used it in his advertising you can see their Houdini ads all over the place\nWhere Houdini advertise that he's under the curse of the spiritual and could die at any moment yeah and it really helped him you\nKnow kind of in a way but then you get this concept of the self fulfilling prophecy\nRight that they have prophesied that he's gonna die so later when Houdini gets sick maybe this is in the back of his mind and so he doesn't go to the doctor\n'cause he doesn't he doesn't want to prove them right he doesn't want to show that he's getting sick or that something's happened and that kind of my viewpoint of maybe what happened\nWhy he didn't go when he first started getting sick\nAnd Arthur forward what happened to him as much\nArthur Ford Arthur forward toward the world after he gave this\nOr did he live Houdini he outlive all uh he lived until Seventy one oh wow okay Arthur poured lived a fantastic life um so after or ... any ah tries to frame up Marjory\nI'm he puts out this book he actually fails but he says he does it and he's got these photos\nOf this book he actually failed but he says he does it and he's got these\nPhotos of Marjory legs under the table and then he had some drawings made were her leg is reaching around his leg so he makes them drawings and puts them in the book where the photo is not anything like that drawing a\nA little little trickery by Houdini\nYet so Houdini once again is doing that and um there was a guy named Walter ... Gibson and he is probably one of if not the number one\nAh expert on eating he worked with Houdini he worked with down injure and then he worked with crafts can and he makes a statement of there's a a a bombshell in in the interview crafting\nAnd uh he gives this quote buy gifts in it says when we're all magicians realize that Houdini was often ... honest as the medium he purported to expose wow\nThat's pretty heavy\nThat as heavy coming from the number one guy so he knew that they were putting 'em ... James Collins in there and that uh the rose Mac and bird was going ahead and and they were setting them up so he would have a great show that three park show\nCan you imagine what Houdini would have done professor if they had television in those days\nA boy you would have been you Michelle who\nKyrie or brings up another a subject you know a ... on the houses and you wonder why people don't put a stance on TV really well I was involved in a or\nWill they have the dark and it's so much you won't see anything\nRight well we'll talk about that a little later because these than for the ones I'm Talking about happen in broad daylight really Arthur for fans who was about a new huh broad daylight when he had the Houdini fans [noise] um\n\n[noise]\nTargeting birthright citizenship on Carmen Ropper Fox News of fire storms brewing over whether President Trump can do automatic citizenship for children or to illegal immigrants\nIn this whole thing started when President Trump made comments terrain interview was actually as part of new HBO a series of viewing this week 'cause\nWe always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment guessing line but you don't get the number one you don't need that nobody can you can just you know you can definitely go with it an act of Congress now they're saying I can do with just with an executive order\nAmish country that allows birthright citizenship which is incorrect some countries including Canada and Mexico Fox\nHas tried Gallagher Democrats don't like the presidents idea accused him of focusing on another immigration issue for the mid term elections [noise] they had hoped to take immigration off the table and concentrate on health care\nAnd the special counsel Robert Morris or for a woman who worked for him the Nineteen seventies tells reporters that GOP activists jak Berkman offer twenty thousand dollars to accused of sexual misconduct\nMattel Fox News he does not noble medical first meet the queen of the Atlantic coast never paid any what'd you do such a thing he also say use representing a woman who claims you more and more involved in a quote intimate situation when alleged sexual assaults occurred in Washington Chavez you'll find can you\nKnow there's the obligations onto the FBI to investigate and human remains sound on Vatican own property in Rome may hold the key to comment one it's dark mysteries construction crews from the bone fragments which\nMay belong to Emanuel Orlando but disappeared in Nineteen eighty three at the age of Fifteen Orlando he is the daughter of the Vatican bank employee is Fox News [noise]\n[noise]\nI Need a Fox dot\nStreaming subscription service\nFox Fox makes you wonder now what am I working\nOnly it's your chance to become a founding\nOf Fox dot com and free order right now\nAre so many streams of information coming summer just time to distract due to mislead you\nWhen you're just breaking you have to slow down we have to begin with what's most important here to find out what happens to record it without fear or favor in context to prospective beyond us really honest about every due to enlist hours to make sure\nThat when we deliver you extract of\nShepherd sleuth on Fox News channel real moves real honest opinion\n[noise] an official than running off on Afghan Army helicopter carrying senior officials just crashed killing all twenty falling on the Boston mobster why goals are dying printed in West Virginia originally murdered\nThe\nCulture of murder Tommy Donahue father in Nineteen eighty two [noise]\n\nTwo inmates at the federal prison in West Virginia including a mafia hit man reportedly suspected of beating the one time crime boss the Boston the death last year was eighty nine today man with terrorist ties rented a truck and mow down New Yorkers a tourist in Manhattan\nLast Halloween strict cycle drove a renter at home depot truck down a bike shop and people die from the New York area it's six visitors to the country from watching in Belgium Mayor Bill de Blasio said after the deadly incident that you considered like awesome\nEnemy of New York city and someone to do it to the people the city\nAnd to folks who were visiting\nAfter initially pleading not guilty and talk of the death penalty so I called earlier this year offered to plead guilty concerts in prison he's scheduled to stand trial for murder and other counts early October what do you see in New York ...

not okay\nI'm going to assume that the elephant was always there\nYeah [noise] okay\nWe'll do a little more homework yeah yeah they do know what who comes up with the tricks I mean was it Houdini does that make him a genius for being able to come up with this or did he have somebody on staff like you who would say here's this trick\nAnd let's do this and we can make this and that how did they do this is the same with ... feel too I assume ... people on staff like you are right exactly\nExactly I'm James Collins with the guy that Houdini the built all of them for them but I Would say I want to do this and then he would put it in the ball in their court and then they would have come up with how you would\nDo so I assume in the hip and Jerome they walked in Allison out everybody sees this thing lumbering in ... and then they shrouded in er cloaked in or something and then the trick began I it's absolutely amazing wasn't the queen there at the time\n[noise] uh well he probably the same queen that's there [laughter]\nIn Europe but I don't think she was there\n[laughter] you know Europe but I don't think she was at their okay I I don't know for sure next on it I don't\nThink she was there I think he performed for them in Europe ...\nLet's go to the first time caller Ralph in Indianapolis I'm Ralph go ahead\nSir I'm here already taken away meetings\nOr I knew I refer to oil and his last five years of his life got a letter from him just before he died a seeing bishop pike on a ledge when he was trying to go over to comb Ron in Israel and that's where they found them\nQuestion for you or what we what year did Arthur forward bring back the code to Mrs Houdini\nThis was in Nineteen twenty nine okay with a three part code or the code was the middle section first were was Rosenthal rose\nAnd then he had a code for the nine or words that spelled out believe and then she had dry words in French which means I pulled the curtain back like this and that's what she told him so he was a shirt that his coat I'd gotten through now didn't he she later denied that\nLater on a after she loses her friends she loses all her money a man a called Edward fate comes into her life and says he's her manager but they live\nTogether I fell in love again yeah so\nHe didn't like that that's why you wanted to come back\nRight she meet women the same kind of way that you mentioned there's a lot of things going on here but he's like Twenty years younger than her ... promise to her that she can make a movie and she'll make a million dollars\nOkay go ahead Ross [noise] uh what\nYear than they cheat deny that that the code was correct well the first time she'd never denies the code was correct\nUh she says she was for but she never denies that the coke was correct but she first about a year and a half after um she they're given the Houdini messages she having lunch with some ladies in Miami\nShe she said she was hesitant\nA Houdini coming back because why didn't he favor from the depression so she was she thought that Houdini would somehow favor from this math\nDepression that what's happening ... somehow he was going to come back at breakfast with her every morning or something I don't know what she was thinking but she wasn't happy about the fact that\nA art before it was on tour somewhere so she had no way to contact him and so she was you know showing your just pleasure for that than Edward think comes in later promises or a million dollars and then they go on and about eight years later they make a movie called a\nA religious racket years\nYeah he made a ... a couple of movies at least Disney\nWell Houdini make four or five movies yeah they also I Do they do they do well or they did fine but he was he was the star of of every movie\nWas he like an actor or were they more like documentaries\nThey he was an actor and he always had like a really really good luck and co star\nHis real name Eric Weiss yes\nHe was he was a pretty good looking guy too\nI kind of a sudden muffin guy he was only\nIn everything kind of a smooth sleuth talker could really give a a ... compliments really well but he wasn't the greatest actor but he used to promote his escape so we had a bunch of escapes and have all the movies\nReal name Eric white some\nYes and that's Eric turned into Harry and then who guinea he got from ...

and their mood is bright across all income groups not just among the rich what's going on let's check in with Catherine Austin fits\nCatherine why this is your story about the economy\nWell we've repatriated and economic capital we have very strong fiscal stimulus\nAnd you know that means a lot of money is coming back including George the fact that\nMuch manufacturing that we that the Senate broad is now can be brought back and that's in part thanks to robotics and technology so\nUs has the right spot right now in the global economy and that and the question is is there at the world doesn't join us there you know ... down but for now\nYes indeed and I think that what you have is you have the ability now to use digital radios to scan the frequencies more quickly a fellow by the name of Frank some action in the nineties figured out that if you hack\nA digital FM radio you can literally break it in such a way so that is that scans the frequency is it doesn't stop at a station when the signal comes in clear it just continually sweeps and again that\nThat's that continuous sweeping has ... ... if you do that voices and other sounds sort of a rise out of that noise\nAnd again people will write these words down that they will capture in these very quick sparse moments as it scans the frequencies and see if they can have some or attempt to have some kind of communication with was a a magic has the spirit world\nHe came up with one of his cold springs box which is trying to exactly that isn't it\nThat's right Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful very creative um devices that he made and he they became more and more complex\nSo eventually he started to think that maybe in fact it wasn't spirits at all but then when he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nPeter as you were putting together strange frequencies did you come across anything strange yourself\nWell I did some experiments and there were a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly odd but I think was important was that I was able to sort of get into that had space where I felt that I was doing something that had been\nBeing done for centuries I mean I'm I'm would like to make the argument that even somebody like John the who was using his scene stones to try to communicate with the angels and ... and as a result created what magicians called the ... language\nThat that use of a scene stone is the same as using radio to communicate with the spirit world that that this is something that human beings have been attempting to do with some media mystic device some material device\nWhere we take something and we read purpose that we use it in a way that it was originally intended and in fact the magician or the medium becomes a kind of spiritual hacker\nWhere we're really trying to interact with our technologies and the material world in a way that some would say really is that what we're supposed to be doing with it and yet as we know it's really the hackers\nThat have work early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers we probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our home [laughter]\nThat's true Peter ... with us his latest book is called strange frequencies you start the book with Jewish mythology and legend surrounding the Golan tell us about that\n[noise] yeah I mean I like to think that the goal and that is really the first piece of technology right where we try to build something in an interview with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend of fickle them as it's called particularly the goal of Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to help the Jewish people who feel um who are being attacked\nOr there's a whole rum and they're trying to defend themselves and eventually the goal\nHope rum and they're trying to defend themselves\nAnd eventually the goal and becomes it goes you know it it it it it there's chaos as soon as the rabbi ... no longer control it and either has to destroy it already has to put it to sleep\nIt one of the stories that goal and gross so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder and race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbles into dot sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories but if you look at the actual\nJewish ... missed this as a mystical writings about the call them the goal of them is in some ways a\nA means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their spiritual\n... it's it's almost like a test to show that they are prepared for greater mystical magical knowledge\nBut the goal in itself is was understood by the rabbis to be just kind of a dumb machine\nHere's a wonderful tell my story where a rabbi ... go to the head rabbi and they show him the goal and the ... says to the world what can I Do tend to eat and they say well no it can't speak and he said well then what good is it it's just\nIt's just the toy\nBeach is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures are right right so we can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that then we're just pretend there's to the throne as it were\nHere what about the showman says well you know in native ah American tradition and other types of was a direct cultures ... seem to be the person connected to the other side\n[noise] that's right and the Sherman would also used in utilize\nSound and light off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to introduce the state of consciousness in their people and I think that what the showman does and what the stage magician does in many ways is is very connected and it also\nCan access it connects the technology to the history of spiritualism and the staging of spiritualism which spirit cabinets and the different ways in which people were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet\nBut they were using technology to be able to create the state\nOf consciousness in the audience and so I don't think that it's necessarily well we we don't go to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to be in chat we want to invest in that state of mind\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advanced I think it's something that we have long\nBeen excited about it I mean even watching a film about spirits in the movie theater is almost like a ... sure experiences knit\nThomas Edison the great inventor was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build a ... machine I don't think he was ever able to do it was you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have very interesting thing here where we have people who are considered scientists them rationally\nAnd it's not that they were the bunk and because they want it to just be cynical skeptical it's because they really want that there to be the truth this is true Houdini\nHoudini really want it to him he really wanted to find a medium who could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his ear departed mother but he couldn't find all he found was Charlotte but his but he believed that it could be possible\nAnd I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where\nLet's just for a moment for ten even if it's just a pretend moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves and ...\nThose are new Houdini by the way you do write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on the right yes that's right ... going to be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy but as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job\nThat's right if he had today's equipment do you think he might be able to do something [laughter]\nMaybe but I think that he would also find which unfortunately I sometimes found is that people were using these things but if you sort of\nYou to move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraption think is most quickly try to hide the fact that maybe he really wasn't as magical as you thought\nWere going to be back in a moment to talk more with Peter a beep or golf his book strange frequencies we've done a link to his publisher Random House to make it easy for you to get the book if you're into this it's a magnificent story the subtitle is the extraordinary story of the technological quest\nTo the super natural and stick with us we're going to take calls with Peter next hour we'll leave and take your stories you're paranormal stories and just your general questions\nMore to talk with him about though about strange frequencies high technology and its ability to maybe communicate with the other side\n... the new version of that goes to ... a a map is no available Rawhide bone in now Android ... was ... on demand anywhere anytime\nGood acoustic ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n\nYou know Protestantism and the spirit of capitalism that something about the Protestant American Spirit is something whereby we want to\nProve our righteousness we want to prove that we are loved by God by by being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right\nAnd I think that that extends even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we are in charge of our own salvation\nWhere we want to be right in front of\nOur experience with the divine\nIs is again something that's very human I think particularly American often\nAnd so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say you know what I'm gonna do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with spirit or with God or divine or whatever\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something that pre existing eye opening it up and re purpose in it\nAnd so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people have practice magic for millennium right\nIt's just another example of magic of\nA of a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between\nRight right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to have this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool I\nCould we put you Peter in that category\nMyself yeah well I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that um I tend to ah believe though that\nWe have to be careful about how much we try to rest that you know from that we have to post put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer them maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\n[noise] yeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it I mean there is\nYou you know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this show why some people are\nBut this goes you know back to the whole idea that we once used to think that a that a profit was somebody who had special information for us and now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so\nYou know it's a for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce art that we called visionary art or spiritual aren't are often\nConsidered outsider artists why is that why is that people who are working\nWith these themes considered to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular\nAre you know mainstream artistic community and I think it's we live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience\nAnd what's interesting about technology is that it and this is really key here to see if I can explain this\nSomebody takes all radio\nAnd they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio and I'm going to re sawed or a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world\nBut the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to east Saudi Arabia and have another effect take place\nThe science behind that that even made this radio or something that you could find a store which said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't exist and yet we can take the things this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that\nIs underneath the scientific method and scientific understanding of the world it's\nSouthern effect and divorced and turned it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can fix about technologies in ways that at the science connected to them might actually be in opposition to\nWell if you didn't own a radio or have a computer where you could listen on line and somebody came up to you and said Peter ... voices of this guy at night\nTalking about ghosts and spirits and all these strange things he's out there he's out there and you of course we never had a radio you never went on line like that to listen you're probably saying what's this guy talking about he's insane\nOr but my voices out there and it's being heard by millions or if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to use the right time to receiver\nWell fascinating that you say that because when\nSpiritual is an was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started developed ... telegraph technology\nAnd people called medium spiritual mediums spiritual telegraph [laughter] they really believe that there was this link between this\nThis new version and technology and how you're right it was a special and new hind receiver and transmit her and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iraq his really augmented in shape things were spirituality in technology tell me why\nWell I mean the TV itself is kind of a ... very strange and scary oh yeah it does have some of the the there is a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four called the clue television company and they actually [noise]\nPretty for called the clue television company\nAnd they actually they this is how they advertise their television this is what they said\nThe dreams of witches have come true oh my God so they they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird\nBut to increase its sense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether right [noise]\nUm and so the the fact that you know week that we used to call those the after effects on a TV you know in that when we were used to watch you HFCs VHS stations with an antenna\nWe used to call those dose right so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically is is filled to the brim right with these supernatural in a cult metaphors and I think that that's really important I think even when we talk about technology even if we're not believers and even if we're just\nUsing it we still use these this language to try to make sense of it\nAnd I remember those days to dump that this has anything to do with our discussion tonight but a ... radios televisions were built into very heavy furniture remember those\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely yep\nMy dad had an old field goal radio and this thing must\nHave been about four feet tall and you know where was it was in case in this beautiful piece of wouldn't form of ... and ... co written across it uh you know it was it was a piece of art in the same way uh TVs in in the stereos other started coming out with\nIts right these are meant to be central pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like pulp that guy's comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nAre you a hundred percent convinced Peter that the other side exists\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I you know I live in a very limited all place what I what I like more than anything and what I liked about this about technology is that I really believe that these ambiguous\nStates are and chanting state when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical\nThan somebody who just wants to share it interesting experience with me\nGet into your time machine and tell me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regards to trying to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well let's talk more about um maybe it's not that we will communicate with the other side but that we will have transcended to the other side by use of artificial intelligence uploading our consciousness to computers\nThere's a movement of what's called trans humanism and host humanists who believe that we will become so merged with technology that that we will become the new spirit world it it's going to be our consciousness inhabiting this electronic\nDigital realm I'm so I'm I'm more convinced that it it's going to be a that we ourselves will become transcended via this technology\n\nThink nine Seventy\nIssue President Trump may have to deal with in courts on Damien than a Fox
