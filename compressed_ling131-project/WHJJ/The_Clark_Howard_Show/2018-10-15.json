Monday on Wednesday\nAnd the hate mail is ... and I have tons of le smells and\nActually I only have to look through one of your columns because you're contain Elizabeth Warren gardener enough heat bound to get me the segment you want to give it a little brief synopsis\nWe have a a a marvelous thing one of the great great things that was passed in the last Twenty years by our Democrat legislature they got tired of people complaining about how people don't pay their fair share of taxes so finally the structure has Lisa okay you want to pay your fair share we're going to give you an option\nThere's only two states in the union that give you the option on the on the tax return for the state to pay a higher rate\nOf Arkansas and Massachusetts so literally dozens of people say of the millions of taxpayers in the commonwealth of Massachusetts take advantage of this one of whom it doesn't happen to be Elizabeth Warren\nWho makes millions of dollars he or she she she was making four hundred thousand is a professor at Harvard then she got elected to the Senate and all of a sudden she's making over a million a million and a half dollars a year\nBut she never checked the box grace until this year and what what's what's going on with Elizabeth Warren this year the way that you might check the box and and decide to pay a higher rate ... instead of five percent five point eight five percent white ... what do you think the difference was this year\nShe's trying to break that glass ceiling that Hillary bonk your head off of in and out back down\nThat's a good guess Christ but the reality is she's running for reelection this year and wants to run for president so she figures she'd better do the PC thing\nThat's so great Smith glass ceiling running for president Hillary ran for president\nHe used to hate now she'll be porn and right now [laughter] okay anyway back to um oh I just want to say about that how that will do my own taxes because if I did my taxes an edge to pay check that box by accident and they ended up paying like half\nA mile do your taxes if you if I had a higher than if you attack guy somebody check that\nBox for you ... you would have a lawsuit on their heads I mean they will be tripled damages 'cause that's like\nLet's say you make I don't know what you make but you it's one percent of your income is gone because of would be gone because of that\nBut like for her when she checks it it's one percent of income\nYeah it's an extra one percent oh an ex\nSo like over the last ten years we figured it out by not checking the box she had saved fifty thousand dollars that was fifty thousand dollars that could have gone to illegal aliens to building and blow transgender bathrooms and and the ... the crumbling infrastructure\nRumbling in ... I'm just so hung up on the fact that children ... currently has her own accountant do or taxes he's my parents' account that's what I was gonna say I knew that you knew that\nI mean it's the one thing that I think it's\nGood that I'm not doing my own taxes I don't think my parents are like your own grace I think they're kind of happy that someone else has that under control anyway back to hate now so how he wrote that piece and I read some comments and throughout these comments Steve feel free to play the messages and the order that there and because we have tons of hate 'em in some of that it's really\nDark winter to anybody who did anybody suggested that I have my facts wrong in the skull and\nPeople were more suggesting that you are overlooking Donald Trump's tax issues and only picking on Elizabeth\nWarren Donald Trump ever called for a a marginal income tax rate of he refuses to say how I ... they they've asked ... what's your what do you want you to talk about these problems that the Republicans get back to people what do you want us to the top tax rate\nFifty percent sixty percent Seventy percent and she never answers Donald Trump that's the difference\nYeah I get what you're saying you know what I mean it's like oh\nDonald hypocrites saying oh well you didn't stay after and help us\nClean up and then I'm like oh well I didn't\nI didn't offer you I never want to kill one person arranged for the place to be cleaned up and didn't stay after it was like a weird now but you know what I mean what does he he's also not called for people to release their tax returns yeah\nAnyway so here's what Steve ...\nAnd they also didn't take the ... I'm pretty sure he didn't take fifty thousand dollars and write offs for his use glows which we that was last week's column on our taxes\nAt Trump supporter complaining about something he found any candidates tax returns and then in all caps", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "15"}
