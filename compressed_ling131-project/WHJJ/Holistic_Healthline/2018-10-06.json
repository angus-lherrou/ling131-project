download our podcast and submit your questions\nFor Todd [noise] so why is the difference again I'm going to try and keep it as non technical as I can well a couple of things one argument really is\nUnderstanding the definition of a limited power of appointment\nMhm K which is what this is you are limited don't or to the ability to a point to a charity but the definition itself\nIs that a power of appointment is not a property interest so you don't own any thing\nNumber one and the definition says that you cannot exercise the power\nIn any way in which you would benefit directly from the exercise of the power mhm so even if they were to say you're going to put it on some kind of a condition we are going to condition this distribution to the charity only if the charity uses it to pay for my care\nWell then you could not exercise that power to that charity right because it would benefit you and that would be a violation of the definition itself\nWhich is technically fraudulent\nRight and in violation of your own power you breach in your own duty I thought\nThere was a big case that came down with this earlier this year and that kind of put this issue to rest wasn't there something that\nThere was a Supreme Court case that addressed it as a possibility to look at applying the any circumstances test it didn't rain all on it that was it said maybe mass health should consider this as an option\nDidn't rule on it just seems to me these they're hearing officers operating a cone of silence the themselves they tore something around things right and you know there's more that can be done here right so in this case\nYou also have the very definition the essence the Internal Revenue code that says\nWhat is a five oh one C. three charity\nThese are how you get the dust Sharon on your income tax return if you give it to a charity well when you read the definition of charity under five oh one C. three which is an Internal Revenue code section it says that you are absolutely not allowed to give to a charity\nIf you do give to a charity the essence of a charity means that the charity is prohibited from using that money to benefit the giver mhm or if it's a nursing home and you have private stock in the nursing home you can't benefit a private stock holder\nSays that right in the Internal Revenue code well then you see there is really no direct\nWhen you give it to a charity who's a nursing home to know whether or not they will use it for your care or even if they're permitted to use it for your care so how can you say it's a way in which you are accessing the principal\nGrasping at straws you you can't write you can't do that so and of course by do share duties do apply to know even if the trustee is the one that has to issue the check if you tell the ... the don't or tells the trustee to issue the check\nTo the charity knowing that there's been a condition applied to it that it's got to be used for your care one I don't think the nursing home can accept it and to the trustee would reach us by do share duty if it then did that mhm distribution\nRemember a gift to a charity that benefits you is not a gift to a charity it's a gift to yourself right\nAnd the other fair hearing officer said we agree not accountable folks if you have a trust now or you're thinking about getting a trust\nCall for free copy of Todd's

yeah\nYes I Am from hearing Ari tract infection than I was just wondering if there is a light and then that I Can't help prevent them\n... or are they your new returned infections that you're feeling or is it just showing up in the urine samples\nAre now that I'm feeling okay\nI've been cranberry is probably the easiest cheapest most effective preventative\nIf you want to stay could just a little step higher um there's a formula called Erie active it's made by um lifetime vitamins and has the cranberry but it also has ... and some other things that I'm a Demian owes helps to\nKeep the bacteria from sticking to the bladder wall and sometimes is full and the bladder when it's empty and um this bacteria can get stuck there are so I Would look at probably taking two a days on if as far as maintenance\nAnd then ah if you have an active um UT I than to take three capsules three times a day for four days and then go down the two a day and just stay on the today\nOkay so what is this your story how how do we balance very active you are I acted view you are right okay and I'm Still you\nCan also do is is a um a topical that you can use because sometimes a bacterial infections are coming from either direct Elyria or from the ... general area\nA man and it gets up into the bladder is a formula is a product called golden solve this me by Barlow herbal and you don't need a lot just a little bit but now you usually suggests I knew that\nUm again if you have a huge ya use it after you go into the bathroom if you don't need preventative than once a day and that usually helps kill off any bacteria that might be\nHanging around okay so AOL though\nGolden like only\nLike a silver but golden okay Conan OK okay All right thank you very much\nWant them and make sure to drink lots of water not enough people drink enough water in a particularly as we get\nOlder and I and as we women what happens is a lot of times the muscles and ligaments and tendons and abdomen abdominal area\nParticularly if you still have a uterus um starts gravity starts working against us\nAnd so they start sagging and kind of pushing pressure on the bladder so you feel like you have to go more often or and so what do you do if you feel like you have to go frequently you stop drinking water and then you end up with these frequent UT so make sure you drink enough water what's going on line one caller and ... when I when\nI um I Would like to help ... with what I Would describe as a new map that they the problem is when I die some weight thing\nI have especially at that point where I have a shot pain in the inner ankle down through the soul of the foot so it's very difficult to walk and the legs I'm quite often feel as though they're burning wood you call that neuropathy in what could I Do about it\nI don't know if that's not but you're not if it is I mean one of the best things we've seen for neuropathy is alpha life poetic acid\nOkay type poetic ethic six hundred milligrams twice a day I'm your time today okay\nThis is a is it possible that this is a circulatory issue\nI don't know okay how would I find that out\nYour doctor could tell you yeah I'm the\nWell I have been for the doctor but he hasn't mentioned that it was sick of Atari\nAnd would you ask them specifically about this pain I did and what did he tell ya\nI put the end the practice and\nAgain there's a cool therapists yeah it's a pain reliever it's not fixing anything he's not telling you why you have the pain is just friends right\n[noise] well I Do have some arthritis in my left hip that possibly might be part of the problem is it only on one side or now it's on ... the the feelings on both sides\nThan um I think there's some again it could be partially circulatory I'm\nI just heard that the other day from\nSomebody who came into our facility or daughters had a digestive problems for quite some time and a slowly starting to figure it out a little bit but\nLast time I saw the doctor said you know no need to be on some you know medication for anxiety because yeah this is all coming from your head yeah I mean anxiety does affect digestive issues but it's not the only reason it occur you know the the the\nFunny thing is I noticed you know if you go\nBack twenty five years ago\nThey were prescribing anti anxiety medication to women going through menopause are they still do it came around\nAnd came back around is what I noticed\nIt went from you're going through menopause here's some Prozac back in those days right\nThen it went to the hormonal report the hormone replacement therapy\nWe got away from giving all the women and things id medication now we're going to now we're going to give us courage and we're getting to the root of the problem here we're going to give you hormone replacement\nAnd then then cancer rates kinda dramatically in Greece yes so however many years ago I Would you say maybe ten years ago maybe even less than that\nThat they dramatically reduced using hormone replacement therapy and now one of the women get anti anxiety medication\nWell back to that again a and B for are the pros that it was the valley him I guess yes mothers little helper and before that it was actually um like a cocaine and stuff I mean seriously that's what they were prescribing\nA two women who were going through menopause calling you know the hysterical time uh and uh instead of understanding you know what was going on a and and again I'm surprised today the number of women who are given estrogen\nA that generally and told oh don't\nWorry is not going to get an you it's not going to your system is just going to that particular area yeah\nWell how do they you know like if you put a nicotine patch on yeah to stop smoking [noise] how do they think does it only affect your name because I smoke three are feeling you know the only way you smoke as you know that yet\nA new kind of goes through the skin and gets into the circulatory system and gets transported around through that through the system\n[laughter] so yeah and I think you know women me being given a bill of goods here on does it help absolutely um but we see the same thing with men I'm often using testosterone the prescription testosterone yeah um that the you know elevating potential\nNow again topical\nJoe yeah but they're using elevating prostate cancer yeah um because again they're not balancing now and they're not helping the body to utilize the hormones appropriately right uh that's in there\nAnd especially for women goes women's hormonal systems a little more complex fluctuate more complicated as a flood they fluctuates so much more men tend to be pretty steady but women's fluctuate up\nAnd down so to think you can use a standard dosage on a woman would that system that all those hormone levels changing all the time makes no sense\nLet's go to my mind Nancy from Rhode Island in the\nUh I don't know if it can they help with this situation because it's a little bit\nBut it's not my son and your shoulder over it you know and get what they go away if I only had an X ray over a year later\nWe discovered is affect your vote for it it it's G. joint at sea\nYou only and I heard your ad morning unhelpful bone and I said that might help them they may not I don't know the only other thing which recommended was paid tea and uh he hasn't started physical therapy yet either then or they got a call\nAre they doing anything about the fracture as far as I Would imagine the fracture healed but may not have healed appropriately\nIt it it didn't but they said the only thing that could help surgery a definitely surgery which he won't he won't it surgery and they shouldn't go to therapy so he might be trying that okay they said they were helpful bone and it said something about\nI feel your bones here but I think\nIt's a little too late again I think the the the bone has repaired maybe inappropriately but you're not going to change that a except through surgery\nBut I Would look at what are the things we can do to help all the tissue surrounding that area um to be more pliable\n... am FM is what I'm thinking uh MSN improved to strengthen the flexibility both um would ligament and that\nIt does take that he's always taken\nThat you know ... years you know how much he takes no I don't want to take at least six thousand milligrams a day and then\nI Would look at it also the plus CBD Oil which is good for chronic pain and inflammation\nHe has just gotten that but he took it a couple of days and stop\nOh it's not going to work in just a couple of days it's gonna is gonna take probably a few months to really get where he needs to go\nWhy they they recommended the surgeries to to repair the broken bones why is he a\n... a voice any kind of surgery [laughter]\nHe difficulties later that if the you know those um [noise]\nStructural damage that is impinging on other areas of the body causing you know pressing uncertain nerves or whatever that's going to a cause I'm discomfort so it's going to make it more difficult if you don't repair I'd be doing that surgery smelly\nOkay well he had some kind of fame that over the place and especially when he walked he feels the pay yeah\nUh well physical therapy could be helpful again make sure that he's taking at least six thousand milligrams the Kirk human would be another thing I Would look at taking probably a thousand milligrams three times a day but the CBD I I Would give it a chance you know ... to ... just twice isn't going to do it for you\nThat that's for the collar bone but no that was the sheet at St joy there's that\nThat is what the MSMX for OK\nOkay but the um Kirk human and the plus CBD Oil is for the inflammation and pain\nAlright because something hey did you say it can be pushed back into play\nRight but it doesn't stay there and so when he you know the physical therapist is going to work on but that's what some of the other things that we recommend that are going to help\nWhen I get here and happy anniversary Oh thank you and they\nHave a great weekend and uh yeah sometimes if again if something is structurally out a place that's going to keep offering a problem yeah and so they may have to repair some of the issue not just the bone but the tissues surrounding it\nI mean we knock the doctors a lot here but right now reject the but right that's what they're really\nLike amazing Atlanta's they're amazing you know\nThey look they can do that kind of surgery they can do amazing things I mean why would I be doing that you've seen\nDoctor you know patients who have had amputations because of an accident a car accident or whatever and they're able to re attach\nThe limb digits or whatever and still preserved nerves function your

fun\nAnd interesting ... sometimes a little emergency room too many times you know that you know pretty darn good\nUh again give us a call one eight six six nine to zero nine four or five five and let's go to line one Melissa in Milford, Massachusetts oh\nHeck no I think if I take my question how can we help you\nKnow in my life I had been cold I mean the thing you touch my hand in my hand is like I [noise]\nAnd um [noise] things seem to be fine as far as you know when I go to the physician and I and other ways way cold [noise]\nAnd is there anything that that you can take for that even in some way whether it's ...\n... ... yeah well ... your stomach can handle it has cayenne pepper capsules right great\nUm but I have you checked the when the doctor says everything's fine but I Would be curious about your thyroid and it may be your thyroid levels you know you might might be normal range but it might be at the very bottom of the normal range\nI think for a lot of women that they call a sub clinical hum I pulled thyroid or the other thing is if it's just your hands and feet a then it could be Reno's\nA which is an auto immune condition um and so um which is a whole different issue so if\nI Would have to put a switch around and he didn't want to keep\nThe fact that it could be circulation that could be I rode um have a I mean there are different I read natural thyroid formulas out there but again you might want to get a full panel on thyroid make sure they also check your um\nUm the three on the floor and the um blob elan testing or to make sure that you utilizing\nYeah Ira appropriately yeah\nAnd they get so go to the doctor asked for a full thyroid panel get the results get the numbers in your hand and uh let us know will take it from there\nI think you're very not smoking I think\nIt directly to it is it's kind of the control center for your metabolism and just kind of your general\nOr\nThe rate at which you burn energy you know so if your thyroid is even if it's again quote normal range but if it's at the bottom of the normal range\nThan uh\nYou know your your engines running a just above an idle time or\nYou need to wrap it up so there's lots of ways to
