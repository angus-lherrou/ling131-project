T. O. D. transfer on death payable on death to her husband Jerry basically a beneficiary attached to her bank account Tribeca go correct is not a brokerage but a bank account\nThen later on she created a revolt couple living trust and then died in twenty Fifteen mhm\nWell Jerry went to claim ownership of the account\n'cause he's listed as the table on death beneficiary you shouldn't have to go to probe it you shouldn't have to go anywhere you go get the money that's what that means ... well the bank said no you don't own it\nTransferred this to the trust mhm and she said that there was certain statements out there that were you know I guess they produced a bank statement or something and some some computer generated records and and they had a copy of the trust but interestingly enough\nOnly thing that they found that was signed was the original signature card and that was signed in her name alone ... so the point of this was\nThe whole decision came down on a a a summer a judgment that the bank was gonna say look summary judgment should apply here meaning there is no question of fact just to prove this thing right allow me to be right to banks that that's what's summary judgment means\nWell this court said the ... the Missouri appellate court reversed the lower court and said you\nCan't grant summer a judgment here not when you have a sign signature card and her name alone even though you might have other bank statements and the like\nThere's a question of fact that needs to be resolved and that's all they said here they didn't say whether it was actually find it or not funded they just said that there is a question of fact that needs to be resolved we need to go to court and pursue these facts\nI Know that when we fund to trust Todd so let's see we had an individual transfer on death count in they create one of these trusts\nWhether it's ... ... we open up a whole new account and transfer the assets over there is no linking him just changing the title on it it's an actual Newtown and the name of the trust without a beneficiary\nYeah and that's a good point I think what yeah what the argument might be here is that maybe she kept the same account number ... changed the name\nAnd now because that's what you did there still may be a beneficiary designation attached to it so even though you change the owner to the trust if you left the beneficiary designation on their friends and maybe it isn't\nIt's going to go according to the beneficiary designation not according to the terms of the trust although the trust doesn't die the ... well that would trigger that yeah that's interesting so it would probably pass outside the trust outside the will according to the P. O. D.\nAnd I think that was the issue here was yeah it it still have\nThe the P. O. D. on it and you're right when when you do it Susan or when when we work with you yeah who helped clients re title accounts to the trust one\nDeed work easy we prepare new deed we put it on record as a registry there is no doubt that it has been changed\nBut for bank accounts and investment accounts yeah we want to add the name of the trust to the owner or to the account\nBut it needs to be especially with these Iraq a couple of trust it needs to be not only a whole new a town so close out the one like you said choosing get rid of the beneficiary put it in the new trust and have no beneficiary designation and get a new id number\nSo now you know clearly not in the same social whether revoke about trust sometimes it ... it remains in the Social Security number of the individual and so that you really got to make sure that the new account and get rid of the beneficiary designation\nFolks you got to have your plan in place ideally you're going to do your planning in advance what is advanced advance means five years if you are concerned about protecting those assets from long term care expenses\nTodd has written a guide for the month of October it's your last chance to request is guidebooks\nIs designing in income only ... trust and it will show you all the important information that must and must not be included in your trust Todd has sixteen different troublesome provisions that pop up all over the place you want to make sure that your trust is not include them\nAnd also includes a comprehensive operations guide so you can see how these trust work\nFrom a practical perspective on a day to day basis\nCall right now it's your last chance to do so eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine visit our website legal exchange dot com download your guy download our podcast and submit your questions for Todd to answer on the air\nTodd ... from the law firm of pushing and Dylan thank you so much Oh thank you Susan always a pleasure I'm Susan Powers a financial advisor with the Armstrong advisory group we thank you for joining us today and we'll be back again next week on the legal exchange with ...\nSecurities off into a securities America ink number ... ... s IPC an advisory services offered through security is America advisor think security is America and its representatives did not provide legal advice therefore it is important to consult with your legal advisor regarding your specific situation because you can do in the Armstrong advisory group the legal exchange and the security is American companies are not affiliated\nIf you're a real estate or property management company you need a banking partner that has all the right tools to keep your operation efficient leader bank is one of the premier banks and the property management and real estate space offering a suite of unique products and cash management services to help you collect rent manage condo association payments and\nDigitized paper checks leader bank utilizes state of the art technology to offer convenient banking services to its real estate clients such as a C.

have to [laughter] you're gonna have to read the labels but are you saying they're adding calcium carbonate\nToo and they are I read the label from the um but is it or is it a natural I I'm sure they added to it\nBut we can't we know one thing I can tell you about medicine or health in general every issue we never assume anything I saw my suggestion would it be to call the company I'm above where you get the almond milk from\nAnd asked them the technical people uh they adding this or is this something that is naturally inherent\nA and the ... okay okay okay\nYou're welcome [noise] um I find that happens all too often even a you know medical doctors and and stuff that they tend to assume\nAnd not be direct and you know ask very pertinent questions and get direct dancers ah and so this is where you are sometimes when you call in because I keep pecking away at ya [laughter]\nBut that's you can't decide what you need to do until you actually have you know understand wrong was of what's really going on we can't assume that it's like ... how many people have gone to the doctor and particularly as you can get up and to the older years\nAnd you know even like I remember in my early fifties uh people say you know going to the doctor and saying well you know ... you know I'm a little tired or ... oh that you're just getting old [laughter]\nYeah oh yeah I couldn't do it can be that maybe the fact that you can\nSend us go uh you know went in and said to the doctor you know he's a little more tired than he usually is usually bounces out of it right now really perky and they weren't anybody you know you go you're that age are needed it known and I said okay well let's get that hot ... blood work and\nAnd all that stuff you know he does we'll find you know and get it on the way out with the receptionist though and you know and\nThat it got down on the car and looked at it and lo and behold he was anemic\nMirror now if we had just assumed that the doctor was right now the doctor had that information and he's not a bad doctor but he was in a hurry and he you know glanced\nOver the paperwork and that are really looking at it and going huh what are some of the things that can cause the tea you know you're not sleeping well are you in pain are you making ... trips to the bathroom at night are you are naming all those things are potentially go into why are\nYou know feeling tired now let's just assume is aging\nAnd then as soon or doctor was right yep so don't assume\nIs very often when do you know again it's when they do a pulmonary scan or eliminate every exam and come up with no obvious answer then that's the answer to that age\nVernon jolly flower kill coverage from Brussels sprouts yeah coleslaw\nYeah or you know and broccoli and salads and hail and stuff like that because that helps to diminish what do you know this was an auto immune form\nNo I Do not want that doctors that I've seen I haven't been that the don't told me that\nMuch they can do thyroid Andy body testing um so that's something you might want to see if they've done or if they have and have them do it because\nThen if it is a auto immune selenium is helpful and then I'm also logic care\nIs a a formula that we used to help stabilize or the immune system and people without one moon conditions but you get to know whether it is or not because if it's not and you don't need to do those there's a lot to do don't let them read it in ah\nStay away from coffee or anything that's you know I'm going to excite the system or on a tone and tell them that down\nWhat two cups of coffee a day be okay or is that where\nI Would cut her do no no ... right now anyways settles down kind of go maybe deep cap even though ... coffee is just a decaf coffee is fifty percent caffeine is still less caffeine ... going to like the not only the adrenal but the thyroid\nYou OK okay thank you so much\nHang in there and let's go to line to LA from North prominence friend\nYes thank you for taking my call\nI recently had surgery on my foot which reflects that stuff but my problem with this guy it's hailing beautiful\nExcept the one that it was very read all week at the same token than when I seen in Florida it's like I'm getting a scab where my foot is bending again\nMhm and and what would it be so good in that sense of what\nI think that would be fine and I when I Do is just if you're going to soak it put equal amounts of absence all I Do your peroxide and I'm proven nine or ... and iodine solution that you get it\nLike I'm a Wal Mart or something like that they have these different um sold a dime proven I they have different names\nSo it would be I ... and ...\nIt's like a tablespoon of each to you know I'm a gallon of water\nOkay but may I say one more to leaks until it came out and it was hurting me further down on and say what pulled them out and they got them out of the of this would this guy or is\nThat ... that it to heal over quickly and that was wondering if I may have that that's what's happening here\nPotential again we can't see it so well you know I guess but um you know it could be you have a little infection and could just be an irritation that's going on but soaking it would help and then something topical maybe they're just kind of ... the\nRight here and you know and I bought it then they had that Neal is boring and um yeah what's that going to do it to help it all came I give it a try OK okay thank you so much and I'm an avid listener I guess\n... thank you so much to you too\nUm yeah and you know it's sometimes it's hard to determine whether or not\nSome things and infection or just plain irritation because that inflammatory you know skin gets rid and itchy\nAnd starts like part of the healing process you know so it's not necessarily again infection it's sometimes it's just you know part of the body's way of viewing right um something\nLike even silver Joe can be helpful to prevent infection but also just kinda toned down um that overreaction if you're over reacting to the healing process\nI'm grateful burns absolutely spectacular for burns even San birds yeah I'm just put some of the gel on acne diaper rational has a lot of different benefits but um I think that uh\nAs far as a scar if you're trying to get rid of a scar ... oil I think he moved to answer seems to work the best yeah I Know you can use 'em\nYou know other uh I think vitamin e oil a lot of people abuse and I'm so there's a lot of things like that but the ... who has been far above the best that we\nSeemed so amazing I mean that's E. M. U. I misspelled Peter EM you a ...\nBig bird looks like an ostrich let's go to line and actually Jane from New Bedford, Massachusetts\nHey good morning oh my God can this week after I had an MRI of my home I've got a law I'm On my arm my for 'em and they said that it's it's just an old lady really can't determine what it is\nSo they're sending me to the general surgeon which kind of scares me\nBut [laughter] I'm Wondering do you think that might be necessary or can I get rid of it some other well large are we talking about\nUm gee it's it's actually gotten smaller since I noticed that um it's less than half an inch\nIt's gotten smaller since you notice it then I Would hesitate on the surgery is bothering you as a painful\nNo not at all are you putting anything on it no\nI don't yeah I mean the Lenny Bruce they're a little ...\nI Would try to get some D. M. S.\nOh okay I Do have that uh okay so apply that twice a day yeah particularly before you go to bed at night\nAnd they were like in a hurry to get me into the the general surgeon I feel like if it's just\nThe money will God Forbid that thing goes away before the surging energy and I don't think there's any harm and\nGoing to see the surgeon and hearing what they have to say OK to harm comes of you just start letting them cutting you open and there isn't a good reason for doing [laughter] do you know but\nTo get in and and and see what it is that they think it is or what they want to do or did\nThey need to do further testing um but hopefully may you know by the time you get in to see them you know it's gone\nYeah [laughter] that's right I Hope that's what I'm hoping that the NFL and\nIt'll okay thank you so much\nHere welcome yeah sometimes we'll get these weird little things and\nAnd I was kind of the skin garner riots vote for whatever reason is either hyper you know they're forming skin cells or\nA you know and you never know with potentially can cause it but a ... tumor and some sometimes you just get these weird little things and the and the one thing you always want to make sure those you know proper to go see the dermatologist may notice like answers\nYou know that's the big concern yeah um so\nIt's been a busy morning here [laughter] I don't know I think there's a lot of people out there who were you know baseball fans are a little tired after\nLast night's game there are some of them to manage ... yeah like Ninety seven hours seven hours and uh oh my God everything\nEverybody is walking around with big bags under their eyes [laughter] um so um I guess we have another whole hour to go a holistic how mine just want to quickly mention um I don't know if anybody in the news about the ... virus outbreak and New Jersey\nI'm killing 'em at least seven children that I Know of potentially more uh and uh you know\nThey don't really seem to have much of an answer for this\nWhich is sad because there's so many things you can do naturally that is anti viral no I'm not saying what we would do is going to eradicate what's going on\nBut certainly better than what they're doing now homeless and it certainly won't hurt so you would look at something like colloidal silver giving kids glued all silver every couple\nOf hours um and then there's other anti natural anti viral roles that are can be helpful um but it's sad that the children have to die because you know conventional medicine doesn't have much yeah but this virus and\nThen you read somewhere along the articles as far as one of the causes they it's a\nIt was a it was an article I read I was I was watching the news when this\nKind of started and it was the first line of the the news anchor in his mouth was a this outbreak of this dino virus are due to a sort of fear lack of hand washing\n[laughter] have you have a severe lack boxing that's\nI mean that's the cause of this outbreak severe lack of hand washing [laughter]\nWhether there'd be\nA little boy oh boy yeah um but this particular strain unfortunately leads to pneumonia but we're out oh when I Will be back in just a minute\nIsland I'm Russell Roberts news radio nights wants to eat and will force of enough I'm here's what's happening national grid is preparing for today's expected stormy weather nor'easter producing heavy rain and winds gusting as high as forty to fifty miles per hour is forecast\nUtility company says it has additional cruise in the state from elsewhere to be on standby\n\nAnd the future was the red Sox are continuing to solidify ties with the clubs new home so that scene was announced a partnership with assumption college that includes guaranteed internships\nOr people who have anxiety or just people don't get in the habit of not taking deep breaths on a regular basis less oxygen you're taking in on a daily basis these signals are the body don't make so many red blood cells because there isn't that much oxygen coming in\nI don't know maybe get a little more vigorous with your breathing on a regular basis um and uh as Peter said check with the doctor to see if you're deficient in iron\nIf you are than there are formulas like I'm Flora Dick science and herbs a is a good formula\nA vitamin C. also helps to not take up iron better so

go to guy about CBD Oil and that's\nWhy we got ammonia today and I still we took a year of looking at different\nA CBD Oil companies are and uh found that the de sciences was in the top tier of a company's uh to\nBe looking at and uh but what we know why we went that direction ah what caused you to go under the direction of Stevie sciences\nWell the first experience was a great story I was with my former boss you probably both remember Dr Cary Marshall who was my boss Nordic natural she's gone on to a great career and the industry and we were set up right next to the first book\nSelling their stuff at expo uh the company I worked for now was making the raw material for the other outfit and the one of our brokers was showing a piece of gum that looked like cannabis\nAnd he happened to have dreadlocks you couldn't make it up you know and I and that's not me any ... you know you know me writing but needs no ... no bombs no Cheech and Chong anything wrong with\nThat I'm just I'm not on that frequent honored and we know what I read ...\nCertainly know what my dad and my tie rack [laughter] little bit more on the ground inside not there's anything wrong with that but I just wasn't

eyes and without having the munchies I mean I'm a busy guy and I'm raising a family too but I'd like to be clear\nAnyway I ran over there and I bought some of it I went to lunch with Dr Cary and ... who both you know who I work with\nAnd I sat there totally changed I mean energetically completely changed I didn't know what at the time subconsciously I made the decision to spend the rest of my life pursuing that ingredient now when I met the the sciences when you ask why did I take the job\nThey had a huge supply of the material ready in twenty fourteen there were years ahead of the curve and they had a lot of money and they were willing to spend it on\nSo four years ago they started formal toxicology work with are raw material FDA\nRead book drug development stuff I've never done anything like this chain we determine doesn't know el know observed adverse effect level we introduced our extract into the U.S food supply or going through the front door of the federal code of regulations\nBecause they had a lot of money and a lot of lawyers and a lot of appetite to do it right because the company is a publicly traded company\nSo they had to build a transparent edifice with a brand new ingredients\nAnd I was so attracted to their um tolerance for the new that was exciting for me\nWhat you've seen 'em and I know the science do use is evolving in coming out all the time
