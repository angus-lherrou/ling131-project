{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WHJJ", "content": "Again that is really the point of view point of this stuff goes on every day and I think this was obviously a stranger not a real not a family member yeah I didn't care\nBut I think we need to spend some time on certainly if it's a stranger I just say family members step up look out see you know see who this person is that it's caring for your loved one and make sure you've got your hands on the ... yeah\nUh but what about\nAll the family members that are providing care for other family members that are moving and I think we need to\nAdd that fact pattern yeah to this case and explore that a little bit\nAnd I think you share with us last week Todd that there are more than thirty five million\nUnpaid family caregiving so you need to look out for those folks because this is great advice Todd's gonna give you he's also giving you some great advice in writing with his guide that is written for the month of October it's designing in income only ... trust\nThere's so much that you're supposed to know about what should and should not be in your ear evoke about trust so that it works it's all about the drafting folks but how are you supposed to know what should or shouldn't be in there you don't\nFortunately for you Todd who is our elder law expert\nHe's written this guy that will give you everything you need to know including what must be in their sixteen different problematic provisions that should not be in there and he's also included a question and answer pretty comprehensive section on how these trust work every day\nYou can request you're free copy of Todd's designing in income only irrevocably trust guide right now by calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine or visit our website legal exchange showed dot com you can download your guide you can download our podcast and you can make your questions first hard to answer on the air\nSo how does that work if you're you know a loved one providing care I think you have a lot more to worry about in this case are often times you're not worried no so much about the stealing or they're not getting paid in fact lots of times you don't even want to get paid right um but the parent wants to\nPay yeah a lotta times they do 'cause you might be reducing your hours at work you're all circling the wagons you're all pitching in or you might even give up your job right here for our parents fulltime\nAnd you need you need a financial flow of money yeah so so if you're going to do that folks then while we're not worried so much about the elder abuse part of this case or the criminal aspects of this case\nWe're worried about the future medicate application you know things that you do well you're living ... out of normal acts of kindness goodwill actions that you take\nYou don't always realize the impact that might have on a future medicate application so if your parents or your caring for ends up going into a nursing home right 'cause they're adults ... and you can't uh\nYou get to a point where it's beyond your capacity yeah they might need to do it acute medical care or effective so so\nWhat do we do in the interim what we want to get paid if you want to get paid you must have a personal care contract\nEspecially if you're a ... a family member doing them you need the personal care contract and you need in the personal care contract to itemize out the kinds of services you think you're going to be providing\nFrom running errands to doing medical prescriptions to doctor visits to uh things around the house and the type of care you're actually going to provide for the loved one whether it's toiling transferring bathing medicating okay put all that and\nAlso you need a paragraph in there about the hours you think you're going to be spending\nAnd how you're going to get paid whether it's twice a month whether it's every week and the hourly rate what's a good rate do you think taught as a guide life you know I've seen enough fair hearing decisions come down on this that that hourly rate for a non\nA nurse practitioner right here just a family member you know stick around twenty dollars an hour okay I think you'll be okay but even at twenty bucks an hour if you've moved and you can justify a lot of time\nEspecially if you don't have another job and so you could be moving you know five thousand a month out ... easy um and if you're doing that you need to then not only have the personal care contract with all of that information in it\nYou need to then make sure that you take the money and deposited in your account\nAnd reported on your personal income tax return okay so it goes through that process as ordinary income that those two steps to contract and the reporting it on the income tax return converts this from a non from a loving arrangement where you're not expecting to get paid ... an actual\nYou know I expect to get paid proposition yeah\nAnd you might even have the parent issue a ten Ninety nine ... at the end I read it as a gift right we want to make sure so there's no gifts so that if she does get sick and goes in the nursing home later\nThe transfers are not considered disqualifying transfers there is no five year penalty period you've cleanse that and you get to keep what you weren't in the end you're faced with just a last minute planning for for the loved one at that point you\nKnow folks you need to have a solid plan in place Todd's guide\nThat have written for the month of October it's designing an income only ... trust it will show you how these trust are working and it's all in the drafting\nThis guy shows use six different um ... that must be included in your trust and sixteen

have no\nClue no clue really of what's going on um and that again this isn't like something that just happened this year this has been going on for four years at least\nWe were talking about this yesterday at the office and I seen this on TV watching the news and I had seen the story saying you know this rare disease defecting children\nBut the first thing the TV doctor said you know a very very briefly you know that a rare disease that seems to cause a muscle weakness it's not caused by vaccinations first thing I mean it was the first thing\nOut of it is now not caused by ... and maybe it's not maybe\nIt is I don't know but what about why go there why go there yeah and also\nYou know again they've been looking at they suspecting it's you know viral in nature I'm mainly because ... viruses can um uh mutates so rapidly\nUh and um there's so many different types of viruses and you can contract viruses different ways you know through the air to mosquitoes through you\nKnow all sorts of different things so why why jumped to it's not linked to vaccinations that's just such an even I Know when you told me this yesterday pita going\nNot getting the news reports and I'm trying to think of you know okay what are the different types of viruses that potentially you know could be a factor here you know infection or something even dawned on me\nTo think result of vaccine no I mean it just\nYeah which never do would be doing what we do that might be one of the first things we we are\nNow that's what we're usually accused of any ways that you know we're so anti vaccine that that would be the first thing we would say and again could it be like a Gillian by re type in reaction to a vaccine for sure could be contaminated vaccine mean how many years ago\nBack in the fifties they had the uh polio virus that had the contamination of the monkey virus in it and which affected\nPeople's brains yeah would come out for decades again the neurological system and they knew about it and they never breed the word of even coming up for decades because they were concerned about panic they were concerned about panic one you know suing everybody\nBut two people would stop vaccinating so again we're not saying this is this vaccination is the cause but that we don't know that is such a ... why would you rule it out when you have no idea what's going on and why would it be the forefront of what you mentioned and it it it was\nSo I'm such a reminder of autism when when\nThe rates of autism started climbing to in your own you know Twenty years ago maybe twenty five years ago\nThat autism started really becoming like him attention getter and that\nWas also the the thing was we don't know what caused it but it's not vaccination [laughter] we don't know what it is but it's not fair you know idea what's causing it but we can one hundred percent tell you ... and Asians\nAnd interesting enough seems to be occurring in the same age group yeah and who gets the most vaccinations children that particular age group and wonderful interesting anyways they get to take a quick break\nWith an open up the phone lines if you have questions about your health and again you
