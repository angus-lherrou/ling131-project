Shapiro\nYeah um and he came out and spoke about your past with alcohol [noise] and ah outlet you asked her to a and I talk to you and are struggling with alcohol myself\nI'm betting ... trunk when I watched that video [noise] um and I I stopped when do you know this\nThis man with all the stress that he goes through\nA he's he's managed to overcome this problem and become a better person and really I've seen a good change in your personality I'm you become much more humble and so because of your inspiration I decided to step out and go to AA myself and uh it's been a huge help\nValue when did you go to AA when did you just start about three weeks ago and you're still you're still sober Oh absolutely yes having a great time out\nReally that wasn't my experience but good for you good for you know [laughter] so uh\nSo ... what was it that was set in that that that turned you\nKnow it was um [noise] we're talking about the ... it was funny yeah of course it was it was really impacting ... D so honest I mean it's it's got to be tough being in the public I Am out some so personal and that that really hit me like a ton of bricks and um\nAnd then you are talking about the uh the the lady in your in your group that\nSaid oh honey where all the wrong side of this ... [laughter] and uh\nI you know I always seen a meetings is probably something lame or or people that wouldn't understand me or anything like that and that was the one moment that really turned my attitude and made me go well I can walk in the door and do this and I'll be in good company and I found that to be true\nBut I tell you will um every a meeting his difference it just depends on where you are and if you do find one that you relate to go find another one uh because they are and we just wildly wildly different to you walked into a a meeting in midtown Manhattan and uh\nYou know I had a hard time relating to people because they literally were in the gutter and just coming out and I never experienced that in so it was it was different for me um but you'll you'll find the people the relate to I'm so happy for you did did people in your life you know that you were having a problem will [noise]\nUh yes you know my my problems had been I'm\nA pretty obvious for a long time I've I've struggled with alcohol or up almost Twenty years and uh I first I first got drunk and I was Fifteen I I've always struggled from self confidence issues which is kind of the under current that\nHasn't helped me and um when I was around Nineteen I was in a terrible relationship and had a bad breakup and and got into alcohol to kind of cope with it and try and get over it and get over the emotions and I'm\n... I made a terrible drunk decision and kind of been retaliation I committed a crime and um my parents helped me through that time out any counseling caught me things that I needed [noise] but um\nWith their self confidence issues I I have a lot of self hatred that came from committing\nCrime and are coming out of that I was drunk or every day for about seven years you know and I held my life together\nI I Would sober up to go to work come home and just get tanked and start all over again and then I'm back in the past two thousand eight I had a terrible accident I was drunk again uh messing around with fireworks\n... up from Wyoming and lost a fifty percent of my left hand\nOh my gosh and that didn't happen over up\nI soak it up for four years and I got married a guy took on three step kids and walk into a different life rebuild our relationship with God and I came to a point of stress says comes a marriage and um sell off the wagon\nThat's five seconds out of three days of terror or antifa was was threatening to venue they were giving death threat to this old lady who answered the phone they're\nGay hang on hang on we're starting to let's go back to what you were doing what the venue is what will [laughter] and you have to hit on the poster because ah [laughter]\nI think the poster is just to be entertaining but go ahead\nWell I Will try it again I'm a coup she killed a socialist for samurai sword in Nineteen sixty and it's a funny trolls that a lot of right wing guys do it sort of like the Pinochet thing\nFor your rights free helicopter rides for comedies early satire right right so it it it's that kind of set up I announce it on Tuesdays call myself a toy again like Gabby\nAnd I'd photo shop myself into his mug shot\nUm second we announced that and anyone who knows me to know is that a satire antifa goes total blast they start attacking the venue attacking the old lady there the calls are coming from all over the country by the way\nSo this was a planned attack that anti for his work I think the and the and the people are working hand in hand traditional as well organized and well funded\nSo then that those attacks continue night before the venue totally trashed windows smashed ridiculously pretentious manifesto nailed to the door that says that we put the Republicans on notice a this is only the beginning we are not civil which by the way the Hillary quote\nA and then I get to the venue that night for the next night total in outer chaos beautifully made signed screaming hurling bottles of urine which one of them hit my car on the way out\nA ... organized rallies like there's this guy I met said you'll see a few really get deeper into the foxhole where he is calling in to foreign thing you know you guys go over there over there I citizen journalists get beat up\nTake his backpack their police to arrest him and then\nThey they arrest the citizen journalists\nYou know not sorry to arrest three of the of the ten who mop this guy okay but I had I interviewed him today and he was talking about coordinated attacks it seemed very military so this isn't anarchy these anarchist or pulling off\nWell you you know I I don't know I'm sure you are um and to FAA Austin is a on their Facebook page\nHas called for a guerrilla style tactics they've they've called for a\nWhat do they call it a black shirt army or something I read a a red shirt army I Can't remember 'em but they're calling for people that just want to go out and do what ... normally does but they're also calling now for a an actual standing army\nAnd they were looking for people that know military tactics that could teach people so that's that's happening and of course Facebook doesn't have a problem with was covering that but\nI must be the Mets had the police are looking for that my citizen journalists told me about [noise] um so yeah that those guys were charged with assault and robbery because they took his backpack so now you know when I by the way peaceful amount of Martin Luther King I must say I saw the same experience right up to him out and it's been days\nAnd then when it's time to leave I come out there I've got my plastic sword I make a point at which new joke and that's something ... may I jump in the car\nAnd then a group of Proud Boys are are the last ones to go they they leave and the video just came out yesterday on breaking nine one one on Twitter\nThey were attacked by antifa fully clad with all their gear and they throw a bottle at them and the huge fight breaks out and now the new world that fight would have been you know hey cops cops or something like that\nIn the Malcolm X world it's a little bit longer but again five to ten seconds different so we're splitting hairs here you know the real issue is we're up against\nHomicidal lunatics with no gender ... plan it's not like they know where we're going to get you know our our gas and oil from after the revolution these guys just want to burn America to the ground and the media is on their side\nYou know so it's so frustrating because um we had the same kind of thing happening out in in Portland, Oregon\nAnd uh you know Portland has I I don't know who this mayor is what I mean what the hell is he doing where that they're already directing traffic ... the police are standing a block away and they do nothing\n[noise] well my understanding with these super left wing towns like Berkeley in Portland is the mayor allows anti for re chaos and then he can say\nSorry Trump's supporters are trouble I mean look at all the chaos that happens when somebody likes Trump shows up when when Republicans and conservatives are around so let's just you know if you don't want to antifa around stopping huh\nThat's their sort of a mile and it works\nIt's interesting because it because the initial video seemed to indicate that your guys were in the wrong that they had they started this and and they started the violence\nThe second video that was released however shows clearly someone from anti throwing something a at a at a the ... the Proud Boys and and the Mets won the fight breaks out it was not something that you guys at least ... the main one that has been covered it was not something that you guys instigated\nIsn't it strange how quick the media is to run with the evil Nazi narrative which out doing any research whatsoever and isn't it strange to how the media takes the five second clip and makes that\nThe total story when we have days and days and days or some subterfuge stays in the domestic violence\nIt's almost like I'm at I'm at twenty now I think they don't just like ... they are antifa I think a lot of these journalists these little hospital bloggers will go to rallies the masks on I'm convinced\nI Will tell you I I ah I'm having a very hard time defending a the press which I have tried to be more moderating uh on my on my\nWords with the press but the the deeper we get in to the violence on the streets and the calls for kick 'em when they're down in all of this stuff are you there is no excuse when when when the when they will not Cole\nA mob mob an angry mob when everybody knows what that means I I don't know what I I don't know what to say I mean how\nDo you and I can't go to restaurants Tucker Carlson just today said he can't go to restaurants and no one and only when conservative can\nGo to a restaurant today that's a new one and it's because the the media will throw around a white supremacist like it it means absolutely nothing ... white people as above all other races just inherently better\nWhere's the train going here's the train that we should all be on\nThe declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights because that's why people came here in the first place people die\nIn the middle of the night in the desert to get here because we have a a rule of law be we do not have a class system you can break out if you work hard you're smart and you're a little bit lucky you can break out\nYou can change the world you can invent something in your garage and become Bill Gates that's America that's great\nThat's why people come here and we're losing sight of that until the first thing they have to do is ask are we worth saving and I think the answer across the board I'll bet you have eighty percent maybe Ninety percent of America Says yes America is worth saving\nSo what does that mean well capitalism capitalism but not necessarily the way we're doing it\nNow where it's playing favorites the constitution but we haven't been on the constitution nor the bill of rights that a long time but we do need a rule of law let me start asking you know just a few questions and I don't care who he voted for I don't care what side of the aisle you're on\nJust answer yes or no do you hate men\nDo you hate white people do you hate black people do\nYou hate Jews don't you hate cops do you hate capitalism\nDo you want to shout down others that have a different opinion\n\nDo you want to shout down God or hate God\n\nDo you believe screen to violence is the way we solve things in America\nIf you answered yes to any of those things I don't think I have much in common with you but I don't care who you voted for I'll bet you the vast majority said no to all of those things and it wasn't a hard well I don't know it was no no no no no no no no\nThat's who we are\nThose are the people you need we need to unite with but the easy ones to get by\nThe ones on our own side again and again is that I may disagree on a lot of things we disagree I I Believe that it would be much more helpful to take the Martin Luther King's pledge and go and walk through Atlanta FAA\nSinging hymns and let them club you wouldn't have had go ahead let them club you in the head I Know that's not fun I don't want that\nThat video of not breaking ranks and knocked punching back that video will speak to eighty percent of Americans\nThat video will cross all barriers and people will say okay look at these ... they're not even defending themselves look at what they're doing to them you put evil versus good side by side and people in America at least still at this point we'll choose good", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "16"}
