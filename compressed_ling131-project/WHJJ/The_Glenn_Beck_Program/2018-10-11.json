joke\n[laughter] it's not a joke um there is a study out I'm from Morton bay at\nThe University of Southern California at looks at the role that online bots particularly the Russian persuasion might have played in the discourse on social media surrounding the last ... now\nThat might wait wait wait wait wait yeah so you just kind of Iraq by surrounding the last Jedi by [laughter]\nThe last yet ay nice in the low hanging target being a star wars movie what do people care about more than politics I Would say that it's probably the light side versus the dark side of the internal struggle and a

Donald Trump that can be about ... the national anthem\nThat can be about something out of celebrity status and an amplified in sort of turned up to eleven so that people get really heated about it Star Wars is in that category too and there might be some evidence to show that this is actually happening every day\nGives me the evidence this is incredible\nYeah so it's it's circumstantial in many ways but that's by nature of what we're dealing with here when you're talking about foreign influence and particularly malicious activity coming from the Russian ... trolls our stock puppet accounts\nYou were talking about a moving target people who are deleting they're out changing their information making new accounts staying active so that they can't actually the tracks to any given location and if Morton ... researcher at us it could prove definitively that these are Russian agents that he should be working at the CIA\nBut he's not he's just a researcher at USC and what you look at is you look at the characteristics of\nSocial media accounts on line conduit to I what I just mentioned is what behaviors did they engage in to speak in all caps what words they use and then as they are out there the next week when you look up again these are sort of thing that you look\nFor when you're talking about foreign influence on line and it might be Russian that might be the Chinese that might be Iranians or it might be some clarity in what the bone to pick with the rest of the country\nSo that so what did they landed live at what did they plant into our society\nWell in\nThis case what they planted 'em there was evidence that there were sixteen account that could specifically be rushing linked a hundred and five that sort of had a question mark as to where they could be originating from that are jumping on line when the last Jedi comes out in ...\nWe're starting to debate about the movie and then they start throwing in the ... not the admiral admiral hold though and

there was a droid enough\nI remember those\nYeah and and so and but the important thing blended that that comes from real people too and you can't really distinguish what comes first like chicken or the egg did that did the Russian you know ... or troll online plant the spot in a conservative or you know activist or Star Wars fan on line and then they sort of echo it\nOr did it go the other way around um because it is reasonable to look at Star Wars and see some sort of like you know progressive fingers in the pot but there's also that discourse on line that happens where you sort of amplify\nAnd here's something you need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week quick start now only Nineteen Ninety five go on to order more [noise] let's see if we can get you out

... that may not it went it without being applied to\nSociety and we're starting to understand society as and they'd be constructed insisted this power and knowledge is a construct of the power that it comes from language that language\nIs dangerous because it constructs that reality that and that sort of the key ideas which are underlying that the problem with that we're seeing now\nNow you say that it doesn't have a ... that it's not playing worrisome in art but I Would consider literature art as well and this is this is now how we are being taught that we have to read literature\nThat uh we read it through the lens of oppression white male European oppression um even if the even if the author is saying no no that's not what the story is about but not the author is not even the the last word on this is the\nThe post modern is they can take and read that tax any way they want correct\nAbsolutely yes I mean I think that they like contagion because that probably ... to ... out of the cultural philosophical problem that a lot and look\nFor example what would be a very different saying it would be something that had made clear that it has an unending ... which is just the beginning of the lost histories which doesn't add up it said that is the style that is oh\nOkay completely separate from okay largely stick thing\nAll right so you're saying as an artist you could create something that has no meaning a but it is only when it's used as a critique that it starts to get into trouble\nYeah yeah okay this is someone who had attended an eye on and that adds up and then not political says than not the same proper\nGreat okay um so tell me how it uh where it grew in and how it grabbed us by the throat or university systems\nAt the end of the original slugging it

[noise]\nIt wasn't until the late eighties early nineties when I lost of and feminist and a critical a serious cliff hanger stick that just said\nWell taking everything is is a little bit of well yes we need to deconstruct pay to see that everything is socially constructed but we have to have some kind of reality if we're going to address anything we cannot face on poll address\nAnd ethics and

at least have a basic handle on it you don't know what you're fighting you don't know what's really happening you don't know who's behind a lot of his or what the series are behind it\nUm so let me let me first say post modernism the modern world is the world that was created that chased out the dark ages it was the it's the world created by the enlightenment of of science and reason ... empirical evidence\nUh and and even I mean the ... when you hear people say mathematics is racist this is because we're there trying to deconstruct anything that holds the modern world together is that correct\nYes they they think that it has been constructed I'm saying is that a lot of Boise has been left out and this relates somehow toilet technology side I think he has a problem with\nThe idea that then irrational and I mean there are cool I'm known ages is that the property of winning or ran at the white people yeah that that is that is how it works\nOK I'm going to take you before we
