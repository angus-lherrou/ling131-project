someone wouldn't disqualify forty years later for the Supreme Court face for all the wonderful or the room you're giving him what leeway but here's the situation where they're just like\nWhat but what it does say when it does is it plays into a larger picture of this man he was in his anger\nWhen he was drinking and the shows that he's capable of doing anything\nSo if I never even reached further I Know if he would've come on and he would not have been angry\nI Would have thought something was up\nBecause nobody does that to me my family nobody nobody is going to make those charges and smear my name without me at least responding forcefully and then if you don't like the anger\nI Want you to hear me clearly I did not have sexual relations with our aim thing yeah he looked and they praised him for being angry about it they praised him for his forced fullness\nYou can tell the president was angry he wants to get back to the business of the of the American people\nSo no matter what he did it would've been a problem\n[noise] they keep\nMoving the goalposts now here is here's my ... to Donald Trump\nFirst of all\nI don't believe any other president in my lifetime was an exception of Reagan and I'm not even sure Reagan would\nHave done it no other president in my lifetime would have stuck stuck with Kavanaugh all the way through those hearings\nThere's no way they would have said that cost is too high they just wouldn't have done it so hey points for Donald Trump for having a fine and go and this is garbage\n[noise] be\n\nWe're in this situation now and if there is nothing if there's ice fights\nDon't give up the ship do not move because if you move now they're going to do this every single time and you cannot cannot give any ground\nWith that being said and I don't think this is a chance at all if Ford\nIf those those charges turn out to be right you noticed you notice the media is not furthering the Ford and testimony\nThey're no longer on that yeah nobody in my ... she's been abandoned already right she's done she's done she served her purpose she bought time they used her as a pivot to something new\nOkay so there there there's nothing new there there's nothing new or the press would be saying do you watch what's going to come out this FBI there they're not saying that they're not nobody has come out and said you know what I was so offended by how forceful he was\nAnd I wasn't going to say anything but I Know that that happened\nNone of that is happening\nWhat is happening is people are saying you know I was for him and I wasn't going to say anything but in [laughter] you know as soon as he started to say he was he was an altar boy\n[noise] I remember him drinking so that's what's coming now and they're going to go after perjury\nYou watch that it by the end of the week that's what they will be talking about\n\nIf Donald Trump please please Donald Trump\nThe only chance you have and the only chance the Republicans have if this thing goes awry in any way you have\nTo have a plan and announce it in the same press conference that you say\nYou know he he you know quit or vote went down all went down in ... down whatever it is whatever it is whatever it is that press conference you must say and here's my next nominee and we're going to have it done before the election\nNow the old in my opinion the only one that can stand that is likely because you don't need how long did they do take the due to the ... sessions\nAh well ah I mean he was he brought in January ... he was inaugurated and then a February eighth he was the vote went down so let it for weeks at three or four weeks for an hour we could have probably could have fast read other things going on I'm gay so you have\nFour weeks to do it that's what you have now for the election you have four weeks the one who can get that the the one who doesn't need all the FBI checks and all of that is likely it's already been done he's the only that if you get done quickly yeah he's the only one that can be done that quickly\nAnother senator but Mike Lee is the guy and Michael is the only senator on the list yes so so you've got you've got Mike ... you could select Tim let's
