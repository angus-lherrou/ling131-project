okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser Christine afford\nShe was the she was the woman that was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend\nShe well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years experience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by ... head of homeland security as the a sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nLet me say that again the woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was ... rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year so she's not a democratic hack\nAnd also not a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true she goes in ... her expertise is on old crimes\nTo be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win\nAll right before I continue and tell you what's in her memo\nLet me just preface it with this we're not going to see any of it CNN dot going to be leading with this\nNew York times is not going to have this on the front page but it should be the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats\nLeft wing activists the media this is absolutely devastating to you\nI Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line\nA she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this isn't even a he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them\nShe adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nI don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case not to the court not for prosecution [laughter] but before the committee nor\nDo I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard\nAnd quote it's pretty significant do you think [laughter]\nAgain like she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this\nUh this poor woman because she was a girl ... yeah Brock Obama's ah the homeland security prosecutor addicts crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amounts of credibility I've been with the left yes\nSo she's saying that it's it's it won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee this explains in my opinion why\nIt was leaked in the final hour because every one who saw this knew exactly what it was now she explains why\nShe says Ford has significantly changed her story several times in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute it may look like she's credible are based on what she said not how she looked\nYou're looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this is this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session lifts the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year and a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six but then something changed\nThree weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein office the date of attack changed to the early eighties\nNow you might say what difference does it make well if you say you're in your late teens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen\nYear in high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've been saying mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens\nWhy did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years it\nIt gets better this is again I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report it gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with their lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged attack attack\nHappened in the early Nineteen eighties but then something strange happens\nIf you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the early\nNineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties perhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was false and it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post for narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two so let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of weeks\nFor more information visit s any hardball die hard that or or tell the American Heart Association at four O. one to two a twenty three twenty five\nHas taken care of all entwined to someone

you believe certain things that he doesn't align with those beliefs let's find that's what the Democratic process as for\n'em now that being said you you leave it at that rate you don't go ahead and try to chop off someone's head\nAnd promote these outrageous accusations against him a specifically the the one by this this woman Julie sweat Nick who just don't even ask the snow is I mean we're there they are so absurd I I actually attended an all boys Catholic school too so I could kind of speak to the culture and how\nHow those communities operate I mean the thought that a group a Fifteen year olds would be running a gang rape cartel\nAll throughout high school and nobody would know anything about it up until now is just is ludicrous and then that eight and a goal this woman must have been like Twenty years old at the time that this happened achievers frequenting parties with high school ...\nYears [laughter] I Know I Know is high school sophomore myself oh man oh all me and my buddies\nWe were [laughter] the college chicks were all over [laughter] you know women women usually look for a young man you know especially those in high school that never happens that never happens\nEspecially Brett Kavanaugh who let's be clear the guy sounds like he was a complete Bork when he was ... when he was in high school this is somebody who kept\n... you can see on his talent or he literally has notes on his parents would ground him I mean this guy was a complete ... in high school and you're like the kind of guy who if he comes home with your daughter or your sister you'd say she really did well first off this is great I'm really happy\nSo the thought that this guy was running a gang rape cartel in the suburbs of Maryland is just asinine on his face but you're saying is that we have entered I think that we abandon a traditional forms of religion and now we're in the church of the social justice right\nWhere we just believe things based on\nA matter of faith based on historical pattern of injustices and notions and that's what's happening here late but they want to believe that this guy did all these horrible things or because you know a women have had it rough for many years and there there there has been a lot of sexism in there it's still exists therefore he's guilty right\nIt's a it's very similar to the rationale we saw in the OJ Simpson trial but almost in reverse\nThis is like reliving the O. J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he was guilty because the LAPD is allegedly racist\nRight so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago\nThat ... that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black men for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life and they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believed he was a was innocent more than they wanted a black man to beat the system\nYou go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community and they all know that he killed the un Nicole\nAll know it so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and and let me tell you I think a\nDoctor's poured who testified she's a serious person cheated as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right but when you actually start dissecting hurt her testimony ah I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws\nA just a it's a series of inconsistencies that would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right\nSo the fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications ah include all communication so\nI understand how talking points are circulated and how people get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized to support look the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucified someone with zero evidence\nThen what you're doing now is that they're moving the goalposts right I I saw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about a well you know he must have drank when he was in college or whatever I mean who cares\nIt's a completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like tweeting Adam Lawrence those goalpost seemed kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter]\nSo John Carlin we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is\nA Democrat or who are has not lost his footing ah with with reason [noise] um so the address people\nAddress people who are let's say a twenty something female that says you know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\nYes and there's also a a a chance that he was db Cooper right there you have to go by the evidence that case you have to evaluate a case it based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular situation\nOther ... that are justice qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he he's a centrally being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system short of murder\nSo the question now is the commit this right and there's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion they in fact all of the evidence that has been presented is the scope of tore right there the guy's pounder clear is that right\nThe testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also clear as him so you you have to\nCast that aside and then you want to oppose this nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely find that the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic where we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's knocked\nMe there is in the court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but you're you're you you were asked to write this would not meet ... any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because you have here is a series of of accusations that have been made\nWith zero Robert of evidence zero independent evidence to back this up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nHer testimony she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline of when this happens four times so I think people need to cast aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell he is going to\nYeah yeah but what we cannot do is play guilty by association ride mark judge I I've never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of this country has never met met right so we're just going off of here see right now\nAnd based on its own memoirs of somebody who was a very quotable person who had a serious drinking issues it's not Brett cabinet but he were not nominating mark judge of the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with the judicial philosophy that's fine\nBut well we can't do as destroy someone's life destroy his family was like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud right we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations\nJust because we disagree with them politically or ideologically at state and that's what they do and and and banana republic spending third world countries that's not what we are in the United states of America\nJohn Carlos ... a Democrat when when we come back I I I Want to ask you if you don't mind holding on for a second generally do you have to um I actually have to run the meeting well okay alright well run to talk ... we'll talk some other time thank you so much [noise]\nI really want to I really want to hear from people ah they can respond to what I'm hearing from the Democrats now which is um um we just have to stop\nAll of these people the people all the people on the all the people on the right you know we need to break up their dinners you know as I said earlier one one prominent Democrat said we should um ... what stops us from disturbing people where they sleep\nCalled Jess Massey invest an hour of your time

you're going to be fascinated by his story and I want to start\nAt the beginning with him let's go to ... are now hello Larry how are you\nAt Glenn how you doing good morning\nThe morning or so I wanted to talk to you I'm really from the beginning if you have time to tell me the story of your life because you were you've had kind of a rough childhood\nYour your dad was black your well your mom was white they weren't married he was in the sixties that's not a popular thing moms moms family she was afraid wouldn't accept you is that how it started that's true okay tell me the story from there\n[noise] sure um I was born in Manhattan\nI'm as you as you said biracial parents and my my biological mom didn't take the family would accept me so she put me up for adoption so uh my biological father was not in my life\nSo I don't know um what he was thinking but that he wasn't in my life so I was very lucky and I was adopted by a biracial couple um my mother was ah my mom who was my brother um was German\nAnd met my father who was black and the army in Germany they brought me to the south Bronx and that's where I was raised by you say to him\nAnd you might know in the seventies and sixties when I was raised this was not the best neighborhood um so that's where I was raised a my father was a corrections officer at Rikers um the jail here in New York City and my mother was a waitress and then worked in a bank\nShe then I left and we all we live together we we rate got enough money to we actually are packed up it was up to ... when I was around eleven years old my father finally made enough money and my mother we work hard to get that we got out of that the bad neighborhood and got to Long Island and when my ... my father died he died of cancer and when he passed away it was very hard for my mom\nBecause how old were you I was a twelve so\nWhen my father died\nUm my mother's family was in Europe and that basically abandoned her for leaving and my father's family um abandoned us also\nSo we were basically now\nI'm at that point I was very hard for myself and my mom of course as you could assume so by the time I was Seventeen I was ready to get outta here and I decided to get out and I thought you know what I'm gonna go off I'm going to join the army that's where I saw it on the go join the army like my father would be like my dad and go join the army\nSo I go off to the recruiting station I'm In this case there were all for recruiters in the same building and I go to the army recruiter and he tells me son is going to be great

what he said for ... years are you ready I said yes and I signed up when\nI look back at that and then I didn't know what I was doing what I'm saying I was just reacting but when I look back at that\nKnow I was desperately seek seeking positive male role models I didn't have and wrinkle gave me many of them and that was a a great thing that the marine corps of the military is not everybody and not much to join\nBut for me it really helped me tremendously and I said all the time without the marine corps I would've been a punk because I was lost at Seventeen completely lost in the marine
