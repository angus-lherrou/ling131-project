just society that is America [noise]\n\nBarely winning going back program one of my favorite guys or because he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves he looks and he tells the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line\nAnd that is exactly the right name for it [laughter]\nIt is that actually the creepy line comes from a speech that Eric Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gay but it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go and then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and here's Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to plant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually here at Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's up to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's\nJust telling you he he doesn't sugarcoat it and I think it's his background as an engineer a and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film was saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there more than just a company making money or they have a certain the east coast and sort of a world view and part of the reason that they structured the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it and Schmidt has been always very direct about saying it yes part of our mission\nAs a company has been to try to shape and changed the values\nOf the United states and that sort of one of the premise of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlenn they're using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's continue tied this all to Kevin ... and what we've seen with the Kavanaugh case and how for instance you know there's there's um a\n... there is this overwhelming ah understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen that\nRight yeah it's it gets very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past ah in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the result of the people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody is monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is a Google is a verb now I'm not a noun verb auto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yeah that's real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabin on me and I don't know exactly what because that's occurring right real time but the bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about a ...\nAbout these internal emails where you actually had Google engineer's saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of us suppress certain stories\nUm this is the thing and Google does it end and here's the the the the point that we try to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story the pointed out in the open you have combat and by the way the fake news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton\nThat fake news to add that the Russians ran of Jesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you voted different\nWet I wasn't but that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because the confirmation bias you know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right why we'll you'd I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back\nDo you have an answer their answer on why they won't make a transparent\nYes and it's not very good\nAt it not the name of the documentary is the creepy line the gravy line dot com Peter ... with it and we have a lot to discuss because of the platform Ming\nA and kind of a role in from our last conversation about\nInformation out of you know that it's true and we'll true information will will actual information\nWill you be allowed to see or keep in the future [noise]\nClan that

comes from a a\nQuote from the guy who's running the Google that you know we were not going to implant things into your head but we're going to come right up to that creepy line that's terrifying beer from somebody who's in charge of Google\nPeter uh I I wanted I Want to talk to you about the platform ing\nI Am currently saying to anyone who has a conservative voice\nLet's all get on a single server let's get on to our own platform together we don't have to join business or any but we have to have a protected platform because I Believe these companies\nAre are going to the platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing going here yeah I I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back in first to consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine\nGoogle actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning\nThey blacklisted the entire Internet\nThat shows you the the scope and the size of Google ... wait a minute if if the ... bay blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW yes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an area that they but but the point being the size and the scope of this company is enormous\nAnd a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using it Google product somebody will say why don't use Gmail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but here's your company ... you know it may be John Smith acme incorporated dot com but his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product because if it is\nGolf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states use Google we we we highlight in the film for example Robert apps signed this caller who has been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a Harvard PHD in psychology um ran a did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this is back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google product they had shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech chip on general a gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being that have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves\nThey view themselves as a company with a mission so\nHere's what people say when when you know what I use ... well you know Google is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually you are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however\nThey are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their age I research so Google isn't free right for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product we say what are the schools product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of us look\nThere's ... this is just at the beginning let me tell ya ... story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of Beijing many people it used to look it up for me what are you still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they

words it was in on the property that you guys zone correct was outside at the right All right so uh what's your question\nMy question they want me to\nOr you know saying you know thank you\nI I think I Would throw it out right All right you're saying\nI'll say it's not going to happen it's not going to happen and if you go ahead and find me and put a lean on it or or keep on hitting me or I get to go to court and because you don't have the right to find me for something that I don't do to the property\nThat far into and the question is how far away from the property do you sue me for I when I put what I put garbage on there certainly are tenant because you are responsible except the tenant would be responsible for whatever\nHe or she put a outside of the property so you ask how how far away twenty five feet fifty feet two hundred yards how about half a mile since it's not on the property you might as well say that\nYeah why should I mean\nYou're not you're not well no you are or you are responsible for what she does on the property that year I agree I ... so you're fine\nI just say you just say no you just say no and they are going to start leaning you and you are going to take it to court and you and you want to look at the CDC in ours and I'm sure he has to do with their property it\nWe already did OK certain right what's your question\nThey go ahead and start and and and

have a creative person and my question is in the car and then have the America company well being in\nA claim from the other party ... and ... about it and be out of it\nI didn't understand one word of that so then you go through from the beginning All right you rent a car you want to extend the rental period correct\nOkay no problem there but was there was an accident somewhere in there\nYeah because I got America because of the accident\nOh you have to extend your rental car because of the accident that you that you had this being taken care of okay so All right now what\nSo my question is um the other part of my insurance is paying for up to be on thirty days\nHi okay well then that's your insurance yeah the other party should be responsible for anything reasonable your damages or your damages\nAnd there is a and if the damages run that you'd eat forty five days for example to repair your car they just pay for it that's what happened to me I'll get my car had to effectively be replaced and since it's a beamer sweet quarters of the parties had to come in from Germany\nOn a ship and so it was almost two and a half months in do you know the other side just cough it up now I had to pay for it I put it on my credit card after thirty days\nI don't want to do it I don't think you have a choice I don't think you have a choice as the other side is going to send the check out until the repairs finished\nWhat my question is this is my question why my inner part of the companies have filed a leading just like what am I prefer well ... ... my attorney\nBecause you know because they have because they have nothing to do is follow lean why the other it's bigger than they have nothing to do other insurance company that's paying you has\nNothing to do with your insurance company not aware of what's happening is it's your insurance company is fronting the money uh\nAnd the other side is going to pay and by the way your contract with your insurance companies will front the money up to thirty days\nRight right yeah so no there's no place you can go but the good data so you'd have to write a check or put it on your credit card but the good news is or the other side will pay for it if it's reasonable as I said two and a half months to repair my car\nUh yeah it took that long and in a State Farm insurance which the other drivers are insurance companies they didn't quibble didn't quibble I mean there are adjuster went out saw what was going on understood and uh just wrote the check and let me tell you it was not cheap ah repairing a a beamer\nWhich is why I'm probably going to give up my beamer odd because I just I mean everything costs a fortune on that court I mean crazy\nJohn Hi John welcome hey how you doing yes or on a good\nRestaurant from the older

that I had the right to tell my interest because it was like a four Plex and a strip mall\nOkay and and uh he called the owner which she should have done the owners say oh no you can't tell you this is the answer is I owned a property\nYou know get to me on hold on hold on ... that's a bunch of BS you can't sell your interests to someone else is there you have a lease correct\nYes you're right ... ... is there anything in the least that gives the owner of the property the rights to deny new owners from coming in for example they have to well they have to okay you\nKnow then you're fine in

no questioning on her to have any right to do that you should have gotten you should've gotten she should have gotten a lawyer ... minute you were locked out the minute he said no\nThat moment in the

come into how can I take my that we had in mind that brought it back\nGo you have to ask for it for one thing well actually the ah the landlord has to give it back to you ... are pursuing per law now you have to give a the obligatory notice you have to give a thirty ... thirty days notice any name of it and then you move out how much deposit do you have with the landlord\n... hundred and fifty dollars\nNow or you have a couple of choices are technically you have to pay the full rent and then\nThe a landlord I has the ability has legal rights then do walk through and assuming there's no damages than right she was seven hundred and fifty dollar check let me tell you people normally do they use that deposit towards their last month's rent and even though technically\nUh the landlord can force you to pay the rent\nThe the problem is that he has to offset the seven hundred and fifty dollars that he has so it really becomes a wash and so just see what happens try or just call him and just tell a land where can I use\nThe uh the deposit towards the last month's rent and it's the places and reasonable shape you should be OK depending on what a bastard the landlord has arisen\nAlright alright alright there you go see some question sure why not a George Hi George ... or\n... ... talk meant management [laughter] management center of the argument of Veterans Affairs

what did they what were they arresting you for I Know while they're part of that or will they anything\nLike taking a break or you're going to the restroom or something like that\nWhen I was up wasting something like that or you went into the restroom again they don't arrest people for going to the restroom so when when\nThey somebody said you know hey this guy's going the richer him they made a bit of a big gossip over the whole thing\nBut why what what are the ... when they arrested you uh they said you're under arrest or what they say you what did they oh you did you want to ...\nNo

assuming it's a remarkable trust your normal everyday trust than they can change things around correct yeah OK\nYeah while they're doing their they cover lawyers that my grandmother's home and a lawyer said that you know it you have if they ever have to go to the home that the government because they have so much money here come back she's getting paid for it because she's on Medicare and that that government could come in time and money\nNo unless she is she had been is uh she had been a fishery of uh the ... of the narrowest\nWith regard to my parents if something were to happen to my parents and they were going to go home oh I can say that they can get some type of paperwork that can stop that from happening\nI Would be there or if it would be in the ... trust where you're at [laughter]\nWhere are your parents no longer have any control at all the trust is set up and then it's over that's done they just don't own it which means that they don't have assets for the government to grab but because they do go on I think not Medicare uh in debt\nAnd I don't know what the rules of Medicare but they're not going to let you go on the government Dole and pay for for example a home\nOr to live for folks living with a million dollars in the bank that's just not going to happen now and then go yeah lawyer\nIf they're not going to cost ten thousand dollars\nTo do that to what to change it to make a a a ... trust\nThat make it so that they didn't give me the name but I Know that's great anybody's charge you Fifteen thousand or so that is crazy\nYou know what

there's a good part\nOf course at yes I Know plus [laughter] five eight thirty five per cat forty five ... dog a car I'm not an okay\nUm my question is my favorite animals now I'm In I'm embarrassed they won't get into that but the animal ... um [noise] I can I weigh the\nOther side of the federal good question or work yeah well you're not going to be able to pull it off with two cats I promise you that\nEven if I got the paperwork\nUh yeah yeah well what if you have five cats and they're all service animals with uh you probably could get away with one\nEye and I'm sure your stuff and then I don't know if they can still charge you a for the cats are ... you know yeah that I Do know that don't know but for you arguing the service animal business then are you um\nYou would have no chance they can charge whatever the hell they want pet fees you can charge extra so like the bottom line is I for one service animal and it's now this is this an emotional\nService animal or is it a city in motion support or is it a straight out service animal\nI Know no respect for an emotional\n... yeah because they are very few seeing eye cats\nDon't they [laughter] yeah yeah they're not that they're\nNow I understand right to I if someone wants to ask me about a seeing eye chicken and it wasn't a wasn't the same I said probably not\nSo the quick answer is I have no idea if a money can be charged but if it I Can't it would be under those circumstances and therein lies where the rules are changing rather dramatically because there's a big difference we know train service animal in this
