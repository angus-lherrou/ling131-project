Providence and I aren't radio station and the news and I was at least ... rupture you buy guy go\nAnd the president is absolutely the victim of attacks by the media there is no question the mainstream\nMedia has been painfully obvious that they are not fans of Donald Trump on many occasions the attacks that are that they have a ... have been the hitting him with and then silently retracting\nAre false\nBut also the media has been under attack by the White House for very long time\nIt's not an issue with just the current administration and stop making it one President Obama was historically a nightmare for the free press and you refuse to say anything about it\nThe crazy thing is today\nThe craziest thing is is that the media gleefully gave Obama a pass even though he was ... the FBI and the de OJ against the press\nDonald Trump has gone so far as just calling them fake news and they got their feelings hurt\nForget about the oh I don't know threatening to throw us all in jail\nThis president is calling us fake\nNews yeah well he kind of has a point just if you even look at how President Obama treated the press compared\nTo you know President Obama was putting new people\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nOh [noise]\nIs I mean he was gearing up for its outrage over being called fake the New York times was publishing an article\nOn the very same day these pipe bomb packages were delivered now I Want you to remember this or you just want you to just just put this in your pipe and smoke it for a little bit\n\nThere being called fake news they're being called liars they're saying\nNo no no no we're not we don't publish fake news we don't have anything against the president is not a vendetta and while\nThis is happening the New York times is printing ... an article titled five novelist imagine Trump's next chapter\nFive novel lists imagine Trump's next chapter\nThe main image at the top of this story shows the White House on fire and thinking into the ground as President Trump waves goodbye each novelist had one assignment right out what you think happens after the bowler investigation is completed okay [laughter]\nSo let's come up let's go to fiction writers and come up with what they think is going to happen with Mueller's investigation and what's going to happen immediately after\n\nYou mock me\nMock me\nEvery single one that's going to come into the prize they found five fiction writers are going to do it but every single one wrote a short story depicting a scenario where the president was found guilty every single one\nIsn't that amazing they couldn't find one fiction writer to write something where Trump was not guilty it's crazy one story had Trump's signing the twenty Fifth Amendment a and another even had him of being assassinated by a Russian agent with the help of Secret Service\nYeah\nWe can write about the president being assassinated advocating violence I don't know what ... what are you are you kidding me know that it was about the Russians that wasn't about a coup yes yes okay Secret Service was involved but that's not about a cool\nThis is the New York times\nYou know the ones who are leading the way saying oh my gosh the talk of violence is so horrible oh my gosh and we don't print fake news you're supposed to be investigators you're supposed to be neutral\nI thought that was the idea let's be neutral\nNow I understand that everybody has an opinion but five riders and no one can come up with anything other than the guy is guilty and maybe he's going to be killed by the secret service\nThis is unbelievable\nHow is it the two hundred journalists can sign a letter claiming that everything is the president's fault when the flagship of the American media is writing this bull crap while the pipe bombs are coming in\nThis this time space exhibit a\nFor why journalism is currently dead in America it is dead in America all of you dancing on the grave of Megan Kelly really what was her was her big thin she asked a question that\nOh my gosh lock her in a tower\nOh my gosh she's got to be chased out of the public ... you can ask a question don't you dare ask a question\nThis is frightening America fact\nFinding is gone the media has already made up their mind they know the answer and if you disagree they will chase you out of the public square\nThey have no inclination to actually at even attempt to find the truth even attempt to understand\n\nYes there's little righteous indignation and me it's not an anger is it is righteous indignation\nBecause I have called these people I have talked to these people I have gone to them over and over\nAgain we've had in hand and said listen you need to understand how half the country feels\nJust have a conversation you're making a huge error and yes I made all these errors oh my gosh I'm the worst person in the world I'm with you just listen to me please you have to hear what half the country is saying\nThey won't do it they're not interested they don't care and now there are quite literally making it up\nWhat's the difference between a novelist and the New York times journalist I don't know\nMedia\n[noise] this is a radical concept and I know you like radicals you love radicals\nYou don't you feel like there's nothing wrong with being radical mob yeah those are those are just people that feel passionately so I Know you love radicals\nBut here's a radical idea if you don't want to be called fake you might want to just start with literally stopping publishing fiction\n[noise]\nFriday over twenty Eglin backer program [noise]\nSelf awareness seems to be dead at this point in the media in particular Glen or this one what is the one thing that if you're conservative Trump makes the ACA criticisms of the media they say\nHey it's fake news hey these guys are relying hey there to the enemy of the people and they say that\nSame as violence like your your your your ... I Can't go there yet I Can't I Can't I got to take a break I Can't go there yet I Can't I Know where you're going and boy does it need to be said I Can't do it yet had a cat do you need a video\nI just say crank either that or we are now he thinks that's it again I'd been telling you for years to get to your alcohol if we can reignite that it's going to be a good ratings most time can I tell you something the blackouts I Need the blackout right now I Need them so desperate that right it would be so great I forgot about everything that they said that was so stupid yesterday [laughter]\nI don't even recall it at all I Love that idea\nI Need to take a break first let me tell you about car shield\nCar shield is ah is is going to save you from a lot of trouble they're going to save you from taking your car in and\nYou've got something wrong with it or even an oil change and then it comes out and they're like her going to have some bad news for you and we found some extra stuff and it's going to cost and you're like why\nLook\nThese are surprises that nobody wants and everybody gets but if you have car shield you don't have to worry about it\nIf your car breaks down after the warranty expires you could be out of pocket for thousands of dollars just to get it fixed but if you have car shield chances are you're not gonna have to come out of pocket for anything\nThat if you if you want to take your car into your favorite mechanic or the dealership usually people go to the dealership [noise]\nUh I mean ... to put it this way why do you avoid the dealership after your warranty expires you avoid it because you can maybe get it done cheaper a by your favorite mechanic and maybe he's not using you know the same parts or whatever you'd have a fix by the dealership near warranty expires if you have car she'll know problem\nIf you look on I mean you get this example of it on social media all the time I mean if we couch it all the death threats and horrible things that you get on social media as real all the time\nOh you'd have to have a staff of salads and checking them all out mhm instead you know most of the time people say crap on social media that goes way too far and that they're actually intend on doing they don't intend on a you know he felt that that happened to for example Dana lash right like has to take all those things seriously when she was on TV\nUh ... she got all sorts of threats on her family and they did take them seriously but like\nAs far as I Know at least no one actually acted on those things thank God\nRight so you have these serious threats that come into public figures often and and sometimes they don't wind up panning out most of the time right even ego to look at terrorists I mean the the amount of ... people in the middle east who say that they would execute a terrorist attack\nOn on people who are on you know people from another country for example you know just take it is so high it's incredibly disturbing you almost would never walk outside if you realize how many millions of people will tell pollsters that yes I Would kill American citizens however obviously they're not doing it\nRight whether it's because they're not capable of doing it or whether there are in reality they just want to send a message or they really don't like them but I'm not going to go kill someone whatever the reason is and that could be the situation here could be the same thing from a someone on the left\nWho wants to make the right look bad a week before the election uh sending me things around with no intention of killing anyone but wants to make a big media circus if things are all plausible possibilities we have no relatives and know that other than the fact that these were all political figures and none of the bomb seemed to work really all that all the information we have right now well\nBut I Know that's that's pretty much all the information they had on the rice dog fire and um I don't know about you but I think the Germans behaved admirably I think the Germans did exactly how to go with you on that one no\nBut isn't the rice dog then communist didn't them right Graham\nNews radio nine twenty and

news radio nine twenty and when it first I have an ... year that topical stories we're following a leak of wild weather that included a couple of tornadoes it's ending with a coastal storms\nA it was started by what's his fat face loud mouth guy what's his name to a a no no no uh Alex Jones sixty five percent\n[noise] whatever it is a you know and I and I talked to Bush about this on TV and extensively and he basically said factor that's my strategy I'm not changing it okay so that's number one so Donald Trump could have done that easy\nBut he chose the fight back trumped it\nAnd he said I'm not gonna let these people marginalized me 'cause it'll never end and the American people uh see me as a fighter they see me as a person who strikes back when attacked so while I'm going to do that\nSo then you have to say okay well who started the fracas who started this and you can make a case said Trump's bombastic a tax on his rivals in the in the primary process\nUm started it you can make a case for that how\nHow he's a he's a table names yeah he's a symptom the American people have never been this way we've never been this way no no no is it to them on your feeling be ... and ... to death by being called racist and homophobia and everything else came\nLater when it when it was apparent that Trump was a player and could win\nSee what people don't understand is that in the beginning the press didn't think that Donald Trump could do anything he didn't have a chance he was he was like entertainment All right let's bring out the dancing bear\nThat out of the press saw him but then when he started to win the whole strategy changed and I keep saying that this comes from the corporate level and it does okay so then it was destroy him\nDestroy ... that that would be orders that came down from the editors with a New York times not in those words but it was very clear what they wanted to do Washington Post CNN MSNBC\nElemental Facebook I mean they're on their ... their on video saying that\nYes okay so there's no doubt that people listening to us know that so that it's All right if that's the destruction that has been ordered how does Trump counter what does he do he doesn't have surrogates\nI mean there are no surrogates who can do it for him he has to do it so he does it in a very blunt and sometimes disturbing way for a president but my column said what is his choice\nWhat if he doesn't do it they are going to marginalize and destroy him he'll be the laughing stock and yeah and the liberal precincts he is already but he doesn't care about that but he has a growing I Believe growing number of people supporting him\nAnd the reason he has it is because it gives them no quarter yes he fights\nBack but now they're turning it around saying well your your fight back like Kavanaugh Kavanaugh fought back oh he's out of control oh that's not a if not fight back shows he doesn't have the temperament oh come on\nYour ear being destroyed by these people you're not allowed to show emotion\nIt's the same thing so now with the bomb thing oh Trump did it where where CNN and we're not responsible for any of it all in all ... us\nNow I'm hoping that the vast majority of the American people understand what's happening I think they do because CNN's ratings are so terrible no matter what they do no matter how they ratcheted up still very very few people watch that so I'm hoping to get it\nWell they're not going to um so so bill uh\nHow much trouble or are they in I mean the New York times literally paragraph thirty five\nIn the New York times talks

somebody on the left who wanted to do the same thing could be somebody who is just a really unbelievably worst bomb maker known to man which I highly doubt\nIt could very well be somebody who thought you know what we're going to send these to the press where to send these ... all of the all of the enemies of the right ... obviously they sway an election\nObviously crowd contrived to get media attention to influence them in terms I'm putting my money on putting\nA button [laughter]\nHow do we how does the uh media respond when it turns out that ah it's it's either a prank with no political motive or it was politically motivated or by the left\nWell that would be an amazing story wouldn't it or why I'm hoping the FBI can you know flushes out pretty quickly\n... how would the press handle

you know if you let these people en masse go to the border we're gonna take economic reprisals on Mexico and that's what they'll do and they know it so they'll break it up\nBut some people will reach
