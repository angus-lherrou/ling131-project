know and everyone knows humans are kind of already headed out when\nPeople are you yeah of course but when people are using it turns out my research shows that the research shows when people are using something like a Google Search engine\nThey turn off the biased detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause I think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm and I can trust subjective and impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nUh what what tends to happen is if people trust sweats higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOr one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product in search results\nUh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed in in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it and that we've done with for national elections involving no\nMore than ten thousand people [noise] uh I've shown over and over and over and over again if I favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes with no one having this latest idea\nThat they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track\nYou know that is scary\nIt is you um you leave this out in the in the creepy line I'm about\nHow Google has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and\nWithout an agenda [noise] um and then ah ... how they have ... you know when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where\nYou were you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search result of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect you absolutely no idea of someone we we did this in a national study in the U.S almost no one was aware\nThat they were seeing biased or a search results are still favor one candidate that this really creepy saying there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias so you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you\nUh we did have a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there in two thousand fourteen\nNinety nine point five percent of people in the study a casino bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism uh and and
