I\nGuess I've seen pictures of people in the military for example who are about to fire a missile and they put like Osama bin Laden name on it or something like I get then theoretically possible\nBut if you know a bomb going to explode why would you put a sticker of a right wing me mom and ... and less and less again potentially a you've thought maybe they wouldn't blow up and that people would say the right wing meat yeah right like\nIt's almost as if they put on the outside of the envelope open with care this is an explosive so that they wouldn't explode it's not one of the nine has gone off\nThey all look but they also put glass in instead of ball bearings or anything metal you\nWant metal as your as your shrapnel you ... you wouldn't but glass in the bomb would just disintegrate the glass even more ... you you don't want it in PVC pipe you wanted in a metal pipe because of the shrapnel\nThis is just ... it's there's just too many things wrong with this and again it might just be somebody who was sick and demented charts and ... that was the end the stupid or it might be some kid that taught this would be funny it may might be some\nYou know mentally deficient\nA right winger that did it\nIt also may be somebody who was on the left is like\nOh I Know how to change the narrative could be that\nTwo of ... I don't know I mean you have to have some level of skepticism of\nThe south of the of the obvious narrative here right a which is some right wing or did this I think the first thing that makes you leap to that is it's not they haven't exploded right so if you are trying to harm someone usually you to be able to do it okay\nThe same thing applies I Believe two white powder arriving to the president whenever I hear that whenever right wing ... figures are hit with a bunch of white powder in the mail my first thought is\nWell okay obviously you'd think if someone who was opposed to them but would take a ... minute here and consider that someone is trying to make the president or some other right wing figuring look like they're under attack especially when it turns out not to be right then and just white powder\nWide someone do that well of course there should be skepticism we've had these these things have happened to a hundred times unbelievably when someone just to listen to this I suppose he thinks the\nCommunist didn't set fire to the rice dog as well [laughter] I mean of course take a moment to consider and and there's no reason to come to a conclusion because we have no idea at this point but you see these statement that have come out\nFrom CNN and ... you know people just outwardly blaming the rights and Donald Trump for this look I don't we first of all you can't blame Donald Trump for the ... unless you think he actually was responsible\nDoes anyone think that he actually sent the bombs and brought them to George source of how well no but I think of ... [laughter] unless you think he's actually responsible irresponsible for your own actions we know that\nBut beyond that if you're gonna ... you have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least ... you know the idea that\nThat the the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there's obvious incentive to make America feels that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right they could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs go off\nIt's certainly possible but they are acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's

black face has done historically yes it's not kosher nor should it be\nBut notice what is happening here with Kelly\n... is being fired not because she wore black face but because of words and I the ah ... west ... not ridiculing people why is this wrong with that person\nLight Diana Ross wanted to be like Diana Ross in a costume\nWhy is this wrong\nI think that deserves an answer instead\nWhat we got was an apology I Am so sorry I shouldn't have oh please don't be me please don't beat me master please don't be mean [laughter] I don't want to know are whipping please don't beat me are you kidding me how\nAre we supposed to learn if we don't have civil conversations and yes once in a while we ask a question that's politically incorrect\n\nThe criteria in America right now has narrowed so far\nThat it is it is almost nothing it takes almost nothing to get you fired\n\nYou know we should we should take Megan Kelly and we should take her down to the river and we should put a bunch of rocks around her and throw into the river if she floats we know she's a bigoted racist if she doesn't well we will will know that will know that she was innocent\nThis is so ridiculous how similar it is to the thought crimes that Orwell wrote about in Nineteen eighty four\nHere's a passage for anybody who you know it hasn't sort of something called a book in a while the main character Winston Smith training himself to avoid thought crimes here it is quote\nThe mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself the process should be automatic instinctive crimes stop\nThat's what they call it a new speak\nHe's had to work to exercise himself in crimes stop he presented himself with propositions the party says the earth is flat the party says that ISIS heavier than water\nAnd trained himself and not seeing or understanding the arguments that contradicted them and quote here's another one quote if you made an unexpected movement and then they yelled at you from the tell a screen\nSwap tell us screen swap tell a screen with what Twitter and here we are in reality let me read that one more time if you said something unexpected\nIf you made unexpected movements they yelled at you through the tell a screen\n\nI don't want to ruin Nineteen eighty four for you but let me just say it's not the kind of world we want to end up in\nUnfortunately not enough people read anymore you should because it is exactly the world we're creating [noise]\n\nAll right I Want to talk to you a little bit of other spots or it's one eight hundred flowers dot com

up this way and they're showing how stupid they are and making the point that they think it's okay to dress up in blackface but they actually did it on camera multiple episodes this is a liberal icon of our program\nOK totally okay for them to do it\nFor her to question it and say if it's a positive motivation is that okay well I don't remember\nI don't remember a lot of an outcry from the left over it's always sunny and Philadelphia doing it multiple times they did an entire episode which is one of the greatest television episodes of any series of all time called the gang turns black\nAnd they have a situation where they all wake up after getting the electric or getting struck by lightning and they're all black and they have to live with black people for the day and they walk around an\nOrderly amazing but beyond that it is something that there's been no pushback on look at things like family guy you'll see the animation but still the same types of things happen because they believe and we all kind of like well the motivation there is\nThat he's that they're not trying to be racist an upstarting trying to say black people are inferior or anything like that they're doing this to make a point on the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay\nWhat she's saying here is if the motivation is good let's say a child for example who think they want to dress up as a hero of there's a happens to be black\nAnd they don't want to stand up comics right you want to be black yeah right they don't understand the dynamics of blackface they would think OK well and you would think the kids not racist their motivation is they're trying to look up to a hero and that's the only point you bring up it might not even be true\nWe may say as a society that we think black faces too far and we'd have to just some things but okay but the issue is her asking that question she's saying if it's a good motivation is not motivated by racism and therefore shouldn't be treated the same way as she loses her gig over that I mean\nIt's just completely insane and we're not adults if we can handle that level of conversation\nUse radio nine twenty and one ...\nOne of the
