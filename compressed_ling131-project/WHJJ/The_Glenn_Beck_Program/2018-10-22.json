and weather station news radio nine Twenty one oh four seven ...\nWhen he wakes JJ Providence and I aren't radio station\nAt least ... news as nine as brushing my staples run hear the stories we're working on today several groups that are addressing\nA percentage of people who are really interesting the election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked um you said the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans\nFifty nine percent said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh you had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Saturday and lose the house or at least makes it possible since Kavanaugh that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight so now we have a basically a balance of very close within the margin of error separate\nStation and both of those numbers sixty eight would be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six mid ... two thousand six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy it is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen even if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before\nAnd ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nAre relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple seats and Republican law in the house where they would lose a couple of seats um there is a you know if you wanna look it's going to be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races there favored in\n... and they revealed when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is we know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win\nSome races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some places and whenever the down by five in the polls don't want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that have been losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that\nThe Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things could happen\nBut right now it looks like those are going to wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power gonna have subpoena power are going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it have you noticed that you\nKnow places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation of ... oh\nYeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them I mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance that this uh two months ago I mean they had\nA legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat they had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh saying now I mean I think it's a real\n... going to come to the independence our the independence feeling\nAt the ... there is an interesting group because they are not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence and two thousand six and two thousand ten we're at fifty percent\nNow independent are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that type of course a blanket role but it's typical I'm into doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with him and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo\nYeah but I Wonder 'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls and so I'm Wondering you know would that four percent jump\nWas it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independence that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever being re hire lifelike was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats like yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so and the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line that\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more of\nThis one could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah ... ... I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything\nThey don't like the overall system there's one other interesting boost outta here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah this this burger yeah definitely we talked about among them a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters\nSo uh in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... come Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal sense night and she doesn't tend was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen it was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen ... Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while they were going on is higher than two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that with a wave election for\nDemocrats [noise]\nIf it I mean the only thing I can think of is the Guatemalan refugees what\nElse does happen I mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh unaccompanied\nMinors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages in July or August ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand teaching polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls were for it at some after okay um all the October ones obviously after ... then include\nThe migrants a caravan situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only place it's low um and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen and thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic\nThe crown prince you and I are not going to like this guy\nIs they all look at what he's still he's he's making it easier for women to drive without their husband yeah okay yeah sure sure sure\nHe's still a lobbyist let's look at what both sides in this country have done [noise]\nWe're currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia we are involved in their war in Yemen did you even know that\nPresident Trump announced a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia last year\nIt was President Obama that vetoed a bill that allowed families of nine eleven victims to sue the Saudi Government\nSo both sides everybody is in protecting these guys\nWhen the crown prince came here to America he met with Donald Trump\nOh my gosh but he also met with Oprah Winfrey bill and Hillary Clinton Chuck Schumer Dwayne the rock Johnson for some unknown reason Brock Obama John Kerry ... rice George W.

people who are going to lead\nBetter mouse trap or apple or where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics is in the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are\nThey're anti constitution so you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics but at what point do you see good people say enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end ... what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did a to Nancy\nPelosi in California how are you know where does did to Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao and Kentucky exactly ...\nBecause there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that\nPeople don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do but screaming someone down taking Mitch and Elaine's food off their table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually have\nPersuasion as any goal be\nThe only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rant a witch headstrong pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta and taking a beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... of phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing\nThat I I'm In I'm In the middle of a little downtown sort of restored downtown and Omaha right now and there's no end to fight here and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media college in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties\nSixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that men are basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but it\nWas shared content\nThere was an American way when you fall with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two they're still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world\nIs so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like and to her do who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignore\nThem [noise]\nSo what he is are are we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually come back to every single time is the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone\nYeah yeah is that our our ... or ...\nSo ... or ... soon them out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said\nThe first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech\nRight of protest all of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we believe Margot day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with eternal souls and with dignity that way\nBigger than their policy preferences\nAnd so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a\nPeople are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics\nIs this tension between rudeness and ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there\nIs confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forest and statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers\nDo you think when you leave home on Monday morning when you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if\nThose four things are true or even if three of the four true\nYou're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rooted in us but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships\nAnd the undermining of vocation or long work um ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community and I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and what you write about with deep fake um you seem to be one of the very few in
