in and give us a rundown of the week so far and we have a lot to discuss one of them is Saudi Arabia this story is just getting more and more bizarre\nLet me bring you up to speed in case you don't know that this story started a couple of weeks ago with\nThis idea that this Washington Post reporter is suddenly missing well he's not a Washington Post ... a reporter only\nHis name is ... and uh he is a Saudi Arabian citizen he is also a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nHis beef with Saudi Arabia in his own what he called self imposed exile is\nAll about the Saudis\nNot befriending and not I'm not excusing the behavior of the Muslim Brotherhood the Saudis are very clear that the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization and not a friend to Saudi Arabia or really any one in the world\nSo he went into self imposed exile a and he came here to the United states\nThe there are claims that he is he he was still a Muslim Brotherhood operative there are also claims that he was feeding us information\nOr a a a against the Muslim Brotherhood I'm not sure which to believe at this point\nSo he's overseas he's in Turkey and he is going to get married but he's been divorced to his wife in Saudi Arabia for him to be able to get remarried he has to have a a divorced certificate from Saudi Arabia\nThe Saudi Arabia and say well you're going to have to come into the embassy to get it now he is not a friend to\nThe Saudi Arabian prince the one who has been this big reformer and he is going to you know take Saudi Arabia into the future and he is good for women and he is good for human rights and everything else\nIs shaggy is not popular with that prince and that ... has not been popular with ... the he had been trying to get Chicago as a shaggy to come back to Saudi Arabia but shaggy knew I Would probably be a death sentence to me he takes\nHis fiance they get into a car and they have a drive up to the embassy the Saudi embassy in ...\nHe says I'm going to go in I'm going to get the paperwork they're expecting me I'll be right back out wait for me so she did ours pass she starts to call the embassy she calls his phone no answer nothing\nIs it turns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this happened um but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent\nUm but it looks as though she was interrogated tortured and killed he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know now there's an additional update today\nWe have our secretary of state over in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the crown prince who are now saying privately that yes this was just somebody who went rogue\nMm but it's kind of hard to believe\n\n[noise] the new information today you know is is coming from turkey so we don't know if this is true or not\nThere were two stories or one of the United states came out pretty quickly\nOr last week when this story broke and said we have evidence that this was ordered by Saudi Arabia and he is dead um but they never released where that came from they just released that this was a U.S intelligence sources say\nThat was the first Nick then the the Turks came out and said that they had audio and video tape of this man's interrogation or torture and killing\nI don't know if they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if\nThe Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance you can get that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story but this actually audio arrived first with his fiance because he had an apple watch\nAnd when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it finished recording it just uploaded to the cloud\nAnd downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true for her sake I Can't imagine especially since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if it's if it exists\nIncludes his interrogation\nAh and then uh the the execution ers come in and the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him you can't kill him in here or I'm going to get into trouble and the what's described as the path all adjust\nOr from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you'd need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\nThey knocked ... on conscious and he was unconscious for a while\nThen you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome gruesome tape\nWe again don't know if that is true\n[noise] this may be an Archduke Ferdinand moment down the road this may be the thing that sets the world on fire that doesn't seem like the thing that could set the world on fire but\nSaudi Arabia is our ally we are currently fighting the war on terror with Saudi Arabia who we are currently fighting\nA proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen um we are getting ready to sell billions of dollars worth of war machine\nMurray to Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is quietly supportive of of ah Israel now in the middle east and are taking strong stands to support Israel they are also a an ally with us against Iran they are a balance of power\nIf this tape exist and this tape comes out we've all known\nThat Saudi Arabia is a bad place but we have not heard the screams\nIf this tape exist and comes out\nOpen up the fields here in Texas start pumping again and bring the price of oil down and let's get off of Saudi Arabia we don't need it\nWe'll watch this closely a it's a ticking time bomb\nNews radio nine

I don't think they've taken every dime true\nI yeah I mean difficult to find more to spend a lot of ways to spend them ever ... millions remember the classic documentary or from the Nineteen eighties and would share Richard Pryor was forced to spend thirty million dollars and thirty days\nAnd if he did so successfully from a from a inheritance even received the full in here and it's a three hundred um this is an important moment uh in our culture\nUm but it was difficult because he couldn't take it ... so he couldn't buy thirty million dollar car right he had a zero after it's at the end of it and the idea was kind of like the thing we do with your kids were you\nUh you know they don't actually do this but like in the legend of like you have your kids smoked three packs of cigarettes you get sick and never wants to smoke another cigarette right around that kind of make sure you get sick of spending money so you're good with money from then on was the idea in in a documentary\nUm but how did he wind up actually this is a spoiler alert for Nineteen eighty three but how did he a wind up spending all the money he decided to run a political campaign it was the easiest way to get rid of all of a buddy at All right uh so I think ah you know this is kind of at the aspect where the uh the the Democrats are which is\nCan they figure out another way to spend\nMoney we may even do a little roosters millions or where you come up on stage and you are a democratic socialist [laughter] and you have to spend\nSixty trillion dollars\nTo do it harder than you think it is hard to live you they can you do it\nBut the the socialist already have like can you do it very difficult right it's very difficult when you go over that I don't think we're going back dot com slash tourist place to go by the way to get to grab your tickets Bill O'Reilly is coming up in just a few minutes and we have a lot to ah to talk to him about um I I\nI don't know if you've seen this but uh Minnesota's
