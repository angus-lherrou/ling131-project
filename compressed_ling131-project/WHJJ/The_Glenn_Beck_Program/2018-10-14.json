saying and that's where he is um he's a guy that we had booked last hour and a guy\nKind of went in a different direction but I it it fits right in to what we have been talking about today I had a caller uh about an hour and a half ago who said that you know when is it time that we are going to fight back\nAnd we should fight back we should fight back in the polls we should stand the crew and steady we have to speak truth\nDo not forget the things that we were all taught and we all know are true\nTo be civil and kind to one another but we were\nNot at a place where I think you grab a gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst heads stats are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books on outrage kind of a nice time you could talk about outright\nAnd we did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nKnow it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime you know rage outrageous in the headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do in Iraq I think\nYou know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate your responded\nAnd mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is dance response is I mean they just said I'll just say it I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of people feel like they are there's a lot of built up outrage\nThat is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country ... from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center a well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage\nOr and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world thankful for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again\nI I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's a culture of the whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bon Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll do he was in the end victorious\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were\nThey wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings\nThey're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment and you know not everybody we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that we live in two in every generation has face their challenges\nBut this is our moment and it in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart in some stats up some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a bat Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to hum we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network where we don't need to be\nA shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians\nBy who Christ is and be Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables but he also showed this remarkable ability\nThat we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around to the American woman at the well and I think ultimately we need a better path to the answer is not to\nGet like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know don't stand up for things don't I mean when you said you fight but you fight a you know for example uh you can't war at a people\nAnd reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're to use your title were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nTo not participate in creating photo and false crises and outrage well\nHere's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court ... Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\nBut you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\nWell I think people are if it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attractive to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us\nTo outrage rather than to engage in I think there's a there's a difference between the two and you know I'm so for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life\nYou know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago\nAnd you know you have the kind of you know they're the gold those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some some self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them yeah and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much\nLike them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot in Christians in the age of outrageous is to I used to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with they win some\nApproach and an income for what's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenged a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important that we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game for small just strategically you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses and Jesus ...\nWe take Jesus Moses out who are we modeling Moore we modeling who are we striving to be we cannot forget our art type [noise] back in just a second [noise]\nClaiming that\nTake bakers quarterback stresses statues much of America is getting outraged for our state\nAnd with all of the nonstop outrage coverage we're actually missing out on the stuff we should be outraged about is trying to put the bottle down and end our bender in my new book addicted to outrage I talk about how thinking like an addict or a recovering alcoholic\nCan actually help heal the country addicted to outrage until now wherever books are still [noise]\nUse radio nine twenty and one ...

can\nGo now a lot of people know who Don Quixote is a lot of people that uh that was the guy used to train horses in Finland I think and was one of the great horsemen a ball of Finland do I have that right okay how\nCan I knew it OK almost I almost there was All right but I\nI Know like it's hard to get a lawyer because I have for an hour\nOkay by leaving ... quake that clicking on the crap out\nSo you want a lawyer that'll take equity in a house the practices elder abuse and we had a phone my phone call a ... that there was a sixty one year old man that had just passed the bar and was looking for cases and so you're trying to connect a sixty one year old with taking the elder abuse case\n... no game um who will take and I assume on contingency or take a a lien against a household lie about an hour\nHundred hundred an hour now does it matter as a matter that a lawyer has absolutely no experience and doesn't even know how to spell elder law\nI don't you don't care for the lawyer has knowing Marion son came\nAfter bart I'll do other work\nWhat what do you mean you'll do all the work you're going to do all these ...\nLegal documents I Love to do it in my hobby\nDidn't want to do that then ... ... it's it is this for you of course then why don't you wait a second then why don't you represent yourself\n... ... they they only get fooled that does not look how\nWell let me a a sixty one year old lawyer who has never written a document regarding elder abuse in his life uh that's probably a less competent than you are my dear\nBut he had a choir behind the room\nSo why you can represent yourself I I live so why do you think someone who has Esquire behind their name is going to somehow when the case and by the way it was a case\nDismissed and what was the case dismissed\nNo I got married the guy there going coroners dollars an hour\nAnd ... how did you lose Mary how ... how we thank you lost the case how what does that mean record now\nSo you haven't lost\n... my hair because he wanted her her ... anyone in the area quite I think it's a federal court now like April cost a lot of the\nLaw I see so you lost the case and now you're appealing the case\n... well appeal\nBy the way you'll never find in a good appeals lawyer then it'll charged four hundred dollar an hour those guys are six seven hundred dollar an hour for somebody who knew because they're\nAll right well you have the word out ... ah well you can leave your name and number and if Mr sixty one year old lawyer who's never done a case in his life ever who just passed the bar and you think is going to file an appeal now I have been a lawyer for over Thirty years you know that Mary\nWell what can you hear about that\nProblem is I Would never I don't have the skill set to ride an appeal I Would never dream of writing an appeal I just don't have that skill set that's right I get it so but you want someone with no skills said just because they MS choir behind their name\nWell it's better than we are well no it's not better than you alone I'm telling you you are more invested in this you have more experience in this then that lawyer does or you want to press just because someone has Esquire behind their name\nThat may not saying\nWell maybe mean something but uh not a whole lot so anyway it's fascinating how people are impressed with lawyers are never get\nThat All right I every\nThere you go higher ivory welcome to handling law we're going to do for you\n[noise] Hi I'm I took out a ... year warranty contract with the term my company and [noise] and and that was in two thousand six inches of Seventeen I started noticing that my ... was tripping on the corner of my house and I don't know what\nThey were turned my findings I called the representative that initially tree in my own\nAnd stone made for a couple of months\nI finally called the the main office and explain to them what was happening and that my front porch where the news in my home [noise] they ... their representative out\nExterminated again and then another aspects and told me that I now have subterranean termite so he says you can get an extended warranty mind you I was still under the contract of the ...\nBut yet seen what what's going on underneath my house and he had written which I didn't notice what repair excluded\nOr what do you mean in a way where you didn't notice they so you didn't read the document\nUm we were talking to but you didn't read the document\nNo I didn't know okay oh I didn't know\nAll right so you now subterranean a termites I guess that were treated eyes so they did treat but it said would repair excluded and okay\nWas oh hey so at this point I accepted it another indication from another company to come into and expect said that was in\nJuly now mine chew marches when both termites were treated again the other company findings where it's at major infestation of both I contacted the state of California pest control\nAnd they had no record whatsoever it that this company had ever been to my own tree so they told me\nWhy would they why would they have a record of it\nBecause I might as well ... why would the state of California keep her record of a target my company going to your house\nBecause by law they're supposed to submit them in the form notify them\nThat really okay I didn't know that so they have to be All right so I have to do it within ten days wow I didn't know that okay so every time they treat they have to let the state no we just treated a home hears the address right right by all the news ...\nSo they told me there in violation and that's an internal thing so I ended up filing a complaint with the state of California in the meantime the owner of the company wanted to give me seven hundred and fifty\nAll right let me I mean you know I was going on forever okay this is taking way too long so the bottom line is there in violation internally or you can sue them for all the damage or based on the damage subsequent to they're\nComing in and treating and then you can argue that they had not had they had they treated correctly all the additional damage wouldn't have been done I don't think they can defend even based on the fact that they were violation of the law that's probably the violation of that uh that ordinance that statute it would be ...\nYou got a small claims suit that's it and now when you say you bought an additional warranty was that from the tour my company or ... or a third provider\nNo from the same\nTurtle okay you're you're you're in pretty good shape a you have to do I have to go out get another term my company to straighten all of that out including the term I damage treat everything and I just saw him a small claims court\nOkay now my question is

you're you're saying ah the form he's asking you to fill out a W to form or are you going to previous W to form for a previous job\nA ... a previous that route to form a\nFor free from previous jobs\nYeah no I don't know but that doesn't have the right to do that uh because effectively what he's doing is asking for your salary and it's against the law to ask what your salary was ... because it's one of his business how much money you earned it the previous in employment\nSo no 'cause you you don't have a right to say I need to see your previous W to form doesn't work that was\nAround ... ...\nYeah there's a bigger law that says you cannot ask for a how much money someone has made previously\n... and it don't\nMean I don't want you to form a previous double your true form says exactly that well so even if it wasn't ... just saying you can't do that you say no but\nWhat are you doing yeah how about the color underwear I'm wearing a so uh no I don't think ah that works or John Hi John you're up\nTo eight that rent or not oh now I'm On the amount that carried on they're claiming that there are no damage\nTo their car and so you're talking about the so you're talking about they moved out right John\nThey are in the hot now okay\nAnd what you're saying is that the damages are going to be greater than this you know or the rent is greater than security deposit correct\nOr do they have there on the part that they\nThey do that all the time All right so what's your question\n[laughter] so my question I I brought it up to them they are claiming that I'm Around you know what I mean I called and emailed them\nWell okay I Do what is going on right okay here is here's your your your choices and I'm going to tell you just suck it up and here's why I technically they have to pay you the rent there is no question about it and the security deposit is a separate issue\nAnd the security deposit is about\nProtecting you from damage\nA particularly protecting you from damage or to the property so I assuming that there is no damage\nOr even if there is damage what happens is they are of course saying where you put the security positive towards the last one threat and you're saying no you can't do that so you have the right to sue them\nBut but you have to offset the amount of money you have a security deposit as against three so it becomes a wash right so what are you gonna do you're going to sue for a wash and then\nThe issue is if there are damages beyond that then of course you sue them and small claims court\n[noise]\nAnd you didn't used to they used to Venus do then you have a small claims shoot\nBut other than that no way we had that before but don't they all the money yes but you have to offset\nSo who knows what\nWhy even bother Steve hello Steve\nI asked her I yet you know for some reason uh I I've been listening to the show I you know sort of during the week I been to the tape of it and you know people around them I I have a hard time

yeah\nThat crosses the line matter of fact legally it crosses the line it's because it's a libel per se\nIn other words a libel per se beans you're you don't have to prove anything\nIt's by law liable and it goes back to common law goes back to a oh it's fantastic law goes back hundreds and hundreds of years English common law and the rules were liable per se is a accusing a business person or

bucks\nMovie and I ... you know yeah okay yeah and then you definitely don't yeah you want if you want to definitely talk to a lawyer there's no question about it now\nHere is ah I think the question and maybe one of the most important questions because you know what you know what the defense is to a defamation suit no okay the defense is the truth so Erica Harry goes do you have\nAn STD no off oh wait a second you said that pretty forcefully matter of fact you say that a little bit to forcefully if you really want to know into quickly if you know what I'm Talking about ... professor protest too much\nOkay or get a lot yeah yeah that's another a concept in the law ... dos protest too much I just wanted to say OK defamation liable\nPer se love that and I was like no one does that anymore but I Love the ... some disease one and then ... and attacking women's virginity I mean ... ... is that\nHuh Oh yes All right Rita Hi Rena\nHello Rita yes yes ma'am yes Hi Bill I'm I have had the

telling me that that you have to say that I have to find out why why it didn't matter I Do\nYou know how much you do you know how much you owe them\nThey told me ten thousand dollars okay and you're paid them three thousand dollars yet okay then you got on the airplane and you came back to the United states yet All right and your question is ... no I had a K against whom the state of Israel yeah yes I Do have a case okay first of all um have you ever seen my a\nBar license my license to practice law no you haven't ... I Do know where are unlicensed ... okay state of California are you won't notice the state of Israel on their own ...\nYeah so what I Would do is go to the Israeli consulate and ...\nAnd you know what you can get a lawyer or through the consulate that specializes in Israeli American law there are some uh who are in they'll give you the name of them but\nI don't know why Israel is asking for three grand\nMaybe ... maybe some executive ah\nMaybe somebody in the government won an extra three thousand dollars 'cause this kid was short three grand for the bar mitzvah I have no idea the point is\nI don't know Israel right now or\nIf you were to ask me about ...

on there is also a good reason for that and it's a matter of whether or not a judge both pay my rent or below me off\nThat's exactly correct It's a matter of whether the judge will see a will look at you and believe you were not believing so what is what is your question\n[noise] my question is ... ... number one what are the possible ... and I could\nJust throwing a court hearing exactly what you said you plead not guilty and you explain why you're not guilty okay and they're going to put the cop on the sand who's going to probably do a whole different story and it's up to the judge to determine who is telling you the truth and who isn't\nI'm In Africa excellent choice like corrupt or not you know listening to\nIt and I find that's not no that's not corruption that's uh just notoriously believing officers versus leaving dry\nWell sure and that is by the way most jurisdiction because here's a philosophy you have every reason to lie because you have all the skin and again a cop theoretically has no reason to lie use objective so from the beginning you're going up hill\nYeah All right so all you can do is tell your story and say this is the reason and this is why I'm not

twenty five hours a week or month whatever it is or not entitled to take their sick pay\nAt the end of it uh then there's nothing you can do that's their policy\nAnd some school boards some companies

and uh they're our enemies that saying oh for example uh my my company the center for surrogate parenting its use\nIt or lose that same thing uh I worked for this radio station to use it or lose
