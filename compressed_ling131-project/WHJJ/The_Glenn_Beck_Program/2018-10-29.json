South Park was very popular\n\nThat's why the nation of Israel exist if people don't understand\nIs why no one ever wants them no one ever stands for them they're always the last in line and so\nThe world decided let them have this scrap of land and they say well is there is because of the Bible let 'em have it it's uninhabitable it's it's just nothing but a desert there's no oil there's nothing there just give it to them\nAnd the Jews happily took it restored to their homeland as the only nation on earth to be wiped off the face of the map and then to be restored to two thousand years later exactly as for told\nIsraeli exists because no one seems to want to them is really exists because they have a right to live\n\nSo let me go back to Russia and our musical friend\nIn Nineteen eighty nine forty years after the battle of Stalingrad the Hebrew immigrant aid society was helping Jews get out of the Soviet Union and go to Israel and to the United states and they provided lawyers money to find homes food even language classes to help them assimilate in their new country\nFor the first time ever\nGregory and the rest of the Jews that he had known that had survived both Hitler and Stalin couldn't concentrate on something more than just surviving\n\nThey had a right to pursue their happiness they could practice their faith they couldn't be proud of who they were they could finally live\n\nThe group that saved him the Hebrew immigrant aid society is the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world let me say that again it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world\nIt was established in the Eighteen hundreds and they're responsible for assisting thousands and thousands of Jews and a few years ago they open up their services not just to Jews but people of all faiths all faiths that are persecuted and need to be rescued\n\nTheir currency a CEO was asked recently why they decided to do it\nHis answer couldn't be more perfect\nWe no longer help refugees because they're Jewish\nWe\nHelp refugees because we are Jewish\n\nReason why I'm telling you the story is this is the organization that I'm mad man went into Philadelphia\nTo try to stop\nThis is the organization that was attacked on Saturday morning at the tree of life synagogue\n\nStory never seems to end the eleven people were killed in the deadliest attack on Jews in our country's history\n\nStories like Gregory filled the synagogue that Saturday morning\n\nThe horrors that collectively endured unimaginable to most people and yet here we are again the group of people who now have to concentrate just on one thing survive\nAnti Semitism is evil anti Semitism is a disease\nAnti Semitism is as old as the world\nFrom the moment\nGods said I Will make you my people there has been anti Semitism and it is on the rise as it always is in times of nationalism and socialism every time the Jew is the canary in the coal mine they are always the first\nAnd if the world doesn't pay attention at that point it's washed in blood\n\nThe world decides they need to come for the Jews I proudly declare\nI sell a Jew\n\nThe world makes promises all the time and they don't ever intend on keeping\nThem but I Do\nWe said never forget I told you you are the audience that wheel in the in ... the republic save the republic and it's not going to be through violence\nThe world is going to become more and more violent\n\nWe must be a unique and peculiar people because the vast majority of Americans know this is not who we are\n\nThis is not who we want to be\n\nAnd we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish brothers and sisters\n\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with her Christian Brothers and sisters in the middle east\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with a Muslim that is being rounded up by the Chinese\n\nThe cycle of hate has to be gone again and it's\nNot Donald Trump and it's not for rock Obama\n\nIt's a cycle that has been running since the beginning of time\nAnd the world always acts the same way because it always comes in a time of chaos it always comes in a time of fear it always comes\nIn a we cycle when the forget the individual it's what's best for all of society if why\nOur founders came here in the first place it's why our founders defended the Jews\n\nWe're a different country where\nA different people we're not better than the rest of the world we just see things differently\nAnd if we don't shame on us\n\nOur pilgrims came here thinking that they were completing the journey from the red sea\nOur first gray seal of the United states was the pillar of fire and pharaohs horses and the party of the red sea\n\nI don't want to just survive I don't want to\n\nDo something to earn a living I Want to live\n\nFDR said this generation has a rendezvous with destiny I echo those words\n\nOur generation must be the generation that breaks the cycle\nThere is no one else in the world who will do it who will stand against this onslaught ... will stand against the hatred in nationalism and the and the the collective wisdom\nThe extermination of people that just aren't good enough\nWe are headed that way we are headed that way once you cannot talk to your neighbors once the other side has nothing to offer you have to eliminate them because they're the devil\nThey're the devil and you cannot deal with the devil\n\nWheels is sixty to eighty percent of this country stand up\n\nStuck in the middle between two parties that are blaming each other for everything or blaming them\n\nYou know why America is a little upset right now they're tired of being blamed they're out here in Boston their ass they're out here working every single day trying to raise their kids trying to figure out how to navigate and keep their children safe while in a prison system called school that is teaching\n... and and doing everything that most parents believe\nThey come home they're tired they don't know how to solve it they're overwhelmed society's just pouring into their house with with the media and social media\nAnd then they have to sit and they have to watch people screaming at each other on TV\nAnd there's nobody actually answering questions there's nobody actually offering a solution to these things anybody is\nTalking about is the solution is just blame the other side and most Americans are tired of it because they're the ones getting blamed\nThey're the ones that are racist they're the ones that are massage and ... they're the ones excuse me we're just outta here bussed in our rafts trying to make a living well you freaks\nAre limited high on the hog on our tax dollars [noise]\nBut the the what's happening in our society is a symptom\nWe are unfortunately sick\nNews radio nine twenty and

Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of a bird dog but he's like you know did he he didn't go there to help with today is the first question was ah you know\nBut what about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I live in a country as a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning center in a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt some anti Semitism my entire life\nHe's ... he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah [noise]\nThis is a terrible tragedy then they're like well what what what part of a bet you think this is the the climate of today change and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear\nThat this shooter\nA outwardly hated Donald Trump\nYeah with a lot like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or has nothing to do that don't tie him to be a ... more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall our discourse is pretty terrible at the moment\nBut it has nothing to do with this and all these cable news networks are ... that were telling you that it's out there that was telling your wife well\nWe don't want us to blame it on a dull Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nRight [laughter] that's really is really that's what they're doing never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever that guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot all of the geo ... and another guy and tried to tried to bring to kill thirty Republican seat\nThat's really tend to the Republicans on was working\nFor Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault no we never said that any either today and either do today yes of course not but they didn't even talk about it because they\nHad a very balanced view of that one for a understood that individuals who are responsible for their own actions that time must re understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them in and they always complain about this course isn't that a great example of terrible discourse yes\nWe can sit on both of these things right when if a Republican and now the python think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt\n'em but you know we did see that ah with with the Bernie Sanders situation\nBut both situations we said the individual is responsible way the discourse is is is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individuals shootings and I'm going to do with it and you do not ... discourse does not commit murder doesn't happen\nSo the reason why Rob ... pad in this morning is because uh you know he he sees doing more on trivia and uh and pour a trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a pet uh\nYeah it's it you know it's a chance to get away from the discourse for a little like an hour a week as and just be mean to yeah and just be mean to be [laughter] dumb they are that credit [laughter]\nSo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know and that when I'm never going to end on that one\nAnd in fact repeated a ... consistently just repeat it and it was fabulous and again it was you know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nThank you thank you so are you coming to the show in Cleveland or what is it Saturday no it's on Sunday becoming\nNo because we're going to be out of town is going to be out of town really 'cause I'm going to be free tickets but seriously oh now all of sudden you're in it can change I I ... you change your plans I've got free tickets for if you want if you'd like them\nAre you serious I Am serious goes my ... that that would I change my plans okay All right All right good thanks Suzie we'll see you or what it is it's Sunday\nOr at least I think it Sunday yes it's connect dot com slash tour by the way for the tickets and the details on we're going to be ... is going to be fun there's a lot of election stuff to talk about like a a stop\nGiving gifts from the gods as far as serial goes the the ... turned completely insane so it makes the comedy fairly easy\nSaid it does\nAnd a Pittsburgh we've got something special for you there were going to have laughs and and comedy but uh also uh I Am a taking all of the proceeds from the I'm from the event\nAnd um we're giving them to\nI'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to or to\nThe uh the refugee I'm Down here a group\nI'm not sure we're going to give them to yet but we're we're\nUh we're we're standing with uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going um to a\nA local Jewish um\nCenter perhaps the synagogue and I'm not sure and I sense from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I noticed you went back and forth at a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was a she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever ... uh criticized I think it was George Soros stream into\nA and I remember and you came back to this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know\nAnd then she posted here's an example of ... supporting the Jewish people and posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros or as as an example of how much you hate the Jews\nNow I did respond because I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel aboard\nA that was a national award what are the highest I'm most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people crying but beyond that uh it was just it was\nJust presented by the the prime minister of Israel though\nOh well that's it [laughter] okay that's not a big one that out of bed a cloud of big one so it's just amazing\nYou know 'cause this is not just the criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporters all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros\nThat you are an anti Semite is completely insane if you are a ... a conservative and the people\nIn this audience I Would leave all would fall into this category many of them would criticize door source but they criticize him because he's a liberal or progressive policies he supports a policy that we disagree with that we're criticizing him around him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he has a very shady history\nOr around the world but anti Semite patriarch source to ... in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew or the way they don't\nLike fish Shapiro because you're in front of me hero [laughter] ... you know like I don't understand racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for a valid reason [laughter] you know Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx he was Jewish I don't like him not because he was a Jew no but because\nHe came up with the idea of communism\nI'm not a fan no not a fan of fat and the ...\nLike you're in these liberals have never criticized Ben Shapiro before is that because they're anti Semite which because they don't like what Shapiro said they will love ... they would love Ben Shapiro if he was a liberal and they don't like him because he's a conservative is this distinction difficult for people\nCan you really not understand I mean we all know San Angelo and I it's not all understand that they're just trying to use this\nTo make it look like conservatives are anti Semite we you're telling me the way they uh you know Sheldon Adelson right here's a guy who is one of the biggest financier the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism from liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic\nOver it does not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas are they racist\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas is legal opinions because they don't support what they believe\nIt's not about it it is trying to make these into cartoon arguments ... is such a\nA ... I can get another sample horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're calling everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous\nThey know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they say it anyway 'cause they don't care\nThat is that that is exactly what they [noise]\nAnd they claimed to be again and they do it every day wow I didn't hear solution there to [noise]\nGo to a pattern I don't know I got out of ... and ah we're we're going to talk about one when we come back\nNews radio nine twenty and one over ... ...\nSo let me talk to you a little bit about buying or selling a home if you are if you're buying a home right now or you're thinking about it do it now get the low interest rate right now if you have to refinance your loan\nDo it right now do it now I'm\nA home equity is at an all time high\nHomeowners are starting to cash in and pay off I interest or that there is a there is a way for you to do this with people who are are working for you they're not working for the banks so if you want to consolidate you want to re fi or you're looking to buy a new home\nGo to the people who work for you and that is American financing\nYou could be looking at twelve thousand dollars in annual savings right now and you could close and his fastest ten days American financing eight hundred nine zero six twenty four forty four American financing dot\nI've been there I Know what it feels like and that's what I decided to do something about it after lifting my home with some agents that just could not get the job done I decided to start a company that would find the best agents people you could trust people who had your same values honesty hardworking carrying\nWe started real estate agents I trust dot com it\nCame from personal frustration and mine and now your frustration real estate agents I trust dot com our goal is to connect you with an agent\nWell I mean that's not something that Simpson signed on for yeah sorry\nTwice and I believe all raised and this is a great lesson for everyone who tries to please save Megan Kelly I think it's the same type of thing right you can't you can't\nNo matter what you say they're never going to be pleased the people who come after you for these in these nonsensical PC issues\nWill never be pleased no matter what you give them no matter what apologies say no matter how sincere it is no matter who they are not asking you to remove up who they're not asking you to change they're asking for something that you can't possibly give them and the earlier you realize that the better\n[noise] let me change the subject to enough is enough when America will enough be enough new polls Americans fed up crave unity amid violence now\nThis one should terrify you\nBecause fifty seven percent now say they want a third party\nThey want unity that number is even higher but I'm not sure people actually mean this\nI'm not sure what unity even means\nThen they say that we no longer really um agree on the core values of our country which I think is actually true we don't agree on core values but what are those core values\nAnybody know\nWhat are the values that brought up what are the things that were actually arguing about now\nWay things are going in the United states twenty five percent are satisfied fifty eight percent dissatisfied the state of politics nine percent satisfied Seventy seven percent dissatisfied\nThirteen percent are like a ...\nPercentage that say Americans are United in agreement about the most important values Fifteen Percent\nFifteen Percent of us say where United on the most important values my question is\nWhat are those values sincerely what are we fighting for our we are we fighting for lower taxes\nHere's what the the here's the surveys the shows where we divide on our quote the most important values politics in this country\nIt's politics of value um moral ethics in our country\nIs that a value\nRace relations gap between rich and poor the state of the news media the way things are going in the U.S the environment the way things are going in your state\nRights for algae beat the status of religion homeland security with an exception\nOf a couple I those aren't values\nThose are issues that is a political campaign and perhaps that's what we're missing\nSee I I firmly believe and I I I wrote this in the book addicted outrage\nWe have a few things we have to decide we have to decide one is the western world worth saving\nIs freedom as our founders saw it is it worth saving yes or no and I don't want to just to you know jump bobbing yeah absolutely why why why is it worth saving who can articulate this\nWhy is it worth saving how has it changed the world in specifics\n\nWho can make that case among us who's making that case to their kids at dinner at night in specifics\n\nIs America a good place or a bad place we have to decide because half of the country says it's a great place half of the country says and I don't even know if these numbers are accurate and half I doubt they are have but let's just say half the country says it's\nBad place half the country says it's a good place which are we sincerely which are week we have to choose deli because it's a binary choice isn't it were good or bad right it's a binary choice you have to choose one\nNo no you don't it's not a binary choice the answers were both\nWe're both we been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hell is paved in good intentions and we have great intentions now on both sides we have great intentions\nWhat are we going to do with those intentions because you rarely live up to them have you heard\nAnyone actually make the case for America and not just in red white and blue flag waving terms but why is America important\nWhy is the constitution\nWere fighting for because if we don't know let's just get on with it man let's just move on\n\nI I'm I we cannot sit here and argue about our greatest issues of our time we don't have our basic living rooms I Want to make sure I have this right our our basic essential values in line\nLike climate change\n\nYou can say one of our values is how do we treat each other and how do we treat the earth okay that's a value that climate change climate change comes off of that value in principle\n\nClimate change is okay is there a problem\nIs there a problem well I'm Sorry but the science is not settled\n\nThe climate is constantly changing it always has to why we we had the ice age ... where were the SUVs for the ice age\nIt always changes now can we do things that can affect the climate I don't know some people say we can some people say we can't\nBe evidence is spotty at
