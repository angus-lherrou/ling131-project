more attractive the image and design of the phone the stronger the emotional relationship consumers have with the products that they found specifically than in two thousand and Seventeen the

millions numbers drawn tonight's mega millions jackpot worth a whopping what nine hundred and Seventy million dollars sales are brisk\nI was reading about the makeup of the care of it too earlier um some of them are children with their parents many of them are children unaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out All right out in that\nOccur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what sign for you to walk to the United states and I want you to walk in that group of people\nAnd here's a guy and paying seven thousand dollars to walk you know somewhere in the group with you and he gets you across the border is that what you're doing or you just you're in trusting your children to\nWho knows what and where is the personal responsibility of the parents here yeah I mean there's got to be something\nThere is and I think their case would be or at least the case the left would make on their behalf would be a these things are so vast so\nBad in Honduras Guatemala I mean they can get a lot or she can be killed a on the way here you could be molested on the way here somebody may not be there on the other side of the border you I mean there's so many things that could go wrong you talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's\nPretty much the opposite like\nSame thing we talked about this yesterday I you know letting my kid walk who's seven ... the uh the dog up the street not the whole street but part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI'm told the story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block in there there's there's a giant bond there in a green area is common to the everybody in the neighborhood and when my daughter was sixteen she said that I'm just I'm going to walk down to the pond like alone [laughter]\nWithout your brother [laughter]\nI [laughter]\nWould you stop and think about how you know pretty protective ... yeah exactly I I don't let them walk down to the end of the block let alone hey why don't you walk\nTo Honduras and there was a group of people that I don't know [laughter] lot look\nThere are situations you could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you'd probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there's certain level of this and and that's not to say that none of the people in these situations where like this\nOr is there probably are some but it it's just ...\nYou try to at the same thing with the dreamers right they they try to give you the picture of ... everyone has a four year old who came across the border and in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen and Seventeen years old that this is a different it's a different story\nA and you just wonder first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about a hardening the borders this\nIs an easy way to get people together to do that when people hear a story like that it it does not soften their hearts that makes people say whoa this ... you know because the ward invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from people who oppose it a ... you know in a hawkish manner [noise] right\nAnd you know like a thousand people are kind of qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border it whether you like it or not feels like an invasion right\nIf it feels like waiting does they're just ... like they're they're the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right let the overriding the security they they're they're they're coming in or the right way or the overriding security\nAnd you see that Mexico does not want to deal with this but they know that they're not the end they're not the end location\nSo they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course they're just gonna keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries deal with this and yet\nOr the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a fairly reasonable way every time we do worry or hateful\nA war on carrying were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy\nOf course if somebody's snakes them from Nicaragua or some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they work\nIf somebody do that without permission with ... with them back then\nThey ... they send back them they'd send back to them if they do it without permissions they send back to them but we can't we're expected to just accept everybody we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to us and Mexico has a pretty stiff immigration law they've got to streamline law\nThat insurers foreign visitors and immigrants\nAre in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves\nEconomically they're not destined to be burdens on society\nThey are of economic and social benefit to society weight you're you expect your immigrants to contribute their own good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being of the nation\nOr they make sure that they don't have any sort of a\nCriminal record they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrants protest have there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they're demanding rights\nOr that they think they have coming\nTo them in Mexico you can't even do can interfere in their in internal politics plus if they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics may deport you know I mean that's uh\nBut he's only racist right I mean like that is not yes there's not an argument there we would never know you can't do that you can't do that and nor should you you shouldn't be like well I Would like this percentage of African Americans in this present we want to make sure we're still Seventy or eighty percent I mean I think I Would you I Would ... I Can't I Can't think of one Trump supporter\nWho would have ... a supporter policy where we had to keep the exact same percentages of white people versus other races you wonder if people who are productive who are here because they want to be here and be part of the society\nOr going to add something to our community instead of taking things from it\nI mean right now that is what you want the hypocrisy is mind by that really is incredible lying to buy it really it that ... ... security for me but not for me and that is not a a that is not a ... that's incredible I mean that's an incredible it is a line there that they draw it is a you know it's not it's not the right thing and ... and it's\nPolitically wanted to split the bottom line is we ... we have a lot of illegal immigrants here there will be more that are coming we need to tighten up that is a completely lets a larger argument that needs to be addressed and we've been talking about it for years and years\nBut politically speaking you got three weeks to a mid term election there is no like this is a complete gift\nTo the Republicans to people who care about the border yeah people who have any uh did Donald Trump and the people he's supporting the gift\nIt is and and he's telling Republicans that saying hey use their use it in the ... election campaign start talking about immigration because I haven't heard any of them doing that\nAre any other Republican candidates using immigration not that I've heard I mean maybe some warm someone somewhere is but it doesn't seem to\nBe a general theme for the party I did hear at all talking about it in the debate I don't think I don't know that he mentioned the caravan per se but I mean he was talking a lot about border security I mean there's a really close race in Arizona a race or where a ... has a I think a great chance of winning or people to get because her opponent there is like\nIf you took a Michael Moore and put him in his brain into a female body of a congresswoman you would have all of these tapes that they've been finding about her where she saying you know she's bashing Arizona ... lab of democracy she saying people are crazy in Arizona\nNews radio nine twenty nine ...\nThis is Steve from water filter company you've been hearing me tell you about water filter company for four years now [noise] now listen to one of our customers\nBan Michelle and I'm ...

Roberts and your family your Paso and none of them go by betcha none of them here what um what ... what is your background are you a boring white person\nI Am I'm born and raised and I get that question all the time are you military and they say no there are white people here in our past\nAnd and that is allowed and they do allow that okay good ah that's interesting I I uh I can that seems to be evidence against tobacco it does we really should report this to him when he goes on national TV and fuzzy thinking that the fact checked hard today going to get a ... day for them\nYeah thankful that my gosh oh wow very upset about that so that's\nWell only every person who is called so far has contradicted a Beto yeah on that and\nThat's why like I you know we want to be factual we want to deep deep deep into the science and that's what we're doing here you know a pat and I both come from a scientific background um and that's why we've always looked at you know for what if one of our examples of courses better Weinstein who is ...\nHe's an amazing things so I ... I Hope we can get ... mailed them\nUm let's see we got burner burden in Texas [laughter]\nTime good morning I Am a lunch that on there I have a twin brother named\nDrilled into it as an adult way calling Robert okay or that\nYou do you do get better okay now what is your background are you ah are you a boring white person or something that would be positive in our society\nWhere Americans of Mexican descent\nTown okay so I don't know his name when ... ... no ... or I call myself an American an excellent dissent first of all\nMy name is bad but I like to be called burger or get this ...\n... wow see okay so you're going to the other way you're going from ... to Bobby which is interesting to me is\nThat name for forty years and ah I don't like to be called Bertha which is that natural inclination from people\n... and I know that don't personally oh you do I where\nI used to work for the past so as the secretary to the director and assistant director when he first started his ah came in Congress he's very adamant about helping veterans and we were overjoyed because we needed help getting the message out about the veterans\nMhm [noise] well\nIt was and then when I came on the a lot of my information 'cause I knew what was going on and stuff is costing my desk and everything when I found out that bad though was running for Senate I knew he had used the veterans\nAs a launching point ... and they need to them under the bus while\nTo get his name to get his name nationally known by the way my call him personally myself I call him ... [laughter]\nAttractive [laughter] calling dangling\nHe's got that weight Adam's apple and it sticks out for a long time um\nWhen it seemed like an angry Hispanic female mhm I Am ... an angry conservative and oh I forgot to tell you I had my best friend and she stayed in Albert she goes to them but he never agent ... ...\n... ... and it's like ... and thank you for the call it just seemed like that there is a a there is an effort made when you when you prioritize identity politics over everything else\nThese things are sensible right like a sensible that Barry Obama was bronco bummer right it's it's ... in that world sensible if you're a list but foreign to claim you have Native American heritage and\nIn in your school and and submit a recipe the powwow chow like that makes sense in that world because that's all you prioritize it's the only thing that matters\nRight if the only thing that matters is your identity as a victim\nThen classifying yourself a as associated with a victimized population of evil conservatives\nDoes a lot of good for you there's a real incentive and motivation to do it and we keep we seemed to see it over and over and over again\nAnd you know look maybe she was called that it was a guy I don't know uh I it's possible I haven't seen a ton of evidence that it's accurate nor that it makes any sense but beyond that ... the idea that he has put on every single sign slowly\nBefore letters B. E. T. oh\nThis is not like that might be as a nickname and it might be that it's okay to call him ... but this is not he's not doing it\nBecause that the uh the case he's doing it because he's trying to fool a bunch of people especially back you know when he was trying to get to this level at this point I don't know I think everybody knows but it helps them climbed to this level\nAnd it's it's the name that appears on the ballot too which is interesting very strange very strange ... a lot of times if it's a nickname\nThey'll put like Robert Francis and then in parentheses Beto O'Rourke so you can identify 'em from you know his campaign ... stuff that kind of makes sense although I I don't even love that all that and my only Beto O'Rourke on the ballot so that I mean the guy has gone to great lengths\nNot to use Robert Francis not to be identified as Irish American now people pressed him on it he's obviously going to admit yeah I'm Irish American and I come from a long line of Irish Americans right but that's not what you get from him when you just watch his uh\nHis campaign ads or you see I'm In a debate he doesn't know he doesn't identify like that at all trying to\nBe a Kennedy right he like he wants to be a Kennedy and a plot you know a appeal to the Hispanic community and it's like you're not you're not be F. K. okay we all know B. S. K. was he's been gone for a long time [laughter] we all know that you're not the F. K. and just kept trying to BBS ... you're not that\nHe's working on it though it's dry and these these dry and [noise] I mean better ... better Fitzgerald Kennedy was an incredible\nPerson will [laughter]\nAnd it was more you know they're ... tragedy and yeah I mean it really was an amazing or\nTurn of events there and it's good to see it's good to see that this has gone on I I I just I don't\nI don't see how people don't see through the\nYou know I and I think maybe on the left they don't want to because they think he has a chance you know every few years the the the less get this terrible teeth or they get to get close in for a few polls mean Wendy Murphy is going to change Texas was the mayor refused and that was going to change Texas a\nOh a record he was the mayor when you're down there yeah yeah sort of a moderate leaning ... or ... he was also going\nTo change Texas every time they run somebody there's somebody who's going to just change it and it's going to you know longer and we'll have to deal with these darn Republicans down their return the state blue we've won forever and by the way that part of it is true\nIf they start they turn ... do yeah that's true they will run they will run the country for a very long time if they're capable of doing that just from an electoral vote standard\nHey pat and Steve Love you guys have a I I think you're missing a very important point and that is that O'Rourke identifies as Hispanic or there for ... you must be belief\nWhile or the great point here is again we're learning today yeah I forgot that was the band or how insensitive of\nUs mhm how hateful and a ... that is that we haven't spoken about how he does identify yeah and it must\nBe a Hispanic jak ... interesting with that sort of talk it's like\nYou know the the Elizabeth Warren is of essentially identifying as Native American without real evidence but she is she's getting beat up I mean this has been one of the biggest political disasters of all time\nHer coming out and trying to say that she actually is Hispanic Native American short approved it by going back ... generations trying to prove it one one thousand twenty fours yeah that's amazing a left hates it through like this is this is playing into the worst of our\nUh beliefs about you know blood being the determining factor and these things and they they hate it there\nMay have destroyed or over the she handled it terribly I mean it's almost like one of those things I don't know maybe they should have leaked it through another source of the fact that she's associating herself with coming out and doing this this is amazing uh but\nThe identifying thing there's two parts of that like I said as a you know say that you know the libertarian tightly right I don't care what people say they are right like you know if she says she's Native American or not I don't care\nBut beyond that there's an actual truth\nYou know if it does all what's to come out and say she's black or Sean King wants to come out and say he's black when they're not black eye it does that matter to me I don't care what they're doing there I think they're lying right and they're doing this for a reason but that doesn't mean it affects me in any way\nHowever we have to be able to stand up for the truth the truth is that Sean King is white turns the truth is that Rachel does all is white and the truth is Beto O'Rourke as white as white\nAnd you know I that's okay you know\nPeople are supposed to be able to be you know we're not supposed to care so much about these identifying factors but we're in a world in which the ... only embraces identity politics the tech world we need to cure it\nNews radio nine twenty and one oh four seven am\nTuned into the Jim Bunning radio show a news radio nine twenty four seven FM every week and find out of the show we live in your town a news radio R.

climbing K. two it'll probably pop up\nProduct 'cause I think they're doing this on the dark Web yeah a lot of thought last time you do some really put stuff in the dark Web uh so I don't I don't know maybe you'll have to find that there are\nBut we're we're ah we're here talking about a Beto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz and the Texas Senate battle a lot of people calling in and saying that they knew a lot of people who are white and not named Beto in the communities that he talked about on CNN last night and they look there's a ...\nIt is is it could be a regional thing I Know there's a lot of differences between north and south I mean people look at you know figures like a Abraham Lincoln and better we leave and all these people who are uh you know from the\nDifferent cultures differently from where they are so I think that that's something that we can kind of look into as a possible cause for ... a confusion here um\nThere are issues however when you try to appropriate culture that\nWhen you try to reach into some other uh cultural group and and and speak to them sometimes there are issues there's a case it is that the media is like ... is is like liking to highlight today\nAre and it's a it's a commercial run on behalf of a congressman in Arkansas a French Hill now he had nothing to do with us at all although surely if you watch CNN Today he will be\nYou know blamed for it to ... to ... hours or it's just some unrelated group running an ad in support of French ... which is part of our ridiculous campaign finance law situation\nUm where people when they want to donate more money than the the maximum which is completely unconstitutional to have in this country\nOr when people want to do that they give it to super PACs and they run ads on the behalf of the candidate that has no control over those ads so this is a bad being run in Arkansas\nIt's a it's related to Brett Kavanaugh and it's being criticized I don't know if you can detect anything here pat I Would like to get your column whether you can detect anything seems a little odd to here here's the ad from the group supporting French ...\nWhy do you think about what's happening in Washington Congress may bring and the Republican noticed dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt especially for black mean\nDemocrats can do that to him why justice of the Supreme Court with no ... no cooperation and witnesses including her best friend it didn't happen\nWhen a white girl lives on them\nWon the election black poker game turnout always told my son don't mess around with that if you get she will crime rate\nTo keep Congress let ... and the Republican because we have to protect our men and boys\nCan't afford to the white Democrat take us back to the bad old days of rain the verdict her I said to Atlanta\nAnd what our white girls going into rate paid for by black Americans for\nPresidents that into account authorized by any candidate for candidates Khamenei first of all I Would normally watch his show with ... and you know I had to do that all sounds fantastic and these are obviously ... they're making yeah right like the point of\nAnd it's a fascinating thing from the left who thinks that you know we one of the biggest reasons Beto is you know in the public eye in the in the United states and not just the Texas figure is because of this video he made\nAbout it's ... it's a great idea to Neal or for the national anthem and what's behind that story people like Colin Kaepernick stating that black people are being unfairly accused without evidence being shot at the streets for no reason because for crimes they didn't commit\nAt the same time we're supposed to get on board if you're on the left are supposed to get on board with\n... with the with a new standard in which any white woman can accuse the man over if we're just supposed to believer that is not going to work out well for African Americans or any ... any race if a male but this is the type of thing that makes no sense\nI mean there are real cases of this this isn't a fake thing go back to you know we talked about ... town go back to Emmett
