twenty nine to Eighteen fifty the riots and still gets that's you know a a paragraph each but after the communist manifesto\nWell then you start to get some interesting\nRiots usually called strikes\nNow some of these things are legitimate when it comes to race\nBut a lot of these\nFrom a progressive in office\nWho is doing something and stirring people up against one another for instance the greatest example is Woodrow Wilson where he's you know these practically heaping praise on the Klan\nHe shows the first to a movie ever shown in the in the White House and it's one glorifying the Klan\nThe Klan goes through a resurgence and he was heavily involved in it ... to the military and it all sorts of things so you see this all of a sudden you start to see this real uptick of race riots again\nIn the in the Nineteen you know Fifteen on word well that's because of the segregation and all of the things that a progressive\nPlanted alright but let me just go through and see if you can find any\nPatterns here the Patterson silk strike the copper county strike the Indianapolis streetcar strike a the Seattle general strike mayday riots read this summer the Boston police strike the

think it was a parade and they actually end up\nRioting and killing people okay good then you look in the Nineteen thirties and forties is\nEssentially it was a an industrial workers of the\nWorld by ... thank you okay Minneapolis or Minneapolis Teamsters strike Nineteen thirty for the auto light strike the west coast long shore strike do you even know what that one was that when that happened that may ninth\nThrough October twelfth that one's shut down San Francisco bay a the ports in California Portland and Seattle ... and who was behind that one\nUh probably some conservative thing yeah no no the textile workers' strike of Flint sit down strike the battle of the overpass the republic steals strike almost all of these\nAnd including many of the race riots have communist and Marxist
