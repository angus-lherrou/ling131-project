Fox\nNews and there's a candidate for blue the owner of the week but I got to figure that this is the one that had the whole nation scratching their head yesterday and it was the behavior of Kanye West as he got sent to break bread with the president big press conference in the oval office yesterday here's John decker from Fox\nDuring a free lunch meeting in the oval office rapper in fashion designer Kanye West wearing a make America great again hat defended his strong support for the president\nIs what I said I like try to like someone that liberal they'll say oh he's right you're right [laughter] okay\nWith said he had hall of fame running back Jim Brown came to the White House to discuss prison reform and ways to reduce violence in Chicago arguing that illegal guns are the problem not legal guns saying we have the right to bear arms at the White House John decker Fox News\nSo what did he talk about Kanye West\nWell a ten minute monologue covered everything from his love of president to prison reform and police community relations\nAnd of course that hat and he said when he puts it on and he said it makes them feel like Superman he also talked about the thirteenth amendment is sleep disorder illegal guns jobs and strong male role models\nSo after the whole thing was over the president's reaction basically across the desk from Kanye West was well that was something and then he said how about a little lunch [laughter] healthy you're going to say to\nAnd as we just heard from decker NFL legend Jim Brown was also there and boy he didn't he didn't offer much whatsoever is just I think some founded\nBy the entire situation and the behavior I think is most of us were and was it was strange to say the least I think it's okay for us to say that um

one in the news is reporting on this but let me bring everybody up to speed if you haven't been following this guy in a nutshell he worked for the Washington\nPost he's a revered ribs veered reporter which makes me ... suspicious immediately but he's a revered ... a a reporter at Washington Post he is the Saudis citizen\nHe was over in Turkey he's going to get married and so he's like I Need my divorce papers from the embassy\nAnd so he goes over to the Saudi embassy he tells his fiance weight in the car I'll be right back she waits right in front of the embassy hours and hours and hours going by she's calling his phone no answer on his phone he's not coming out she calls the embassy and they say oh no\nHe left he just he came here and we gave him the papers and he went and she's like I've been sitting outside I'm not sure if he went out I'm pretty bill did he go out the front door\nYes so fill in the other guy ... says yes he went out the front door well CCTV cameras show that he didn't ever leave the Saudi embassy at least by the front door [noise]\nSo [noise] the next thing we find out this was yesterday as the Saudis the Saudi prince\nLands of gulfstream his Gulf Stream it at the airport there I'm In turkey about an hour or so after the guy goes into the into the embassy\nThese guys get off the plane with what appeared to be a lot of empty suitcases they pile up in the back of the vans they're driving to the embassy they decide for some reason or another they need more empty suitcases they buy some more empty suitcases they also stop just a real quick you know I don't know maybe the chef needed at the embassy but they needed a bones\nSaw [laughter] by your boat saw Oh thank you so much now we can have soup and uh so they get the ball and saw\nGod only knows what they do in the embassy but they're seen leaving about an hour later with really heavy suitcases they throw them into the back of the van they throw them on the jet and the jet takes off\nMeantime the United states says we do have a we do have\nA an encrypted a messages showing that the Saudi prince was trying to in trapping more tried to trap and get him into the embassy or get him back to Saudi Arabia\nA and today and I don't know if I Believe this because it's turkey but turkey says that they have either given to the United states or shown in the United states this video and audio they say they have surveillance in the embassy of him being questioned\nAnd then tortured and then murdered we don't know if that is true but that's the latest today so ... we're going to find out\nWho this guy is and was possibly uh when we come back because this is the part of this story that no one\nSurely CNN and Christiana autumn poor would want you to have this information will give that to your next [noise]\nLet me tell you about our Palm Beach letter taken tore his crypto course Ninety seven percent of the people who take his crypto course give it a four or five star rating and

at it yeah and that's the decision our president is is having to make it's why we should stay out of other people's business as a man stay out of their business kind of like a production yeah\nSo I think that Saudi Arabia will eventually own up to this because I think the evidence will come after them I think they'll they'll blame of very familiar a photo and they'll say it's the deep state

the political correct ... percent but back in ... you left out some really big things could never have happened without the ... in support of the media\nYes I Believe the media in at eight percent directors\nHey let me just tell you a quick story okay All right so this week I've been doing a lot of promotion for killing the size which came out on Tuesday\nAnd in that promotion I'm basically saying that\nWe in America are seeing a rise of hate and evil and I tie it in a number of ways one of the ways that I tied it in was that George Soros at his crew have bought up about twenty packs political action committees\nAnd they said that they send them out on missions and one of those missions was Senator Flake in the elevator with the CNN camera right behind a woman's screaming at him because she was a victim of something\nAnd he was an idiot for not siding with her who's the woman the woman is an activist and the Soros pack making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year All right so I tell that story which is a tire early accurate a hundred percent correct and media matters within a half an hour says I compared the woman to the third Reich\nOkay\nNow that's what's going on here that that's what's in play so the eight percent progressive zealots fanatics couldn't never having pose any thing\nOn this country without the media taking up their cause and actually doing the dirty work\nI put the media in that eight percent it's the it is the reason why it has swept the country it is you're right because of the media but they are part of that eight percent\nLook what happened and Kanye West my favorite guy of all time\nOkay yeah so Kanye West who I ...
