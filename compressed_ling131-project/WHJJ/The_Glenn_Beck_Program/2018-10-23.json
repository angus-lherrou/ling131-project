probably had to the doctor was ever a sneeze or an ape each and every one that they suffer turns out the Christina most Americans aren't so quick to seek professional help with something that ails them and I've always wondered what the reason is if you're not feeling well I mean could it be your medical coverage but the I guess there are a lot of different reasons\nI guess so according to the new survey sixty percent of Americans have put off going to the doctor and in fact the average person in a way up to our last month you're kidding between the time they realized that they have a medical issue\nAnd when they go to the care and then you kind of go check things might be too late by the time when she got out right answer why so stay away sadly fifty one percent you say that it's due to financial concern no coverage you know while forty two percent simply believe that condition in theory in a serious enough and thirty percent chalk it up to just been too\nBusy no no no no no no all three right I'm with you in the meantime the conditions folks are most likely not to seek care for include some pretty general aches and pains followed by a sprained or insomnia so here we go top ten things people at least likely to seek medical attention for a number of ten is Iraq's I wouldn't mess around with the right\nNow especially look at the number eight number nine neck continuous headache people that is not a good sign you got to get that checked out a hearing loss that's another one because you had the hearing you had the Erie you never got sick because number seven what are you kidding me an infected ... know you might lose a limb yes yes\nNumber six is back pain which could be something serious right number five is ... number four is ringing in the ears again you had those area and yet it hearing loss and now you're the ring and number three insomnia and sleep problems number two sprain of some sort okay and the number one just general aches and pains yeah\nGeneral aches and pains people are most likely not to seek medical attention for but people at least six things on this ten list this ten list of things serious could lead to serious issues there could be a serious issue is not good\nCouple of movies have been delayed we mentioned this a little bit earlier but it's a it's worth going back to I don't know why they would want to make this movie but apparently it's in the can but the release has been pushback jungle cruise another movie that's based on the Disney rye oh you know shouldn't work the other way and might be a popular movie they make a right out of\nYeah definitely I didn't even know this was a thing until recently has actually\nDone it's in the can I remember Eddie Murphy did a dreadful movie called haunted mansion which was based on the on the Disney ride and that was just a massive stink burger and they push back and Wonder Woman for some for some reason\nOur government and Donald Trump needs to tell Mexico if that\nCaravan arrives at our border\nYou receive zero eight zero we will cut off all aid you are to stop this\nIn your country is not to hit our border this is not our problem nor our fight zero aid

because\nDonald Trump will stand against this now let me ask you when's the last time you saw Seventy five hundred people a mass with another flag to cross a border\nI Would say would probably have to be if you were in the military crossing into Iraq from Kuwait\nNow\nDo you remember the reason why we had to wait to go into a right you just don't land in go\nBecause you need to logistics and the logistics\nOf moving a crowd that size is a nightmare otherwise it becomes a death march because people are going to get tired they're going to fall they're going to be dehydrated you don't stop at a seven eleven with Seventy five hundred people to get some water\nWhere's just the water coming from where where is the emergency aid for those who are falling ill along the way\n... where are they

hundred people who are stating they are going to break the law\nAnd they've already done it and they're just crossing in an overwhelming where did we would never let anybody do that to any other thing

governor from the great state of Texas Governor Greg Abbott on with the snow hello governor how are you sir\nReally and I am doing terrific how's it going\nGood it's always good to talk to you I'm a I Want to talk to you about a couple of things first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive turnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas uh ... what does this or what does this tell you and how's the turnout the rally around the rest of the state\nWhere this might be frustrating because the true answer is it's too early to tell right here's what we don't know and and that is is this a front running of what the overall vote total will be or\nIs it a massive wave vote for your listeners what we're seeing with regard to the turnout is a ... records are not just for mid term elections which is what the stairs a but in many of these locations are the first day of voting exceeds\nThe amount of votes that took place in the presidential election on the very first day and so all we know is this and that is a massive\nNumber of people are turning out to vote will know it was called but don't mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan that's coming up here and we want to make sure that people who simply to stop it [noise] uh but here's all I can tell your audience and that is if you care about the future of Texas it'd be clear about the future of America or you could not\nSit on the sidelines this election because there are other people out there who were casting those who might be hostile to you and your values your values must be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this\nMe to make sure you go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo a governor lot of times people have said yeah that's the most important election of your life and I was thinking about this last night I I've always hated that praise\nBut in this particular case we are now seeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say you know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this is a game changing a ... a election is it ...\n... e captured the U.S it was very correctly because it just to be here in Texas and maybe some other places are the Democrats are either rent undergo label or they would call themselves conservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and then they were a progressive and now they're openly or lifting themselves there\nSocialists and and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor\nIn Florida a isn't out and now he says he is a socialist and end the Bernie Sanders style of socialism is not even further to the left in the same things happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and even here in Texas or some people may not be\nCalling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as the open border policies that is so stupid as a with a look at the uh wealth distribution policies that is socialism and these people don't realize and that is socialism is real out there that we see it in Venezuela where the reported inflation rate in Venezuela\nIs over a million percent\nAnd so it's just crazy what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nI don't I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue there's ... there's only a few counties that are really a a lynchpin here and ah the you know unbeknownst to most people is Soros has dumped\nMillions of dollars into this state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing in so many of your listeners need to understand this is George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles [noise] uh two years ago he gave a half a million dollars not directly to a candidate\nIn Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that you as bonded these ground games to get out the vote and so he was trying to turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and us on TALK of all this money pouring in from California for candidates like that so uh but let's go back to the first part of your question\nAnd listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really blew cities and counties you have a Dallas year after year and you have San Antonio you have all that and you have El Paso and so you have these massive blue regions across the state of Texas that makes it\nSo much harder for people who are conservative people are who are Republican to be able to\nCobble together the votes that are needed to make sure that we keep Texas that the passion of freedom that back to the liberty or in the past year the conservatives and also a every vote counts in and we really need to get people excited enthusiastic about this the same way they were\nThe vote or your listeners have a lot at stake in their own personal lives uh baseball is going to happen in this election\nIn every vote is going to matter because the voter turnout is it sky rocket levels right now\nAnd if you're listening and you had a voted you need to go vote a because your future is at stake for today for example uh when we hang up I'm headed to a belt and they GO Campaign for some people they aren't going to be a in Dallas County later on today I'm going to be an ... uh in in the week and then ... ... ...\nNorth Texas and in South Texas east Texas in West Texas or to make sure that we win these elections from the talk of the ballot to the bottom of

I think you should all these things do you are innocent until proven yet he designed charges against Cory Booker right one person making\nYou know and then there's people making these things about every ... every day up which is why by the way you don't believe all women and race I Believe it's a man made an editor ... well we don't believe all women we don't believe all accusations correct particularly against powerful people because there's incentive there to make them right um so you know\nThat's the way I think you're supposed to head let's why innocent until proven guilty is not facing\nA and I think with not only are Cory Booker but also also Keith Ellison I think you have to look at those things with some level of skepticism by the time these relationships break up and there's things that and who knows\nThere's much more evidence however with Keith Ellison delegation huge evident it's not even close to comparing what would they were talking about with capital and everyone you know half the country believes Cavanaugh I should be you know I don't put in prison or what happened\nSo what's interesting here is the Democratic party\nHas completely abandoned their believe all women saying when it comes to keep up with a they don't care about it he can do it every once they've completely ignored these allegations ... it was fascinating at the people of Minnesota don't seem to be doing the same thing\nNow remember Alison was up by five points before these things happen latest poll came out he now trails forty three to thirty six he's now down by seven points soda wow this is a powerful Democrat one of the top people from the DNC\nA very well known is on TV all the time and he's she's credible\nShe's a Democrat she doesn't have an axe to grind Jimmy\nDated him for a very long time there's video there's witnesses\nThere's Dr reports at the time uh and she again is a very reluctant witness who doesn't want to hurt the Democratic party she'd rather have Allison on another Democrat when she doesn't write your phone into when it's just crazy yeah it's an amazing wants to that one\nForty three thirty six is a surprise I mean that is not something that I think anybody certainly the Democrats when they thought they had Alison running for that post they thought they had that wrapped up\nA instead it's forty three thirty six so right now do we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go\nUh there's a if you're looking at right now a forty a four\nFeet are that are safe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have a seat it's forty six excuse me forty effect if you add in the solid Republican seats in the leaning Republican seats you couldn't get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races that includes Tennessee which is\nAbout bill's very close to poll came out yesterday that had the Democrat up by one point though the overall it looks like a Republican is still a head there are ... and then in Texas still leaning Republican though Cruz looks safer but then you get a few ... a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got to another six races that are toss ups that's going to give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can go three of six they're going to be at fifty three seats and expand their advantage if they if they can\nPull off fixed up six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things passed\nA so you know at that level of whether it's to him and they could still lose it to they could easily still losing impossible but that level of between fifty and fifty six is is kind of what we're talking about now and that you know that is a big difference uh so could be a major thing especially if you can hold on to the house which\nLooks a little bit better than it did a couple of weeks ago but it's still on the unlikely side [noise]\nElection by numbers\nOn the ... best as they claim that program\nAll right when I take a break and we'll tell you about our spots and then we come back and I'm going to tell you about\nI mean there's a real problem and you haven't even\nConsidered it to really know what you know that which is er up putting ...

now\nWhat do you call people Seventy five hundred who are political Marxist activists that's what they are political Marxist activist marching with the Honduran flag\nIn protest that their Marxist government was ousted in Honduras\nWhat what do you call them is they're marching towards our border they're not refugees they chose to leave their country they're finding their country\nThey were trying to get a do a political stunt\nSo what what are these people where did they get the money who's doing the supply chain how how do you even have the bathroom services all along the way who's providing medical aid so it's not a death march you can't march twenty five hundred miles\nAnd expect everybody to be okay and in good health when they arrive\nThings happen\nWhat who's providing

I think it's CNN and Cuomo can you play this here on what the military is going to do\nWhat we look it's not about whether you're going to have the right to do it that's why I waved away the idea about domestic law enforcement Rick if you put military down there where you know with a God Forbid is in this situation\nHow was that good for anybody if cars you know you're not going to turn away thousands and thousands of people even if people start getting shot ... and what message does that send who wins and\nBut I don't think they're going to wind up in the country a wreck and can I don't think that it has to happen that way but I'll tell you what if you have if you have a must happen\nWhat do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be here and you have to chase them around and process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who were coming in\n... worse for America can\nYou give me your you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in at entry points and it's a turn them away right there it's an invasion treat it as an invasion turn way\nYou say there's an invading force these people they're not going to legally\n[noise] now the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these
