judge Kavanaugh will be the standard for all of us and our children\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n... October ... ... [laughter]\nI guess maybe I should have taken off my doctor back in the white jacket or for that amount of ... a month to us to\nDo I'm Still I still have to do in my care after a [laughter] doing a power our was to to\nTo uh to just to to be able to see is he capable of being president or um you know or or Supreme Court nominee in the future after drinking six beers as Brock Obama said he used to before he went to college now Bill O'Reilly is here hello bill\n[noise] back how you doing I'm I'm I'm good I don't well how do you think this Kavanaugh things going to come down\nA it'll be confirmed um tomorrow afternoon\nA guys but I guess I'd say there's the forty if there's time [noise]\nBut I I think he's going to be very hard at the ... this last a gap for any Republican vote against them because there's new information but I don't know whether you guys know the new information because the media is not reporting it including Fox News [noise] morning\nTo Wall Street journal I'm\nDr Ford's people that includes for lawyers and uh her advisors or tried to get a woman named ... ... ... testimony that isn't the FBI report apparently\nThat ... was the best friend to Christine Ford when this incident about Gavin allegedly took place and was named by Ford as an eye witness ... all along and said I don't remember anything like this I don't even know judge capital\nWell now the journals reporting that a forge people and they name a woman Monica McLean\nTexted keys or and said hey you got to change your testimony you gotta help Christine that's a huge story\n...\nThere is also another story um that are in the FBI testimony that it shows the leak came from Chuck Schumer that it was Chuck Schumer is office in cahoots with one of the beach ladies that Ford or talked about\nYeah well I don't think there's any doubt about Chuck Schumer or Dianne Feinstein at this point that they are corrupt\nSo Bill Schutt there he won more than one language Monica McLean by the way this was the woman who forged ex boyfriend\nTold a Senate Judiciary committee that Ford try to help her get through a lie detector test\nYep because she was applying for a job at the FBI now bolsters the ex boyfriends um account now this may seem in the waves\nBut if the judiciary\nCommittee and I I Believe rationally may do this I Hope so\nHe could all mine I'm Monica ... uh and\nUh others in affords camp in front of the committee and he could call a bring back for it and say you lied to us about the lie detector test if that happens for it could be prosecuted\nNow I Do think it will I think it should it should I Do think it should to here's here's the\nAnybody capital allied or for allied anybody they should be held to account\nHere's here's the thing I don't care if it is mark judge or if it is a professor Ford right if you lied yeah usually I go to jail right that this this is too serious this tour the country apart\nAnd what if this was coordinated if it and I mean Chuck Schumer is well if Chuck Schumer lead to this he should also stand some sort of\nPenalty but anybody who was involved you know there was one guy who uh what was it still he came out and he said oh I Know I have this evidence I saw this happening and as soon as he I'm Sorry to ask do he's been drinking this morning bill you wouldn't believe\nThe IRA yeah [laughter] oh you have him arrested yeah really like to be drunk for all of your interviews that's OK rights do then is it better state\nFor you because you can't understand them sober\n[laughter] that's true that's fair so I'm a ... there's there's one guy who came out and leveled accusations and then immediately retracted them and admitted that he was lying everyone likes to focus on Fort but there's been five accusers\nYeah yeah this is the Newport Harbor guy yes but when you when you get into a situation and and this goes right back to the need to think here we're talking about did you see a ... yes this week day\nIt doesn't matter if individual men get crushed it doesn't matter because women have been abused for so many years and I have no sympathy for men innocent men who get crushed I mean once you're into that zone and we've\nDiscussed this before your interest Allen is you are no we don't care you know if\nSome guy didn't do something like Kavanaugh whoever it may be and and and you get it and your career and family and everything else was\nDestroyed you know that's the price you got to pay because of the past injustices a against women\nBut that is that now that is the ... bill that's the combination\nOf post modernism and social justice social justice now is the vehicle for post modernism and the idea is it doesn't matter if she was telling the truth because others have been in her situation doesn't matter if she did it because others have been in his situation\nIt what matters is is communal justice\nThan it is that other people are talking about in the media will never report on is it the same people\nThat organized a sponsor boycott against me when I was on Fox News are now paying people to go to the capital to scream and yell at senators about cabinet ... outfits\nAre doing it move on leaves the league alright they've got the mailing list\nThey've got all the information\nI mean I'm sitting there going deja vu yeah\nSame people so now in addition to insanity like Alissa Milan all individual and Saturday then you have an organized coordinated effort with tens of millions of dollars courtesy of George Soros and others okay or organizing\nSending people paying people to go in and disrupt sometimes physically the process and Americans are basically in a dark they don't know what's happening back because this report it\nWill I Will tell you I I listen to that stupid New York times podcast I listen to it every day just to hear what the\nYou know what spin they're putting on it uh and it was a it might it made my eyes bleed today I couldn't take the hypocrisy a button one of the things that we're talking about is you know I'm really concerned because things in the capital are becoming very scary\nParty well the only cuts it like and he's already out of it you know he's leaving ... that's\nTrue but I don't think flake wants to go out on that note remember flake wants to get a job as a lobbyist she wants to go around and give speeches maybe write a book if he's got the machine again scam that's going to hurt him in retirement as far\nAs good earnings are concerned about where he is\nI Want to ask you honestly Danes is if for Montana's leaving to go to his daughter's wedding and I was there was a really important vote and who knows what happens in twelve hours even\nIf something goes wrong but I thought that my daughter and I was like you know what I I Would totally leave oh I Will be my daughters I have used my daughter's wedding none of the right choice yes\nYeah I mean I'm I'm I don't know why they can't work out something on that um you know there are ways\nTo vote 'em but I you look you know if your daughter's getting married daughters get married um maybe they could move the ceremony later and it could but I don't know I don't know but you're right you gotta you gotta family first\nAnd there's no reason why these guys have to be there why are we using Seventeen hundreds technology out of the euro some\nReason he could be on a phone\nHigh right right and they could make an exception I trying but you're right okay what else\nI'm All right well she's believe me I Know that I thought were going to say if you want me to give you some good we got to give us two minutes on on killing the as\nI look at the book is about evil and and my contention is that most Americans don't understand evil my mother didn't she lived a very\nI re all your life yeah she's on me which is obviously\nBut she loved me and thought I was good\nSo they didn't understand evil right right\nSo we're seeing so much evil in America are we not um you know people walking into schools and gunning down kids uh clerics abusing children um Chicago where thousands of people are shot by drug gangs and nothing's done opioid epidemic through the roof\nThis is all evil it's centered on evil and so I wrote ss with an eye on explaining to the reader\nThat these concentration camp guard and the people who kill babies and gashed innocent people were farmers merchants and and bankers they weren't anything trained to do this they weren't as Saxons\nThey were regular people and once the war started they put on the black uniform
