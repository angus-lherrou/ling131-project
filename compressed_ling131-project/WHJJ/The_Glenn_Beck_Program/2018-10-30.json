to make you keep popping those coins there\nInto the into the machines you know it's a big thing now this is bizarre I saw this on line for the first time the other day trees that are decorated for Halloween my Christmas trees yeah decorated for Halloween new trend on social media\nHalloween trees basically the Christmas trees than instead they've been decorated for Halloween some choose to use it fake black tree while others just use whatever tree that they used for Christmas Time and the trees often feature orange black green or purple lights and ornaments that looked like pumpkins ghosts spiders and more\nAlso where Christmas tree might have an angel or star on top of Halloween trees are usually topped off with maybe a black cat a scholar some other Halloween symbols or somebody look good up there huh\nNow have you ever read purpose one holiday decorations for another holiday I have never done that\nYou know to me a Christmas tree is sacred All right you want to do a holiday tree and want to do a a Christmas tree you want to do a Halloween tree I think they should be to distinctively different things but\nNo I'm not gonna rip purpose my a Christmas tree it'll be up before I Know it anyway thank you you know she was like I just put the decorations away and now we're going to be taking them out again All right Halloween looks to be a dry affair tomorrow night for trick or

see if I can make you one thousand dollars richer before we part company\nAnd one thousand dollars now\nThe key word look under the laundry you'll get attacked confirming injury plus I hard radio in\nThe great supply luck that two hundred two hundred and\nBut what do you call a group of people two thousand four thousand seven\nThousand strong marching to a border saying you're going to cross whether the country wants your not while carrying another\nCountry's flag what what what do you call that\n[noise]\nYou know the reason why you have to stop this if it's coming\nThe reason why you have to stop it is because if you don't stop this one there will be an invasion because America can control our own borders\nMerely eight thousand troops to match what four thousand strong caravan fourteen thousand if the second caravan linked up with the first swelling their numbers to seven thousand so any media magician trying to spin what this caravan really is\nAnd I honestly don't know how you can describe a potential force of seven thousand people all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\n\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no\nBut what does America say\nIt is classic mail is ... military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country that has not happened before\nBut I said I Want to be fair here\nUnexpected in a regular tactics call for emergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing that men and women and green and blue or standing watch on the border\nI don't know what you can expect what should you do\nNothing nothing\nIf you had a group of people that were headed to your business or to your house and they said we're going to go into your house whether you like it or not\nAnd we've got two thousand people here\nAnd you're not going to be able to stop us because what's in your house we want we're just going to live there\nNow if you had a group of people that were marching\nSaying that coming to your house would you want the police to do nothing\nWhat'd you think that would you be happy if the police all of a sudden just said you know what they're not common for ... que they they're on the road there on the road there they are there's the video there's the video them saying they're going to come into my house and live in my house oh please\nI don't know about you but the next time there was a campaign I sure will be running for sheriff\n\nLocal law enforcement protect our streets the border patrol protects our borders the new standard cannot be the military on our borders a hundred percent of the time\nEmergency situations always give birth to emergency changes which always turn into permanent changes the federal income tax the Patriot act are truly examples\nOf many I don't like emergency measures that's why we should have a border policy that allows immigrants to come in that are qualified\nCome in through the front door\nAnd stops all of the side windows and the back door entries the country needs either serious policy on the border that will stop this or you need to build the damn wall\nBecause quite frankly the military on the border is not a good solution\nBut I'm Sorry CNN I don't know what you want to call it I mean after all you\nDon't like to call you don't like to call and to fall when they're throwing Molotov cocktails you don't even like to call them a mob\nGlenn Beck program\nDirection by numbers\nLet's take a look at election by a numbers hello sue\nTell me what's happening so far well uh we're one week away and this is when we get balls the with the chart a little bit because we have a had a lot of races in the middle and the sort of toss up category yep um ... been close and now we start to\nTry to move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are down to only three tossup races\nUh we have moved uh Missouri and Indiana\nEr into a lean Republican physician I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident us Indiana\nThe polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time um but we're moving those to lean Republican but the lives there was a Ted Cruz's still lean Republican state\nA ... and a a Mississippi and North Dakota is going to get you to fifty one if you if Republican sweep thoroughly nurse right now fifty one Republican Penn State there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure tops Phil and we couldn't really moved them\nBy Arizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls for Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know some of them showing her up fourteen points\nPlays falling has a lot closer a really a tough race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the house of category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we've moved to Florida to a lean Democrat\nDate or again this is a tough race 'cause you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen\nA movement towards towards a Nelson in Florida and we now have that one is a lean democratic state um we've moved from Minnesota as well from faith Democrat to leaning Democrat appalling there [noise] yeah [noise]\nI still think that's going to the Democrats but it the polling is closer then I think most people expect there's two reasons in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we've moved to lean Democrat as well or with a tossup races for most of the time it looks like tester has enough of a lead there to consider this one to be\nLeaning Democrat at this point ah and let's see we've got to New Jersey and Wisconsin and leaning Democrat as well so if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three forty five for the Democrats so [noise]\nI mean it's pretty it's [noise]\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate [noise]\nThat is the started to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida that was discouraging I think for Republicans the past few days Montana's not turning around\nYou know we've seen no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia as well which was a big hope for pick up again this is a state that voted for Trump by thirty points and Joe Manchin I think he you know\nI think he's solidified his seat there with his pro Kevin Olival yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota and hide camp I think she's done [noise] um but as of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's\nThe majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slightly nurse we're moving need that I Would normally keep those in the tops of categories of or a week away and we got to pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now I mean people are voting all across the country right now or it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break then come back and give us some of those results on the house\nLectern by numbers [noise]\nOn the Glenn Beck program\nOr don't want to tell you about our sponsor this half hour it's filtered by a filter by is a great

I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just\nBecause I constitutionally I think you know the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but I Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually means\nIt seems to me a disagreement among even original is with the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included\nAnd it'll be entirely there is yeah I think it would be interesting to see like how that shakes out because you know one of the things we've praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts so he needs to the judges he's put in would now rule on this end with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would be allowed or\nNot it was going to be fascinating yeah it does happen imagine Chuck Schumer and uh\nAnd Nancy Pelosi riding up that brief as a friend of the court come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh\nWe we really believe this\nThat guy has got to be a Superman to not ... not at least think oh\nReally I mean you can usually come with the Pittsburgh shooter and say no really he did it he is really really bad you know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's got to be a part of it but just goes\nOh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which is interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership trying to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish presidents we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this ... it's pretty amazing\nIt is ... ... you know what can we play can we play just a couple of things [noise] listen listen to this this how far they have gone this how far they've got here's here's Joe Scarborough and what he had to say listen to this make a um [noise]\nPeople get to make a decision if if the America they want to live in\nBecause right now the only constitutional check against this sort of a porn behavior I get that guy really a guy who was sending a message by time and time again tweeting about baseball we're talking about is bad hair day there that was done intentionally\nThan a message\nTo white nationalist [noise] as a bug me that much\nBut I'm I'm gonna watch a baseball game I'm going to tweet about baseball World Series [noise]\nNot that I'm I'm not gonna let it occupy my day\nThis is how twisted have become yeah twisted they well and that's from a ... a hard core conservative yeah she got her oh nobody's more conservative than Joe no you know we're all not\nSo well [noise] July twenty Seventeen bed going down forty percent bitcoin crypto currency expert ticket tore said hey there's going to be a lot there's going to run on this it was Eighteen hundred dollars a year on on this like you're crazy\nWhat was it eight months later and it was in an all time high was almost twenty thousand that ... has said that it is going to be at forty thousand now he said this was gonna happen by Christmas is a chance of I don't think\nThere's not a chance that's going to happen a chance I Would be very\nWary of it would be a wonderful Christmas present but really what I don't think so yeah I I'm a skeptic on that I Will tell you we have to get him back on the phone because I just talked to him recently\nAnd I said okay the ... come on man really random like yeah he's like okay maybe the timing maybe it's not Christmas but I'm telling you and he laid out all the reasons why it's about to take off yeah\nIsn't it yeah right yeah not again it's just a matter of timing\nI'm All right so here's what I Want you to do I want you to take the smart crypto course because I think everybody should have at least a hundred dollars in in crypto currency it's just this this game changing stuff\nAnd between a bitcoin crypto currency and block chain that is the future and you need to understand it takes is Glenn Beck exclusive\nCourse right now smart crypto course dot com smart crypto course dot com or coal eight seven seven P.

when I saw this I said\nYou know what we need to start telling our side of the story and we need to use storytelling as a as a way to do that\nSo that's what I ... it was it was astonishing kind of

people\nAnd there was just such a fear for losing work and one way and then on top of that it's like the game of Thrones where\nThey're it it's very competitive to ah to to get that work so the first the first way to take somebody out is to say that they're conservative um and and anybody that anybody that is even near that person that gets distinct them on conservative that they're conservative\nThey run from that or some sort of a lot of it is the loudest voices basically first kind of ...\nYou out like the invasion of the body Snatchers that this guy is a conservative and then you have the the second tier which are just people that are fearful for their\nFor getting work and those people run as well so it's just kind of this kind of\nA very the unhealthy community that get set up and then you know and then you start to see what happens to the Hollywood box office they started you know slowly over the last Fifteen Years\nStart to decline because they aren't making a content for the other half of the country\nSo um you know and I think that conservatives have really locked in on this and said you know what a ... of this we're not taking his anymore you see the

get she's she's very credible she's great interview you know we have our own kind of sixty minutes kind of person I'm very very smart yadda yadda yadda they hire her\nAnd that's when the social justice warriors all around them remind her remind them she's a conservative she was or at least she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um\nAnd no you can't play nice and you have to destroy her and solely hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized that the social justice warriors were against it\nThey did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy do you think there's any validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was used to I also do think that\nOr a ... going after the network where their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and the entire me too movement had a big part of that that a lot of people aren't touching on um ... it basically she was you know pretty brave in doing that um I think you know from a career wise it might have been not the smartest moved to do\nIt yet I'm here's a woman in the me too moment and exposing the corporation for covering and they don't like that and we're all the social justice warriors on that one\nExactly and that's where you kind of see how the me too movement has become just a political weapon because it was not it it's it's not um being used in the way that it was a God given birth to a\nMan and I think that that is is one of the main reasons why and it didn't help that she was a conservative and it was easy to get rid of her because of that\nUm so yeah I think that's what happened and egg and\nPatrick ... we're we're talking to the host of red build America you can hear it on the ah I hurt radio out really good story teller I Know you're going to be taking on a few issues and I want to kind of go through\nA a couple of them um first of all the\nThe caravan that is that is coming up uh there's today they're they're the media and quoting ... Smith are saying there's nothing to worry about this isn't an\nInvasion what what are your thoughts on the care of them [laughter]\nYou know I think that it is something that [noise] for whatever reason the last ten years the left is completely changed their tune on 'em in regards to our borders are open borders I I I feel like it is a we actually do an episode\nOf that's coming up that looks at this kind of story of you know is there actually jobs Americans won't do and we follow\nA to construction workers that um I I don't want to give the you know the end away but they've completely this crew that ah that that argument and I think at the end of the day there is a lot of people that in America that we've forgotten about\nThat have lost their jobs to to a much cheaper labor that comes across the border and I think that we're seeing this year I think that this caravan it is just not for political refugee status these people are looking for its economic and it's going to hurt the the most vulnerable people in the United states\nWell I think it's what's causing the homeless crisis in in Los Angeles is that fueled by any of this [noise]\nYou know that's a funny thing that you you asked that that it does um one hundred percent fuel out of that because a lot of these kinds of a labor type jobs have been taken away um but another thing that is causing the the homeless crisis in ... in Los Angeles\nIs is that there is is the drug epidemic there are there's a thing called patient and we actually have a story coming out on that\nI'm patient brokering where people are using Obamacare to fly to fly people out to Los Angeles to rehab centers and then when they end up using men\nAre using the the health insurance or they ended up getting stuck here in Los Angeles and there's been this huge surge of of ... basically go to rehab tourism\nHere in the in the Southern California area that has been a that is it being attributed to the homeless ... of course last you know basically follows me the passing of Obamacare and I've spoken to parents that have basically been through this and they went directly to Obamacare as being part of the reason why\nI uh their kids have gotten\nOut here in Los Angeles and I ... and ... year\n[noise] um you're covering also one other story I Want to cover with you why does the black community vote almost unanimously for Democrats\n[noise] we are that we're we're releasing two episodes on Thursday so I'm not I cast is launching this Thursday and I are radios a pod cast it in the ...\nThey can do it but it's not that I mean that's not the right way I don't support what they're saying and what their what their actions are correct\nA support single payer healthcare fifty six percent say yes thirty seven percent say no and that\nIf you're wondering why you're getting so many people jumping on that bandwagon at the polls like that that's why the Democrats are doing it\nDo you want Congress to check Trump fifty three percent say yes thirty eight percent say no also by the way the founders said yes to that one that has to any president right that should be Leon beyond heart of the role should be a hundred ... one hundred percent um do you support them lower investigation\nFifty two percent say yes forty two percent say no these are independent voters compare that with another poll yes is the Russia", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "30"}
