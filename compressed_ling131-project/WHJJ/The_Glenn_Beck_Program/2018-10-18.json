off with an opioid overdose and she was kind of upset about that and she took to Twitter instead I ain't did you and that's it I Can't see them I can say at once we got to say you know I can say

decision is I'm going to carry my aunts all round and again\nAnd occasionally my ... is is isn't so ... so many system right right exactly yeah at least I'm I'm going through the right steps of the cutting of it a little pieces and put him in this case and then I think that's your clean up after yourself that's all you can do is clean up the mess afterwards\nAnd it's interesting too that the media is making a big deal out of every single time they talk about this guy they talk about him as if he's\nAn American because they always say Washington Post reporter I\nUh ... I think he just he contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff member of the Washington Post columnist was any or he'd written it's relatively new yeah because he had left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might\nBe on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness what's going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new and you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... a first of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean an important that we are able to air those things are but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it Fahrenheit nine eleven was the one he's made like he's tried to capitalize on that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now but they're in it and I live in the first one the biggest political documentary of all time\nUp in that was just a giant conspiracy theory\nAbout how the bushes knew this guy like Fifteen Years ago all out there and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and it was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven um right so this is not a new\nAccusation and when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've\nBeen critical about for a bit of our allies since Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to the FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a\nFriendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Obama was plenty friendly with them to exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there was no way the bronco Obama would have done\nAnything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point in there and it wouldn't have done anything about this a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of the media coverage today the difference\nThere is that they perceive ... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker who is expensive right\nRemember good I'm bringing in Fahrenheit nine eleven again the big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and you let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the\nRemember this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time you know like but they saw Bush as the bad guy who who was who was incompetent\nBrock Obama waited what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything universally praised for this\nDecision it was the most difficult decision and five hundred years a thin slower than me so it was a tough decision I made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision and in the minds of people who want to praise the zoo and\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was risking admission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean it you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but ... it was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options and and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite is what they feel about Trump\nYou know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on with investigate this before we act irrationally if for Rocco bomber was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's\nNot being reactionary with Trump is that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something\nIt's just the you know that it may be overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who is a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's ... or Donald Trump but ... you know CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC is certainly on the sport and and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nA potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your own self but something happened there and ... and all we can talk about is what does why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't there are more of a story here maybe that's the story you run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIsn't the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still well that'd be age yeah should be\nUm breaking news now um Chicago Tribune is reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nUh actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ...\nUm Saudi Arabia publicly pledged payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into oh we're not doing anything to them 'cause they just paint us a hundred million dollars\nOf course there are always paying a hundred million dollars you got our relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that kind of I mean look at it it's not completely in significant to the relationship right I mean that there there are these considerations\nAnd that is why when you're making a decision of the president of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do right like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day of American interests are harmed long term\nI'm by a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority for top priority is not a ... murders in Turkey\nRight like the beginning I don't know if anybody knows this but we're ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to touch the pre anymore so studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things\nAll over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a journalist or a columnist is a big part of the reason why are you know I think the media care so much about it\nAnd they're prioritizing over you know some slaughter in Africa or some terrible thing that's happened in Russia\nRight like this is you know this is a a journalist that they knew that was from a you know that wound up working for an American newspaper\nSo it's a big story and the and the details rounded are so crazy like such a twenty four storyline that I can understand why it captures the interest but being patient and making sure you understand the actual facts of the situation before you act is not a negative\nAnd there's a lot at stake here a lot at stake I mean if you if you just start willy nilly throwing on sanctions on Saudi Arabia they are going to retaliate and it's it's going to cost a not us as much but the rest of the world is going to suffer in\nOil that's what they've already threatened All right go ahead and punish us and we'll cut off your oil supply while I think we get scant little from them but other people get a lot Europe gets a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia so yeah you want to make sure you got all your\nUh T's crossed in ... before you take\nAny severe action I Would think you know look as a global market anyway yeah so it it it all affects ah each part of it affects the other parts and you know it's something to consider though I mean I think making a principled moral decision outweighs that a lot of times but American interests are have to be facts annihilation we I think we see that\nHappening too infrequently over the past few decades and it and that should start again\nA AAA seven twenty seven back as the phone number are sponsored this half

Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment\nOn how to remove a Supreme Court justice right from office ... are just unbelievable I mean the ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench when there was no corrupt ration and no evidence\nYeah and you know wow first of all I think once we get past this election\nThat Brett Kavanaugh stuff is going to die down quite a bit because I mean you see what was the last time you see ... I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't hear ... occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story\nYou know they'll be still hate Clarence Thomas Milo was eight Brett Kavanaugh but I mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that story was about the allegations it was always about the ... the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court can they thought they had a chance of winning\nThe Senate and could block the block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court\nWould that was one hundred percent of of it for every ... every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and\nCertainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was definitely part of her calculus there [noise] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story we don't know um but\nThe other people in Cory Booker did not care for one second about what happened to this one not at all not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him to call themselves Spartacus a and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty candidate and the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um\nAnd this and and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually has evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to a the police and\nAnd again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but what you're judging by the standards that they're putting up\nIt's totally different ... let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating after I think of how\nRecent is Brett Kavanaugh saying was an ... story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find\nThat Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people uh they were there none of those people say that they remember the incident\nUh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she went back what happened what mine of it it happened ... none of it right [noise] um\nAnd we were basically the insinuation from the media was if let's say one of the witnesses she named\nInstead came out and said yeah I remember that party I remember hearing really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like you know very distant and I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already weren't phone conviction mode but I don't think\nCollins and flake would have held on for something like that just one person saying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident which just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who even knew that the party occurred none of the incident happened just that the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of late talking about the accusation of rape\nNot sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton brought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rip off to advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this uh Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he's she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to go down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it\nShe eventually told the FBI the truth in Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was getting like perjury charges or something against or\nFive people say ... five people said Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred wow so not while for one person who is at the hotel or at the party in the cabinet case she had five people that she told about\nThe rape immediately after it occurred uh a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick with a bloody lip and torn panty hose in their shared hotel room Broderick explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband then her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days but the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe Camelot and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovated so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked for rape is like a by the way I'm going to renovate the prison there are so work\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended\nNewspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred there was a prison outside the hotel window\nWow that is\nFound in times the amount of even alleged evidence that occurred with ah with Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet that was ignored\nFor ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats\nAnd now yeah you'll see occasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment it only happens now after they never want to hear a either one of their uh stories ever again\nTo them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump\nAnd that's why they have no more used for them but I mean Bill Clinton goes on and it still\nMakes a big ... levels speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there it's it's a situation with with a double standard that is so\nBizarre and the fact that they that the media actually thinks we should take their current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when your report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system\nWith actual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened\nI mean that is well that's the system we have it's the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we are now supposed to go through these kinds of records and an even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it is now or standard that can sanity it's insanity and yet you have\nHillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two and she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there is substantial evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy\nChristine Blasey Ford nobody's trying to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated or exception\nOf Michael ... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy fair so pissed off about that and they don't want him running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are today are very much trying to destroy him at this point\nBut what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then my collapse without it yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad that even Trevor Noah who's the ... I mean I I thought John Stewart was on funny this guy is on funny too about the one million to power but I'm Trevor Noah on Comedy Central the other day I took on Hillary Clinton and you know to his credit\nActually said some some accurate things are about her and and whether or not she's the best person to be speaking out on sexual allegations here's what he said\nUse radio nine twenty and one on forty seven have ham\nEventually every soon to be retiring must his time should I go it alone working before\nYou make a decision hold Jess Massey invest an hour of your time with Jeff people listen internally he learns into a retirement strategy personalized to you whether that's using investments or insurance horrible jumbled put it on paper you can take it home kick the tires talk it over\nAnd you might discover it's just what you were looking for [noise] just done this for more than Thirty years for hundreds of you are like anyone else in your retirement strategy will reflect that\nFor your own personal retirement strategy Jess Massey\nWon three three three thousand four zero one three the three eight zero zero zero\nMassey and associate think\nOh one three three three thousand\nFour zero one three three three thousand\nInvestment advisory services offered only by registered individual through evil management ...

Seventy Seventy easy Kay [noise] uh there's this there's an interesting\nThing for the New York times today and it is they do this little pod cast in the morning called the daily and today's was about Lucy K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage ever ever\nUm well he did things in front of girls right after he asked them if you could yeah and that and they said yes an odd part of the saga with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations of him and doing something\nThat against the motives will write like he would ask they say yes or or um there was one case where um he\n[noise] again like this is the level of the accusation your ... he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with a woman a woman believed that he was pleasure ing himself while on the phone with her\nBecause I guess he was breathing heavy or something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics power dynamic absolutely yeah power to make it makes you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian he's increase wields incredible how right in this country now incredibly led to ever\nFired at any job in the nation your any job you're sarcasm is just reality and the situation that they're going to go back to what they were saying they're saying they ... some of the people were other\nComedians and one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a ... there's something invited her back to his trailer to do its thing in front of her which apparently was\nWas this was his shtick ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife a child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues\nAnd that's the center of the allegation that he didn't do it he didn't force her to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation he asked her to do this thing which is believable obviously icky\nRight yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I haven't either shoes I'm Sorry but that is is that sexual\nAssault why the accusation there are no that was shown what she answered\nA diet and he did not pursue it after that ... it's unbelievable there's you know so I ...\nHe admitted to being a dirt bag right now and he admitted in such a general way that people kind of a make an equal he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make that make them right and I think that\nThe one I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is\nNo and and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian can affect other ... other comedians careers is theoretically possible but\nThat is that enough for a crime snow act that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's no evidence\nOf that he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again just making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was supposed to scare away from right you're not supposed to just a Seattle and people will commit crimes in the future\nAnd listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar is famous New York comedy club like it's a tiny like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedians I never heard of they're probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks in a dozen or Jerry Seinfeld comes in a while 'cause that are loose hey well doesn't that well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he's bounced around to several clubs around New York's fence and they let them under the age so the New York times of the exhaustive report about trying to talk to the club owner about why you let him onstage\nThis is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision\nOther people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy said he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work that he's never mhm like never he says never\nSaid well could you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence never work again he says I don't care never this is an admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as you are of a place where you would say particularly to a female customer who was somebody else on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton",
