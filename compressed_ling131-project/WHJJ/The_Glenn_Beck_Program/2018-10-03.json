expect to happen and what happens in fact so to give you a a quick example I'm just [noise] a\nA couple of weeks ago I'm a\nConsumer uh a customer of the apple eyes in a movie store found that three movies ... purchased had ... had been deleted from his account there were no longer accessible and I think that shocked a lot of people um those of us have been following these issues closely for years\nWould remember ten years ago when Amazon remotely deleted both off of people's candles yams including a ironically George Orwell Nineteen eighty four [laughter] so these these issues have been happening for a long time but I think people are are are now starting to read a sit up and take notice\nOkay so I I remember it gives us that it's easier for me to read everything on Kendall um but I and I have a a large collection uh in my library of of of hardcover books\nAh and I read so much I read it all on tend to but I have recently really been concerned not just because I don't actually own it and I can't have it in my library and I can't pass it on but also because you watch things like that happening in China\nIf you're trying if you're in China in the first they wouldn't sell the book but if they did sell the book\nThe government can just deem that that book is and you don't need to burn books you could just overnight just take all of that\nEvery copy of that book out of circulation if it's only digital that's really disturbing to me\nI think it's a real concern um it's a concern I'm from the perspective of censorship and you've just described it but it's also real concern\nOr from the perspective of preservation and sort of archiving our cultural history these books are ... are are stored on these\nCentralized servers and only the hands of you know the the two or three companies um that dominate these markets\nThen there's a real risk that um we are going to be able to ensure a cab to widespread distribution of copies that will allow us to uh to to uh to archive and preserved [noise] um the these works\nIn an air and it with the movie it wasn't because they found it objectionable or anything else is because that particular provider they lost the rights to that movie right and so they they had to pull it from people's libraries because their rights that expired\nSo there are number of ways that this can happen this most recent example I don't know the facts are totally clear on exactly what went on so one way this can happen is that as you described\nUm the deal between the digital retailer apple or Amazon and the copyright holder expires may no longer have the rights to sell that product\nIt can also happen when a record label or a movie studio decides that they want to put out the new updated re mastered the director's cut edition of the movie and when they do that they pulled the old\nVersion to alcoholism I knew [noise] um\nOh my God the almost a force you to I mean 'cause they they've always done this where you know it's the masterpiece collection and it's you know a digital footage and and the you know fully restored but you still had the old copy now that threat you can't you I mean even for thinking this even just for comparison\nYou can if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed our war huh well I Want to see what it was like\nWhen they originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that what'd you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that\n[noise] that's right I mean and the and the problem is most recent case in part was that the consumer and people have a local copy stored on their computer or their device [noise]\nUm and and this is this a practical tips for people you should always try to store as much as you can do locally many services are often trying to\nEncourage consumers to rely on their own on the on the company's own set of cloud storage solution and sometimes I'm for with the Apple TV for example\nThe Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of a movie you have to access it through their servers\nExactly I'm\nSorry I I think that makes a big difference in your relationship as\nIf I downloaded of something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kindle\nOr so is it allows you to store those files locally on your own device cars the Kendal is tattered through soft where right where connections to Amazon\nAmazon has the ability as as they showed ten years ago to block it move those files stronger\nWhen my ... are you talking about all go ahead [noise]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years ago two and a very different way I Am sure um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a huge who album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way David forest everybody to have it exactly [laughter] that's\nBizarre you write about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce there is in the past you had a transaction where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making provide tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them\nYou it's a it's sort of an open ended thing where they're constantly knowing what you do with that product and you\nHave that ongoing relationship where they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk about a little bit about the change their cars that is a that's a real change I don't think people have considered an air and before you answer that we're going to take a quick break and then we'll come back and get you to answer that question\nA and just the change in\nCapitalism change what does it mean to enter a world where\nThere's really no ownership of anything\nFor years now relief factor has been helping uh my team here in the studio\nAlleviate pain late last year um oh schooled mine\nWell I Want to tell you about really factor really factor take it it's really good\n... and you can buy really factor with gold one thing you can I don't think you can mount a case I Want to tell you a little bit about the goal line the new silver maple flex allows you to break off a smaller pieces are for barter Andrade of sub silver um there's a really I mean we just talked about the debt\nI don't know what's going to happen to the dollar nobody does nobody does nobody knows what's gonna happen bitcoin what's it going I mean there if there ever is a time of of catastrophic change there's going to be a time when we're all going to have to kind of work together and figure things out or because of the things aren't going to work the same with with dollars\nMay I suggest that the world always returns to gold um and for a barter a they have the maple flex going which is this this bar of of a silver that it's about the size of a credit card that you can carry it around it has a maximum flexibility you just break off pieces and\nUh you can have you know one tenth one quarter of an ounce of silver\nBut they also do it in gold and it's all made by the royal Canadian meant the only people that carry this is gold line\nJust look at the numbers find out for yourself is the world\nOr lean towards a fiscal sanity or insanity\nAs soon as the stars start rolling the other direction I'll stop talking about this but I don't trust that we have anything that's going to go into um bring us back into sanity other than some sort of catastrophic event\nThe air keeping you in touch on June and informed on

been looking at this\nSo I think in the short term what we are likely to ski or more changes in the way our commercial interactions occur and the way that\nCommercial transactions are structured will say we're going to start to see people become more and more customs to paying for temporary access to resources rather than owning them and in some ways\nI I think that makes some degree of sense there are some people for whom owning a car is it necessary they'd rather be able to take a left or use some sort of car share application\nAnd I think that makes a lot of sense what I'm worried about is the long term a set of implications for a shift away from ownership and towards temporary access a shift away from independent control\nOf resources to one where we have to rely on permission or or or the sort of good will of the companies that control access\nSo ... maybe many I give you an example and see if I'm On the right track I buy a car and I love this car and I want to keep it and it's
