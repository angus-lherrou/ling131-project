push in\nThrough the Democratic party free health care\nSingle payer so sorry single payer health care free health care free college\nI'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for an even bigger a infrastructure package than what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and gotten zero cosponsors zero he was the only one who's publically supported now the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten or ... democratic candidates which by the way it will not be enough to ... to cover the field there's going to be a lot more than ten I think\nUh but I mean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and\nIt does endorse Medicare for all\nAll the big names are for it already there are many of them were cosponsors of the bill or it seems to be this\nI mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racists for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are ... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nNo we were scare mongers in races for saying yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stores will go through this tomorrow but I just want to throw these that show um Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college\nYou know that is a fundamental um a a a fundamental aspect of what brought the states together in the first place\nThe state's said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything well then ... what do we have it can't be that way so we had the electoral college\nWe are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter it will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat pretty frightening pretty frightening so now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected right I'm old enough\nTo do is just just appeal to the big cities and by the way this is a this\nIs an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college I Know Trump sports at for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but uh there is a there's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe\nThis is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country road by cities\nI mean as you know it'd be which have been the ones that like as a Republican I certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\nRight as citizens should run themselves in the cities can run whatever they want and the rural or you can do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's some no farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand it taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmlands trying to dictate rules that are good for them that I also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous right and it's\nWhy the house and Senate both exist suit to give balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the it out right\nAnd it you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could have raised the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate\nThey way they got elected yeah it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly\nSo things can be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly\nThen the next the the first check\nOn the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body there was much slower but it wasn't just that it was slower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for wrecked trying I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was senator bronco bottle was center I shouldn't care about that\nBecause they would be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power\nOf their state then it goes to the president\nAnd the president is only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWay no that's the ... the opposite way you're\nSupposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed\nOr you're just arguing for king right with these the several ... around with a ... give you the argument for it came\nRight I mean okay really they failed or have we not been using them properly\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife and saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and slid lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed [laughter] ah no you're\nNot using it properly that's not what it was meant for and I would also argue the failure park right and you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane\nAbsolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland but Portland

position [noise]\nWow okay protected by her by her good friend\nAh who is no doubt or the head of Muslim or a Jew or or [laughter] we're somewhat of that ilk yeah here's here's the problem\nIs uh that I mean I'm ... on his face it looks like it is straight out discrimination show there doesn't seem to\nBe a a lot of a lot of doubt there but let me tell you which way the law goes on this even if you can prove discrimination and uh your boss can prove there was any other reason uh in addition to that ... that firing flies also eliminating the position completely gives them a lot\nOf a just a tremendous amount of power for example I Know the company that had a and it's a company that is in it's in the spotlight I mean people know about this coming and there was an issue uh an African American who was working there\nAnd I was and it was very obvious that this is the one African American that was their out of two or three people what they did is they just shut down the entire division and I literally instead of everybody everybody in the division is a shutdown we decided to shut down the division and boom where are you going to go with that or you shut down the division because you are a bunch of racist\nI knew we shut down the division as a\nAs a business decision\nYou see that's the problem that uh you're up against\nMy performance for better than the three parents but together but that's what you say and that I have proof that\nBut ... but even so it's a division part is going to be horrible also because your performance used to be wonderful doesn't mean that she's going to say that you are in subordinate I she doesn't die it said that it has changed I mean those are very very hard cases uh Laura how how's your Hebrew\n[laughter] horrible huh you see I work on that a lot truly [laughter] All right Laura that\nYeah I mean it's it used to be where discrimination was\nIt was it was a bad bang when or if you could prove discrimination the court has actually gone the other way in California which was a shocker to me when I heard about the court and because I and also firing someone you can fire someone for any reason\nLet's say you're employed and you're the best one in the division by far proof Syria is a you know what I learned when a fire you today I'm your boss or just don't like any more boom you're gone with no rights\nSo\nUh it gets to be a problem to say the least alright Joe here you go Joel welcome Hey Joe\nHi I'm a Seventy year old disabled\nBut I have some serious disability and I'm I'm having problems H oh\nWhat a shock whatever\nI Want to put a window in a bathroom when I asked about [noise] so I called the management company Fifteen times they never called back where it got a chance to talk on including trying to get to the board of directors are going to try to go to one of their reading but\nAnd they put out flyers saying when a meeting with the fact of the time so I didn't know was eight o'clock in the morning or eight o'clock at night when it hit that put the window when a\nA good thing you said the CDC in ours um rent having a window precursor to zero so but I went to the board meeting got very very nasty person or what have you back [laughter]\nUm so that's where I Am [laughter]\nAll right and what are they are they finding you now or is it just is screaming at you\nKnow to find me a hundred dollars a month or ... or be caused by something and they expect you to take the window out I'm assuming they're demanding I checked the window out or else they would keep finding\nAlright has anybody else in the building or put windows in in those locations\nNot throwing\nAll right so this is new well I it's\nThey have the right to say no or a they have the right to say if you put one in ... that in violation of the CBC in ours or they can say ...\nAnd you take it out until you are and and then here's your fine and uh we're gonna keep on charging however they made it untenable for you to on the other side is that you wanted to put it in ... they made it impossible for you to even\nUh even make an application and there it is and there by the way that there's the court case\nOkay uh you have to ... ... what I Would do is have a conversation with the attorney that represents the board every every board of directors a eight every ... has an attorney who represents a that represents them and have a conversation and say hey you know the board made it impossible the management company when you call me back\nOf it but it was but it has nothing to do with you the problem is you're probably you're probably going to need a lawyer\nOr to get you out of it it will be dismissed I mean there's no question you're you don't have liability here are based on what you said you because you know you're innocent he just came out and do this you don't know what he paid for which credit card you have no idea now they rotted the company but it's a superior court action\nA ... at this point I I Would contact a lawyer or that's representing the or the company that's suing and and just and send them a letter first of all say he was going on and just say hey I I had nothing to do with this\nNothing and lay it out\nAnd just say I really appreciate if you were dismissed this because I shouldn't be a defendant right it's one of those where you will win but you have to go to court have been dismissed ... lawyer actually gives a damn interviews you as an instant is an innocent party here\nAnd you truly are\nThen there should be a dismissal just because he's a decent\nGuy right sometimes not but that's worth a shot just a lot of like there's not going to go\nThere's nothing to counter to nothing the counters to on a because even if you are not liable I in the end there is not a frivolous lawsuit I he did work on your house the allegation if you weren't\nCaught up in this is legit it's a legitimate allegation and may not be true but it is an allegation it's not as if he just grab your neighbor and started suing your neighbor and there's no connection so but you do not counters too but at first I just asked\nTo get out of the damn thing and then and then you probably have to see a lawyer especially if it's an enormous amount of money\nOkay well I wasn't then I write in a ... the attorney but I also have to file every bond\nYes you do yes you do well thirty days you have to follow the response and you need some help with that on an avid attorney I could just you\nDon't do that yourself you write well actually I go to a paralegal and because you wind up with some of that you want to just there are some legal language that you have to know now you can go on the Internet and do your own research ah that talks about the fences and there are affirmative defense this\nBut uh it's yeah you can do it yourself or with a little bit of research I absolutely\nLorraine Lorraine welcome to handle on law I bail yes\nI kept my car habit that this noise in my car and you know and they fight breaks once when I took the car and driver Kay\nSure ah you have a case and that you have to pay for\nAll right uh yeah\nFigure out first of all you want the money back for what you paid for and that's it that's all you're going to get a fact that they didn't fix ah the noise or you're still the same place with a noisy car and it could be the battery and you're hearing aid is going south and you're hearing rattling noises and uh I have no idea how that works\nBrian Hi Brian welcome hey I\nWanted to ask you for years whenever I see my dentist he's trying to ah\nTalk me into installing a bridge on a a I have an open more that I've been chewing on for ten years no no uh no problems\nWe've been trying to talk me into installing a bridge on their thing and it was a three and a half weeks ago I allowed him to do a cursory thirty five hundred dollars and part of that preparation for bridge is you're going down the two right\nAt the time you saw yes I have one that I've\nBeen in ... for three and a half we thought it was settled down at it and I've been on ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you know twenty four hours a day for almost a month now that means to an end though Don to yesterday and ah he\n[laughter] but I'm going to need to root canals that grounded to them too much\nOr the old cars almost to the store\nOr that's lovely okay so what's your question\nThough his responses or my original Dennis response is is just one of those things that happen\nYou know know does that first of all I don't even understand why a dentist would push for a bridge today with their dental implant\nI mean all you have to do I have a bad too if you put it in a dental implant so you don't have to do a bridge which I mean I have a bridge but it was put in decades ago before implants were even around so I I have no choice or by I mean the guy is from what you said this is pure malpractice\nNow you need a you have to go to another Dennis that'll say yeah this is crazy and then as soon as that happens ah you get to take 'em for malpractice problem is how much his dental malpractice worse\nUh but now you start going and doing all kinds of research first step get another Dennis get a second opinion to say this is crazy this is not just one of those things would happen this is malpractice on its face\nAnd then you go from there and then you start talking to\nMedical malpractice people are and there's plenty to specialize in dental malpractice\nAnd I'm not really interested in pursuing\nYour fingers right now than get it straightened out and send them a bill I mean you can assume anyway and\nIf it's under ten thousand dollars a year go ahead and there's no problem to go to small claims court another problem is going to be you'd have to bring a dentist in there\nYou're gonna ... you're going to have to bring in a dentist a dental a dentist who's going to be a witness 'cause he's going to say in my professional opinion this is one of those things and it just went south and he's within the ... that is you are within that tiny little percentage that no matter what job I Do it's going to go south okay and I\nLet her be be appropriate being done\nYeah maybe or bring in lots of them are bringing in two or three and then see what the judge has to say OK okay alright try yeah tennis is he spent all these years talking unit doing something\nWent in in ... when you when you look at a dentist hockey when to anything you go to a dentist when you need a dentist\nI Know you've probably heard by now a new ...
