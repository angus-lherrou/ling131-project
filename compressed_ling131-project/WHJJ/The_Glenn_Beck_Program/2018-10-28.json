I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal\nI'd hang on weight before it sure started without me as you go into ... absolutely\nI Know one talking about getting rid of all standardized testing proud of high school I Know in talking about doing that because\nThey're testing is it unfair way of bringing teachers\nIs an unfair way of rewarding schools\nAnd it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across his entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons his family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests that is so stupid and to be some come successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy standardized testing is very good when you're in high school and try and why you should go where you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools I'm not okay with that\nNow you have a bit of gray hair as I Do think that means you were in school prior to Nineteen eighty and go with I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about the really do anything [laughter] somehow everyone in in in the United states some help on how to read\nWrite survive in the world without at at a department education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked\nAt the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse let me give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some low class central and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting ready and and I was testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion so losing four billion not into the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here\nWhen we lose at four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then it shows what writing granted but it shows you a check and boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why\nRegulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one say nice things because I crossed the entire state might say that sixty two counties across all ... to\n... get the full sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more than a traders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminishing makes over a hundred and fifty ... you dump a couple of minutes raiders you hide my teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done why in the world we have K. through twelve neat K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is thirteenth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college\nWas terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and when you say I Wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who would tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one uh ... told me said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is for people show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we didn't get breaks access and now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course\nAt sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test like it has a plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally\nAnd the lie is the only way to have success in this country is they got a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk and ... and the computer all day ... that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that\nSo it's sixteen let's not make some decisions if I think called you write to me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go to years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator is life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who have felt sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nNow okay yes hello I'm so that kid who's really smart that can take the SAT right away and goes off and get to a degree why should

making waves in New York and he's a voice that you should hear because his his policies are different than the Republican and the Democrat and I believe they're very very workable in a\nIn an era when we are changing everything when technology has changed everything\nWhy we're still looking at a system or you know that feels like the old Soviet size styles centralized system is beyond me but\nI'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things um\nYou are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with the big banks ... uh and the big banks a Cuomo is pushing them around quite a bit especially when it comes to the second amendment\nA and trying to de platform or people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally on ethical for a governor to impede business\nPeriod no ... no ... if I don't like in the industry or like something I never said if I Want to our freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief\nI should be the marketer and chief not not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing three out of it is he's always not only\nDoing that he's also threatening another group of business people but you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nYes absolutely and winds up happening more than ... more than more than often as normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around his edicts right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just once insurance forest firearm\nNow we can't get it there's no way that the individual and there are at least for me and I'm gun owners in New York state if not more widely in the insurance now\nWhen when when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore for any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yes and that's the unethical part that's the issue\nRight and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by default no matter what you do\nThat's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight and we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe act compliant say fact was passing twenty Thirteen\nAnd the fact said that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal literally ... what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before completely legally totally above board you are now a violent felon\nIt was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to\nNot joking is true story they hadn't out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes oh the cops where it's headed revamped of all because of that in other words but it now if you're retired cop once you retire well now you're a felon again I'm not going to come up\nThis in this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing it\nIs all about projecting how he is helping the little guy he's constantly who project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a businessman\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired mhm

nothing\nAnd I usually go to the restroom now he's like telling me now because you can't use the restroom so I told them you know it shouldn't be against the law for you to operate a business and conduct business and not have restroom so I don't know where I stand on\nThat well first of all a I I don't think there is a law but even if there is the law I it he can say to the public or you can

[laughter] and I'm from the need for the member me\nOr something you have five out here on calls later yes go ahead\nAnyway I have a car loan um didn't begin bankruptcy and if I call them did you think of the crowd away\nYou know and then if you don't know if it's a car loan you probably don't have a enough equity in the car where and probably the car is worth less than the amount of money that's oh ... or how much money do still on the car\nWith how much you're three thousand dollars on the car and how much is it worth\nMaybe he will just came home\nI Know you don't worry about it now you just keep on paying it no one's going to touch you can go bankrupt all you want\n[noise] oh okay I don't worry about it that that part is and that's usually the case is I assets are deal I dealt with with the bankruptcy court so you file for bankruptcy\nAnd the court looks at how much money you old versus what you have and then if it's a liquidation splits up the assets but cars are almost never ever put into a bankruptcy unless you've got a Bentley or a Rolls Royce\nA that is a paid out that's been paid for but other than that what you have users exemptions where you're allowed to have a personal car and usually whenever there's a loan I as in his case\nYou owe more money let's say you buy a car for twenty thousand dollars\nOn and so you you you go ahead and arrange a payment schedule you finance the carnival the second you drive off a lot it's Fifteen thousand dollars is value and you still owe twenty and that's the case all the way down so no cars are pretty\nMuch a left out of it so I wouldn't worry too much about that I Hope I'm like oh yeah yeah so how long you're going out\nYeah [noise] yeah I have a question all the case that cat will take a while it showed it to

to a total the long hair and all that of course that they are in a judge it matches Shaw about a a statute of limitations\nAre the first of all\nTime Mike Mike Mike I'm going to stop you right there because you're you're going way way beyond ah what what the show was about uh you have a bankruptcy issue yeah but this man that Sonia dismissal issue you need a civil attorney to look at it because you may have a case of legal malpractice\nThere's some statute issues obviously the judge had some issues a with a statute asking you to file an amended complain it didn't happen on time there was a dismissal yeah you are definitely going to have to contact a as civil attorney on that just go to the website 'cause I Know the story was going to go on forever and frankly I didn't understand Ninety percent what you're saying anyway\nBy the high any Europe welcome to handle on law\nAnd do yes I have a question here [noise] I had to\nGo out and my mother home it was a ... it was on the recall I contacted ... said OK yeah recall sort of the bill a check at the top the bill for another two to three weeks\nAgo I wait wait wait hold on a minute or so there you had a recall and what happened then Michelin just call you up and send us the bill for what what happened\nWell what about the tire blowing out a chore it made a thousand dollars damage to the motor home on\nGod and so the tire blew out and it was a recall tire\nThat I get up and I never got a note it's\nGot it okay and so are you of eight thousand dollar damage and what else\nAnd show me swing with the darn thing I actually my chest they thought I had a heart attack\nBut ... the way they hassling with what\nWith the with the with the steering wheel trial\nI see as you weren't this happened during the course of an accident when a tire blowout\nYeah sure got it so there were A Guided bodily damage bodily injury okay now like yeah\nSo my question or a total of God I got in contact with them all the time and everything I told the guy uh I Can't get you to be for another four ... four to five weeks or whatever that number what okay\nI thought look I I I'm On the Medicare and you know they pay for everything right All right pretty much it I said if you make choices and the\n... from my eighth them being taught about that and my question is should I get an attorney to hell with upset at me dealing with this man\nWell it depends on how serious you're a medical issue is\nA ... but I think that our dollar\nConsidered talking to an attorney Betty okay\nThere's enough money there that you want at least talk to a personal injury attorney and this is not one of those things where uh here's the medical bills and here's another thousand dollars a first of all I think you're going to have a hard time even here arguing the medical bill 'cause he's going to come back\nAnd this is typically what happens with the insurance the insurance company of Michelin right this was not Michelin per se\n... a year and I do believe me you're you just started talking to them or if you're on your own uh missiles going to go and they're not going to a ... the guy that you're talking to is not going to write you a check for medical is going to go to their insurance company who is going to go through the medical and\nFigure out what was legitimate what wasn't and gee you didn't have to go there and you didn't have to do this kind of procedure oh Edie Edie yeah go\nYou've talked to earlier about this [noise] okay do you need a medical malpractice attorneys and it's just that simple [noise] ah this is handled on the

Fox News after Saturday's deadly synagogue massacre Pittsburgh Mayor Bill judo promising will get\nWhat's going on or what the answer what they're making more money bring your own back like everybody else sides yeah yeah I mean I'm Sorry it would be unfair I understand\nBut I think they can charge anything above that now you could be that the only charge ten cents\nA and uh that's the way it goes I don't know what the law reads I mean you can look up a law that's easy or just look at the statue where they changed it and just read the damn thing you know just go on the Internet and go you know ten cents a bag law mandatory bag payment whatever a search words you want\nBut I based on if there isn't a law that says the stores can only charge ten cents\nAnd they must charge ten cents then all they can do is charged sense but my guess is that there is a ten cent charge in the stores can charge way beyond that\nWow yeah\nSo it would be the answer you bring your own Dan bear hug you when you go to the store and I always bring their own recycle bags [noise] right right yeah okay there's your answer\nOr what a big legal issue on that one isn't there oh hey can I sue them yes yes I'll give you some lawyers a good lawyer six hundred bucks an hour\nOr what does my lawyer charge 'em whenever I Need legal work to keep in mind died my expertise is [noise] is limited as most lawyers are limited in their expertise and mine is insanely limited to third party reproductive\nLaws you know I I was my lawyer charging I just had an issue with a a lawyer headed I needed some a business documents are six and a quarter an hour six hundred and\nTwenty five dollars an hour and by the way that's not off base either for a good lawyers summer seven hundred appeals lawyers can be nine hundred thousand dollars and our senior ... senior partners in a law firm you can run nine hundred thousand bucks an hour\nSo when you have to pay for a lawyer and a good lawyer you have to look at whether you have a good case or not\nAnd that's why I Love law it's the principal thing I Want to file a lawsuit okay go go for it you know you'll enjoy yourself and then the judge says you're

lead your own house Kelly the album God so I was removed from ministry while kept my ordination\nAh for two years I was I'm working back and forth or email talking about getting in ... after a finally here's later I was given my termination notice however they backed candidate a day before my ten year\nWhere I Would have been backed into my pension play a lot of my church lots I wipe it off by tension there there are my just rude\nAlright well first of all I Want the nomination is is\nA Methodist I'm Sorry free method is yeah you know I deal with that is have you considered becoming with say a Muslim or a Jew\n[laughter] actually I met you ought to use I should just go that route\nYou if you don't like I Love that because you know what the uh you know when people called messianic Jew so people that believe in Christ\nWith that Christians that's all we call them they're not messianic Jews just saying just throwing that out I always had a pleasure talking about that uh where you can do ah I think you can go for your pension because uh that road knocking you off one day a\nIs retaliatory and his predator a predatory I mean that is I mean they're just a bunch of pastors they really are to do that well yeah they sure have that Christian outlook on life don't they\nAh and yeah absolutely and now the issue of uh their belief if you can hold your own house in order you can't leave you certainly can't a lead a house of God a which is also a complete ... if your wife leaves you and a has an affair as somehow it's your fault I Love that\nMan that's another reason why he decided just switching a religions Israel I mean this this is a tough way to go it really is\nNo no I'm I'm thinking like that just I don't like the people I I like God they stop people from much\nYeah All right ah is ah the other possibility of getting in another a person ensure a another church\nCan't it's hard to say that actually I was just approached by one of the new leaders that just stepped up and and one of the higher positions and they asked if I were so interested and I kinda wondered if if if I did do that if they had to take off the fact that they terminated me and kind of kept me on fourteen years\nNow that the other issue is as you talk to or the new folks that you are I'm considering going back to the church or at least having a a a a church or what what do they call that a person who does a congregation\nCongregation and that's the word yeah having your own congregation you want to say can I please be credited or with the two years so my pension kick sand and have a ... not only are we in statement but credit for the two years and if I were if if I were them\nOr or ... I Would ah I'd give it to you in a heartbeat because it's so unfair to what happened to you\nI mean it really is I mean on the face of this and you know the fact that you have a good attitude about this if it were me I would've towards the church\n[laughter] anyway so uh the issue is yes I think you have a legal a right to go after the pension based on their actions but if you can undo that with a new congregation and the higher ups on the church willing to do that you're home free Israel you don't care\nMatter of fact you don't have damages\nThat's true and I really appreciate that thank you so much\nAll right take care of me not to join that church if I ever convert ah I'm not going to be a free Methodist\nI'll be paid Methodist [noise] I think so was that were that works for sure [noise] okay this fins handle on the law use radio nine twenty four seven [noise]\n\nAre you considering a safe or gun safe to secure your valuables and firearms if so before you spend any money\nAny typical running a middle safe check out the amazing I\nAm crafted rhino iron works strikes at ... dot com see for yourself why Ronald safe customers are so passionate about their antique industrial style safes and if you're a gun owner you love the convenience of the swing outgoing wreck\nRhino or a huge dealer network break pricing warranty in customer service so go to rhino safe dot com today that's rhino safe dot com\nNothing small and not your [noise] your passion your hours your reputation ...\nYour partnership even\nWith ... technology advisors you'll get the [noise] in my and one on one partnership down to business ground because with a reliable there'll be these core processor you can focus on what matters now getting business down\nSeven Devon by down to speak with an advisor to eat them seven by down\nThis is Michael met them here with Mike stole from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage of the news reports say that the rates might be going down\nThe government protects the costs of Medicare plans will decrease this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best right to health markets offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide to help folks maximize their benefits and save on\nI mean that's what ... and windows how how many months ... days is he a going to be turning Eighteen from this phone call\nWhile he just turned ... and here he just\nTurned okay so he just turned Seventeen believe me I'm a mom could go into court asked for custody and Seventeen year old son goes I you know what I don't want to live with my mother\nIt's over I wouldn't I wouldn't bother\nNow she could file for custody just make or make yours and his life miserable\nOh he's done that for all the fear\nWell then you have to bend would have been what happens is I she he well he can also here's a couple of other things you do okay the number one\nIs uh that I she filed against the father asking for sole custody and the court is going to say about what's this about will ask your oh we'll ask your grandson he could also argue to being emancipated miner\nAnd his son and it's done at Seventeen I think the court will give it to him\nCan he do that if you don't have a job\nYeah OK of course all of course that you don't need a job to be an emancipated minor so you want to look into that but you know the bottom line is I don't think there's gonna be a custody issue I really doubt\nOkay 'cause I think in some ...\nYeah I Know I wouldn't worry about it some day those on my alright yeah by a judge someone was [laughter]\nYeah my kids want to stay with me too [noise]\nOnly because they figure I could pay more\nThan one [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nThree years ago making a murderer became less the TV show than a force of nature and uncovered a grave injustice and the criminal justice he was also completely\nDishonest and I would know I'm dead O'Donnell I covered that Steven Avery and Brendan Bessie trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am to part two of rebuilding of\nMyrtle wanting a murderer is now on the free I our radio as to when the\n...
