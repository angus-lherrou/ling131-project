A. N. G. stock says Facebook Amazon apple Netflix global\nCan you repeat that yes sure and I know it's kind of went through a pretty fast started but that ain't right S. A. N. G.\nSo Facebook apple Amazon Netflix and Google\nSo they've always refer to as the ... years but now they're referring to fang plus Microsoft so they've added that another old technology based stocks so when you look at those six stocks in earlier October before the correction\nSixty four percent of the growth of the some ... five hundred\nWas related to those six companies so six companies out of five hundred accounted for sixty four percent of the growth of the some ... five hundred so people are looking at the index and say gee this is talk on my portfolio is not following it or near it\nWell if you weren't heavily invested in those six stocks that we're all high tech\nThen you wouldn't have have seen as big a rise in your portfolio and that is on the aggressive side if you're in all that technology\nNow when you look at it the corruption that we had early October it was so sick that again cause that pulled back so they had a minor correction within the technology area\nBecause they were overheated this year they had grown way too much in a very short period of time so the market will quote unquote corrected meaning some people saying wow I really made a boatload of money I'm going to\nSome profits off the table and then that that's going to drive other people to sell if the if the selling drives the market down or the cost of that stock down other people might get triggered for their cell orders so if it goes out five or ten percent that might cause other people to trigger a south which drives that don't deeper\nAnd that's the kind of feeds on itself so when we look at what happened those six stocks drove up the market and they kind of cause that correction and then we'll see what happens as we go forward but we don't feel too strongly about buying into those six socks at this point because they're way over heated in our opinion\nSo as I mentioned a moment ago we always want to look at the fundamentals and if the fundamentals are so strong meaning is unemployment low\nOr people working you know is a things stable in the economy itself are retail purchasing numbers looking strong well those are fundamental issues so if the fundamentals are good\nWe anticipate that these quick corrections will again kind of recover now we don't never know how long that would be or how quickly that could be but the fundamentals are so strong\nAnd it's just the way that we look at our clients portfolios and where their position if that sounds interesting to you are a number of years for one three three three eight thousand\nIf you save two hundred thousand or more of your retirement give us a call we would love to sit with you take you through our proprietary process or the master money retirement road map\nAnd we will do a deep dive into your portfolio and show you exactly from a technical perspective where you are and of course we do our best to make that simple so that you understand it\nThe feedback we get from our listeners is always has been wonderful it really has where people say wow I never knew so much about my investments until you showed me this report\nAnd I often hear well gee whiz my advisor never showed me that\nI'm not sure why but we think that's key and fundamental you need to know where you are today before you can make good strong investment decisions going forward that number again is ... three three three eight thousand\nI Want to tie financial fundamentals with you gas to protect us from volatility the volatility we see on Wall street what is a fundamental you think we should start with\nWell the first fundamental is is to ensure that your assets are appropriately diversified now by diversified you know everybody hears that word was me\nWell I mean methodically allocating assets across various classes you know you've got stocks mutual funds exchange traded funds\nAnd potentially some new disease which of course we prefer the fixed variety because the variables I just I'm not a fan of the fees tend to be high and I I just don't care for them\nAnd then perhaps some cash and are there any alternative investments that you should consider\nNow that applies to your entire asset Bayh's retirement accounts that just four one K. your stock portfolio if you have one outside of your retirement plan cetera the goal is to build a mix of assets\nWe're the behavior does not correlate and that is when the value of one asset classes down the value of another asked the class hopefully is up or at a minimum steady so one balances off the other\nYou know this use of non correlated assets\nIs designed to help level out\nThose ups and downs and you're the overall performance of your portfolio of assets while still producing a certain level of growth on the one hand and having a certain segment of your holdings in a protected position and that's the fundamental basis of how we structure clients portfolios back in\nThe number at ... says the it's aimed for the euro

people\nRetires thinks that the only thing he can help you went on a show or attacking financial fundamentals to help us put volatility and its proper place can retire but so Geoff what's next\nFor the next fundamental has to do with was among the top one or two issues and usually it's it's the top every survey I've seen\nThat you know some heading towards retirement tend to worry about most and that is having enough income to last as long as they needed to laugh the fundamental is to ensure that you have some retirement income sources that are not tied to equity markets because we've seen how those equity markets can go down\nIf we just think back to two thousand eight and technically it started in October about seven and then dropped even though oh seven was positive for the year there was a major drop from October to December\nAnd then two thousand eight it was like thirty seven percent it kept going down until march of old nine but only nine itself\nWas positive so everybody's skipped so seven and nine but if you look at the ... five hundred from October of oh seven to march of oh nine it lost two thirds of its value in Eighteen months\nSo it's very important not to have all of your money tied to a market that can be that brutal and unforgiving\nBecause your income is what you live on it's not just a pile of money yeah you can draw from a pile of money or cash some people way back in two thousand ... actually buried money you know because they were afraid of what was going to happen with computers and stuff\nBut that doesn't make a lot of sense and thankfully it didn't really cause or any type of major issues so it's important that you have multiple sources of income for your retirement ... most people will have Social Security a lucky few or might have a pension plan\nAnd then many people have their retirement plan at work whether it's four one K. for three beep or fifty seven or IRA accounts whether that's traditional or Ross or you may have an investment portfolio outside of your retirement plan and if you do\nThat's awesome because now you're diversifying the tax ability of the income which is very important\nAnd then you might be somebody that's had rental property that son well over the years and now some people\nChoose to liquidate rental property when they get to retirement because they don't want to be tied to the property if it's been a challenge\nAnd others intend to hold those rental properties and use that as rental income and for them that can be the perfect strategy and then of course if you're going to have a safety position in the bag well you you should earn interests and thankfully finally you know interest rates are coming up and that and that's fine that's been great to see finally\nAnd then you know many um maybe not many but a fair number of our clients choose to continue to work\nNow they'll they'll quit the full time job they had to do something fun do something part time it gives them some socialization out there to to have friendships et cetera and it gives them a few extra bucks so it makes them feel better\nSo when you look at the bigger picture Social Security is an income source that is not tied to the equity markets that's important neither is the pension plan\nInterest bearing accounts income from from working also those are all in that category but many others retirement plans for one k.'s investment portfolios\nIRAs regardless of the time many of those are invested directly in the stock market so you may be overexposed and the stock market\nIt gets it perhaps than in certain circumstances we should be finding other income sources that aren't tied to the acronym ...\nIt's true of absolutely and you know you see it and all types of\nMagazine financial magazines whether it's kept blender or even the wall Street Journal we'll talk about securing your income that you need to cover your your fixed expenses at a minimum is not your lifestyle\nAs a minimum now the only exception with the lifestyle would be you don't need to have a secure monthly income\nFor like travel expenses because your travel expenses you don't need to have that money coming in every month you just need to have access to the money when you're ready to take\nTake that that trip funny story years ago I had a couple that had come in and we hit agreed in their first meeting that they said they needed twenty five thousand from their assets okay great I put together a plan I come back to the next meeting and I said well you know our our numbers changed a little bit\nUm as well All right so instead of twenty five ... what do we need to bump up to and they said sixty thousand [laughter] and I was like well wait a minute how did we get from twenty five to six so so one of the points was that he had four thousand for Gulf trip with his buddies every year\nAnd she wanted twelve thousand for travel for the two of them\nAnd and so I said well first let's take the travel out of the budget she above jumped out of her chair Megan really it's really kind of ... she was so you can't take the travel a lot of my budget I said well we'll let me explain why we're taking out of the monthly budget\nI said let's say march comes along and you decide you want to go on your trip but you've only receive three months of your uh twelve thousand dollars\nCan you pay for your trip while the answer is no so it's not you don't want if you're going to spend twelve thousand for your trip you don't want a thousand a month to come in you just want to have access to twelve thousand when you're ready\nIt's a very simple way to look at things so\nWhen you look at structuring your income it's important to cover your base expenses but also certain lifestyle expenses so if you're eating out every month that kinda stuff you want that to be structured so in our opinion we believe that fixed annuities can fit in that space and there are two different general categories", "year": "2018",
