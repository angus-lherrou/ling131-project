none of it is protected\nNow if you had changed the owner and the beneficiary on the life insurance policy to the child more than five years ago I think he would be okay\nWith that uh it would be protected I don't love that idea but at least it would have been protected so that being said what's gonna happen when we go to apply for Medicaid 'cause she's going in to the nursing home\nAnd you know what what you're probably hearing here folks and realizing is wait a minute there's no benefit to given it to a person you don't short and that by your clock\nDo it to your ear evoke about trust

done we go into the nursing home we apply okay as you are saying Susan from uh I'm going to compare a state recovery versus trust planning right so if this was all put in a trust the bank accounts the investment accounts the home you know all in the trust well\nThen you see the ah\n[noise] ah there would be ... there were and were beyond five years there would be no state recovery here right assets would be protected not half mhm all and no state recovery when the individual dies\nHe just die and whatever's left in the trust is there it's a life insurance on the other hand I could not have probably put that into the euro vocal trust because if I did change the owner and beneficial to the trust\nIf it's still required premium payments than the father could not pay the premiums because then he'd be paying a premium on a policy he doesn't own therefore\nAt five o'clock start every time he makes the policy payment\nBut if he had put assets are bank accounts into the trust then he could pay the premiums would that trust money right\nThen he could as long as there's enough money in the trust to pay those kind of a very good point Susan you could actually do that\nVersus what he did he gave it to the sun changed the owner and the beneficial to the sun I said\nYes after five years you would have protected downside who's going to pay the premiums when he went to bat the dad still paying those premiums are going to have the same problem went down so another short cut problem that doesn't actually work at the end of the day mhm so\nYou know at this case I'm thinking the irrevocably trust would have not had any of these issues\nSo now what happens now in his case we're going to apply for Medicaid\nAnd they're going to say the houses non ...\nI like it yeah it you got you know none of the bad things happened by owning it died in a life a state with a child I get it but at least is protected from the nursing home and you know a state recovery let me explain he even though he owns a life a state interest in the property since it says home\nIt's deemed non accountable while he is alive and when he dies the life estate expires like magic it disappears\nAnd any lean that would have been on it also disappears and so it passes outside of probate to the child and he becomes the full owner\nAnd the simple so what that means is\nNo state recovery because at least in Massachusetts you need to check with your state\nBut some states have expanded estate recovery but in Massachusetts a state recovery is limited to assets that are in your own name on the date of death\nThe life a state of voids probate so therefore it doesn't own name means that goes to ... hey okay so that's a good deal\nNow what about this joint investment account let's say we didn't do it more than five years ago and not even half of it is protected what are we going to do you can't leave it joint thinking that somehow that's going to avoid probate right because the whole assets accountable\nYou're right or two thousand dollars so thinking you're going to leave a joint and get on Medicaid to avoid estate recovery is not going to help you because you won't get on Medicaid you and me and\n... because you have the money and you name regardless of how the ownership as if it's half and your name it's all that yeah\nIt it's so in this case you're over two thousand dollars so you don't have to worry about estate recovery 'cause you're not going to get on Medicaid right\nSo that's not a good deal same thing with the bank accounts what are we going to do\nWe're going to take the bank accounts and the investment accounts liquidate them\nAnd either buying annuity in his name on Medicaid annuity to convert it to an income stream allowing him to become eligible for Medicaid or put it all into a pool trust depending on his age and how the numbers play out also avoiding the five year waiting period yes there'll be a pay back provision on both\nBut at least you'll beyond medicate ... and when I say a pay back provision that's really a state recovery right so instead of worrying about it going to probate because it's in a pool of trust\nThe trust itself has the language that says we don't need to worry about probate it's going to say right in the document after you die pay back the state at least the amount of benefits you received from Medicaid\nTakes some advice folks avoid the last minute dancing do your planning in advance do it right\nMake sure your trust is drafted properly how do you know what shouldn't shouldn't be in your trust well Todd has

...\nEye on radio station\nAt a place of worship on ... who's now Fox News I synagogue in Pittsburgh the latest target of a person with a gun\n[laughter]\nChange or was this more of an emotional kind of knee jerk reaction so we have to look at it both ways we always look the fundamentals now when we look at the more recent volatility in October of this year\nWhen you look at what's referred to as the fang S. A. N. G. stock says Facebook Amazon apple Netflix Google\nCan you repeat that yes sure and I know it's kind of went through a pretty fast start but that ain't right S. A. N. G. so Facebook\nApple Amazon Netflix and Google\n... so they've always refer to as the fangs ... years but now they're referring to fang plus Microsoft so they've added that another all technology based stocks so when you look at those six stocks in earlier October before the correction\nSixty four percent of the growth of the U.S some peace five hundred\nWas related to those six companies so six companies out of five hundred accounted for sixty four percent of the growth of the ... five hundred so people are looking at the index and say gee the next ... my portfolio is not following it or near it\nWell if you weren't heavily invested in those six stocks that we're all high tech\nThen you wouldn't have have seen as big a rise in your portfolio and that is on the aggressive side if you're in all that technology\nNow when you look at it the corruption that we had early October it was those six that again cause that pulled back so they had a minor correction within the technology area\nBecause they were overheated this year they had grown way too much in a very short period of time so the market will quote unquote corrected meaning some people saying wow I really made a boatload of money I'm going to take some profits off the table\nAnd then that that's going to drive other people to sell if the if the selling drives the market down or the cost of that stock down other people might get triggered for their cell orders so if it goes down five or ten percent it might cause other people to trigger a cell which drives that don't deeper\nAnd that's the kind of feeds on itself so when we look at what happened those six stocks drove up the market and they kind of cause that correction and then we'll see what happens as we go forward but we don't feel too strongly about buying into those six socks at this point because they're way over heated and our opinion\nSo as I mentioned a moment ago we always want to look at the fundamentals and if the fundamentals are so strong meaning is unemployment low\nOr people working you know is a things stable in the economy itself are retail purchasing numbers looking strong well those are fundamental issues so if the fundamentals are good\nWe anticipate that these quick corrections will again kind of recover now we don't never know how long that would be or how quickly that could be but the fundamentals are so strong\nAnd it's just the way that we look at our clients portfolios and where their position if that sounds interesting to you are a number of years for one three three three eight thousand\nIf you save two hundred thousand or more of your retirement give us a call we would love to sit with you take you through our proprietary process or the master money retirement road map\nAnd we will do a deep dive into your portfolio in show you exactly from a technical perspective where you are and of course we do our best to make that simple so that you understand it\nThe feedback we get from our listeners is always has been wonderful it really has where people say wow I never knew so much about my investments until you showed me this report\nAnd I often hear well gee whiz my advisor never showed me that\nI'm not sure why but we think that's key in fundamental you need to know where you are today before you can make good strong investment decisions going forward that number again is for one three three three eight thousand\nI Want to tie financial fundamental flip you gas to protect us from ... until it and we see on Wall street what he is a fundamental you think we should start with\nWell the first fundamental is is to ensure that your assets are appropriately diversified now by diversified you know everybody hears that we're both I mean\nWell I mean methodically allocating assets across various classes you know you've got stocks there's mutual funds exchange traded funds\nAnd potentially some new disease which of course we prefer the fixed variety because the variables I just done a fan of the fees tend to be high and I I just don't care for them\nAnd then perhaps some cash and are there any alternative investments that you should consider\nNow that applies to your entire asset base retirement accounts that just four one K. your stock portfolio if you have one outside of your retirement plan et cetera the goal is to build a mix of assets\nWhere the behavior does not correlate and that is when the value of one asset classes down the value of another asset class hopefully is up or at a minimum steady so one balances off the other\nYou know this use of non correlated assets\nIs designed to help level out those ups and downs in your the overall performance of your portfolio of assets while still producing a certain level of growth on the one hand\nAnd having a certain segment of your holdings in a protected position and that's the fundamental basis of how we structure clients portfolios bagging\nThe number at ... says the at the end for the euro

he's the founder and president I'm mad at me and the cat's health people\nRetire successfully something he can help you went on a show or attacking financial fundamentals help us put volatility and its proper place can retire bed that Jeff what's next\nThe next fundamental has to do with what's among the top one or two issues and usually it's it's the top every survey I've seen\nThat you know some heading towards retirement tend to worry about most and that is having enough income to last as long as they needed to last the fundamental is to ensure that you have some retirement income sources that are not tied to equity markets because we've seen how those equity markets can go down\nIf we just think back to two thousand eight and technically it started in October of seven and a dropped even though all seven was positive for the year there was a major drop from October to December\nAnd then two thousand eight it was like thirty seven percent it kept going down until march of old nine but over nine itself\nWas positive so everybody's skipped so seven and nine but if you look at the ... five hundred from October of oh seven to march of old nine it lost two thirds of its value in Eighteen months\nSo it's very important not to have all of your money tied to a market that can be that brutal and unforgiving\nBecause your income is what you live on it's not just a pile of money yeah you can draw from a pile of money or cash some people way back in two thousand ... actually buried money you know because they were afraid of what was going to happen with computers and stuff\nBut that doesn't make a lot of sense and thankfully it didn't really cause or any type of major issues so it's important that you have multiple sources of income for your retirement now most people will have Social Security a lucky few or might have a pension plan\nAnd then many people have their retirement plan at work whether it's four one K. for three four fifty seven or IRA accounts whether that's traditional or Ross or you may have an investment portfolio outside of your retirement plan and if you do\nThat's awesome because now you're diversifying the tax ability of the income which is very important and then you might be a somebody that had rental property that's on well over the years and now some people\nChoose to liquidate rental property when they get to retirement because they don't want to be tied to that property if it's been a challenge and others intend to hold those rental properties and use that as rental income and for them that can be the perfect strategy\nThen of course if you're going to have a safety position in the bag well you you should earn interests and thankfully finally you know interest rates are coming up and that and that's fine that's been great to see finally\nAnd then you know many um maybe not many but a fair number of our clients choose to continue to work\nNow they'll they'll quit the full time job they had to do something fun do something part time it gives them some socialization out there to to have friendships et cetera\nAnd it gives them a few extra bucks so it makes them feel better so when you look at the bigger picture Social Security is an income source that is not tied to the equity markets us important uh neither is the pension plan\nInterest bearing accounts income from from working also those are all in that category but many others retirement plans for one case investment portfolios\nIRAs regardless of the type ...\nYeah those are invested directly in the stock market so you may be overexposed and the stock market\nHad cats and perhaps than in certain circumstances we should be finding other income sources that aren't tied to the equity markets trail\nOf absolutely and you know you see it in all types of\nMagazine financial magazines whether it's kept blender or even the wall Street Journal we'll talk about securing your income that you need to cover your your fixed expenses at a minimum\nIs not your lifestyle as the minimum now the only exception with the lifestyle would be you don't need to have a secure monthly income\nFor like travel expenses because your travel expenses you don't need to have that money coming in every month you just need to have access to the money when you're ready to take\nTake that that trip funny ... years ago I had a couple that had come in and we hit agreed in their first meeting that they said they needed twenty five thousand from their assets okay great I put together a plan I come back to the next meeting and I said well you know our our numbers changed a little bit\nUm I said well All right so instead of twenty five ... what do we need to bumped up to and they said sixty thousand [laughter] and I was like well wait a minute how did we get from twenty five to six so so one of the points was that he had four thousand for Gulf trip with his buddies every year\nAnd she wanted twelve thousand for travel for the two of them\nAnd and so I said well first let's take the travel out of the budget she above jumped out of her chair magazine that really is really kind of product and she was no you can't take the travel out of my budget as well let me explain why we're taking out the monthly budget\nI said let's say march comes along and you decide you want to go on your trip but you've only receive three months so if you're a twelve thousand dollars\nCan you pay for your trip\nWell the answer is no so it's not you don't want if you're going to spend twelve thousand for your trip you don't want a thousand a month to come in you just want to have access to twelve thousand when you're ready", "show_name": "Massey on Money", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "28"}
