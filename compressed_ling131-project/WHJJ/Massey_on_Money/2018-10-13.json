assets help you decide what you should maybe sell out of your portfolio and shift that to a different investment and they can help you build it but it absolutely is a different skill set\nTo ... assets to provide you with the with an income stream that you can be certain that you can rely on that will be there for the rest of your life so totally different skill sets so in my opinion is important to work\nWithin advisor that is specializing in the retirement income category and here ... associates say what we look at is\nAre are biased if you will were very clear about it is to preserve assets as best we can we can't\nCompletely do away with risk if you have money invested in the stock market so it's about mitigating that risk lowering that risk but\nStill getting a a

S. S. E. Y. Massey on money dot\nCom today Justin walking through a checklist that he's made seven items we need to be clear about to help determine if we are indeed getting the right financial advice for our own transition to retirement had yet to number five what is that that died um\nHomosexual we've touched on a little bit already you know you're following a written strategy is there a plan that's put in place that is well thought out those that's encompassing all the different retirement puzzle pieces that are out there\nThat also has some flexibility to adjust what might change in the future or if there are unforeseen circumstances\nNow I'm Talking about something that that sets out the details and the substance strategies you plan to implement\nTo get you to him for retirement while working towards your goals all along the way\nNo with this type of written strategy you can pull off the shelf will pull it up on the computer screen this is a compass that can keep you on the right path in terms of the approaches that you use to help grow preserve and spend down the retirement resources that you have those assets where your income is et cetera\nEssentially the pass I'm Talking about connects her retirement resources to your goals issue to answer all the big financial questions about your income about tax efficiency about managing your retirement accounts about your different types of insurance and what you should or maybe don't need to have\nAnd then it should also handle wealth transfer it should handle cash flow your cash reserves you know that's one item near the cash reserves so we see so many people that I think you're doing it wrong they only have five or ten thousand in the bank we feel that that's nowhere near enough\nFor cash reserves you know and it needs to be handled so all of those types of things are kind of tied up in a nice little package so that you know you can turn to say All right this is what we're doing and we know this is how things are going to unfold as we go forward this is how we're going to take our income as we move forward et cetera\nTo get you really do believe that having that actual formal strategy it makes a difference\nIt sure does and I mean it starts with all the analysis and that's that's a key point let's do the analysis let's determine what your risks level is and what your tolerance would be and then we build the playing around that\nAnd we have some interesting software now that\nI'm Will show us probabilities of you getting through your retirement years and we plug in what you currently have harass that's what your current level of expenses are what your income is going to change in the future we can plug all this them\nAnd we ask you what your life expectancy would be you know how well do you think you might live now I Know it's a weird question are you know the answer\nBut we try to get people to consider that they may live out to wage Ninety and then this software will run up to ten thousand different variations to determine the probability of view reaching life expectancy\nWith enough income and there's it's pretty cool and when we show people how we can just do some little tweaks to the investment strategy overall and ended up with a much different outcome\nIt's great to to watch their face and they see they look at go well so yeah so we've got a pretty good plan there because we have a high probability of success no if you don't have a high probability of success well then we need to get to work and try to figure out how to treat your plan\nTo get through to the higher probability\nGap we're talking about your tech less today verifying if we're getting good financial advice for transitioning to retirement what's the next item\nWell the six item on that checklist is to gauge whether you're getting skilled transparent service from the financial professional that you're working with\nThe way I see it financial professionals have to earn the right to advise shoe and guide you with your finances in your retirement\nWhen you and trust me with your finances I view that as an honor and privilege I Believe I earned the right to serve an advisor by treaty as I Would want myself to be treated and how I Want my finances to be treated with the most care\nWith transparency and honesty and integrity with all the skill resources and tools that we here at our from have at our disposal\nAnd for those folks that come in and meet with us and go to our proprietary process the mass yeah money retirement road map\nThey get a chance to look at all of this and decide for themselves if we fit the bill for them so that sounds of interest to you and you'd like to take advantage of our\nComplimentary offer for our complete process to do a full evaluation of first we start with your goals and do we think we can help you with the goals going forward\nAnd then we gather your statements we we do an in depth analysis we come back with the report we take you through the report and ... there's a ton of information in it\nWe make it simple and understandable and you will likely know more about your investments after that second meeting than you ever did at least that's the feedback that we get\nFrom our listeners when they come in and meet with us and go through our process and they can see where all too often they have way too much risk in their portfolio especially if they are in close proximity to retirement or worse if they're already in retirement\nBecause let's face it the market has been on an absolute wrong for the last like ten years so\nUm do category another ten years well theoretically it could but that that's kind of a gamble in my opinion to think that the market will continue to go up like it has been for the last ten years and we want to take some strategies and bring those to the table that will help preserve those assets that you've earned over the last ten years\nJets fund the client perspective what exactly does it mean to have transparency from your financial professional\nSo it's about our team you're amassing associates I being up front so you know exactly what we're recommending and how we're recommending it it's about us being transparent and leaving no mystery about how we're being compensated because we lay that all out for our listeners when they come in", "show_name": "Massey on Money", "year": "2018",
