because this is ultrasound not radiation\nRadio waves I'm Sorry maybe\nAround here we've got to be a different thing um I Know the effects exactly the same thing on and live on would be a similar

summer [noise]\n\n\nIsland I'm Russell Roberts news radio and I just want the and went on for seven FM here's what's happening yesterday was day seven of the Providence a school bus drivers to strike\nCity councilor John ... says he has a possible solutions and the contracts they all made reports say he's proposing that the city and the first student bus companies split the difference between what the company puts into the drivers four one K. accounts and what it would cost to fund a pension\nNow in bonds there are the interesting term now is called high yield I called up the new sexy term for the bond category of a higher paying bond I don't know\nCan be sexy Jeff\nWell well well here's a comparison would you rather call it high yield uh would you rather call it what it used to be called which is junk\nBond I got you know so when you look at those two will turn it is yeah you know how you ... much sexier I'd that and then the last of cost us treasuries and with the junk bonds and corporate bonds that's all part of the mix that we tried to bring to the table\nWe're just not trying to focus too heavily on the bonds were using pond alternatives as we have been for a couple of years because of the anticipation of the interest rate increases which we are now see so if you'd like to discuss your portfolio mix and your bland and if he was like\nYou have a steward stress tests on that portfolio so we can show you what might happen in the future as interest rates go up what would the impact being that portfolio or if there is another major market downturn what might that impact be on your portfolio\nIf you save two hundred thousand or more for your retirement our number of years for one three three three eight thousand easy to remember three three three eight thousand you're not calling a one eight hundred who knows where number you're talking to local people right here in the ... state of Rhode Island\nAnd you are right Cass Tech about an easy number to remember you've had that number a long time now yeah very long time\nFor one three three three eight thousand and the Web site if you'd like to learn a bit more about Jack and his team simply go too nasty and money dot com you mentioned you'd help people to take a look at their mix in their portfolio in your estimation jet what would an ideal next book like\nWell of course it is subjective to each a client that we're working with because everybody's situation is different you know I Know that might sound cliche to our listeners a little bit but\nEverybody really does have some little thing that is different from other people and so we always make sure that we Taylor what we do specifically to the couple that were working with or individual that we're working with the help them achieve their\nTheir financial goals for retirement so that makes it really depends on the overall goal we look at timeline we look at overall makeup of the financial portfolio\nAnd then how comfortable is the person we're working with with risk or you know the more conservative a more aggressive type uh we're all day relative to that final work day so to speak with a ... you know go through that door of retirement you know expecting your whole life change there at that point\nSo the closer you get to retirement just in general you want to become more and more conservative because at that point if you're within five years of retirement\nAnd that's just a general rule of thumb that I use if you're within five years of retirement you really need to dial down your risk so that you don't give up money either just before retirement or worse right after retirement when you have started to draw from that\nInvestment bucket if you will and because that is the worst thing that could happen we call that the sequence of returns\nI'm simply put if you retire and the market tanks and you're drawing from that investment you're making that value go down even faster and then you have less than that bucket to recover with when the market ultimately comes back in the future\nSo it's so important to circle the wagons around your money as you get closer to retirement to avoid any big drops in the market because that to me is the worst thing that can happen to you so there's a lot of different things that goes into building that portfolio what is most important is that\nYou have a manager that's that's actively managing your dollars so recently our team determined that in our portfolios we want it to reduce our duration an average of maturity that I had discussed a short time ago\nOn most or portfolios are average maturity was running just three to four years so that's a very short window well our team decided they wanted it even shorter so now our average maturity in our bombs in our portfolios is now just one and a quarter years\nAnd that drop was was handled with only thirty basis points of a lower dividend output which is impressive\nAnd that's why working with a very large money management firms like we do they their institutional money managers\nYou know they manage fifty five billion dollars directly another Thirteen plus billion under advisory which is where our from falls under they have they have a wonderful track record which we can share with you when you come we don't put that out over the air but\nThey do have a very good record working with their management style so we're very excited that we're we're hooked up with that management team\nSo if you have saved two hundred thousand or more for your retirement and you would like to have another professional opinion\nAs to what's going on with your current holdings and what might happen in the future based on either rising interest rates or what if the market were to drop substantially again like it has\nA you know a number of times in the past our number here is for one three three three eight thousand that's a local number because we are local I was born and raised

Andrew or is this is [noise]\nNews radio nine twenty and one oh four seven ...\nMaking the nearly ... years have you with us today more mass the\nOn money and I are discussing\nOf those and what is worrisome scenarios that could turn your retirement hopes and dreams upside down and we're getting new ways to help protect your retirement savings against\nThose what at what the next what if that might bring us some concern\nWell that would be what if Social Security benefits get reduced and the future you know that is not a very happy thought for anybody to think about wild Social Security's financial outlook\nHas certainly some uncertainty they're currently we can we predict it benefits may be lower than expected\nThe reduction in benefits can be contributed to what's called the worker to beneficiary ratio today which is only about three to one when compared to a ratio about Fifteen or sixteen to one\nIn the early years of the program the reason why we like to make the most of this benefit even if it turns out to be a little bit lower than expected is because it's guaranteed by the federal government and with that guaranteed income we liked it to cover as much of our essential expenses\nSo how do we maximize our benefits than\nKnow many American style retirement at age sixty two because it's the earliest stage they can start collecting Social Security benefit\nHowever this may not be the best course of action for everybody but you might be asking why not I want to enjoy my retirement as soon as possible well first Medicare the health coverage doesn't become available to until your age sixty five\nNow if you're one of the fortunate people that can work at sixty two and have your former employer pay that health care expense until sixty five well that's certainly in your favor but a lot of folks that don't have any health insurance\nYou know that could cause some eight nine hundred thousand dollars a month for each person until they sixty five well that's a big drawdown of assets that a lot of people really can't afford to do you know secondly\nYou know how much savings do you really have set aside to general expectation is to replace and this is all over the the board here American as you know to replace Seventy to Ninety percent of your annual pre retirement income with your own savings Andrew Social Security benefits\nYou know are you ready to do that for two decades maybe more you know it and those kind of weird measurement upsets his before that you know when I'm preparing to do a seminar I Will look at the obituaries and just count the number of people that are each Ninety or above\nAnd when I did that just recently there were six people that were over the age of Ninety the eldest was Ninety seven so as a society we are absolutely living longer so you don't want to have well we call an ostrich plan\nYou know sticking your head in the sand going up that's not going to happen to me I'll be okay you want to have a well thought out plan so that you can build\nSome income that you can be assured of that will last for the rest of your life can we are able to do that with certain insurance based products\nNow those assurances and guarantees are always backed up by the claims paying ability of that insurance company so we always want to work with solid a you know financially solid companies so do many people will take their benefit early most of us should probably consider waiting\nUntil your full retirement age which for most of us the sixty six\nIf you were born in Nineteen sixty year after its age sixty seven\nAnd if that makes sense for you and only the map will tell us that\nPotentially defer taking your benefit until late seventies now that does not work for everybody but it can be useful and helpful for some of the benefit of waiting beyond your full retirement age is that for each year that you do for you receive another eight percent\nSo if you end up if you're a full retirement age of sixty six you can get thirty two percent more money by waiting until eight Seventy now keep in mind you've left that benefit on the table for four years so you get a higher benefits sunny and Seventy ... there's a payback period for you to\nKind of catch up with the money you left on the table between eight sixty six in Seventy\nAnd that's why I say it's all about the math and we have the analysis tools that we do to show people what that might look like\nWell needless to say trying to determine what I refer to as a sweet spot for you and if you're married for you and your spouse on Social Security as to what makes the most sense for you our number here is for one three three three eight thousand if you have questions about upcoming decisions on Social Security\nIf you haven't started your benefits yet that's the best time to do it you can't undo your benefit if you haven't received twelve checks so maybe it's worth it even if you've been on it for just a short time\nTo see if maybe there was a better way of strategizing to ultimately put more money in your pocket between you and your spouse potential in our number here again is for one three three three eight thousand if you have questions about Social Security police costs will have one of our advisors chat with you to see if we might be able to help you\nGet let's say there is a gap and have rights are there other sources of guaranteed income that we can be considering\nYeah anytime that there's a gap between the income that you have coming in and your lifestyle expense you know it's important to try to fill that with some other form of guaranteed income so a very natural fit for that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Massey on Money", "city": "Providence", "day": "06"}
