toxins viruses whatever it could be a key component by improving those glue to sign on levels\nAre particularly for this am F that's causing polio like um symptoms are in these children that they haven't figured out you know in four years what to do autism that they haven't figured out what to do a out scientists they haven't figured out what to do\nThe glue to fly on helps to protect cells yeah and so by improving igloo just die on production again you can't just take Lou to tie on and they do\nYou have to improve the production of I'm glued to pry on and the rejected formulas I mean that's what they specifically do with the Emmy three so again interesting with this\nFood for thought yeah that's how we figured things I was just banter back\nAnd forth and uh sometimes something that makes sense and then you try it and they're very often it works\nA let's go again if you have questions get it in now one eight six six nine to zero nine four or five five and let's go to the phone lines go to line a two parent in Fall River Massachusetts\nI like just been diagnosed\nWith early stage Lyme disease they put me on Dr recycling and after two days of taking those pills or I got deathly sex so then they gave me a mock for someone thought that's what I'm On the ... times a day three weeks I'm also adding colloidal silver to that than anything else I can take you\nYou're going to make an appointment at the tree of life wellness center and seek on Massachusetts and I don't I don't\nI'm not working and I don't have any money for that\nWell I I Would definitely do oregano oil okay did the mock facility is not as active and I don't even know how effective it is for a long time the doctor you cycling definitely is you know I was\nAbout worrying up I was definitely sick I Am\nAbout where you can't take it I think you need to back that up with the oregano oil a capsule three times a day\n... the silver I think it was a good idea okay [noise] um are you having symptoms ups of lime\nYes I tend to line and then I uh well\nI they put gave me a test and I they called me and I've got early states ... what's what's the symptom uh always\nFeeling like you're you're going to throw up but you don't always a little nauseous always a little busy a feeling slowly all the time but you don't have the flu\nOr ... that I'm usually sharp as attacker\nSo I mean different people experience a wine or or attacked in different areas the body by line so they get different symptoms that doesn't apply to\nA head on and they said I've got it okay no I'm not saying that you don't I'm just saying how some people it attacks the heart some people attacks the brains some people attacked the joints so that was that's better\nFeel I have also have joint pain all over where I didn't before\nOkay um\nI dunno Peter and anything else you can think of besides the oregano and the solar ... yeah I mean it just kind of gets down to the individual\nI'm ...\nI Would probably look at taking the omega three six nine okay okay because that's anti inflammatory but it also helps the nervous system throughout the body All right and so I Would I Would\nYou can abs the if you absolutely can't do an appointment\nYou should at least walk in the door and talk to us for a few minutes about it okay we can get a little more precise okay All right thank you All right\nAnd uh we just tried to keep her appointments ... cost of his as possible yeah it's only a hundred and thirty nine dollars and I know that sound you know but that's for just for the first appointment and sitting down and talking to you for an hour hour and a half\nUm and then follow up appointments after that a sixty nine dollars as long as you come within a year of your last appointments so we we try to you know keeping ... most people can afford it so I understand you know some people are much more um [noise]\nA limited budget so ah but that's why we have the radio show and that's why people can can come down to our center and and talk to us as as much as we can make ourselves available we really try we we do a lot of free advice\nOn her ... daily way more than we should wait even more than anybody\nElse that has a practice I can tell you that yeah you don't have [laughter] you know most doctors don't give you the amount of time free that we do a two hour you know and then and that's you know we do it because we want people to get well\nUm we could be like everybody else and just say no gonna make an appointment that's the only way we're going to give you information um pending or we are ... you know this is what we tried to do to help the community be as healthy and well that's why I Do a blog and that's free or to get advice and to get information that the accurate\nBut you got to understand there are conditions that are complicated and you can't do that you're not doing the right thing with a complicated condition by going ahead try this try that\nIf it's because then it's hit or miss um we don't have all the information is you know I mean this is why people go to doctors\nIs so that the doctors can get all the information from the test results that down and figure out what is the best course of action because again not for nothing but you go to a medical doctor and I understand that I get the co pay and all that stuff but that's you know\nThat's a whole another story [laughter]\nBut typically all they are going to do is prescribe you Dr cycling yeah that's what they\nDo what they don't have anything else why do you need an appointment\nFor that why can't you just go and get tested and then yeah somebody just prescribes you you know doctors cycling why do you need to see a doctor for that that's what they do\nYeah\nI don't know [laughter] you don't mind going to the doctor and paying for that and every single person's going to get back to cycling yes\nAnd again if that doesn't work they give them something else but it's it's not like they sit down and go okay now we get a look at it as it attacking the hard as attacking the joints what can we do to support the joins what can we do to support the brain or you know not only let's kill off the line bacteria\nBut what else can we do to help repair and protect those areas that are being attacked by the line they don't do that they'll just go here but there's also make an appointment with that doctor and get that tiny little bit of advice that they gave me the every single person that comes in with the lime disease\nAnd get you know we do we do exceptionally well treating Lyme oh yeah really well but it is a very very complicated condition I tell patients right off the bat figure on a year of rigorous treatments a year and and\nYou know there's a lot of people who do get lime and they never have symptoms because they caught it so early that that the ... cycling killed it off they go and you're all set you're good to go but the people where you start having some symptoms and particularly the longer the symptoms have been going on\nThe ... trickier it is to alleviate those symptoms and get the body back on track\nThat's what's involved you know people who get you know they just got tested they got on taxes like clean and it's gone there you go you don't need to see us\nBut people who have complicated or cancer or autoimmune conditions that does not quick fixes for that you got a cold we can usually say do this do that\nUm but when you get the complicated we need more information and I'm I'm Sorry I Apologize to people that we can't give you a quick information but it it's not a good service for you to take a stab in the dark and saying oh just do that\nYeah it's not appropriate and we get a hey we get it all the time people walk into our office regularly and go so what do you go for cancer or in a foreign runs like\nReally you just want to walk into a store and ask what we got for cancer and whatever we hand you a bottle and you're just going to go home and take that and figure okay I'm treating cancer now I'm also I Would\nBe really concerned about anybody who did that only smoke if I walked into somewhere and said you know give me something for cancer and they said oh here they're you know\nI Would run and you get a question yeah yeah how much this person really no they're going to hand me a bottle that quickly with not knowing anything about me or my cancer or my treatment because we want to help you but we want to help you the right way yeah battle the bill\nAnd part of that is tuning in every Saturday every Saturday weekend and week out we're you should be to be promise not to let you next week [noise]\nDon't make promises [laughter] ah [laughter] do you speak for yourself go vote you know I promise I Will [laughter] feed them I thanks are

[noise]\n\nIsland view I'm Russell Roberts news radio nice wants to eat and will do for seven FM hears what's happening small game hunting season starts today available game include assessments rabbit squirrel Quil and Fox\nWow starting with a psychology here I'm Glad you talked about that I think you get overlooked some times it's a lot to consider Jeff where do you start\nYou know what happens to some people like us abruptly so I'm not in this client situation just came to mind that it's ... it's kind of it's got some humor to it\nUm she retired first about three years before he did and we go that all set up and then ultimately he came and took care of his retirement\nAnd then the next meaning I worked in so the conference room and I could just cut the tension with the nuts and I'm like whoa I Wonder what's going on here so I sat down and I said so what's going on\nAnd she just started you know what you know I Do this on Monday I Do this on Tuesday this was a there is some from Thursday and friday she said I've had my whole retirement plan\nAnd now he wants me to change all that because he's retired now you need to tell him that he has to get a part time job so you know a kind of look down I'm Sorry for enough so you need to get a part time job for twenty hours\nAnd then I turned her and I said obviously you need to work the other twenty hours because you've seen too much of ... each other and then you guys have to figure this out so then they kind of took the edge off a little bit but it was just so funny or the way it happened but the point is when you go into retirement\nPerhaps you should consider what's going to happen when your spouse retires later on and now you're going to adjust to make that transition easier for them\nSo you can't just be thinking about what your activities are because you know you've been married for decades so all of a sudden your spouse in it I think that's a good thing that he wanted to spend time with his wife as opposed to you know spending his day fishing or something you know that he wanted to be with her so I thought that was a good sign but anyway it worked out and\nThey they both had to adjust a little bit and it all worked out\nSo I'm familiar amassing associate think if you save two hundred thousand or more of your retirement give us a bus we'd love to have you in such a down see\nWho your goals are see what your interest the patience for your retirement Supreme might be able to provide some value helping you first determined where you are currently what your level of risk is currently especially if you were shaken up a little bit on that act Tobar ten drop you know and that week we had a big drop of eight hundred plus plus five hundred plus the next day\nI mean yeah the market has done some recovery sense but it's important to get a good handle as to what your level of risk is so the number here for a one three three three eight thousand\nYeah when we start piecing together our lifestyle goals in retirement how do we proceed\nWell then we start putting together or you know price tag many what financially will you need to support that lifestyle\nWhat are the expenses of those retirement goals some of your day to day expenses may decline or even disappear once you retire but you'll still have the essential to cover you know those for housing transportation food healthcare not just the mores but\nProperty taxes insurance or in a condo you've got home owner association fees and so on\nThen there are the the non essential you know what I called the fun stuff dining out\nTravel you know given the charities you know those things might actually go up at the beginning of your retirement the important thing is to understand what those expenses will be on a monthly basis especially those that cover the central so you can have a clear understanding\nWhere your retirement savings overall should amount to there is no magic number to save for retirement\nYou know so we can't go to the old magic eight ball like when we were kids\nIt's still not going to help you the general looks expectation and this is all over the board and I see lots of surveys\nNot sure that I really agree with it because that just have a different perspective general expectation is to replace Seventy to Ninety percent of your annual pre retirement income with your own savings and Social Security I met with the a couple recently that were very frugal\nVery well paid\nHad amassed a lot of money like over two million dollars they are telling me they had their whole spreadsheet that they spend three thousand dollars a month now there's to Social Security checks will cover that\nSo when you look at it I mean they're they're fine they will probably never outlived their money they do not need to replace\nTheir income to Seventy or Ninety percent so that when I say everybody situation is different that's just one simple example of someone had just met with recently\nSo that is why it's so important to come in if you save two hundred thousand or more for your retirement\nSit down with us let us see what your goals are then we'll do a deep analysis come back at the second meeting show you what we see and if there are opportunities for improvement will point that out we will also point out the good things that we see with what you've done the far\nAnd then you go from there\nAfter that second mini ... pretty much decide do you think we can help you or or not\nPretty simple there's no pressure for that is a complementary meeting process that we take you through and it is a a trademark process at the Massey on money retirement road map and you know we talked about that in the book that just came out a couple of months ago as well so our number here for a one three three

off in motion so what does this mean for you and your finances and most importantly your retirement David by a well known financial educator is here to make sense of what's happening on Wall

author of books including smart couples finished rich\nAnd smart women finished rich and today he's co founder of the aim wealth management one of America's fastest growing our eye gaze David wealth and we are thrilled to have you with us today\nLet's talk about that and eight hundred plus point drop or the Dow Jones we know that rarely happens due to just one event so set the stage for us here what sparked this sell off\nWell it's a handful of things first of all and so the question becomes a think's going on and I'll give you the first thing is that weight you're going and you even heard the president talk well let's break it down what does that mean when you hear\nRates are going up that Israel has actually been raising rates really\nTwo thousand and Fifteen but\nMost recently the fed raises rates on the money that they can land they called the Federal Reserve fund rate to tour of course happened in September and\nWhen those rates went up a couple of things happened first of all the costs to borrow money goes up right so you're going to borrow money for a home\nYou're going to refinance your home if you're gonna buy a car and you're gonna financed that car or you're going to use credit cards for that matter any where where you're borrowing money the cost to borrow that money is now going up and that's ...\n... spoke some market right because of your home maybe people will buy the buy less homes or they'll refinance or home last so they'll buy less cars or they'll shop less when it costs more to borrow money the markets can stoop to that consumers will slow down on their spending and so that's the first thing it's really been a story about\nThe fed and rates going up now we have to put down a little bit in the context because let's be honest rates have been really really really really low like you know we've had historically low rates for well over ten years and\nThose historically the rates which the fed put in place after our great recession\nWe're successful that's what got the economy going again and that's why we are right now enjoying what is the longest bull market in history so you have to put that in perspective um and they're all some other things are happening that are influencing the stock market which has as rates have gone up\nThe tenure treasury the rates have gone up on that right now and that's the highest rates we've seen on tenure treasuries and like seven years so that's also a very interesting thing that's happening and then there's the fact that the tech market hasn't ... let me see now we've seen a sell off in tech stocks\nParticularly tech stocks though\nI'm like Amazon and Facebook and that's not all related interest rates there's been some data breaches\nWith companies involved like Amazon a potentially data breach and Facebook had a recent data breach and so there's been some soften these tech stocks but again making putting that in perspective it's been a tech stocks have been driving the market higher company you know we call them saying companies like Facebook and\nAmazon and Netflix and Google use main tech companies have been absolutely on fire in terms of growing and they've been the stocks been driving the market hires the fact they pulled down a little bit um it's not that surprising and it was probably you know about time for\nUs to see tax Sox pull back and I think the third thing that we know is affecting the market is actually the global markets that the trade wars um all this talk of trade war with China\nIs having an impact and it's been really having an impact globally\nThe global markets have been really down compared to our market like the U.S economy has just been on fire we have been absolutely crushing it we've had the best stock market in the world um and so we you know us pulling back a little bit compared to what's happening abroad um there's really been\nA lot less like abroad the global markets been down emerging marked down and we've just been doing great so I think it was sort of time for the U.S markets maybe take a little bit of a pre there to an almost\nA recognized that things are slowing down globally partially because of the fear of these trade wars with China\nDavid I Want to go back to those rising rates I Know that they can still terrible for the overall economy but aren't higher interest rates are really good for retirees\nWill you know you're exactly right they are good for retirees especially retirees by the way who pay down their debt right which is\nSomething I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest way to to reach retirement early is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement and you and you don't have a mortgage payment you don't have a car loan and you're probably not using credit card or to borrow money if if you're doing one retirement than the good news about race going higher\nIs that the rates on your money market and your checking account and CDs and again treasuries are going higher and in most retirees live off of the income that their retirement money produces", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Massey on Money", "city": "Providence", "day": "20"}
