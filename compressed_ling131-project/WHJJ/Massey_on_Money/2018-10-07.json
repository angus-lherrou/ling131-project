the property right if it were me\nI I Would want to be able to leave my one third to my family mhm and and so tenants income and if you're going to own it this way is the way to go see why because if it's joint owners shift with the right of survivorship then when one sibling dies\nThat one third would automatically go to the other remaining siblings survival of the fittest as yeah and you would be dissing heritage and your spouse if you're married and or your children which you probably don't\nWant no likely not in the first issue and you know ... maybe you want to make sure that your share is protected from those long term care expenses well that's where the Erie vocal trust is going to step in\nBut you gotta make sure that your your evoke about trust is drafted properly\nFortunately

probably wouldn't own it\nOther than tenants and common I wouldn't even knowing it that way at least not the rental the rental I Would immediately jumped to the idea of owning an El Al see\nRight maybe not the ... property but the rental property why because if it's a rental property in three siblings own and then somebody gets hurt on that property they are going to sue three people\nOh I didn't even think of that and all of their own personal assets they\nHave families and yeah I Know they remember this isn't the siblings only asked this just just one of them they might have their own home their own IRAs their own four O. one K. is their own investment accounts bank accounts yeah\nThat's a problem mhm that's not a problem for the creditors that's a really deep pocket for the owner to share it is three deep pocket three deep pockets so putting it in an\nEl Al see would be my first thought and each of you guys could be a one third shareholder of the El Al see that way the liability won the lawsuit comes for the tennis they will sue the company and not you personally huge difference but\nThe the three of them as shareholders what if they are concerned about protecting from long term care could their individual ... be one of those shareholders so know moving\nPast the El Al see discussions Susan let's say again where would the shares of the yellow sea go the shares of the yellow sea would go into this irrevocably medical\nIt ... if that's\nIf that kind of planning right works for them right yeah I mean if you're self insured and you have enough of their assets you know you may not be doing\nA Medicaid euro vocal trust but you certainly would put those shares into a revolt couple family trust yes but let's let's assume you're right let's assume they they want to protect their assets not only from the creditor of the slip and fall tenant\nBut from the nursing home mhm well then this Medicaid irrevocably trust comes into play and report the shares in and they put all their other assets in ... into their own respective irrevocably trust so what does this do\nBack for the Senate and common idea it's still allows each family took control where their third of the property goes mhm not to the other siblings ... well that's good\nIt avoids probate also good it's going to help them reduced their probing or their estate tax liability if any also good\nAnd most importantly it will get the clock running so that if one of them get sick and go in a nursing home it will protect the assets from the nursing home\nWhy that's so important and you don't think about it as much when you're doing just your family planning mhm this actually impacts other families because if you don't do it the planning and one sibling goes into the nursing home\nThe other two siblings who are not in the nursing home yet\nThat asset that they own what the one third\nOwnership of the sibling who is in the nursing home is at risk for the nursing home right now we're going to now tell you\nSiblings that are are healthy by this out or lose it to ... now there's some sibling exceptions that can work here but in any event you are now jeopardized the other siblings ownership interest in the property and of course you've put at risk for your own\nUh children your own family as to losing it for them so yeah\nLots of issues when you own property like

how comfortable is a person were working with with risk or you know the more conservative a more aggressive type or we're on the relative to the final work day so to speak where they go through that door of retirement you know expecting your whole life change there at that point\nSo the closer you get to retirement just in general you want to become\nAre more conservative because at that point if you're say within five years of retirement\nAnd that's just a general rule of thumb that I use if you're within five years of retirement you really need to dial down your risk so that you don't give up money either just before retirement or worse right after retirement when you have started to draw from that\nInvestment bucket if you will and because that is the worst thing that could happen we call that the sequence of returns\nI'm simply put if you retire and the market tanks and you're drawing from that investment you're making that value go down even faster and then you have less than that bucket to recover with when the market ultimately comes back in the future\nSo it's so important to circle the wagons around your money as you get closer to retirement to avoid any big drops in the market because that to me is the worst thing that can happen to you so there's a lot of different things that goes into building that portfolio what is most important is that\nYou have a manager that's that's actively managing your dollars so recently our team determined that in our portfolios we wanted to reduce our duration an average of maturity that I had discussed the short time ago\nOn most or portfolios are average maturity was running just three to four years so that's a very short window well our team decided they wanted it even shorter so now our average maturity in our bonds and our portfolios is now just one and a quarter years\nAnd that drop was was hand but with only thirty basis points of a lower dividend output\nWhich is impressive and that's why working with a a very large money management firms like we do they their institutional money managers\nYou know they manage fifty five billion dollars directly another Thirteen plus billion under advisory which is where our from falls under\nThey have they have a wonderful track record which we can share with you when you come we don't put that out over the air but they do have a very good record working with their management style so we're very excited that we're we're hooked up with that management team\nSo if you have saved two hundred thousand or more for your retirement and you would like to have another professional opinion\nAs to what's going on with your current holdings and what might happen in the future based on either rising interest rates or what if the market were to drop

and we're getting new ways to help protect your retirement\nSavings against those what at what the next what if that bring us some concern\nWell that would be what if Social Security benefits get reduced and the future you know that is not a very happy thought for anybody to think about wild Social Security's financial outlook\nHas certainly some uncertainty they're currently we can we predict up benefits may be lower than expected\nThe reduction of benefits can be contributing to what's called the worker to beneficiary ratio today which is only about three to one when compared to a ratio about Fifteen or sixteen to one\nIn the early years of the program the reason why we like to make the most of this benefit even if it turns out to be a little bit lower than expected is because it's guaranteed by the federal government and with that guaranteed income we like it to cover as much of our essential expenses\nSo how do we maximize our benefits then\nYou know many American style retirement at age sixty two because it's the earliest stage they can start collecting Social Security benefit\nHowever this may not be the best course of action for everybody now you might be asking why not I want to enjoy my retirement as soon as possible well first Medicare the health coverage\nDoesn't become available to until your age sixty five now if you're one of the fortunate people that can leave work at sixty two and have your former employer pay that health care expense until sixty five well that's certainly in your favor but a lot of folks that don't have any health insurance\nYou know that could cause some eight nine hundred thousand dollars a month for each person until age sixty five well that's a big drawdown of assets that a lot of people really can't afford to do you know secondly\nYou know how much savings you really have set aside to general expectation is to replace and this is all over the ... as you know to replace Seventy to Ninety percent of your annual pre retirement income with your own savings into Social Security benefits\nYou know are you ready to do that for two decades maybe more you know it and those kind of weird measurement upsets his before that you know when I'm preparing to do a seminar I Will look at the obituaries and just count the number of people that are each Ninety or above\nAnd when I did that just recently there were six people that were over the age of Ninety the Elvis was Ninety seven so as a society we are absolutely living longer so you don't want to have well we call an ostrich ...\nYou know sticking your head in the sand going up that's not going to happen to me I'll be okay you want to have a well thought out plan so that you can build\nSome income that you can be assured of that will last for the rest of your life can we are able to do that with certain insurance based products\nNow those assurances and guarantees are always backed up by the claims paying ability of that insurance company so we always want to work with solid a you know financially solid companies so do many people will take their benefit early most of us should probably consider waiting\nUntil your full retirement age which for most was the sixty six\nIf you were born in Nineteen sixty year after its age sixty seven\nAnd it didn't make sense for you and only the map will tell us that\nPotentially defer taking your benefit until late seventies now that does not work for everybody but it can be useful and helpful for some of the benefit of waiting beyond your full retirement age is that for each year that you do for you receive another eight percent\nSo if you end up if you're a full retirement age of sixty six you can get thirty two percent more money by waiting until late seventies now keep in mind you've left that benefit on the table for four years so you get a higher benefit starting Seventy ... it does a payback period for you to\nKind of catch up with the money you left on the table between eight sixty six in Seventy\nAnd that's why I say it's all about the map and we have the analysis tools that we do to show people what that might look like\nWell needless to say trying to determine what I refer to as the sweet spot for you and if your marriage for you and your spouse on Social Security is what makes the most sense for you are a number of years for one three three three eight thousand if you have questions about upcoming decisions on Social Security\nIf you haven't started your benefits yet that's the best time to do it you can't undo your benefit if you haven't received twelve checks so maybe it's worth it even if you've been on a purchase a short time\nTo see if maybe there was a better way of strategizing to ultimately put more money in your pocket between you and your spouse potential in our number here against for one three three three eight thousand if you have questions about Social Security police costs will have one of our advisors chat with you to see if we might be able to help you\nGet let's say there is a gap in coverage are there other sources of guaranteed income that we can be considering\nAnytime that there's a gap between the income that you have coming in and your lifestyle", "show_name": "Massey on Money", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "07"}
