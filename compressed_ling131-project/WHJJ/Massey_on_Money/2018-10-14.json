answer on the air\nTodd the next paragraph I Want to talk about looks like it's from the results of a fair hearing just from February twenty team and it's entitled the right to potential future income what is that about [noise]\nOh yeah this this is a very uh this is a very complicated one to talk about and it it really deals with I like to put you on the spot there it's not that we can explain that it's just that it becomes a very complicated one for for a radio\nOr it deals with a paragraph\nThat talks about you know paying out money to like for a trustee who is serving as trustee oh on there and and if you're going to continue to serve as trusting where if you're a now unable to serve as trustee mhm right should they be able to project forward\nThe ability say well look your life expectancy is ex even though you can serve here's the amount of money that you could have earned\nGoing forward you can't do that okay you can't project forward and their statutory regulations\nThat prevent you from projecting forward you know just say look it's now an impossibility to serve as trustee because you are in the nursing home you created the trust and you're not competent anymore so it's just an impossibility and therefore you can't project forward\nThey try to project backwards but while you were serving they could say what what you have received yeah and this amount would be considered counting all somewhat it turns out to be a small amount of money at the end of the day anyway mhm\nDon't worry so much about the fact that maybe you did serve as trustee so you figure out what the amount is and you you would pay it out in a small\nAnd a lot of clients out there Todd they're concerned that their kids are going to be put out if they're serving as trustee there kids actually can be compensated as because they are serving as trustee correct\n[noise] Oh yes absolutely so that's what we normally do we have the kid service trust and they are entitled to get compensation folks don't get jump up and down about this one either I can tell you that most of them don't take it no right why would they take it number one it's just money that's coming out of one pocket going into another pocket they usually don't take it\nAnd real quickly before we stopped Todd for the for the show there's information in here about an issue with having clauses about the right to pay the donors estate taxes and kind of final costs in here so in Asia that are there in\nThe right one right so you\nKnow I I don't want any paragraph in a trust that deals with the ability to pay debts ... of the ... or like there's one that this this one said oh we can pay all the debts of your last illness and ah you know funeral costs in a state of Minnesota ration cost while\nThe court came back and said in this particular case well\nDebts of your last illness you're alive that could be a nursing home cost right right and so if a nursing home cost has a debt that we're allowed to use principle to pay that debt\nThan to me I see that clear connection of money in the trust principal and the trust being used to pay a nursing home 'cause that could be my last illness mhm which is in a nursing home right so we don't want powers and the trust that allow the payment of debts of the ... hour\nPeriod and then our trust we actually as I said earlier we prohibit the trust from lending money\nTo the donor or absolutely not allowed\nAnd you know what folks taught is included sixteen have these problematic clauses that should not be included in your trust\nHow are you supposed to know what should and should not be there refer to Todd's guy he is our subject matter expert this is a comprehensive guy that shows you what must end what must not be included in that ... trust so

years in Turkey\nIn to sell you something or puts you into an investment where they get paid a lot it's all about what is best for you and I'll give you a simple example a stockbroker if you tell them you want to grow a portfolio and you're younger\nI mean that loophole is so wide you could drive a tractor trailer through that and they can sell you pretty much any kind of a stock\nBecause you said he wants to grow your portfolio now for do share advisor if questioned or challenge or especially if the regulators come in and say OK Geoff why did you recommend that for this client\nI have to be able to document why I felt in my professional opinion that it was in their best interest for that particular position that investment whether\nIt's a stock you know a mutual fund the exchange rate from whatever it might be was it the best one that I've got available\nFor that client so this is a huge difference\nWhether it's produced Sherry or the other standard is just called the suit abilities standard and that in my opinion is very weak\nI Believe that anybody handling your money should be a fiduciary they should be working in your best interests and our number here is for one three three three eight thousand if you save two hundred thousand or more for your retirement\nWe'd love to have you come in for an opportunity conversation to see if we might be able to provide some service so you and your family\nWe have a proprietary process that will take you through and part of it is first meeting is really just to discover what's important to you what your goals are\nAnd then we move into the analysis phase where our team gets together and puts\nMany hours into the analysis of what you currently hold for your investments\nAnd then we come back and report that you know there was a complex report\nWe make it extremely simple and easy to understand so that you will have a clear understanding where you are today\nIt's our opinion here amassing associates that you need to know where you are now before you can make some decisions about moving forward with your investments in your portfolio so again if you've save two hundred thousand for your retirement or nobody hears for one three three three eight thousand\nAnd the website if you'd like to find out more about Jeff and his team and go to ... and money dot com nasty as styled N. A. S. S. E. Y. that's nasty and money dot com\nAnd yet the first item on the checklist to determine if we're getting good financial advisor retirement is to find out if the advice or you're working with is required to put the best interest of you first and the client\nShould we ask more from our financial professionals jets other than upholding that I Do share a standard\nYou know absolutely which brings me to the second one that I'm On my checklist which is to determine if that financial professionals currently providing you with the advice has the skill set and the know how to help guide you financially\nNot only two but through and into the next phase of life called retirement and now we think it's very important and it's a different skill set\nFor an advisor to help you accumulate your assets help you decide what you should maybe sell out of your portfolio and shift that to a different investment and they can help you build it but it absolutely is a different skill set\nTo ... assets to provide you with the with an income stream that you can be certain that you can rely on that will be there for the rest of your life so totally different skill sets so in my opinion it's important to work\nWith an advisor that is specializing in the retirement income category and here amassing associate sick but we look at is\nAre are biased if you will were very clear about it is to preserve assets as best we can we can't\nCompletely do away with risk if you have money invested in the stock market so it's about mitigating that risk lowering that risk but still getting um a reasonable return on your portfolio\nAnd then create that income that you can rely on for the rest of your life when surveys of done\nOutliving income or outliving assets is the number one concern of people that are getting to work in retirement already so that is so focused to help provide hopefully some peace of mind in that area where people can look at that\nAnd feel confident that that we've got to laid out for them in a manner that they understand that they get it will be there\nAs long as they're here which is important part of income planning in my opinion\nSo if you're concerned about your asset base and whether or not you can generate that income that you can rely on for the rest of your life and if you have save two hundred thousand or more of your retirement our number here in Madison associate think his four oh one three three three eight thousand\n... for a visit let's meet let us see if we might be able to to provide some value to you and your family moving forward and

getting is actually on the mark that it's appropriate for you guest taking a serious\nHeck lists that seven items to consider when you're making that determination had yeah what's the third item on that checklist\nAll the third item on my list has to do with the lens through which a financial professional looks at their work\nWith retirement approaching you need to gain the shore and say your financial professional is looking at the entire retirement puzzle not just one piece of it\nI firmly believe that at least in most cases pre retirees and retirees too for that matter need someone with the knowledge and experience to understand how all the various pieces of your financial life it together\nAnd to actually put together a coordinated comprehensive financial strategy that incorporates all of those different puzzle pieces\nNow that's something not all financial professionals are qualified or prepare to do\nKnow some have a narrow focus maybe they're sweet spot is more insurance but they don't look at the investment side of things or maybe their focus on just investments but can't really offer much help with the insurance side of things you want to avoid situations where you're getting advice about a certain aspect of retirement\nOf so called certifications out there but I'll be accredited do they really have some meat behind them for instance I Know there are other people on the radio that out that their Social Security certified\nOkay took them one day of training and now they say they're certified well you know so unfortunate that people look at that say oh well they're certified they must be good no what's behind that certification because it's important to know what it took to get that\nAnd the boy you have to do is pay a fee and spend one day now how anybody can be an expert in any field\nIn the financial world in just eight hours is beyond me especially when you look at Social Security\nNo there are more of them six hundred different versions of

A. S. S. E. Y. Massey on money dot com\nToday Justin walking us through a checklist that he's made a seven items we need to be clear about to help determine if we are indeed getting the right financial advice for our own transition to retirement and yet we're up to number five what is that at the item\nOn the sex when we've touched on a little bit already you know you're following all of a written strategy is there a plan that's put in place that is well thought out those that's encompassing all the different retirement puzzle pieces that are out there\nThat also has some flexibility to adjust what might change in the future or if there are unforeseen circumstances\nNow I'm Talking about something that that sets out the details of missteps and strategies a new plan to implement\nTo get you to until retirement while working towards your goals all along the way\nNo with this type of written strategies can pull off the shelf will pull it up on the computer screen this is a compass that can keep you on the right path in terms of the approaches that you use to help grow preserve and spend down the retirement resources that you have those assets where your income is et cetera\nEssentially the pass I'm Talking about connection or retirement resources to your goals it should answer all the big financial questions about your income about tax efficiency about managing your retirement accounts about your different types of insurance and what you should or maybe don't need to have\nAnd then it should also handle wealth transfer it should handle cash flow your cash reserves you know that's one item near the cash reserves so we see so many people that I think you're doing it wrong they only have five or ten thousand in the bank we feel that that's nowhere near enough\nFor cash reserves you know and it needs to be handled so all of those types of things are kind of tied up in a nice little package so that you know you can turn to and say All right this is what we're doing and we know this is how things are going to unfold as we go forward this is how we're going to take our income as we move forward et cetera\nTo get you really do believe that having that actual formal strategy it makes a difference\nSure does and I mean it starts with all the analysis and that's that's a key point let's do the analysis lips determine what your risks level is and what your tolerance would be and then we build the playing around that\nAnd we have some interesting software now that\nI'm Will show us probabilities of you getting through your retirement years and we plug in what you currently have harass that's what your current level of expenses are what your income is it going to change in the future we can plug all this them\nAnd we ask you what your life expectancy would be you know how well do you think you might live now I Know it's a weird question are you know the answer but we try to get people to consider that they may live up to age Ninety and then this software\nWill run up to ten thousand different variations to determine the probability of view reaching life expectancy\nWith enough income and there's it's pretty cool and when we show people how we can just do some little tweaks to the investment strategy overall and end up with a much different outcome it's great to to watch their face and they see they look at go out so yeah so we've got a pretty good plan there because we have a high ...\nWhat do you have success no if you don't have a high probability of success well then we need to get to work and try to figure out how to tweak your plan to get you to that higher probability\nGap we're talking about your cat class today verifying if we're getting good financial advice for transitioning to retirement what's the next item\nWell the six item on that checklist is to gauge whether you're getting skilled transparent service from the financial professional that you're working with\nThe way I see it financial professionals have to earn the right to advise shoe and guide you with your finances in your retirement\nWhen you and trust me with your finances I Do that as an honor and privilege I Believe I earned the right to serve an advisor by treaty as I Would want myself to be treated\nAnd how I Want my finances to be treated with the most care with transparency and honesty and integrity with all the skill resources and tools that we here at our from have at our disposal\nAnd for those folks that come in and meet with us and go through our proprietary process the mass yeah money retirement road map\nThey get a chance to look at all of this and decide for themselves if we fit the bill for them so that sounds of interest to you and you'd like to take advantage of our", "show_name": "Massey on Money", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "14"}
