procedure she would've gotten would have been maybe Fifteen Percent well that's not enough to buy another house now and five or six hundred thousand dollars so\nThey sell the house and then lo and behold unbeknownst to her son decides to say you know what I'm not giving it back to money wow well she doesn't have to right that's a big problem\nAnd so this is why I don't want you to ever give the house to the children and ask for that permission and so then a little bit longer goes on and she says well you listen I Can't have this um a aggravated I'm going to file a lawsuit against my children oh my goodness oh yeah so she does\nAnd you know what folks before we go any further let this be a lesson to you\nDon't let this be your real life story gets your planning done get it done in advance if you've been wondering how these ... trust operate if you're concerned about protecting those assets\nTodd's guide that he has written for the month of October it's designing any income only ... trust it gives you the guidelines of what needs to be in your trust what must not be in your trust\nPage eleven shows how you can sell your home after it's in this trust without asking the permission of your children\nPage fourteen shows how you can change your beneficiaries\nInstead of filing lawsuits she could've just change her beneficiaries at her well ... if she uses these trust call right now for your free copy of Todd's new guide eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine you can also download a copy on our website legal exchange show dot com okay\nWell now we've got a lawsuit filed suing [noise]\nYeah the the one that was three than out all three has got a ... attack I guess she's suing technically the child who won't get will and won't give back the money\nUm and so you're right that was a great analysis Susan that you made whereas if it was in the trust not only would you not to even give permission to sell your not need to ask for permission to get the money back\nAnd you could change beneficiaries anytime you want your out none of these problems whatever they existed had done the euro vocal trust okay so she filed a lawsuit and\nThey're waiting now her argument is that she never really gave away the property and there was really some kind of a construct of trust that was formed I Love it\nAnd and so this is the arguments that she makes and the court proceedings go on and she dies\nBefore the answer so she dies before the answers so that's why the kids the two daughters are in the meeting with me she dies before the answer then the answer comes and guess what she won\nYeah so the money was forced to come out of the escrow account and the judge ordered the return of the money and so now the money did get put back into her account because it was as if she didn't give it away and so all the other money all the proceeds now is back in her state ...\nSounds like a win because she really didn't obviously she well she was going through the the that the law suits you changed your will and made sure she'd just inherited that yeah the sun so she really didn't want to son to get even one third of the proceeds\nSuccessful you think but\nIt turns out also that she never went to the nursing home so there was no worry about Medicaid leans from the nursing home except she was on the community mass health for a very very long time to the tune of about two hundred and Twenty one thousand dollars a long time\nSo during her life community mass health had paid and now there's a lean on her state\nFor the two hundred and Twenty one thousand dollars of mass health claims that she fought so hard to have this asset put back in her name because she died in ... and her name yeah bullshit find like al ... the argument was you\nKnow now with her and her name yeah I Am so because it's in her name now there's a lean on the property and they're wondering can I\nDo anything now yeah I don't think so\nRight cause it's cash you won't even be able to negotiate a settlement because that's all they're right and they're going to say just take it and this is where as state recovery comes in and takes the money whereas had\nThey left it the way it was with this life estate arrangement at least worst case scenario the sun would have got one third of the proceeds the two daughters would have gotten their one third each\nAt least and that would have been no probate assets so there would have been no eh state recovery and so mass health would not have been paid you cannot even make this I'm telling you this is one of the top ten\nYou must have been salivating in that way how\nTo use this real life story I mean I feel bad for the people that's not the the point and I explained it I'm going to do this just to help other people not necessarily give away the property and reserve life a state\nThis is a real life situation right don't do that if you really want to reserve life estate cars you liked that feeling then put the remainder interest in one of these irrevocably trust and move forward ... in that way you won't have any of these\nProblems you know what folks don't be Todd's next real life story educate yourself get your plan in place you need to have an ironclad estate planned and this guy will show you what must be in your trust and sixteen\nDifferent trust provisions that absolutely must not\nBe in your trust it will also show you how these operate on a day to day basis because when you hear the word ... it is not as scary as it

desperate measures at Mexico's border with Guatemala we're about two thousand migrants defied police orders yesterday to turn back\nHe came in and took care of his retirement and then the next meaning I walked into the conference room and I could just cut the tension with the nuts and I'm like whoa I Wonder what's going on here so I sat down and I said so what's going on\nAnd she just started you know well you know I Do this on Monday I Do this on Tuesday this was a this I'm from Thursday and friday she said I had my whole retirement plan\nAnd now he wants me to change all that because he's retired now you need to tell him that he has to get a part time job\nSo you know I kind of looked outside for enough so you need to get a part time job for twenty hours a week and then they turn ... obviously you need to work the other twenty hours because you've seen too much of each other and then you guys have to figure this out so then they kind of took the edge off a little bit\nBut it was just so funny or the way it happened but the point is when you go into retirement\nPerhaps you should consider what's going to happen when your spouse retires later on and now you're going to adjust to make that transition easier for them\nSo you can't just be thinking about what your activities are because you know he's been married for decades so all of a sudden your spouse and I think that's a good thing\nThat he wanted to spend time with his wife as opposed to you know spending his day fishing or something you know that he wanted to be with her so I thought that was a good sign but anyway it worked out and\nThey they both had to adjust a little bit and it all worked out\nSo I'm familiar with ... associates I think if you save two hundred thousand or more of your retirement give us a bus we'd love to have you in such a down see\nSee what your goals are see what your interests are patients for your retirement see if we might be able to provide some value helping you first determined where you are currently what your level of risk is currently especially if you were shaken up a little bit on that act over ten drop you know in that week\nWe had a big drop of eight hundred plus plus five hundred plus the next day\nI mean yeah the market has done some recovery sense but it's important to get a good handle as to what's your level of risk is so the number here for a one three three three eight thousand\n... once we start piecing together our lifestyle golden retirement how do we proceed\nWell let me start putting the other you know price tag\nMany what financially will you need to support that lifestyle what are the expenses of those retirement goals some of your day to day expenses may decline or even disappear once you retire but you'll still have the essential to cover you know those were housing transportation food health care not just the mores but\nProperty taxes insurance\nFor in a condo you'd go home owner association fees and so on\nThen there are the the non essential you know what I called the fun stuff dining out\nTravel you know given the charities you know those things might actually go up at the beginning of your retirement the important thing is to understand what those expenses will be on a monthly basis especially those that cover the essentials so you can have a clear understanding\nWhere your retirement savings overall should amount to there is no magic number to save for retirement\nYou know so we can't go to the old magic eight ball like when we were a kid\nIt's still not going to help you the general looks expectation and this is all over the board and I see lots of surveys not sure that I really agree with it because I just have a different perspective general expectation is to replace Seventy to Ninety percent\nOf your annual pre retirement income with your own savings and Social Security I met with the a couple recently that were very frugal\nVery well paid had amassed a lot of money like over two million dollars they are telling me and they had their whole spreadsheet that they spend three thousand dollars a month you know there's two Social Security checks will cover that so when you look at it\nI mean they're they're fine they will probably never outlived their money they do not need to replace their income to Seventy or Ninety percent so that when I say everybody situation is different that's just one simple example of someone who had just met with recently\nSo that is why it's so important to come in if you save two hundred thousand or more for your retirement\nSit down with us let us see what your goals are then we'll do it deep analysis come back at the second meeting show you what we see and if there are opportunities for improvement will point that out we will also point out the good things that we see with what you've done the far\nAnd then you go from there\nAfter that ... ... pretty much decide do you think we can help you or or not\nPretty simple does no pressure for that it has a complementary meeting process that we take you through and it is a a trademark process at the Massey on money retirement road map and you know we talked about that in the book that just came out a couple of months ago as well so our number here for a one three three three eight thousand we look forward to your call\nComing up a little later in our program what does this month's drop on Wall street mean for you and your retirement we asked David by one of America's favorite financial educator and he weighs in on that\nComing up and we do know saving money is one thing\nElse can you do for the hair of retirement continue the discussion [noise]\nIt used to be easy to create a retirement strategy worked forty years money to live off that money for a few years

women finished rich or the automatic millionaire he tells us why that drop on Wall street happened earlier this month and what you can do\nTo secure your retirement your chair at ... after we decipher some of our retirement lifestyle though you were telling us about that the psychological part of retirement\nAnd you really look in and you focus on related costs seven\nYour lifestyle is going to require why it's helpful when we're trying to determine our retirement date kept\nHim before I answer the question I just wanted to mention that you know I had the pleasure of meeting David Baake a couple of different times and one was just a few weeks ago and he's just a super guy and you know I was able to have a a photo or take him with him because we do plan on working\nIn one and a quarter years on average now that will allow our investment\nTo reposition the money each month as bonds mature overtime so they can keep up with the rising interest rates and get higher performing bombs every year and a quarter or so and they'd go settle structure so it's lettered\nNow that's a simple thing but that is something that had to be done differently than twenty Thirty years ago because then you wanted a bond and he wanted the long term bar because you wanted to keep the interest rate\nFor a longer period of time while the interesting market declined will now is backwards so you have to think of a different way\nAnd that's just one of the things we do in our financial team does and our financial team through a wealth management is sterling capital now they manage directly over fifty five billion dollars worth of money and they have another\nThirteen billion or so under advisory and that's where he will management comes and were part of the Thirteen billions of about half of that as my numbers are correct\nSo we have a very big team was forty four certified song analysts on the team they're incredible brain power that run the various portfolios that we have\nSo I don't wanna use I probably shouldn't even get the details about it but it's important to understand but you're working with an advisor that has a huge support team behind them as we do so if that's important to you our number here is ... three three three thousand\nIf you save two hundred thousand more of your retirement we look forward to your call we'll have you come in for a visit to do a proprietary process kind of pull back the curtain give you a look at what's going on with your current holdings\nIn detail form but we do make it simple so you don't have to be nervous about that

with him an armed camp this market drop\nYou know we thought pretty sharp decline in Wall Street back on October tenth but what does that really mean for you if you're headed toward retirement we asked David what caused the drop and what it means for you and your retirement your last listener [noise]\nOctober tenth saw the worst day for the Dow since\nFebruary a big drop in popular tech stocks put an impact will sell off in motion so what does this mean for you and your finances\nAnd most importantly your retirement David by a well known financial educator is here to make sense of what's happening on Wall street and David been featured on Fox CBS\nCNBC the today show and Oprah David been out there teaching America about money for more than two decades he's at nine time New York times best selling author of books including smart couples finish rich\nAnd smart women finished rich and today he's co founder of Eighteen wealth management one of America's fastest growing our eye gaze David wealth and we are thrilled to have you with us today\n... show so let's talk about that and eight hundred plus point drop or the Dow Jones we know that rarely happens due to just one event so set the stage for us here what sparked a sell off\n... well it's a handful of things first of all and so the question becomes all their ... going on and I'll give him\nThe first thing is that rates are going and you even heard the president talked about this well let's break it down what does that mean when you hear rates are going up and that is raising rates actually been raising rates really but\nMost recently the fed raises rates on the money that they can lead they call their wars are fun to go to court happening\nAnd when those rates went up a couple of things happened first of all the cost of our money goes right so you're going to borrow money for\nIf you're going to refinance or if you're going to buy a car you're going to finance that car or you're going to use credit cards for that matter any where where's your or owing money the cost to borrow that money you know going on and that's\nAll folks market right because if you're well maybe people will buy to buy less home they'll refinance or last show they'll buy less cars are those shocked when it costs more to borrow money the markets which Boop to consumers will slow down on their spending and so that's the first thing it's really been a story about\nThe fed and rate going up now we have to put down a little bit in the context because let's be honest rates have been really really really low like you know we've had historically low rates well over ten years and those historic ... had put in place after our great recession\nWe're successful that's what got the economy going again and that's why we are right now enjoying what is the longest bull market in history so you have to put that in perspective I'm enrolled some other things are happening that are influencing the stock market which is as rates have gone up the can your treasury\nThe rates have gone up on that right now and that's the highest rates we've seen on your treasury unlike seven years so that's also very interesting [laughter] and then there's the fact that attack marketed as a way like it's right let me see we still often tech stocks particularly tech stocks though\nLike Amazon and Facebook and that's not all related interest rates there's been some data breach\nWith companies involved like Amazon potentially data breach and they spoke at a recent data breach so to soften the X. box but again making putting that in perspective\nIt's been the tech stocks have been driving the market hire\nCompanies you know we call him saying companies like Facebook and Amazon and Netflix and Google main tech companies have been actually on fire in terms of growing and they've been stocks driving the market the fact they pulled down a little bit I'm not that surprising it was probably about time", "year": "2018", "show_name":
