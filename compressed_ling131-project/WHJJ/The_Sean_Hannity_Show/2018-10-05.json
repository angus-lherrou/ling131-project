T. E. or a hallway device in just down the line and they all said nope nope nope no absolutely not\n[noise] and now we have a new company to add to the mix here by the way how far away as he does he he makes a cell phones and there was even a Porsche at some of the PX or some of the the the military exchanges\nWhere some of these phones ah Huawei or Z. T. as I'm as a woman who's being sold there was a move to get those phones out of the bases out of the exchanges\nSo uh they weren't sold to military officers are enlisted a at the naval exchanges are military ... the PX is a a around the country and and or even overseas\nBut in this story from Bloomberg is just really amazing and it has to do\nWith a mother board specialist called super micro and the details here are are really just rebutting so the Bloomberg reports that this us based server mother board company\nCalled super micro was apparently\nInfiltrated in China with some of these boards so while I was a U.S base these mother boards were being produced in shoulder\nAnd you had government spy can make the groups that was able to interject interfere infiltrate the manufacturing process of these mother boards\nAnd put a tiny little chip in to the circuit in to the mother board I mean this is this you can't just do this overnight to Santa ... you know and then had to be engineering here and and the ability to do this so they infiltrated the supply chain of super micro\nAnd the Chinese production facilities and his little Biddy chip was being put on to these uh these boards these mother boards for the service now the ship they said was the size of a grain of rice or a pencil tip\nAnd those mother boards ended up in servers here in the United states so with that the Bloomberg report says that the Chinese military spy agencies government they were able to have an access point\nIn two companies systems that had the servers and they were able to potentially steal intellectual property anything confidential\nI mean there's just shows the extent that the Chinese will go\nTo steal from us\nThey are decades ahead that's why they did ban so quickly or a technology wise military wise because they rip the world off they didn't do it on their own they stole the Chinese\nGovernment they are the haves and have stolen I'm sure hundreds and hundreds of billions in intellectual property and this is just another example\nOf having a tiny little Biddy chip the size of a of a grain of rice or a pencil tip installed on these mother boards for servers and then being used in here in the United states and around the world and in major corporations\nWow a self doorway that would allow these China operatives to control these devices or have a back door to get whatever information they wanted\nSo once the program with these little chance once this was discovered our government we spied on the spies\nThat were behind the placement of chips\nThat's how this thing you know started to unravel a the story also talks about the chimps\nAre were discovered and reported to our fans to the FBI by Amazon and this is also and then we'll we'll wrap it up and grab some calls you so Amazon Amazon dot com they're the ones that initially\nHad discovered that a whole bunch of their servers or compromise with these chips and the way the thing was found out this is incredible and ... and the reason why this is important is because Amazon it's not just ordering crap on line that shows up at a prime box and your doorstep\nIn two days it's not just Amazon also provides\nA they have these data centers and they they supply a cloud computing storage\nFor a major corporations for the federal government our agencies are using Amazon so Amazon discovered they had an Amazon figure it out and this is what I also to me it's fascinating so Amazon\nThey alerted the FBI why because\nAmazon was looking to acquire a streaming video company so Amazon with all of their uh expansion into streaming video\nThey were looking at a company called elemental technologies\nAs a possible acquisition because Amazon was expanding obviously it's streaming video services and Amazon Prime video et cetera so\nElemental as national security contracts one of the main reason for the proposed accusation because of this nice fit Amazon's governmental business and just their their technology et cetera\nAnd you know the the the clown in the Amazon Services uh and uh it it ... says to help with due diligence or\nAmazon or a W s which was overseeing the perspective acquisition hired a third party company to scrutinize elemental security\nAnd a mental\nApparently on this elemental they're based in Portland, Oregon in Oregon they had some special software for ... pressing huge video files they help stream the Olympic Games online so that's part of on multiple levels why Amazon fault that acquiring this elemental might have been a very good fit\nSo here's what happened\nWith due diligence or Amazon hired a third party to look at this elemental company security\nAccording to one person familiar with the process according to the Bloomberg report the first pass uncovered troubling issue is prompting eight of us to take a closer look an elemental main product the expense of servers that customers installed in their networks to handle this video

C. to express your thoughts as an Alaskan voter that you want her to vote yes have you called her offices\nYes I Am in the tragedy but uh there was no answer a micro through anyway\nWhich office did you call you call her last officer did you call the Washington office\nI called the ... to do she offers\nMaybe try calling her last office now\nYeah I'll I'll probably do that or or hang up but uh anyway I you know she's up for elections you're in a couple of years\n[noise] [noise] yeah and less than I Would I Would stress for all of our listeners right now listening in Alaska or out of Anchorage and I I was I visited a the facility and I I had lunch with a bunch of the sales\nOh since I was up in Alaska York a couple of summers ago and I stopped through Anchorage and I met the team of my local affiliate in Anchorage a great folks and uh I uh I\nI think is is it all the listeners all of those listening right now the wand Kavanaugh confirmed\nYou need to call Murkowski's officers so try the Washington are all online just look up or Lisa Murkowski contact information or Senate offices you'll get you'll get her Alaska offices and you'll get the the number for D.C office and call up tell them your constituents\nAnd they'll ask for some details some data\nAnd uh you know though that as probably for your name address and tell them you want Lisa Murkowski to vote yes on Kavanaugh so I'll make sure your your call when you hang up with me okay\nI sure will basically lack\nI appreciate it and just a little more before I go back to falls you're just a little more background\nOn Murkowski and this is where things get a little complicated because remember Murkowski was a writer she defeated the odds after she had\nHad you know was primary and she lost you know then there was a write in campaign and Murkowski one and a lot of that was at the hands of a lot of native Alaskans now\nI don't know if that counts is ever going to get to a yes\nHer native Alaskan and Native American constituents are not fans of Kavanaugh\nAnd many have been vocal about it you know the rates of of sexual violence against women are higher in Alaska than any other state in the country most of the victims are Native American and Alaska Native women\nNearly half experienced sexual violence a nearly one third experience rape or attempted rape\nAnd that's much much higher than the national average is so that's one problem now those issues exist but it is unfair and here here's here's an asterisk here's the caviar\nIs unfair to apply this smeared job to Kavanaugh to the plight\nOf women in Alaska that are facing these problems so it is just grossly negligent it's just unfair to just glom onto this democratic smear campaign to absolutely shred the name of Kavanaugh and to apply it\nUm but you know she came forward and and she came forward in a way that\nIf it were me standing in front of us in front of a group of people that I didn't know in that forum and I had to disclose some of the things that happened to me that weren't nearly as bad as what she was saying were bad enough\nI Would have trouble speaking I Would there would be tears I'm I don't even know that I could

that Susan Collins announcing I think one of the well I'm going to be honest I thought it was the most powerful speech in recent memory on the Senate floor that I've ever seen\nIt was Thoreau it was sober it was smart it was thought full it was comprehensive\nShe went through everything from judicial temperament and philosophy to her own belief system how she came to her decisions are constitutional view on the Supreme Court\nOn the role of advice and consent on the madness and the circus that has broken out in this country\nAnd um I I have I'm I'm frankly we never run an entire

happened in the last Eighteen days can't continue to happen in this country you cannot bludgeon people\nWithout any corroborating evidence the way judge Kavanaugh and his family have been bludgeoned you can have political differences and I've had my share with senator Collins over the years\nWhere I really realized today is I don't know her well\nShe doesn't do a lot of television she's not somebody I've interviewed a lot like the most impressive thing that I took away from this is the seriousness the intellect\nThe the systematic be she walked every American through her decision making process and frankly it was flawless\nIt was spectacular nothing short of spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money\nAnd it's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly followed her conscience on this issue and she is ... ... it was obvious she missed nothing she followed every single solitary detail of this process\nDid all the work you would ever want or expect from a representative\nAnd and now I guess the left is about as one hinge did they ban I don't even think it's safe to walk the Senate ... at this point\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South

said well what are you know about Susan Collins and\nYou'd you basically describe what I learned about her today I was blown away and I don't get blown away very often I really I'm too cynical I'm from New York I've been in radio Thirty years I'm a tomorrow I start my twenty third year on the Fox news channel\nSo they're going to try to destroy her now she comes from a purple state a President Trump last name a few points he wanted a second congressional district but Maine politics are different than they are in South Carolina and she was not about main herself she was about America\nShe represents the best of Margaret Chase Smith I'm a history of of Maine and if you really don't be fooled she's a moderate she's not as Sean Hannity conservative\nShe's a moderate but she loves the country and she's got more guts and most politicians and her little finger than most everybody I Know in my district she's not afraid so help push on two years to help her they're killing our financial\nSenator helper I I was so blown away by the speech I Would absolutely recommend that people help her she she did something 'cause she has leveled the playing field them brought a voice of sanity well thought out intellectual constitutional\nSanity that we stood on core principles a presumption of innocence it was beyond the ... to me but let me ask you this\nUm tell us about managed had mentioned it yes to\nWhat mansions ESL light Joe and um you know he was a yes but Susan was the center of the storm and I'll say something about flight we've had our differences I Know the

I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabinet effect but it's really what it is it's three gauge whether Trump voters a short you know your dog and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited billions and their voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote twenty twelve took a pass on Mitt Romney and\nUp until this time up until the hearing last Thursday or those voters were staying home they're a good portion them a good portion and weren't engaged and I think\nMaybe I got to see the the the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination there were those politics I think\nThe Democrats had looked ... chores are really smart strategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at that map and he said this thirty five feet tucked twenty six hours entering states that that Donald Trump won what can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabinet that the Republicans poll him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay on because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made they hit the Republicans stuck from the president stuck with them\nAnd the Democrats were exposed these voters and now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to mirror good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother\nAnd said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it and they're trying to destroy this man and this family and the Republicans are ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these calls\nThat Missouri poet McCaskill behind was appalled and we did for super back she found any points them or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day it's it's not a big explosion but what it is is\n... ... soldiers coming back in and\nGet along really well ... ... that Trump voters worked on what what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago a less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting\nAnd the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process a party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence or the need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and defense Keith Ellison\nA I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they're being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nWell Sean I mean I don't quite know how to require bought off your ...\nAnd you can say I actually agree with your characterization and their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation go if they do have is and I'm going to lead in the house which I think you can lead to pick up the house and\nFrom what I see looking at the Senate races there are all very very close within the margin of her\nBut I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back in a week or ten days after Kavanaugh is as I think we all expect narrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job than\nYou are talking about Sean is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats and from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately\nA benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York the the San Francisco and Los Angeles or or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with her writings of America I think it's going to play very differently\nI think the the real challenges the one John raises I think that's that's right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs the owner inside twenty point enthusiasm gap just the ... and and sixteen days\n[noise] let's let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where we\nDon't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did to this man for support yourself\nMore

no due process\nAnd for once you know how critical I Am a Republicans they took it with the seriousness the topic deserved they handled it properly they looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration now do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not\nYou probably have the Democrats handled this\n... ... ... if if I can voiced support for you perhaps he'll give me a chance to do that I Will have a I said this is somebody who has my own a judicial legal and philosophical differences\nWith a judge Kavanaugh so I Would not be voting for him but I Do think showing that you are correct\nThat the way this process has played out depresses me as an American first and a Democrat second\nUm I think the process is destroying\nA the independence of archery do Sherry destroying the presumption of innocence and basically what is destroying what makes our country great so we may disagree philosophically but I'd like to think we stand for the same enduring
