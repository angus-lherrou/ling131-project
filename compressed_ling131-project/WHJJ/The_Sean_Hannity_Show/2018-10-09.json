know who Brent capital is\n\nRemember that Dr Ford she didn't tell a compelling story the president even ... even sadder story was credible and compelling\n\nBut it was absolute lack of cooperation of

add up points ... blood alcohol level essentially on how intoxicated they beat came\nWith their plot with their plan they were drunk delusional [noise] and that leads to the second point here because

eastern four o'clock\nCentral advisory than regarding hurricane Michael we have a lot of listeners in the panhandle\nUh my show as heard in Panama City I Ninety four point five FM I'm also heard in mold meal and uh Pensacola as well so uh and I've been through this real ally joining us right now from the national Hurricane Center in Florida is Stacey steward a senior hurricane specialist\nStacey thanks for coming on that show I Want to get the latest with at five o'clock advisory\n[noise] well as the five PM issued a lifetime advisory hurricane Michael is located a very near the western tip of Cuba has continued to move northward it's now probably located about to say twenty miles or so north\nOf the western to Cuba still moving northward a speed somewhere around eight to ten miles an hour we expect that most to continue tonight\nAnd tomorrow morning and then a graduate turn to the north northwest is expected tomorrow afternoon then in a couple of days we're expecting Michael to make landfall somewhere in the Florida Panhandle uh near major hurricane strength\nStacey I've been watching as obviously and I'm trying to empower my listeners especially along the Gulf Coast ah to the east of Panama City to the big band and to the west to Panama City over towards Pensacola\nTo prepare and prepared quickly the difference here is\nAnd I tried to illustrate this for the audience typically you know we're watching these hurricanes is they\nThey roll off a K burn and they can they they they courage across the Atlantic and into the southern Caribbean and it made us take a long time and we were able to watch and you watch the cones or shrink and grow and and you know all the forecast in this case the difference here with Michael\nIs this has formed in the Gulf of Mexico essentially\nAnd the preparation time is so much more compressed because we're dealing with an event that's really just two days away\n[noise] ah that's correct Todd uh the system's only been alive technically for about a two days and it's going to make landfall they're roughly another two days so this is going to be you know easily less than a week\nOr event and we want folks in the Florida Panhandle everywhere in the Florida Panhandle not just focusing on where the forecast track is supposed to be but\nA specially folks are living in the areas east of where Michael was forecast make landfall the wind field is going to be a very broad on the east side the Florida Big Bend area is highly susceptible to storm surge because of the concave shape for the coastline and the shallow water there so there's going to be significant storm surge many miles away\nFrom where the storm makes landfall and then of course everybody who's going to be a located east\nOf where Michael makes landfall you're now in the heavy rainfall threat the tornado threat so uh just because this joined track might end up being sixty eight even a hundred miles away from you or you know to the west view please don't feel that you're going to be a and said company\nStating that I see that the u._k. model is starting to run and more agreement with the U.S models\nAre that's correct but it's still out there on the right side showing you know perhaps landfall near or just east of\nAppalachian coal Florida and we need to remind folks that are a two day a forty hour forecast errors or you know pretty much on the order of about a Seventy nautical miles so that could be anywhere from uh the Florida Big Bend area too as far west as almost to Pensacola so we don't want people focusing entirely on\nWhere forecast track as are showing it making landfall right now that could change a little bit over the course of pi\nLet's talk intensity now over the years the actual forecast path has gotten better intensity is still one of those areas where we're still trying to get better [noise]\nUh so now where where where in a category one the five o'clock eastern advisory for central had a maximum sustained winds at eighty miles an hour or so up five from the intermediate forecast that at two PM\nAnd you guys are projecting it to intensify with two and then potentially a three what makes landfall on the Florida coast line is that correct\nThat's correct or were explicitly forecasting a store to become a major hurricane and about thirty six hours while\nIt's still out over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico or then as it makes a term or to the north northeast and biggest approached for pan handle might see a little bit of slight weakening but still be near\nAmazing ... was

this now for years on this program but\nThe stakes couldn't be higher for weeks from tonight I'm you might hear the words Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house and committee chairman Maxine Waters and committee chairman\nJerrold Nadler of New York I born Jew over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better or they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders\nEliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare\nShort of that what else did they stay on for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot\nAre new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago\nIs America stronger than it was two years ago is the economy better off than it was two years ago is the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well he's kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation east kept his promise on building the wall hasn't fully been able to do it because that hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced a bolt bill today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall we now record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years\nLast time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series that's how far back that goes Hispanic American unemployment record lowest African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for\nAsian Americans also record low for our veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nResidents kept his promises on Billy dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea\nThe sanctions in Iran are now paying off we see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there and we haven't been able to tap into those resources are building the Dakota pipeline or the Keystone\nApplied and that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he was select from any selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country and in twenty eight days for weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are\nGood news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think\nNancy Pelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people what are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you\nKnow what these tax cuts of working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either you know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a head of the investigation and the next hour\nKnow while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Katherine Harris you've all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know it was just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice when she deleted subpoenaed emails and then use bleach pet and busted up devices with the cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction but of course she had friends in the deep state\nThey took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company and told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration of Hillary in May of twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview her Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nMan that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and a exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAnd exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remembered then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James ...\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney or with a company Perkins Kuwait that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil well they were funneling money into Perkins Kuwait\nWhich is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group that then went out and hire the former ... six agent\nOr the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and an inter August ... Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling the number two the the lead counsel for the FBI now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the de OJ or either resigned or fired or\nOr stepped aside anyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's stunning in terms of what it reveals since it directly contradicts Justice Department and FBI officials sworn testimony\nSo in other words they lied under oath and Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at meddling in the twenties sixteen election in other words he was a cut out\nIt was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it the question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about\nThat in fact you know its application then for the price of warrant which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dusty aid that even the guy that put it together doesn't stand by but anyway\nThe fights application was based on Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA but it was all to get warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd by the way it seems now that it was done at the direction\nOf Donald Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton from the get go\nMuch by the way it would be entirely illegal for both the FBI and for Clinton what appears that they've done here how many times if I said this is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history\nNow you've got numerous officials after the OJ and the FBI have told us under oath that nobody at the FBI ideal Jay knew anything about the Democratic party being behind all this Clinton dirt\nHouse intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes and she was on with ... I think on Sunday said well now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats in the Clinton campaign feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI\nSo it appears that the FBI and department of justice for doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for the Pfizer warrant to snoop on Trump campaign communications\nAnd they did so by getting the size of warrant to spy on Carter Page which means that with Hillary's without Hillary's involvement here\nThey wouldn't have been a finds the application to spy on the Trump campaign they wouldn't be fusion GPS or a dusty a on

hurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now is headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit land at a category three\nAh and there's a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined Fort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job is started the official weatherman other Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and it's being I'm being told is the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I said I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City or that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not have Ninety eighty five that was a major hurricane and the golf but a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area\nNow the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the a sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this is a big deal and mobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain\nBut once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in the Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area the weather pattern you remember Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a place that strong category perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what is it when they look the average person including me has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much what is the angle of the storm matter\nIt's also the overall pattern one Florence was coming into powder in the western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical site clones September twenty believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency it's maps came out and said look out October of ...\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basin you notice all the tycoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely and say well what does that have to deal with as well when the action stops there like\nA good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on ... ... it can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to cap or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw and watch we got so last Thursday and friday you know then showing knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get them ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto\nWe hit it off to the east over there with ... this is going right in between and instead of coming west northwest it's hitting it's heading into classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas they're going to have a fast moving tropical storm goats were there and unfortunately\nIn a lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally and inches of rain coming Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go right out to sea to the south the New England no problem in the north east from it but it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas\nOr because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't hit the ... you'll see forty\nSixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force along the outer banks in forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moves up it's going to accelerate through there\nWhere we are looking at that devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama

there's no doubt it's for the proof is in the ...\nUm\nYou know it was an interesting piece by my buddy Hugh Hewitt Trump may be outside of our norms but he is the feeding for all of us\nAnd I and I just read a little bit of the article I didn't finish it yet but I think what he's saying there's a point that I've been making as well except in a different way and that is that if you look at any criticism of Donald Trump it's all stylistic stuff\nHome out of style they don't like that is combative they don't like that he breaks dishes\nThey don't like that he fights they don't like that he is at times not polite um they don't like that he's a disruptor an iconoclastic they've got their image of how a president needs to behave in an act in what they should say and that they shouldn't be tweeting and this and that\nThe problem with that has to be get rid of that side of Donald Trump you get rid of what we elected the disruption is good breaking dishes\nIn a swamp lake DC is ending up

J. and their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page or both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon he is an investigative reporter is what the hell\nRag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst and of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nThank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I I Want to also put this in context for people because it gets complicated\nWe've got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may have twenty Seventeen well that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like ... and Peter Struck talking about uh media elite strategy\nThat had to do with the dusty a\nWhile it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes and they got rid of all it was was the dossier recycled and different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so it would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah ...\nTaping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nOr if there's one other event that occurs and that may timeframe that rarely I think you're a shockwave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director allowed all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from ... in may and they still have no evidence from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump or fire read that investigation get fired\nAnd what for natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that the roses have a a Cape and a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather be can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove easily confident in well over a quarter and\nAnd uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment\nFisher is not what the FBI with ... with the ... I'm ... ... talk about the history his book\nLays out the real possibility that this was a softer right look at this we have the FBI they're not investigating a crime here that\nIn fact they can't find a crime by a page\nHas all these well at least two pages testimony just to be clear she said they um they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove them through other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nIt says that drama the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it\nShe got the FBI and the deputy attorney general or allegedly have a conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road with the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counter intelligence\nAnd again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is a group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field offices purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jarrett why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials that the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to ... pose the sitting president United States\nIs the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using and misusing their power in the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker\nWho was told this was serious because the people in the conversation with Rosenstein who are Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page you said he was\nDead serious recruit people to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and secretly record the president to gather evidence in support of it uh Rosenstein whenever he gets caught engaging in wrongdoing\nClaims oh I was misunderstood he threatened the intelligence committee staff members in January first denied it\nThen it mitigated but said oh\nI was misunderstood he threatened\nThis is the biggest abuse of power in history I got to get their southern understand\nHow deep this goes will continue on the other side [noise]\n\nIs around St pure ... apples and

investigation was based on her own verified aren't corroborated\nBought and paid for dot CA\nAll of the all the media elite strategy to destroy Trump before the election oh hookers in a bad urinating into and the Ritz in Moscow and then literally leaking strategically\nTo get the special counsel may you know using the same source of information but making it appear like there are numerous sources here so they're all saying the same thing so creating enough smoke so that there would be right fire\n'em and all the FBI guys they all knew it wasn't true from the beginning at least a page even testify to that fact\nThat's right I mean you cannot use double triple quadruple here say from anonymous sources to launch an a counterintelligence investigation that is strictly prohibited yet shown that is exactly what the FBI and the de OJ did and what John\n... exactly right there there's a you know there was a guy that if I had a few weeks ago that they can get a lot of attention because he's on script guy but his name's bill priest that\nHe was beat strokes boss she was the chief of counterintelligence up the FBI he told\nHe told the congressional uh a committee that at the time they were submitting actually using that information for Christopher ... they had just gotten betting if they hadn't been and yet the standard for the fight it must be substantiated before you can submit it to the court records it exactly right\nThey they hadn't even begun to substantiate process and yet they're using it presented ... stance jaded verify the court when you look at these\nOf at the point they willingly lied before a Pfizer port and light it as an advisor court application and they also purposely withheld key information like act that Hillary pay for it or how much of these are crimes

is trying to pass on information about is phony lying ... even Robert Mueller for crying out loud right\nThat's right with the president listening for the Justice Department I said hey there might be some problems here we don't really want you to do this he should keep in mind this is the Justice Department that hit from the American public and the court for more than Eighteen months the fact that Hillary Clinton paid\nFor the main evidence used to open an investigation of Trump's campaign [noise]\nWhen I got to leave it right there John Solomon great work well have you on Hannity tonight ... we'll see you on Hannity tonight eight hundred nine four one Sean as a toll free telephone number\nA weird twenty eight days away for weeks from today the most important midterm elections one of the big issues on the ballot is health care are going to explain why and what the Republicans ought to be offering as an alternative to Obamacare next\n[noise]\n\nOr the God Forbid I get cancer or the God Forbid I got in a bad accident right\nRight and you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last\nYou know really a good ten years of insurance premiums that have doubled or tripled we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works the key to that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in atlas empty and Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your aid you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of history and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and um you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill\nThat's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total\nIn forty eight states in every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise] um and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation was er physician run house policies because doctors never seem to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in ... Congress ... personally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice of health are plus when he was\nYou know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services all it does is create ...\n... ... ... ... points with Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country was ... medical tourism or what we're finding is that\nYou know not not the same thing about health insurance we're using it for all and you know when somebody is\nYou know place twice the amount of money for a service because they just are health insurance wondering ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the other products so an MRI cash price for us is two hundred and twenty dollars while using her your commercial insurance you know we go through all the hoops ticket it authorized\nYour co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health care\nI'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an obstacle ... solution so I'm pleased to see but you know we're shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone who I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think the real close enough I was about testifying us some help committee on the ... topic\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shocked they gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance in that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nA for every illegal immigrant in the country are but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas them day and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it for the big things heart attack\nA accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars for a year or a month\nA month or so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send them on a ridge analogy this throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nWhat we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get ... cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you know actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending way and if I could\nAdd up to that just a a you know as far as the cost of care you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well mama care made that illegal or so that ... just brought by ... get access to these major medical plans ... short term medical plans\nAnd you know some would argue that these are actually crew insurance they don't cover anything except what major medical expenses they're Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this can be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it\nAlready does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for outlets MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\nNow everybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients but well so now we're going to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to know judged by their illness\nDid you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\nBoy I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um that the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership\nWe do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be at ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a stash of seven people er physician fighting insurance we can\nLower the caution and pass the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those cars they're going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nWell they're gonna have to move out of New York because they don't make it easy but they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the a few states that make it a very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that costs that would be an amazing model it it would cut down there\nRight let's take the York out of the equation or California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida huh hum I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up it's like shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um [noise]\nYou know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills of blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I Can't and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than\nEight hundred nine four one Sean ... telephone number when we come back wide open telephones if you want to be a part of the program straight ahead\n\nRemember with dad used to say say

that they leave up to the states I mean the states have quite a few things that they do differently I mean some states require id them don't that's true um you know so I'm guessing it because that that's what I think the states go okay that's that's our territory\nAnd you know I'm I'm guessing that variety is the spice of life anyway so why not right\n[noise] I never really thought about it

Fox News hurricane Michael ... category three taking aim at the Gulf Coast of Florida\nOr I really don't I mean the difference here is is that it's gonna make landfall in about twenty four hours and right now it's in a it's an an intensification stage\nSo even if nothing happened to make landfall as a hundred and ten mile on our hurricane that's still a pretty big deal I'm you know I I I Would think there's a higher chance of being a three or four than it is a one or two but you know we've learned over the years the intensity forecasting is not perfect\nYou know I think regardless of the ... number two three four it's going to be a really big deal for the pan handle\nPotentially catastrophic and if you're familiar with kind of a vegetation up in that part of the state it's a lot different than it is here in Tampa Bay is just a lot more trees\nA it's a different climate and there's going to be\nYou just widespread power outages that could last days weeks maybe a month or so in some places and then it's not just gonna be a coastal forward a thing that's going to move into Georgia and the Carolinas and bring some wind issues and power outages this was not going to be just the state of Florida storm it'll continue moving northeast up towards North Carolina\nAnd Paul I know you're in a tight schedule doing whether graphics for your for five and six PM a cast a storm surge now if you cut less less direct this directly in my listeners that are on the the the Florida Gulf Coast in the pan handle the Panama City listeners those to the ease those or to the west\nOr let's talk storm surge predictors are potentially eight to twelve feet of storm surge and of course that can be deadly\nYeah and that's always an eight to twelve feet ... Indian past his to cedar key\nUm even here even here we've had we've had high water around Tampa Bay and there's been some flooding are way down towards Naples or what some high water she got to think of of the Gulf of Mexico as being like a big bath tub\nBecause it's almost close the close circle and that water when it began splashing along our coast really piles up a ... it's a whole different set up here on the Gulf of Mexico there it is on the Atlantic side when the water is deeper into the water off the coast of the panhandle in off our west coast is pretty shallow\nAnd it really piles up quickly so on our west coast storm surge\nIs the big problem up in the big band and the panhandle storm surge it's wind and it's and it's raining so bats that's how that's\nGoing to play out yeah I saw in the Tampa Bay area which is my back yard 'cause my home is you know is right on Tampa Bay a two to four feet I I I don't know if we'll see much really that'll affect us but\nI you know I I just I feel for the people in the panhandle right now if you want to do as as a a well trained a meteorologist who's dealt with the hurricane activity for decades Paul what do you say to my listeners that are in this path\nOr to the east and west the Panama City beach\nOr the water always wins don't don't ever try to fight the water because the water will end up in places you never think the water is going to go if you're told to evacuate\nGet out I mean there's always the chance and it happens a lot that you can leave and the next day he says I probably should've stayed but trust me it's it's not worth\nA try to ride out a storm on the coast especially a storm of this magnitude if you're told to leave just find some place away from the water again you're evacuating from water you're not evacuating from when\nYou got to get away from the water the only time you evacuated from wind is if you live in a mobile home and there's a chance to your mobile home to be compromised you've just gotta get away from the water the water by far is the number one killer when it comes\nTo hurricanes and Paul last thing here I'm timeline we're looking at about this time tomorrow\nYeah to get bad late tonight and then tomorrow will make landfall ah and then we'll move inland but it's not going to be just a quick deal it's going to the impacts are going to be far ranging and we'll be doing stories of storm damage in Georgia South Carolina North Carolina but obviously\nA it'll be worse where the storm does make landfall and you know Panama City beach is pretty built up now there's a lot of lot of stuff up there that wasn't there ten Fifteen Years ago and a lot of stuff literally sets on the Gulf of Mexico\nI've driven right by so I've seen all the buildings on the construction on the high rises though the motel the hotels and and the condo so I'm driven right along\nThe road there right adjacent to the beach and or if we can call this a lighter note did you see that the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office issued a press pass warning to Jim ... of the\nWeather I got I saw that tweet that's kinda funny or you know they yeah he's yeah he does a great job and and you know the thing is you know you when he when he shows up your your town you know the stuff's getting real\nYeah and and that's the point is it's it's ingested was more of a a joke from the Santa Rosa accounting for the sheriff's office they don't want Jim can't totally their nose when Jim shows up it's it's going to be banned typically\nCome down in the summer just don't come down in September and October\n... that's that's what they said Paul Paul delegate into chief meteorologist a Fox Thirteen and Tampa Bay Florida Paula thanks we'll talk to you soon OK buddy ...\nThanks so there we have it again I Want to take this time out on my national program\nAnd also let let's keep in mind that a lot of the oil platforms have shut down and evacuated in the Gulf of Mexico so you're saying you know if you were in Las Vegas that well why does this concern me or if you're up in the Pacific northwest you know why or or Minnesota why why should I care about this well one of the reasons\nIs this does have the potential to push up\nA gas prices because\nYou've had a whole series of the oil\nAnd gas natural gas and oil producing platforms\nIn the Gulf of Mexico or have been evacuated so a lot of\nThe production staff have been taken off of these platforms in production has been shut down and over the years we've seen that that has had an effect on oil prices which in turn will ah Jack up the prices at the pump\nAnd of course we know that the market looked for any reason to raise prices whether it's a Texas crude whether it's the you know a gasoline futures whatever\nI'm sure the the prices are already rising it at the pump so that's why the whole country you know needs to be aware that it's not just you know the impact of the storm itself but there is an economic impact in many cases\nFor the whole country when we have these storms because of the oil production in the Gulf of Mexico so again or to my floor of the listeners\nOn the the the northern ah a part of the Gulf of Mexico in the Florida Panhandle please heed all warnings were going to follow this we have a lot of ground to cover today or next I Want to get into Nikki Haley so why did Nikki Haley\nResigned as you know if you're a regular listener I\nA a great affection for Nikki Haley I thought she did a wonderful job is to South Carolina governor I've got a lot of friends in the low country and and I'm In upstate in in South Carolina and everyone I Know really love Nikki Haley I and then as UN ambassador\nShe's done a fantastic job again uh another thing that Trump is done right is\nIs you know ... and now it seems pretty seriously hey there's a new sheriff in town here and we the United states we're not going to get beaten up any longer by the United nations and the bulk of the countries in the UN that that hate us\nOr it's America first I had no issue with that that's not cold for anything America ... at first than white supremacy you know someone's going to say America First that's that's code for white supremacy that is that's BS\nI don't care what color you are I don't care what religion you are I don't care what floats your boat in this country if you're an American citizen you oughta want America First and this country first so why did Nikki Haley\nAnnounced her resignation or for the end of the year here or there is some speculation and well let's drill into the loss of grab your phone calls coming up on Smith if you want to get an eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine a nationwide number eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine a just a little more on that trust password Jim can't tore of course from the weather channel\nAnd again the\n... to hear from the police in Santa Rosa County Florida is yeah Jim can't tore it showing up well that means they probably have a bad hurricane so let's give them a press pass warning so he doesn't come here and therefore maybe the hurricane won't you know it's it's more ingest obviously that's going to have no effect on the path of the hurricane\nBut from what I get this this is from\nAh ah\nTo P.

regarding the breaking Nikki Haley news from earlier today\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine we will if you're on hold that Nikki Haley will get to your calls here in just a moment so why did this [noise]\nIs there more than the story on why she resigned yeah many people think that\nThere are couple of factors that potentially are at play here out one of the factors is she wants to make some money\nYou know you look at what she's made as far as uh in in South Carolina politics or them as the south Carolina Governor and now as the U.S ambassador to the United nations uh Nikki Haley has earning potential\nUh clearly foreign greater or in the private sector than she does in in public service and you know looking at some of the research that's available online\nI if you look at her a twenty Eighteen financial information that was officially disclosed\nShe has a you know outstanding debt\nA credit card debt between twenty five thousand in sixty five thousand dollars there is a mortgage a of more than a million dollars\nAnd there's also a line of credit between two hundred and fifty and five hundred thousand dollars and with kids college age going you know the question is is Nikki Haley\nAre energized to hop into the private sector and\nMake a big score I mean she a clearly will have any number of options available to her in any variety of fortune five hundred companies or a board seats I mean she has a chance to make a lot of money and certainly clear on that debt and\nAnd have a whole lot more additional income so is that the reason is Nikki Haley ready to parlay her experience you know prior to running for president on the Republican ticket in twenty twenty four which I think will happen\nIs she ready to take the next let's say five or six years and try to rack up some coinage I think that\nThat does make sense to me uh some of the other possibilities are some of the other rumblings unwind Nikki Haley is calling it quits that it might be some pressure from within\nI don't know if this is as likely as the monetary suggestion but some are suggesting and floating that are hard liners inside the administration like ah my palm pale secretary of State John Bolton national security advisor\nThat well they don't see her as enough of a hard line or could there have been a push again we don't know the whole story well there will be leaks or will there be additional information surfaces on why did Nikki Haley really live and who knows\nBut these are the the ideas that are being a rumbled about being talked about and uh\nThen you know of course you know running for president in twenty twenty four ah if she's not going to challenge Trump those that say oh she's going to try to primary Trump in twenty twenty I I don't see that happening I think twenty twenty four is likely and\nWould believe that she'd want to maintain the visibility inside the administration for as long as possible uh on the national stage if she wanted to go ahead and try to parlay that into a potential run and twenty twenty four I for me\nFor me the the most likely scenario is trying to use the next five plus years to make some serious calling to make a over seven figures a year which I think she can easily make", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "09"}
