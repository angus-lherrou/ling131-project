van made a food delivery to her husband's office back in November of twenty Seventeen\nAnd that's why they had a picture and he had sent the honey look at this picture of his them so it's the same stickers on the van from a year ago\nNow does he ... they don't appear to be individual stickers they appear to be a a a a digitally printed collage on one type of I'm bored or whether it's a plastic

oc\nAt this rally that that's what they're claiming\nSo I don't think that and and those that are suggesting that this is a democratic a operation that this guy has been paid to do this or the

propping just happens to be alone a tone\nThat's the answer here there's no grand conspiracy uh\nFootage from Melbourne, Florida rally twenty Seventeen it appears to be him\nA CNN's we're in a marsh reported so much you know what I think I have a the audio here I Am I might be able just to play the all these individual already Trump rallies from twenty seven or eight\nVotes so we have and digging

rally\nIn Melbourne, Florida and uh this is for the end of the rally at the end of the advance man holding\nA sign with the CNN letters there that is ... ... again ... standing behind the press riser so what was happening in front of him is that the reporters were going live from\nRally and there he was holding a CNN has signed a back in Florida are back in his house and and Seventeen or we have been going through his social media we do know that obviously authorities have been going through his social media as well his Twitter account\nExtremely political in nature or in going through many of his ... uh it is clear that he had his eyes on his targets before he even I mean\nThere's a lot of messages and there's a lot of\nA posts that our political and a year at a tax or some of these democratic targets that received and made comments about these individuals who have received\nThese pipe bombs in the mail eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine a nationwide number here

... the ship and details have come forward [laughter]\nAnd they said ah that no no no no he doesn't work for the ship and details but apparently at one point vis a bombing suspect was working for a knock off organization not the actual real shipping details\nOr TMZ had reported the here's an extensive ...\nA little history also worked for ... as the tour manager but then the shipping down said no no no not not us it turns out that apparently he worked for a similar type male dancer review or international gold productions\nAnd maybe the Caesar's Palace royal burlesque show so and allegedly he was delivering food from some company\nA year ago in that van and a woman's husband took a picture of the van and their parking lot and it was covered with the same anti a democratic stickers CNN sucks crosshairs on Michael Moore and Van Jones and Hillary Clinton and that was a year ago [noise]\nTied back to the phones here again is just so many little pieces here or a single fingerprint a single little fingerprint which was lifted\n[noise] on one of the packages that was sent to Maxine Waters was enough latent print\nAnd that was match to fingerprints on file because he has a criminal record he's been fingerprinted he's he's been arrested multiple times in two thousand to the suspect\nOn the phone threatened they Florida power and light customer service agent because they weren't

I'm always thinking along spiritual lying there with a client [noise]\nUm [noise] I I ... bridge we're already very seriously I'm interested in my book called the ... yeah\nI'm from the from the turn of the last century right\nYeah yeah I think it was published or and or\nLike you know eight um apparently with what they say according to the introduction of ... it was kind of cramped cried out written transcribed by Levi Dowling transcribed it from the classic record\nOr no offers on has gone from book remember it by the way of putting it [laughter]\nI'm a native with this book because it is her role in many ways for for gospel um and and describing like Jesus and also covers like that so called missing here is a device\nThat highly ... law in years or so [laughter] um but it does talk about the different ages and that the the full of full title of the book is very current gospel of Jesus comma the price of the highest in age\nAnd somewhere and I'm not I'm not an expert on this book but I'm fascinated with the idea of the return of the Christ that I'm not in a lot of conservative Christian I'm ... I'm\nMore in line with like Quakers [laughter] and I'm fascinated with the idea of um\nThe beginning of an age where they'd be occurring age began disagreement about\nThat a million years is that I'm going to their current oh go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're bringing I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes I think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in or and this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modern ...\nSome Marxism and neo Marxism and you know all we could ever do is the arise because we can't there's no there's no met a\nData so that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... [noise] so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make sense ... of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what something that just otherwise it'd be completely ... the way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I mean I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I've looked it up several times and and it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it it's sort of exist up there especially the part about that period of time they'll missing so called years\nUm because there's a lot of different books that address that and we'll do they all tell the same story though do you\nI don't know I'm not familiar with all the ... the only one I'm familiar with a cover it right by your\nUm ... good wanted a wrap it up quickly on there's a lot I could go into your boxer book I wanted to say um I I agree with what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier with a caller I'm Talking about live along the lines of\nIt as your your creative freedom we have a we we all worship something you know what the money or her materialism or whether it's God him or herself [noise] um that we really appreciate that you ... do you cook a worship your way\nI I I appreciate that but I also think that there's a downside to that for sure but I have an edge because you know we have the freedom but we don't always use ... oh yeah we have a buddy ... individually but can we collectively\nCouldn't agree more to have some kind of shared values\nThat oh yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political you're I I think what holds us together as a country is a I I I don't fixate on borders I understand the importance for security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut when people talk about each the border that makes us a country that's just not true you know it's at the border that makes me in Arizona and or write or soon to be a a a cans and isn't a like didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nAnd I think what holds together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we've got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to we aren't philosophy should be where every education starch I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers based\nThe entire country I think that's what we need to always focus on that's the that's the most important thing to other things are also important but that is to me the most important thing\nGosh well I learned a lot ah for people who don't find it interesting part in the other but gosh darn it that was great thank\nYou so much for jumping in an open lines and look forward to tomorrow night so the most elusive serial killer\nIn history\nAnd you'll be shocked and in fact the author\nVery well might have solved this case [noise]\nGlitter make that decision I wouldn't think George Norris Chris boroughs think leads to lie and I want to think Tom ... or who just called TDY\nOr for a give me this opportunity to continue to come back and I'm looking forward to the same thing in November picks them dates to coming up in [noise] in December so it looks like a couple of times a month\nAll of a chance to host coast to coast but that's only because of all the kind words you pass along so thank you very much until tomorrow night [noise] wouldn't Halloween tradition will continue on coast to coast [noise]\nGave him a [noise] and I do\nLook back at this week in history this week in Nineteen ... sixty three year old schoolteacher named any medicine Taylor becomes the first person to take the plunge overnight\nMore clean October twenty far from prefer something one of my camera accounting falling from\nSeven to decide by the Rapids in them propelled over the edge of horseshoe falls Taylor reached the short lived around twenty minutes after her journey began after a brief flurry of photo ops who's speaking engagements Taylor's fame colds and she was unable to make the fortune for which she had\nThis week in Nineteen thirty one eight months ahead of schedule New York governor Franklin Roosevelt dedicate the George Washington bridge over the Hudson River four thousand seven hundred and sixty foot long suspension bridge the longest in the world that this time connected Fort Lee New Jersey with Washington Heights in New York City\nOne year later it carry five million cars from New York and New Jersey and back again\nThis week in Nineteen sixty two in a televised speech of extraordinary gravity president John F.

it's getting sicker every day I mean noticed the same thing the Maxine Waters\nYou know you get a crowded you follow these people into grocery stores in department stores and gas station do you tell them we don't want them here anywhere anymore you know telling Henry Kissinger to leave the country Mitch McConnell not only did they tell Mitch McConnell to leave the country\nBut then they're talking about the guy smashed literally ripped\nIs leftovers I guess just maybe it's taken a meal home to somebody else\nAnd throws it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's going to get killed here you watch somebody is or hurt severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever can critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover his ... brand new book\nUh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle a blue collar Americans that won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they liked the way judge Kavanaugh was treated ...\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nMean they they literally are mishandling everything and so what's what's happening is ah the the president has almost like this light Sean like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that insect light well the president has that the Trump Twitter insect\nLight and they're all going towards the late in the rape arising a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test she's less of a Native American and your me into the vapors Asian big\nCaravan issue the way they're handling the Caribbean issue it's a galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next sugared okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process and the meat you look Mitt which takes\nThis guy that did very well credential judge or he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter\nInsect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of and the president's base is actually going to turn out in much higher percentages and people predicted and so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate\nAnd it couldn't happen without the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say the CBs carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're going to have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nNow the president is is battling back on all these ... in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there we're not we're not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now\nWe will begin cutting off substantially reducing the mass of foreign aid we routinely give them an Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people they legally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally thinking blamed the Democrats were not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be a sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix it with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's not just all it is is he or she is recognizing with a legendary built for even one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your Puerto Rico's free market forces dictate that people will cross over that quarter\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so I don't get\nA you know I'm I'm I'm I'm promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows where they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that have voted in the last I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... well could there answered by so\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more bottom\nThe bottom ten percent of the society shut the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but\nAlso the fact that he cut the slack at the border and so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot now have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us all through the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons it was either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get on each call them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he was gay he resonates with these people for reasons\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave a a a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I started as a dishwasher at twelve and and look what you started I you know\nSean Sean list that I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you saw credibly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration\nIn America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that\nCan do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents that our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white\nFree market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is that you cannot just ties or through a political system created equal outcome it never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making it and get an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here but\nThere's no moderation left either mulch and the Democratic party it used to be I I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nHave to losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they make contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a college campuses\nIt's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it but the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf these professors Sean or liberal but about forty five to fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the malarkey\nYeah All right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is whether Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs\nAre and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs in eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps so dramatic turn around\nAnd they're back happily working and some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back\nQuick break right back well continue more the mood Scaramucci\nOn the other side she is the Senate candidate\nAmerican War hero Martha mix Sally from Arizona will join us immigration obviously a big issue out there and we'll talk to her and much more straight ahead [noise]\nRight as we continue that Aaron ... the ... as I call\nThem a he's a great friend of mine these amazing he did something that nobody else did they actually took the time to actually look at Donald Trump's real background railroads his family his father and you know you tell a lot of gripping stories in the book about how well the mean horrible landlords\nActually weren't so mean after all when people came on hard times they would work with people and help people\nThat's absolutely true story that's actually Carol won a family in thirty forty your friends has changed and I wanted to relate a story you know an auto it quickly\nFred Trump showing up to collect rent with his twenty six year old son Donald Trump in and they're walking through the uh the garden apartments knocking on doors Carolina family cannot pay the rent\nThe father has lost the job he's a blue collar worker Fred and it's sort of looking at them saying okay no problem there very often guy let's wait a month let's see what happens I suspect you'll get a job well and behold a sixty short days later\nOr he gets a job pays the rent that he was owed a and it's just a wonderful story about their family never\nWill be going to be told by the mainstream media above people talk about what does the president has compassion for these people does the president of apathy\nAnd the answer is yes she learnt that at the riding shotgun with his father is he was easier building these buildings helping to build buildings are collecting rent from blue collar people that were living a shot so so I Want to get a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story arc of Trump's family which is a great American success in many ways the head of the family is also an American success story the arts are different uh and the generational transfers are different uh put their goals part of America the part of that broke up America\nYou know the the generation is built this country and I don't know if Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations I built this country are just amazing people the immigrants that built this country my grandparents all for coming from Ireland\nUh anyway the book is called the Trump the blue collar president Anthony Scaramucci it's up on Hannity dot com Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere Anthony good to see we're going to see on TV this week we'll look forward to it my friend and all the best on your book tour and I hope people will run out and get a copy of it because it's worthwhile reading I appreciate\nIt God Bless

I Would imagine that your polls are going to go higher\nShon well it it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed and her mocking Arizona and their extremism on so many issues as being on earth\nBut the Arizona local media is protecting her a and making excuses for her and so the only way that filters down his shows like yours are are turning it into a TV ad\nAh the fact that she's still hanging in there is really ridiculous\nSo out of step with Arizona values and American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate Kennedy disqualifying in the past\nAh but here we are right down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past\nThis qualifying statement you know compared to nice to have been twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms that are way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know well you served abroad post nine eleven correct\nAnswer I was a a ten pilot I was just fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly a fighter jet in combat uh and then the first to command a fighter squadron in combat I've had\nSix deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan a hundred and twenty five combat hours in a tan ward hog again saving American lives on the ground and\nDefending our way of life it was absolutely honor of my life to be able to serve\nYou know when you hear Christ and send them to say oh it's okay at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the Taliban and nearly died\nA Sean when I when we heard this I\nI couldn't believe it I mean I was a deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harbored al ... who came and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops\nTo include your truthful I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a command or\nAre we you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them and are eight ten but oftentimes ah you know the the the firefighters happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket with come through and there's ... there's a silence there and everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nAnd for her to be able to say that she's okay within American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign\nTo super food dot com or call it an eight five five Texas fifty five ... five five Texas fifty five Texas super food dot

sound bite me to make it look like I was trying to make the case that can show you deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said the fact the exact opposite so yeah yeah a lot of people worked\nUp about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it ah in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert by again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned ah there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but I don't know our constitution and governor thing call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments out of ...\nThat normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens it has nothing to do with using the military just stopping invasion from another country so\nThere was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you didn't you you\nYou he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay what seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections what if we can make that case what do you think the people will be demanding Trump do\nStand aside left to seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks it's a joke you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven\nThousand Russian communists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized just a border that if they\nBomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just been a look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that short\nI mean you you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump sends a military down and he started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump\nExactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people playing this thing\nAnd that's where he can't try to deal with this on his own he leads to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on\nTape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous situation

civil again when everything is made normal with us back in power they've done everything they can everything that's always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them\nThey've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack plans the various schemes to make you distrust\nAnd by the way Republicans in the past I'm kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning to promise to do this that and the other they get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the media they've had Republicans who are electing properly and temper David\nThey've been able to persuade you that various Republican bank not worth your support we've been able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to\nTheir Jim Acosta in Houston,

falling for the hate\nYeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show\nAt some conventions setting in\nNew York city and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gone so far beyond you're not expecting the president to pet it anymore but what is troubling as to look behind him and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me how is this who believe [noise]\nAnd he does it I think because it's still we're still rile people up\nDivides us horrible yeah oh it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and the election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you in Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected\nSaw he now says what's really troubling to look behind the Trump to see the reaction of people to\nWhat he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this heat that's what I think because it's still works that seat so Trump Trump he pretty smart Trump knows when he's Trump knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump has been working is spending like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment never Trump hers they resent the hell out of Trump because Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid now you are which takes me to want peace\nThat I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David

Europe first that I hire\nI rushed thanks for taking my call Yes sir this morning I was listening to NPR and Steve\n[laughter] I ate a reference to the mall but he didn't want to call 'em all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality saying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the hardest jobs in the ... making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mark they use one or whatever it is to them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people but it's good for them but when it's not good when they want to use the humanitarian side\nIt's such a disaster but there's you know thousands of feet on the line would only couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR's great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to you that for that day listen to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can you hear for\nWe've got a bad we've got a a a a bad a connection here uh about the only time I read that NPR is when they run pieces to translate what I've said offered her audience and and then happened is why get the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three week\nA ... but of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemala El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar torn poverty and the violence in ...\nAnd it just organically happen you know all these people is amazingly on the same day citing believe and they\nJust they just they just they just human beings they just have a decent life you know in in in in ... and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB ... want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know an insult me screw with Trump Trump simpler trumps the Nazi this there's no doubt this was a political movement it has been orchestrated and designed and is being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\n\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if\nI'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters\nAre so mean spirited cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering and denied entry in this\nKind of thing but but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal ...\nIt was about it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but there is no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of\nWhat's this guy's Jorge ... Ramos or whatever it is it is what does he tell among do ... what what what does it tell her tell her no but what is it Univision right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way\nFolks [laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you'd want to run in to [noise] you know\nOn the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past and he's not looking at 'em there behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder and he's ...\nHe's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that there are different people and all they want us a better life and that we as Americans we owe it to these people and what that meant that all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I ask myself how wouldn't work and this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead and TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats pool\nAsked about the timing worry them and national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that there spoke to over this\nEven before of a caravan most congressional Democrats immigration as a loser for them\n\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on immigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony and the Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador what she has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story trying to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him\nBecause it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] who they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they are every day anyway whether people show up in a group detour five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind those and the reason I say this\nIt may make no sense that makes a word that has this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this smoke they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media\nThe Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone\nYou gotta put yourselves in their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and they've read in the New York times I'll Trump is toast\nRead it's only a moment of time before\nA matter of time before proof that he's the co loaded with ... is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has been goods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history\nSooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them now you have ... out there promising subpoena power\nSaying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality and their perplexed because none\nOf what they have done has worked in a white has worked to get it it's again back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nFit to be tied\nOver it they're at their whipped candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance of Democrats win just to make themselves feel better about things but they really bumped\nRussia's always work but he I have never closes Fifteen hours a week here what is there not said it turns out alive and the liberal

here as the bombs it didn't take long for Trump to be blamed the former aides to Hillary Clinton blamed Trump and Republicans for these devices [noise]\nSo I guess Trump and Jared Kushner had just got

term elections this doesn't pass the smell test\n[noise] um I actually think and all ... what's going on barring a the\nRevelation of what really this is about if we ever learn that I think\nI'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative and you've watched everything blow up on your watch cabinet blow up you have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you\nIf all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports in at restaurants at all that's blowing up on you and it is by the way it's not working what could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs\nStorm restaurants and harass and threaten and bully Republicans what could you be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing that really makes any sense\nTo show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system and what's so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans that\nOther people joined up other people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republicans to other words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt to brandy hate and anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got is\nWe hate Trump Trump socks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment\nThat's all they've got and so if none of that work if all of that backfired\nAnd leave me and has especially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of words that has backfired on them like you cannot believe\n[noise] so what would you do you might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side you might want to do something to make it look likely in saying lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact\nOf lunacy on your side as average American voters\nPerceive it okay let's get some of the election\nAnalysis them in terms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly\nWhat what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there and do something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so Tom ... co founder of this place\nWas on ah the Fox Business Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top up here and Tom Bevan sat in all of polling data that they have it real clear politics and analyzing\nIt's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead and the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... but they're not building on anything there's no way and that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecasts that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one is seats they're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight of bad Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five an absolute two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise] so all of this synthesized and stripped away and I went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sleep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing the generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are\nRising over on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats\nTwo weeks ago they were predicting no change Republicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world but Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past ... cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n[noise] and Trump is a great unknown as these rallies\nContinue now another retired historian and political analyst sends an email that I received\nA lawsuit but I've been able to have it but it just this morning\nAnd I'm going to identify who this is doesn't matter I don't know you've heard of them\nBut I just want to share with some of the things I get some of the is by the way legitimate some of it is obviously tried influenced me a into promoting whatever it is that says I have to be very very careful about so I'm just I'm I'm gonna relate this to you\nThis ... this guy\nWho is it a story and who has studied American politics and congressional races along the lines of

care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around would it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not\nWorking out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have assured us\nFor the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the pollsters tell them there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and I believe it and\nThey start reporting it and they just compounds

and you know and and the hormone all these guys and then Brennan the deep state and this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook\nIf you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOr yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to hell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nWill tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on and tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ... um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight\nWith signs saying iron my shirts iron my shirts of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and you know what you're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that

legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time Tony I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up

one time with the ... there are no coincidences and there are no ah are you there is nothing that set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made up and so\nI don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs while somebody was open the door for

them\nThis is a it was a philosophy\nThat I have a stalled for four years on this program asking people to\nNever forget there are no coincidence and live and the fact you know you say that Israel deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary or Obama and so forth\n[noise] uh it's [noise] it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to it other than they're trying to get themselves on the radar but\nSee that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately need to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some

I Would I ran into\nUm what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass during those hearings yeah he was coming out of where I was going in\nAnd I said center Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over you know I might just because I disagreed vehemently with them I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out of the ... ballot box I\nHave a fear and when I say fear with regarding myself but one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response would go viral\n[laughter]\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself what I had to wait situations though man of the ... that's why I say I'm a fear I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up all Amy the old me would come out with my wife told me would come out and then it will go by what my response would go viral but I think they pick and choose their targets does exactly\nWell may be but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half ... and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to stop crazy people\nBut I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk like I Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect for doing grappling or or\nOutright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past caught then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful\nBut we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions but I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh\nCommunicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served do so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigations and Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on\nParallel economic success fourteen state record for states record low unemployment\nRecord low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nThink the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leader so stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that there's a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just rent\nAnd we decided to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for a better job they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others say listen I'm tired of this because all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am ... so you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you say they have it to another level and you're you're propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at a picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down boats demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus by night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message is recording tell him as a message to let them in the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really go\nFor it would do with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN the politics of CNN and MSNBC just starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get off the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this\nDay but if if we all believe in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do\nIf we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes the word\nEducation from the Latin isn't due to bring forth from within\nThat tells you the God put it there our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's the great story of the two years at Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get back what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that but I think the left as\nAuthoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left as losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort to identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics\nDividing people on the basis of race and gender is\nEvery four to them for years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white a run up against a race to sexist massage in this Tacoma ... Islamic fall but they weren't dirty air water and they want to kill children and grandma throw over the cliff but also they also hold eyes kept him out and they want the polar ice cap to melt\nSean

seven and be miserable but but they want to take their kids go out to eat and not have to worry about a pastor I mean we all want the same things that this is universal listed humanity\nYes it is I really believe you mix fourteen days is going to be critical for messaging as long as I mentioned it stays consistent also I think that you know they're the script in the Bible says this is no weapon formed against the self prosper\nI Believe some of these weapons that they formed against this nation I'm not going to be able to possibly even with this caravan I think is back firing I think that a lot of Americans share the same concerns about those caravans regardless of political party this year the same concerns that the Republican Party shares\nRight good to see a both ... and we got to let
