AS Nancy Pelosi was a walking into this this building and I believe this might have been\nA little restaurant because there were a couple of different a cat that was one of the the office and there was one of his rest I don't know the name of the restaurant but after the crowd was yelling FU Pelosi which is I don't condone that I don't condone the profanity\nOr you know attack Nancy Pelosi on the merits then the crowd busted in to\nThis which I can play [laughter]\n\nThey took policy into our back door\nAnd the protesters far there are just yelling socialism socks and they're holding signs with you know hammer and singles you know with the line through it and just again ah you know Donna Shalala really [noise] and\nI you know I can talk about our academic background and and it goes I don't want to waste any more time I just wanted to give it you know some details that there was a protest against below sea and ah I get a lot of profanity and they were just yelling F polo see an English and Spanish and\nI I don't like the profanity although I I I personally a privately Carson Nancy Pelosi and a half on many occasions\nI just you know as far as you know let let the wacko a left let them have those ballots of incivility I just don't think it makes sense to or even though I I Can't stand pillow see I I don't think it it\nReally serves a the cause right and to let the left use a crowd using profanity and shot him the F bomb to use that against those on the rights I mean ... again ... socialism socks that's fine or go after Nancy Pelosi on the merits\nBut I I just don't think we need the F bomb but I wanted to play a little bit of an audio eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine a nationwide number here on Schmidt eight hundred eight zero one\nYeah okay you're kind of on my same page here I'm you know I'm looking at what has changed it's going to reverse the fortunes of the Democrats have been losing elections who have not been turning out voters\nIt isn't issue related because they're not proposing proposing any and they're certainly not advocating and they all they're doing is ripping the bullying and so\nSo your theory is that they are fooling themselves that they're they think they've got this massive hate Trump movement out there that they've created that is going to show up in droves and sweep Republicans out of office\nAnd most Democrats are admitting that the economy doing well and they may not like the president techniques but they have to admit that\nWhy now wait a minute wait a minute what most Democrats where are you seeing most Democrats big grudgingly admit that the economy's doing well\nI had fortunately my entire family democratic that pre med I socialize took Democrat because they're nice people\nOkay but they are you are including them that that that there's not just your your like your family that that has been grudgingly admitting things are getting better they do not blindly hate Trump\nDon't they don't widely eight Trump and they don't feel like they are called scholar matter\nWhat so you're telling me they're not all that exciting to show up and vote\nExactly [noise]\nSo now you're you're calling from Tallahassee what are your what is your family's thoughts on Andrew Gillum\nI'm dangerous [noise] in a good way of a bad way\nIt's not I'm not sure dangerous can ever be good but it's like\nWell I'm the most dangerous man in America because it's good\nAt it ended up at work you can be good dangerous on\nAndrew Gillum is a democratic candidate for governor here he's up against Rhonda Santa ... and I'm the guy the guy is um is [noise] is dangerous is the right word but your family mostly Democrats are not into the guy is that what you're saying\nWell most of my family in the mid west [noise]\nWhat about Democrats but you know so the Democrats the really nice people do\nThey are and and none of them support ill because they watched it back as mayor happy it when you ask them what they look at their shoes shake your head\nRight so this is it look all of this is ... by the way the word is a and\nE.

I'm telling you I Am the people are Texans are not going to put up with this\nI Know the people attacks us they're not you know you have what I think they start early voting on Monday in Texas um so that's coming to to a head I mean barring a disaster I mean it only is is it's like the brains me of Obama in the sense that he's cool\nIt's it it is eight out side Texas phenomenon not attack it only

be the twenty twenty nominate\nA yeah try and get through Ted Cruz first good luck with that but we're following all these races let me tell you where I think we are right now I think the Republicans\nI think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us four thousand people strong that want to get to the southern border or the United states from Central America\nI Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen I I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and get an update uh apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government that that's not gonna happen\nBut four thousand people still four thousand people and what did Democrats what did they resist that they don't want a solution\nFor the border problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we now are using these drug cartels you can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using\nIn this I Can't even believe this district you know these drones that they fly with cameras above him so they'll fly from Mexico\nInto the United states along our southern border they fly drones with cameras on them and what they do is they map out where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's they're most likely to succeed in bringing in their heroin and their fat and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities\nThat's how evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are to be successful now the president while he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that has been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny but we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done that in ...\nThis is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor\nAnd any sense of constitutional or authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process that would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh it wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his late well now they want a nine to one but the way I see it Eighteen days out\nIs that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick Scott has a slight lead now in Florida but it's not big enough\nYou want if you want rex where Scott has killed himself and on such a great job for the state of Florida look at how this man is all hands on deck doesn't sleep every hurricane he's prepared to help out those that are victims\nAmazing I maybe it doesn't have the most charisma in the world will be the first to tell you that but you know one thing I'm a little sick of\nA lot of politicians with a lot of hot air and be asked that talk a good game and just for lying to us which is part of the whole democratic strategy that is why project very tossed

Maxine Waters revealed that they keep saying they keep telling me don't say it to ... will do it but don't say about impeachment\nJohn Podesta group saying just don't ever talk about immigration to

to this ... of social media accounts also creating email accounts\nThat all were designed to make it look like it was coming from a United States citizen was coming from somebody here in the U.S to according to\nAh the charging documents to create an amplify divisive social media and political content\nAmong the ... are among the\nTopics here according to the wire reports and this is a combination I think this is Associated Press\nAnd NBC News or the topics that were uh were broached here\nGun control also picking up on specific events also ah fomenting a discourse on the horrific Las Vegas shooting wars on the horrific Las Vegas shooting\nA little over a year ago on the strip of the country concert also oh are trying to stir things up with that that Charlottesville debacle

be\nAmerican people trying to push this narrative out when in fact you have a a woman heading this thing up in St Petersburg Russia ah\n[noise] I've got some examples of the means you don't get to that in a second again this is just breaking up kind of a rolling through this live having a chance to look for all the charging documents here uh\nThe federal prosecutors said this Russian woman who's ... is a chief accountant\nFor a Russian organization called the\nProject locked tough which they get their money\nFrom a a rich Russian dude otherwise known as an oligarchy or he's connected to Concordia companies and they were also involved in a separate indictment that was brought back in July by Robert Mueller's team\nAnd they were accused of meddling or attempted meddling back in the twenties sixteen elections so here we are new Russian vets but you know I got to be honest here a false breaking news here on Smith I don't think I'm is worried about this Russian meddling [noise]\nAs I Am about\nThe Texas Democrats mentally ... known Russians here\nAlthough I get to that you're the second one of the means quickly let me let me bring this thing up but I just I downloaded a file\nOn one of the Russian means for instance a ... to to try to you know sway voters or to so um anger and and this course one of the moves that this a Russian woman\n[noise] uh put out is a photo of a what appears to be a Mexican or Central American family or a a father or mother who's pregnant clearly with a big baby bump sitting down and then a whole bunch of other kids in their laps\nAnd ... it's a photo of what they want you to think or are illegal aliens are either in this country are coming to the country and you must Internet me with the photo of what's purported to be illegals\nThe caption the graphic says every deported illegal household saves taxpayers seven hundred thousand dollars that's why it is very important to keep families together\nAs they're all being deported\nSo again you've got multiple things at play here just one of the the means but going back to I did I pick your curiosity here\nOr that I'm not as concerned with the Russian meddling per se ... unless you know again I'm being slightly facetious here yes there is no place for Russian meddling the Chinese are meddling multiple governments are those are the two biggies the Russians are the Chinese and there was zero tolerance to zero plays for this and\nIt it is in the foreign countries trying to interfere with our democratic process you in the United states and I've got a zero tolerance it didn't
