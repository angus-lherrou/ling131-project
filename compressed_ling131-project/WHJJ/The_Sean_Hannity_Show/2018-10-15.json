years if you look at the charts you can see Greenland\nHas had well above normal skillful and near record snowfall so Greenland she apparently she's on aware of this because two or three years ago of

evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThat was a great piece by Jonathan Turley the three reasons Mahler may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker no saying the FBI failed to provide a federal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lives that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through ... from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the ... the judges that it was

so\nJason shape it's just what those former congressman now Fox News contributor author of New York times best seller the deep state we have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova up to ... with us a thing\nBoth for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your wheel house and it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request as they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issues to peanut when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to on board that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the

Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can do is threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think is important\n[noise] they should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth\nIt's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope Jason you're talking to your former French and telling them to get them a get hit in to the Congress to take this it and\nI don't care if they're not going to I'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena use the ... first and then you negotiate later you don't\nSay oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think about standing you sit here and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it Thursday\nThat I Can't believe there's no ...\nI mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... of warrants the gang of eight information that three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get so to pay his but let me just say this 'cause this is really important all the names that you heard Michael ...

[noise]\nIs so low that I saw a headline several others see rush I saw a headline that\nActually many other Americans have more\nNative American DNA that Elizabeth Warren openly fight I mean I I saw this I saw this\n[laughter] it might have been on the Drudge Report but I saw this headline about two hours ago and I printed it out it's in my pile but let me see if it's on a ... let me see if it's what I see this they die it's it was it was a piece that I was reading I thought I highlighted I probably did\nBut [laughter] [laughter] and I'll find it a second but essentially it's\nThat many other Americans who don't claim that they're Native American actually have more Native American in them a van Elizabeth Warren and I went\nAnd something with European European Americans were or Americans with the European descent actually many have more Native American DNA then a Senator Warren so [laughter]\nSo am I executive producer just said hey Schmitt you probably have more Native American I don't know I've never done one of the twenty three and ... I Know vaguely or basically what my lineages I Know that\nThere is some German there's some Russian woman named Schmidt is German is Russian is German is a Hungarian his polish so uh\nAnd I know that I'm On my mom's side of the family my dad's side of the family they rolled over\nThe Eighteen Seventy is Eighteen eighties or through a Ellis Island so from from Eastern Europe\nSo [laughter] there's\nThere's a chance maybe I could have more Native American [laughter] once led set this whole thing up and I I don't mean to make a mockery out of this as I Do I don't mean to joke about this yes I Do but I mean if if [laughter] if Elizabeth Warren really thinks\nThat Vince DNA test which shows her at best at best one thirty second the Native American but\nEven the experts says that it goes back maybe six to ten generations so going with those mathematics six to ten generations even the Boston Globe's peace said that a lens the most Warren is on the long way and only\nOne [laughter] and one sounds in twenty fourth [laughter] one slash one zero one or one zero two for one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American and by the way the Boston Globe Anna correct themselves then you had to issue a correction is actually pretty embarrassing here but\nThe the the original the original a percentage from the Boston Globe piece was that she was one in five hundred and twelve\nNative American and they had to\nDo a correction here looking at a correction due to a math air a story about Elizabeth Warren misstated the ancestry percentage of a potential temp generation relative it shouldn't be one and one thousand twenty fourth\nThey had it at one point five hundred twelve or ah yeah won five hundred and twelve so double it and they they were they ... they had a half wrong so I'd be folks [noise] the experts the expert\nThis bustamante guy he ports Elizabeth Warren's family tree lineage going back six to ten generations\nAnd if it's ten generations back it means that she's won and won salads in twenty four not a third not I have not an eighth not a sixteenth no\nOne one thousand twenty fourth [noise] ah that's incredible\nThat she really she wants to hang our hat on that this is a proof I mean it's absolutely laughable [noise] I saw how did we\nGet here [noise] oh by the way of done some research on Native American DNA requirements which uh I have a whole little\n... that I Want to go over as well you know I'd love to grab phone calls if you are Native American and what are your thoughts that Elizabeth Warren might have Native American between six and ten generations back\nAnd that she claimed that she was Native American\nOn job obligations on job applications and and try to get a professorship and certainly in this documentary they have a whole host of law professor say oh she's the best she's the greatest uh she didn't get the job because of this\nI mean this is such a pie or missile that they're trying to write the listing ship on any doubt\nThat she overplay their hand or was fraudulent\nIn her description of her Native American heritage you do this folks when you plan on seeking a higher office was a she's a shoe in obviously from Massachusetts and her Senate seat continuing bought this clearly is a rehab attempt at any damage at all\nThat might be a swirling around because of her desire to run\nFor the presidency and seek the Democratic nomination and twenty twenty there's no doubt about it now\nI said we have audio I Want to grab your phone\nCalls as well so any thoughts on this Elizabeth Warren's story the timing of this if you've seen the five and a half minute a documentary a lot of your thoughts on that I've got a couple of audio bites from the documentary I Want to play here and just a bit I if your Native American I mean any\nAspect of this happily take your calls eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine she has\nA ... the ... the leader Betty purple poke at that bikini and a little bitty tiny bit of Native American blood\nAccording to the DNA tests which again really [laughter] [laughter] it's a it's\nHardly the kinds of proportional born line that you would use to try to qualify for everything and we get from it of actions space I mean\nIt's kind of be kidding me here I mean even the Boston Globe documented warns past controversial claims for their article now let me give me a couple of quotes a on a and from the Boston Globe piece which uh which broke this today\n... this quote from the Boston Globe piece which they had to correct because their their numbers were were not\nAn astronomically high enough on how little potential Indian blood she has so that it correct story area called questions over warns ethnicity have dogs ... cents or twenty twelve Senate campaign\nThat's one GOP operatives found archival stories in the Harvard Crimson\nOf Harvard law school or the the the the newspaper a and it was the Harvard law school spokesperson for furniture as a Native American and the Harvard ... newspaper a as a way to show that the school had a diverse faculty\nDuring her academic career as a law professor she\nHad her ethnicity change from light to Native American at the University of Pennsylvania law school where she taught from Nineteen eighty seven to Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd the Harvard University law school where she was a tenured faculty member starting in Nineteen Ninety five she was visiting professor at Harvard during the Ninety to Ninety three academic year\nIn an interview with the globe published last month\nWarren explained that she identified herself as Native American in the late Nineteen eighties and early Nineteen nineties as many of the matriarch of her family were dying and she began to feel that are family stories in history or becoming lost folks\nThat is a load of crap hold on a sec old I was at DCA hear this sound right here\nEh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh\nThat's the best detector going off that is the Elizabeth Warren BS detector so a couple of ... she made those claims folks\nTo get hired at these press the schools that were under intense pressure to diversify the staff\nAnd faculty that's what's going on here and well [noise]\nDidn't work I mean they they didn't hire her but at the University of Pennsylvania had to go to great pains to explain why and hired a white woman over qualified minority candidates so obviously they didn't view her as part Native American it sounded like they weren't a you know falling for her her racket\nI anyway we have the analysis from the Boston Globe piece the analysis was done by Carlos the bustamante who is a Stanford University professor he's an expert in the field or we can go over here the the here and just a moment a I've got the audio from a documentary that you've got to hear\nAlong in the opening segment do really really really good Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas from stuff is

here [noise]\nA CNN is reporting\nThey're claiming that there are two sources\nThat are claiming that and by the way this is a flashing on average now tour was a little while ago in big red letters a big red fun or the reports are the Saudis are getting ready to admit\nThat Jamal ... the U.S permanent resident who\nFor the Washington Post at the Saudis are going to admit that he did die in their custody\nWell I mean the facilities they lie to President Trump is President Trump was on the phone with the Saudi king and all we had nothing to do with this well then they uh initially ... you know what's happened here folks\nIs the Saudis had no idea that this thing was going to explode into this kind of a story\nThe Saudis had no idea that this was going to be an international press conflict ... of oh my God they killed vis vis a vis a Saudi national or who has permanent us resident status his kids are us citizens\nAnd he was just popping into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey to get papers for a marriage license to marry his fiance who is waiting outside\nSo here's the story according to what CNN is going to report the death was the result of an interrogation gone bad so they were planning on interrogating him and something happened now when they go\nIn a couple of other stories and sources that are popping up here\nAnd if you click on\nIf you go to the drudge link that takes you to Jake Tapper as\nA Twitter feed so top a drug right now in red font report Saudi to admit killing journalist\nDuring interrogation so again with the Saudis things have gotten so out of hand they had no idea of this thing was going to be this humongous of the story on the world stage and was any journalistic organization worldwide then I can stand for this and they're going to make a big deal at one of their own\nWas taken out by a ... a government by a governmental entity so\nThat's going to be the claim and I'm sure they're going to try to paint it on one of the interrogation team members that it went too far it got out of hand this wasn't our intent but\nThey realized that they were backed into a corner that they couldn't deny this 'cause initially it was denied that I Know I we did nothing I we didn't kill me didn't they ... this is there's no way of the Saudi king tells us to President Trump for the phone call my pump paint on the way to Saudi Arabia or secretary of state\nSo the Saudis realized oh my God what the hell of we've gotten ourselves into\nOh hang on saying oh my Allah or what the hell we've gotten ourselves into so they ... they clearly had to come clean and now they're going to do is to get up they're going to absolve themselves as a whole and they're probably going to put it on ah some of the interrogation team members\nAnd then they'll probably make that individual individual sacrificial lambs there'll be punished\nBe executed when in fact uh they probably were doing exactly what they were supposed to do make him disappeared like a
