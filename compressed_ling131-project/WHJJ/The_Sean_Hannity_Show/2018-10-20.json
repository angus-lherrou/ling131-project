says he will pull the U.S from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with Russia because he says Moscow has done it by adding to its term\nHave been violated again for many years that I don't know why President Obama didn't go for a loud\nSaudi council and it can be hurt on the tape saying during the show these tortured do this outside you're going to get me in trouble\nOr in another tape and unknown person again I Can't corroborate this only told me what the New York post and the British newspapers are reporting on one Turkish newspaper if you want to live when you come to Saudi Arabia be quiet\nAnyway returned to Riyadh on Tuesday ahead of a plant search of his residence part of the official Turkish probe into ... disappearance that is the the Saudi council he's back in Saudi Arabia Middle East thing\nIt's language website holding a Turkish sources saying that there were no attempt to interrogate could show ... but that us Saudi hit team came to kill him\nThe source told the site that his dad took seven minutes runs a physician doctor Salah Mohammed al ... body listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nIn New York Post Turkish authorities believe could show that he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though the kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denying that says these claims are baseless this report comes as Mike Pompeo met Wednesday\nAfter being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president ... and the Turkish foreign minister\n... rubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough investigation\nMy palm pay on Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh said he didn't want to talk about any of the facts adapt to the president said there's got to be a presumption of innocence but he wants all the facts\nTop us deployment diplomat Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh blah blah blah blah several of the members of the alleged ... team were found to a close ties to the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nSolomon according to a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... was murdered by Saudi operatives upset the president say they didn't get any tape but this time\nHave a pro government newspaper reporting that ... apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing\nWell I Would assume that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but before leaving reality Pompeo told reporters\nAt the Saudi leaders made no exception on who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus of fish or Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that had to pack up and down the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely that show that you could have broadcast the signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi ... had the Saturday counseling wired they have transmitters\nAnd the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later joining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka\nFormer White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight\nDefending the feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies also Dan hop but Fox News contribute a Thirty Years' CIA up operations officer a doctor Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis assassinating\nMurdering this guy in a a barbaric way that's what I'm thinking\nYou know there's a ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questioned\nUh I think this man is that whether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain\nThat this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world that's the meal often I'm an avid won regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man woman a journalist was Americans that trying to spin it was a foreign national read them and it was a common type ... you wrote commentary and he has a long decades long history\nOf ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the biggest Arab arms deal out of the twentieth century ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have your back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murders and the most evil route brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen cloudy traveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived if it costs to lift the day the show he entered and we know he just show again never exited the cost of living\nUm we do the makeup of those of the fifteenth outings for them apparently part of ... the one of them forensic doctor you referred to is listening to music well allegedly this membrane ... body after he was killed\nOr what we don't know what were the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to whom did they report posts Puerto\nThose are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think was a hundred percent right to dispatch secretary state like that or the fact emphasize that they were issue of grave concern to us\nWe'll get that fact with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when Sergei Filin power was poisoned back in March\nBritish home secretary said they needed to avoid speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here and the last thing I Would highlight is that well if I'm paying was meeting and doing its public diplomacy I'm quite sure what the the FBI legal at Shea in Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or an uncle or probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it to be a part of reviewing it shot\nYou know it's the I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince says denying it I'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but knowing that they're a very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because also the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the average they're all fighting against the Iranian had you had money in the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world\nUm I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia where Don where this was that um I think this will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nBut it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat\nA Nazi is among more and more to\nAdd for you you don't make perfect the enemy of the good\nGeo pollock strictures like politics or self
