Rhode Island last year one of the most severe flu seasons in the state and almost a decade nearly fourteen hundred people were hospitalized there were sixty debts in Rhode Island flu shots recommended for everyone over the age of\nAnd in that application he specifically what ones pages ten through twelve and Seventeen the thirty four they're also looking for the D O D J what are known as real twos\nAnd those are the conversations between Bruce Oren Christopher Steele and we now know Christopher Steele was bundling information trying to get it to the special counsel Robert Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann in Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a leaker himself anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago what does it about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some doctors we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents\nFor the department of justice from but some of the keys documents including the so called McCabe memos which could very directly bear upon this question of how ... was Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting [laughter] ah\nItaly prior to the point when Robert Mueller as special counsel and are these allegations that are in the New York times actually true ah I think that can be a a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents we've been requesting for quite some time are made public\nSo as a result of that of is when you die if they're not produced by tomorrow or to say this week\nWe aren't going to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos\nAnd some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page a tax ah\nThe ah the the Bruce or three a one and some other things All right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back to the man that in the middle of all of this\nAnd I said do you know what the news is ... getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened there ... there we have people than the that no that was there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan in a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but\nUh to take out the they duly elected president I'm hearing a lot\nOf big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree and what I'm hearing is going to be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you\nUm you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with I'm correct absolutely Sean yup yup bitten by intelligence CIA up gosh\nAbsolutely and other intel community people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trust that you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments you know similar to any international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted ... to spy on your country that you love\nNo but I again I'm happy to share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah but what we're pretty open guy but\nSo anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hospital regime\nAt and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact the bulletin does have a network of of their own deep state operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that well\nIn terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did versus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talk about election interference particularly their conspiracy\nWith the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead\nAt the DNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a room people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on well\nI started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington who we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter dies I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd that is a first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I I first started getting the phone call so I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ... ...\nThat they had this buys a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report or I think came out with his a lady Luis Mitch in October of twenty sixteen ... within a ... just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't\nWith I think my first ran with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there is a buys a warrant on the Trump campaign\nOr were you aware of our reporting at the time\n... it's funny Sean right hey interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know and these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview it in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox and what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but they again because it's all about you know media perception\nWhat are they asking you at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing you win simultaneously you've never been charged with anything\nThere's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged ...\n... ... well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right by the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... a lot about that that they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah and basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of\nRevolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source\nFor the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior there is\nA an indictment of ... or ... you know if someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back\nI Know media organizations have pulled lies about you\nOr I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you gonna do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using ... verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties have got to be some recourse for you\nWell I've definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the roads blocked that has created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMy the biggest thing that goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte is just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that you should write a book\nWhat it's like to be spied on by your government you know something to that if I'm Serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well but I mean what does it feel like I guess maybe there are some people because they took out the Warren on you\nDo you have you do you know what they did they ask you about everything that you were saying and doing it this time basically yeah and I'm going back many years again\nAnd we had talked about many hours total do you think you've spoken to intel community FBI Muller all these people how many hours do you think you spend total\nThe last two years out of the last two decades two years last two years well I mean in terms of actually in person meetings you know forty eight hours or something like that but you know when you add in the hundreds and hundreds of hours I had to do in terms of document production etcetera\n[noise]\n\nThis is around ... apples and pumpkins season going on now at Greg's the old fashioned apple bread putting his

to keep up with them however\nIneffective no healthy people don't need it healthy people don't get sick that's another myth that's not true\nA myth is that the flu shot can give you the flu or not true give you similar symptoms but it doesn't give you the flu and it can mess up your muscles that says as with anything that you insert into your skin is going to hurt a little bit but your muscles to just fine okay and the shot is poisonous that's not true either\nBottom line is get your flu shot you might want to get it early too because everybody seems to think that this year is going to

I've got no problem if I say something controversial I have no ... no problem putting coal wars on this program that disagree with me\nCall me this call me that call me names they assume I executive producer\nSo quick question on friday the twenty eighth when I said hey guess what this fleet don't get picked off folks a flake is not siding with the Democrats per se here I think flake just did the Kavanaugh favor I said that Jeff Flake\nSave the cabinet nomination so how many calls as executive producer do you remember as soon as my phone screen was well about how many calls or did I put on folks who are angry at least screaming at me\nRight yeah ... said she had a couple of dozen calls and how many made it to air that we're able to take a right yeah right oh aren't yet I\nAs soon as soon as soon as says she says she had over four dozen calls it was screaming at me once so not always Schmidt why is he a great that the one we pause because they didn't have the votes it was the one we pause that brought Susan Collins into the fold and was enabling\nCollins to deliver that I'm believable speech on friday that it was amazing it was incredible and remember\nAlso and this is what's amazing even President Trump had said okay\nI he's OK with the the the pause button the White House the White House signals and from signal that they were OK with the one week FBI investigation because why ladies and gentleman\nThey knew the votes weren't there so says she's screened or talk to over four dozen callers that was screaming at me what's the matter with you said what are you talking about why you allowing the Democrats because that was the catalyst that was the only path forward\nThe delay the pause that brought Susan Collins into the fold and that one and also brought a fleet\nFlake was going to be a yes vote that got Kavanaugh confirmed with out it toast no go\nWhether he was going to be re nominated or Trump was going to come up with a new nomination we don't have to worry about that now but all those were possibilities\nSo I was no problem with folks yelling at me but I Want the record to show that ultimately I was correct and I'm sure my other cohorts and talk radio we're probably not saying what I was saying I'm sure they'll do with the mob mentality rule when in fact\nTake the emotion out and look at it more as a strategic play and that's what\nI Todd Smith did on this very program and\nI feel great about it and I said I don't want to brag about it that's not my style I'm not the bragging time [laughter] [laughter] I'm just making it really

second just to review some of the\nConfirmations a from years gone by and understanding this\nShift in\nHow regardless of what side of the aisle you're on how we essentially used to vote and we'll get into that and just a bit but as far as this this horrific limousine this a stretch SUV crash\nIn New York state now when this happened is a place called sky Harry and sky Harry and I think I've been through there is about forty miles to the west of Albany and when you think about twenty people dead Eighteen in a limo\nSeventeen passengers limo driver that's Eighteen died in a limo and then to people\nOutside of this a farm stand a restaurant now we're in the parking lot at the wrong place at the wrong time for a total death toll of Eighteen people the governor of New York who I Am not a fan of at all obviously\nA I find them to be quite a number so I actually bought a he had said and I the politics out of the equation I just you know I'm not a not a Cuomo fan or obviously\nBut he had said earlier today the limo had recently failed its inspection\nAnd this vehicle should not have been on the road at all\nAnd that the driver did not have the correct endorsement he didn't have a limo license\nSo I and the limo company apparently has a litany of issues where vehicles have been taken out of service due to inspection issues and their problems are multiple times the national average from limousine companies with a number of problems they had\nJust just an awful awful story and as I was telling you before a not a tweet but a text message from one of the deceased\nInside this limo or turns out that uh she sent the text message to a relative that the vehicle was in terrible condition and this was prior to the crash just awful now as far as my little speech here\nI don't know why people drop their guard for whatever reason people will get into the back of limousines and what is this feeling of inherent safety that oh\nWe're not going to have a car crash there's not going to be an accident don't need to put my seatbelt on I don't know what it is but it's not just limousines it's also people that ride in taxis people that ride in the you know ... ... for instance or a Juno wars you know some of the other\nYou know v is some of the other car come in a nationwide is pretty much all Britain lift but you've got some places that are that have some of these other young up and coming services as well why is it hey I'm Bob Simon the CBS News\nThere's corresponded sixty minutes Bob Simon he died in New York City a couple years back Bob Simon was in the back of one of those black cars you know the Lincoln town car services and he was in an accident he was in the backseat didn't have a seat belt on\nWhy is it the people they there's a false sense of security when you ride in the back but especially I feel that when people get in to liberate cars taxis or over type vehicles limos that oh I Want changes\nWhen you get in your car\nIn the front seat or the passage fuzzy buckle up most people buckle up but there is this this this dropping of people's guard when they get to certain vehicles and I was mentioned Bob Simon from CBS News he got into a a lot of these black car limos\nA you know one of these you know a Lincoln town cars style of vehicles\nAnd it was an accident on the west side highway in New York City in Manhattan and he he wasn't built in and he he died you know blown force trauma he died because he became a ping pong ball inside\nI'm sure there's going to be fully investigated the NTSB again involves there'll be a full report on or any of those culpable in this crash George thanks for the call I appreciate it back over to Cavanaugh I wanted to grab that call because it was very relevant to what I was just discussing\nSo as you know a Brett Kavanaugh has been convert a confirmed on Saturday and I'm just looking at at some of the numbers in years gone by which really is fascinating so if I watch this I Know that a lot of the country was glued to the television to watch\nUh this historic vote\nOn a Saturday\nA and of course this is a a totally divided Senate along party lines for the most part a fifty to forty eight votes to confirm Kavanaugh yeah it doesn't add up to a hundred you had the Republican Steve Gaines who we told you was going to be walking his daughter down the aisle\nOr in his home state on Saturday he wasn't present a Lisa Murkowski of Alaska or was not at a winning a she was the lone Republican who voted against cloture\nTo end debate on friday and you know at the last bit of she offered a little bit of an olive branch to Republicans ah she ended up voting present instead of no against\nKavanaugh and when Murkowski voted present\nOut that was more of an an optics thing so Kavanaugh was not confirmed by just one single vote since Danes was that his daughter's wedding and was not there to vote yes yeah the last time and this is where I Want to look at the stats here\nThe last time that a justice was confirmed by that slim of a margin was in a teen eighty one wins family Matthews was confirmed twenty four to twenty three\nAnd even Clarence Thomas going back to Nineteen Ninety One after the whole Anita Hill affair Clarence Thomas was voted in with a former vote margin so\nThe way that Kavanaugh ended at a fifty to forty eight\nVice president Mike Pence see did preside over the vote because the vice President Biden states is the president of the U.S Senate and he was there as a tie breaker if needed but again you know he was constantly interrupted by these a noxious screaming mean these\nAre protesting yeah they were they were going off like depth charges it was like every you know it was like a what a what a building is demolished and the charges are are staggered I've yeah these protesters\nDaisy chain staggered and one would scream they'd be hauled out and then they get going again another word starts screaming and then rinse and repeat it just happened over and over again or\nThe president tweeted a and for Fifteen PM so that the confirmation happened in the Trump tweeted I applied to congratulate the U.S Senate for confirming our great nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court later today a sinus commission of appointments and he'll be officially sworn in very exciting\nAnd he was sworn in using a family Bible by chief justice John Roberts\nAnd retired Justice Anthony Kennedy was there at that private ceremony because Kavanaugh uh obviously cork to for Kennedy also replacing Kennedy now some of the confirmation vote tallies
