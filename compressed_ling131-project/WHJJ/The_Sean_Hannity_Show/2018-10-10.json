his\nA little cute age as he was leaving the White House uh and some ethanol was disgusting when I was listening in and out of the audio and I I did hear ethanol come up a and the Trump Administration is moving to allow year round sales of gasoline with higher blends\nOf ethanol\nAnd that's going to be big for a corn growers in these corn belt states you know South Dakota Iowa a\nLot of these states these big farm states they have a push\nTo increase the sales of\nOf ethanol corn based ethanol and of course there's pros and cons you know the if you get to high with the ethanol content the engines don't like it or parts do like it\nI said there's also I don't know if you've seen it but around the country uh I've seen you know gas stations where they ... uh you know pure gasoline no ethanol blends so I Know there are gas stations around the country to do that and we were dealing with\nA ... and with ethanol by the way I mean it's really I I don't want to pass off any corn farmers but it was I got to speak the truth here\nYou know with ethanol there's been a whole lot of research that the production of the S. and all\nThe expended the expenditure of energy to create and the resources used to create a gallon of ethanol ... whenever you think you're saving guy you're not you know with the the the amount of water it takes to make a gallon of ethanol it's just it's just a lotta and I understand you\nKnow in in these big corn producing states that this is big for corn farmers I get it but there are pros and cons and I like to discuss\nIt all so President Trump is

times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's gonna be the worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida\nThat's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends in Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein others has really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein now think of everything that he's involved to think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn may twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim combing he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew all the fourth Pfizer application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian ... that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money\nIt was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legally expense now he was now are supposed to testify but those three people now Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learn this you know this week\nJames Baker now the third person are all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office taping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nHe's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse over the terms of the testimony\nBecause lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional task force interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview beyond\nHe's refusing to do so and those opposed to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aide said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and having testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying\nDiddy or did he not talk about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it and then we can also talk about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy did he sign off on a document himself talked about well with regards to ... you know that is an affidavit and career law enforcement swears to the validity truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the five applications including the last one\nAnd there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it\nThey knew the DNC paid for it they knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the dusty a was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents when questioned in in in Iraq a tour in Great Britain and said I don't know if any of this is true it shows raw intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump\nOr in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton well nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit ... the law especially Pfizer application Pfizer warrant and protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton\nBought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first it gets to smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should win them a hundred million is zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... of what the insurance policy was insurance policy is that you have people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation Lisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tax confirmed that there's no there there\nBut anyway then they started ... media elite strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA they get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA\nAnd it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of call me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen then they appoint\nRod a Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption those failing school is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak\nTo the Senate or judiciary committee's outside of the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why woody\nEspecially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath\nYou know and people worry about that just ask Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power and twenty seven days we have in

with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know there are at least twelve adult\nSo the so called trio too is when you see those and remember when the president first talked about e classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe Lisa Page all those documents as well\nThat would include my number so we we need all that information\nAnd again if you're ... you're talking about how our great system of justice works\nKeyed it at a trans parents he give us the information that we need to see it more important the American people need to say\nWell do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero people I please do oh two two to five six oh

the\nState or data and misery supply and when two hundred two hundred\nSee the polls for the first time raspy innocent showing that Republicans have more enthusiasm the Democrats and the lead up to the mid term elections I think the cabin on hearing says awoken people to just how vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox or you know a racist besides you this you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics grenades and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapists line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back to work in the back you up and we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it\nBut based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democrat Party and I think it's really\nA spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out\nAnd people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAre and I'm more determined to vote in the upcoming elections is is a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old\nClaim you really can't ruin somebody's career and their life and you know the reputation or ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is ... and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness they just care about their own political agenda\nHowever misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain that momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is then they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country\nOr they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump\nThey you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin or case I'm frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed split the end you chronicled his new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American to have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the very you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic guy I mean it's a host and a and a parasite at this point\nThey're the same thing they have ginned up this rage or not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe's been he's been called trees is they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what are you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose that train rapists or whatever it's sick name they call the cabinet\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough\nYou attack this this this American patriot and Kavanaugh you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize is wrong and preposterous I could certainly explain how in a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible\nFor Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals' and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to ruin the accomplishments of Donald Trump which have been incredible\nYou know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than Brock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up there I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to\nMaintain that prosperity 'em and add money to their wallets into private ah from government officials who loved to squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I did like Kevin McCarthy introduce which is a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nThat is already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars he needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think you know the president rightly said he couldn't make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments\n\n\nEventually every soon to be retiring must just I should I go it alone or get out before you make a decision or all Jess Massey invest an hour of your time with Jeff\nYou will listen

of it and uh it's more it's\nOf uh stating that we even thought of could be\n[laughter] well we had it going through as a category for my company from Sunday and as a matter of fact I\nI you know and and my dad used to always say to me the if you have to tell somebody said something you must not say it loud enough but not everybody hears things a few days away so uh it was actually is that we put it out publicly with the Patriot post\nWhich is a conservative blog I Do a Monday morning telling people that it's going to be but look here's the thing with this storm folks the first thing is this is not climate change or any evidence of it okay\nSo you could see this coming you could see the whole pattern coming H. back I talked to Shaun ... on the sixteenth of September I said I'll I'll be seen you get an October probably because of a big golf ... right now you said it right on the show I Know\nYeah right right on the show and you could see the pattern setting up\nEverything got together and that's why you see that every once in a while but let me put it in perspective I guess is the worst storm ever to hit between mobile camp I that I can find on records okay now you know whether ten thousand years ago something that we're ... we're not sugarcoat that\nBut on the other hand it's not because of your SUV All right this is what nature is capable of doing and you can see this pattern setting up\nPretty far in advance it's also one of only a handful of storms the last twenty five years including Harvey by the way that hit at its peak Andrew did that Camille did that I was in at its peak when it came into Florida was weakening off its peak\nMost of these hurricanes have we've been blessed and not like the thirties forties and fifties that hit on their peak now as far as the storm it was it it made landfall\nAs a borderline category five I'm ... and when it's all done they may call it a category five I'm not sure they're gonna have to go in and look at the damage but there's a lot more left to this storm folks\nBecause even though it's weakening hurricane force winds are going to go all the way in the central Georgia that'd be ... to one Seventy five but they're going to be ... to eighty Ninety a hundred miles an hour at ... you will escaped the worst of this\nBut I guess it's probably going to come right over Augusta very close to Columbia South

yesterday and appears to have Panama City Florida in the crosshairs right now not this is no joke in this nope and that paranoia to U.S officials are doing everything they can to get people out of

Dennis uh we're hearing my my show my radio show or is heard on a affiliates nationwide one of my affiliates is in Panama City a Ninety four point five FM and we have heard that there's thousand foot tower\nWas toppled a thousand foot radio tower has come down and we're also hearing that most of the uh am and FM stations in Panama City or all the air right now\nThat would not surprise me remembering Hurricane Andrew came across South Florida back in Ninety two how many uh television or radio towers came down and those kind of wins and Andrew was one fifty five one sixty one sixty five so you're in that neighborhood so I I'm not surprised that the towers would have come down\nA dentist one are you hearing as far as from people on the ground or water you gathering information wise on the amount of damage that has occurred so far\nWe haven't had anything on that other than what we're seeing on television right now our focus continues to be not where the storms are already gone but where it's going this is still a category for hurricane which is going to be leaving the Florida Panhandle and going into south western Georgia south western Georgia southern Georgia is going to get a hurricane\nA full blown hurricane or with all the impacts about wind and rain a going with it\nA dentist one area we're talking about dust ah we're talking about what what areas in southern Georgia you to get nailed\nWeren't talking to south western corner of Georgia that will be ... we're talking a going up towards kept Denver I'm making a Augusta they're all in the path of the storm and I'm going to South Carolina probably right on top of Columbia tomorrow\nNow do you expect it to weaken to a category three uh two at at what timeframe you know right now we're ... or ... which still a category for when does it we can and will it ... it will it quickly weaken\nIt and we'll spend down but the remember the storm is so strong it's going to take a while for the winter to spin down so this'll be a good one are good too easily going into Georgia could still be a free uh and we expected to be a hurricane tracking all across Georgia and down to a tropical storm strength as it gets into South Carolina tomorrow\nI saw a dentist I Know we've got a role here but uh I Would imagine that a hurricane of this nature a category to potentially hitting a well inland in southern or south western Georgia that have they ever seen that before\nA in where we're going back to the records or which go back to Eighteen fifty won the Florida Panhandle has never had a category for hurricane hit them never sent Eighteen fifty one so I'd have to go back and see if southern Georgia has ever had anything that powerful I doubt it but I I Can't be sure\nAh Dennis a big difference from southwestern
