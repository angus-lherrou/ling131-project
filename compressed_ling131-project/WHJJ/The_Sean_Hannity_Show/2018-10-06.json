wavering on this because you know I'm I'm a cabinet supporter\nI just couldn't believe this well organized attack and yet in a in a moment of frustration\nWith these other accusers coming out and just all of this detail and you don't even some Republican showing a whole lot of concern our earlier was it was earlier this week or late last well you know I said I I it was it was before the it was before the FBI investigation so bad for us right\nBefore the end so it would have been a late last week a at a moment where I just I was really depressed that I was on the show with all of this information all\nWho yeah I did sell my God I I think capital could be done here\nAnd you know I I'll I'll I'll take my lumps but listen I think I've rehabilitated myself over the course of the game last week here and and also I was I'm a cabinet supporter uh I ... I I I don't know how often you listen to the program but I've been very much on the attack\nA over this whole process on how despicable and how desperate and how cold water needed and scripted this whole attack process has been it's really nauseated may\nAnd I do you look at Kavanaugh's judicial record you look at all of those that said that his qualifications were matched unparalleled so I Do apologize Audrey for my moment of week this uh last week when I said\nWhen I when I said oh Mike oh my God I I I Can't believe what's what's going on here and remember what else that I Do remember what else I said along around that same time\nAfter the FBI investigation was agreed to\nAnd Jeff Flake remember a lot of conservatives a lot of Republicans were very aggravated and Jeff Flake\nFor that little meeting that little sidebar that little Hungary had with Chris Collins Democrat from Delaware\nAnd that I Want to say who are college I cuckoo's run I've got Susan Collins on the brain so when when ... met with Chris Coons from Delaware and they came up with this plan All right a flake wants a one week or a FBI investigation\nYou know what I said I also said at that moment on this program oh my God\nI think Jeff Flake just saved Brett Kavanaugh\nOn this program and remember\nI was getting yelled at from caller saying that one of your door you agree to the FBI investigation why are you saying that one flight did was a good thing why because I was a hundred percent right in that I told you that with this little a\nScheme that flake and cool those had\nHatched up no pun intended on or had a that this is going to be the saving grace this was gonna say uh the nomination and it happened the flake to win over so also homes I Wonder if he's getting cramped from Democrats because this little clues flake maneuver that\nHelped save\nCapital so Cohen Democrat he essentially has some responsibility and the fact that Kavanaugh is going to be confirmed as the next a next Supreme Court justice here but it's a simple folks Jeff Flake out going\nFlight who has enraged many Republicans and conservatives flake saved Kavanaugh you must realize that Audrey do you understand that\nOh yeah I Do and I called his office and encourage town even though he was leaving fan I'd that what is done now will affect the even now we don't live in his state\nAnd listen and Audrey I had people when I made the statement after we had this crazy maneuver or late last week on the FBI investigation and flake having the caviar on voting for a cabin on the full floor where he voted to to uh uh\nWithin the vote that he did make and then agreeing that we have to have this one week investigation when I said that flake his move was brilliant and this is actually the same time I had numerous calls on this show last friday\nI was getting yelled at that what are you doing why I mean I was getting yelled out what is now because they wanted me to just attack plane like no you have to go past just the emotional talk radio talking points and understand what's really happening here Audrey thanks for the call let's grab\nGary is in New York Gary uh where in New York are you\nA Gary are you there [noise]\nI guess Gary walked away let's let's say in New York I'll grab a call from white plains New York and here's rich Nextel rich\nHey taught you know what I was going to talk about something else but let's stick with Susan Collins and yeah you know it was a good speech he made but I think it's the the only speech she could've made in order to maintain her half Democrat half Republicans status if you will okay\nShe she could have gone the other way easily listen man is not a red state moon is a blue state\nWell let me let me get to the larger point okay I don't think that it should have\nEver want to or you know what they did offer a purple is but it's it's going but it's purple to blow is what's going on in Maine I go ahead\nI here's what I don't think it should have gotten this far I think this process should have stopped if the Grassley and the Republicans had\nA backbone and said look there's no way we can entertain allegations this area's just on the strength\nOf how well somebody tells the story so we're not saying you can't tell your story you can go to whatever news outlet you get shot at from the highest mountain we're just not going to use it in this a confirmation process\nWasn't there were any number of roads to take but ultimately rich did this not work out the right way\n[noise] I don't watch taught yeah you know the end result but\nIt sure Susan Collins circle back to what I just said\nRight there is no cooperation jumping never been to pay\nA hundred a hundred percent right by listen scorched earth the Democrat just shows how Frank should we are and this was the plan we knew from the beginning so it was one July nine ...

was the Blake issue last week and then we also have\nAudio of Orrin Hatch and he was also a a verbally assaulted by\nThese women you know it's it's like they're putting on a show it is it's it's like they're they're trying to just the gene up views on social media by by cornering in in trapping these members of Congress or the members of Congress that they don't like you know I mentioned Salem\nAnd you know the Salem witch issue from of many many many many years ago and that's what this is why it's like you are guilty until proven innocent\nI mean it's like prove you're Donald which I mean that's what the capital of the ... the all the cabinet accusations I mean that's what it feels like or even better yet with some of these protesters that we saw you know it was she was\nDozens and dozens that I saw a cup yesterday on the Senate floor it turns out it was over three hundred were actually arrested a not Santa floor but the the for the Senate office building yesterday and it it final count was over three hundred arrests is what I read a with these protesters and the mentality here\nYou know with the audio I'm about to play with Orrin Hatch or when he was confronted ... as he was going up in an elevator or in the Senate office building and uh\nWith the protesters with flake get those that are screaming those went McConnell's House yesterday with cases of a ... blue ribbon as they were having a you know ... beer party to protest cabin or\nYou know it's again it it's like the doing this for a combination of of entertainment value shock value and\nI'd be I can take them all seriously and you shouldn't either and there's almost this mentality yeah I'm going to be a little course here but there is this mentality with some of these people that if you have a penis your guilty doesn't matter\nIf you got that appendage your guilt doesn't matter what you say you're guilty and that's just not the case it's just it's grossly unfair I back to your calls in just a second if you want to get on eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine taken a lot of calls today on this a historic day in the fact that\nSusan Collins delivered an incredible speech\nIn her justification for a yes vote on Kavanaugh\n... which was just well written well research brilliantly delivered one of the best I've ever seen in laying out the case she didn't just say a yep after careful consideration and this and none of voting for cabinet no she laid out that case in\nBlistering detail I mean just incredible\nThat was like a legal arguments are from a brilliant attorney laid out from it and ... and getting from point a to point lead and getting firmly in squarely across the finish line before she announced that she would vote for Kavanaugh\nUh just incredible well [noise] you knew this was common so with Collins and a brilliant delivery and her affirmation that she'll vote for Kevin all we have this\n[noise] remember Jen Psaki Jen Psaki\nFormer White House communications director or red head or from the Obama administration so after Susan Collins said she's voting yes after she really legally\nDeaf I did you get a chance did you not hear how she laid up they don't care they just don't uh\nI mean it's like putting your fingers in here like a kitten going I\nMean that's what it's like here\nIgnoring all of the reasons why Susan Collins is a yes vote on Kavanaugh a yes vote rather on getting lazier folks a yes vote on a on Capitol so Jen Psaki former White House comes a director\nSo in a way um the the tower oh here's a ... a credible opportunity to recalibrate I'm sure that we're now in line with the deep deep blueprints of what it means to be a human being\nIs it a predictor\nOr good question you know that's that's a that's a a a controversial question I don't think so my myself um I I think it's more a reflector um but it it there is you can predict some things\nBut one of the problems with prediction from where I come from is um\n[noise] see I don't I don't believe that uh the future exists [laughter] um\nI you know I'm a or a present right power now guy yeah\nRight and it's it's all happening now it's all here interesting take\nYeah the future is there is a construct and show 'em when we talk about prediction we're looking at possibilities that are happening\nIn the present moment so and and that way it predicts\nWhen we talked about the ducks card I learned from you sense that that doesn't necessarily mean one is going to die\nI beg to differ I beg to differ\nYou you think now it means someone's gonna die\nAbsolutely absolutely because\nYou know I always thought it was maybe ... relationship or it could be that\nToo but you know what George everybody's going to die\nSooner or later everybody's going to die so of course it means someone's going to die it doesn't say when [laughter] so\nI remember you once asked me a art you said or if I get the death card does that mean I'm going to die\nAnd I said absolutely yes [laughter] and\nThen then you will liberated but we don't know where\nThey're less than but that's true with all the cards in the ...\nWhy would somebody pulled the card if they weren't going to die immediately\n[noise] um well well it's a\nGreat question and and my answer is because um as far as the Buddhist say I'm death is certain but at the time of death is I Know right right so\nI'm In ... in keeping with say the Tibetan book of the dead the understanding of being aware of the reality of dash\nAnd living each moment as if it were your last moment in a way or the only moment is a useful way of re calibrating your mind and so it's a part of reality it's nothing to be afraid of\n'em it's not all that pleasant to think about it either but it's just part of the existential reality of being human [noise]\nUm and and all these cards most every card in the narrow really though directs you point you to um\n... ... spirituality\nI'm being more ... you know every reading at the end of the day says um get more in touch with your spirituality get more in touch with your consciousness and um be more aware of the now\nThat's what the terror essentially says Everytime\nWell it's an

Fox News the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh now seems assured since for previously undecided senators have announced their intentions\nAnd Senator Graham of South Carolina joined us right now he's on the Senate Judiciary committee\nA senator good to talk to you thank you for joining us there's a lot going on Mitch McConnell just earlier said that the FBI report will be finished and we will have a boat on Capitol and uh I assume what's gonna happen at some point this week the way up any any timetable idea\n... I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here was the agreement with our colleagues\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like Chris but he was never part of the ... what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue around whether or not he's been honest about his drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and ... and the fall and incredible eat any credible lead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee\nWhen the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... or ... your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants to men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to nip FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar and so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is that saw a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one it said the goal was to take away\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy and twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets said ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a three witnesses that Dr Ford named Mr ... isn't there any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do yeah they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\nRight close to be limited in scope is now\nExpanded out into other allegations but it'd be a full one vote short you end up with a pretty interesting and thought polite\nYeah that I kind of like [noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delay legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if they fail one vote short just pull the plug he's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump\nMight be different I think Trump would say listen this man's been abused I'm not given up on him less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly ... he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yeah most Democrats will know no matter who Donald Trump test\nRide they've already against Gore sick\nYeah All right so now what's going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question Martha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins\nUm we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race\nAnd do you do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... towards claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're wanting to FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh vote costs world one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota wants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to these red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection and we talk to any oh\nI'm doing it right now uh\nSo you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher this about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know this is about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well and then we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short list they have ... we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days\nThirty five we can find yeah find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election use in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty did twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nOh it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people and their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care there's like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh as Heller qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just not a complicated issue for me if\nWe follow vote short a less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves\nA them ... [noise] yes no I think they handled properly because these are serious allegations but she identified in and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made I don't mind you've made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Kevin\n... is that those are the environment\nWe live in senator and I warn those audience on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or a conservative and you're running for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist appoint a massage it has to homophobic Xena fold Islamophobia you're going to be accused of wanting dirty air and water you're going to be accused of wanting to kill children\nAnd it's got to be all look alike of throwing a grandma over a cliff [laughter] it is as predictable as the day is long and now with Supreme Court nominees\nThis slander has been taken to a whole new level do you have a nice throwing incident when you were nine I mean it's ridiculous\n[laughter] yeah adding ice the thorn granny over the cliff is the new standard so Scott ridiculous it started as a brush fire again back to the doctor for she's been betrayed by the other side as much as\nIf you are struggling to pay off your debt do not let the credit card companies make you think that you have to call debt free dot com now for free information on how to get out of debt faster than you ever thought possible without bankruptcy we offer a guarantee with no upfront fees so there's no risk for the free information you need a\nCall now one eight hundred nine hundred nine seven eight for that one eight hundred nine hundred nine seven eight for one eight hundred nine hundred nine seven eight and ...\n\nAnd as we continue with Senator Lindsey\nGraham of South Carolina as we continue also from DC I'm a senator look where's this go from here you mentioned earlier that in fact that they're not going to be good people that ever want to say yes to yeah positions like this I wouldn't say yes who wants to live through this\nWell I think the the contrast asked a question here said there's a report out today or poll out today that at the FBI supplemental background check doesn't change things sixty percent of the people leave the judge Kevin I should be on the bench so if if if that doesn't you know all I can say is that the stakes are high\nWho would follow Kevin after this they will destroy everything we stand for us Republicans if we legitimize this it only happens to why is it always just a [laughter]\nThis is a time to fight back stand behind Kavanaugh get into votes he needs he's a great judge and destroy what I think it's been a process that will destroy the country\nI got to tell you I don't think anyone would even want to run for office under these conditions or you know even for you taken a strong position I mean you've been smeared in slandered or by all the right people just so yeah and people that have made too so I ...\nWell I don't think we've had to find out later on I don't think you had a fine or moment and all the years I've known you and\nYou know we've had disagreements over land a cake but Kagan Sotomayor there's two but I Do I mean where your righteous indignation and your leadership has has stood out and I applaud you for all you've done and\nAnd uh I Hope it works out the right way thank you sir\nThank you for the research you do to prove sack versus fiction you're you're the best on television talk about what actually is the truth or in\nA ... eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program could break right back we'll continue\nYou are listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show and stay tuned\nMore memorable moments interesting gas and a lot of fun coming up next [noise]\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's\nPremier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates stays locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or go to a rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial upheaval only about on certain three year fixed rate loan Scott precaution permission conditions people having winter licensing office he takes animal is number three thirty initial conditions are excluded may play\n... kills you just taken lives destroyed families and ruined childhoods we need to take action immediately the missile field a patient registry active twenty Seventeen we create a patient registry for researchers\nCancer and a a less habits missile researchers needed to we need to find a cure for this devastating disease for more information on this bipartisan bill visit I save team dot org that ice said team ...\nHey ...

I live in today I had a party and there are people that know about that part of\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of ... she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall a Julie sweating it another of the friends she named is just east we've reached out to the other two and hasn't turned back\nRight twenty five now till the top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing at all this was was absolute how does this passport news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago you would think she can stay consistent in a week\nAnd the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here that there was a a a systemic\nParty culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged\nWith ... and and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then line up outside the rule waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago and nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement\nAnd she gets the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote corroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that than we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news standard in any capacity here to put this on the air Byron York is joining us he's been running a lot of columns about there is not the least of which is how high the bar\nHas risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote\nNow you see that a Camille Harris she's now coming out with another allegation just today\nMyron hey Sean listen on this on this NBC thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds about it\nA war on on the basis of the lack of evidence and uh there's no way to stories should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bad but it was given in part a but due to the news networks um thing about Michael I have an anti her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that if you see that was recorded this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think where it was a parent to a lot of people\nAre there just wasn't nothing to this story [noise] um and when she offered a witnesses who could corroborate the stories you just played a one

confirming him just one hour go by the slimmest of margins\nOn this vote the eyes or fifty the Naser forty eight the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is confirmed\nOh my God [laughter] oh no Harry the polls are tightening oh my God no well what what does that tell you what what\nWhat what what's going on\nHere we are so many races that are within the margin of error\nMissouri Nevada Tennessee Florida the list goes on and on and on we have all of these close races which means we have a better estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls are often wonder how can wave in the Senate and house in the ... not in the house\nRepublican wave in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump means an impeachment of the Democrats get the house I don't think so but if they do it ... it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake clones in there because they would never vote to what took an effect\nIf the Republicans hold the Senate or even swelled the ranks so the panicked host Jim shoot I couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave red white and the Senate\nShe says\nThere was discussion of a blue wave big generic battled advantage for Democrats you'll notice that tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans you know there's a lot of talk oh with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation met that in fact that might hurt Republican but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening of the house races\nI'm going to get a little ... observation about this but what did I tell ya he's generic ballots way back last December that's when they first started harping on this\nAnd back then you know nine months ago the Democrats had a\nTwelve point advantage and that's when all the talk of a blue wave but yeah and that's what all the talk of the Democrats winning back Congress began and it went all through the year\nDemocrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them are Democrats once again broke away and all during it I your host have been doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything me remind you of a motivational technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will ... prior to one of the super bowl the patriots rarely might do it frequently\nA one time he gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're gonna have more fun we're going to watch a horse race he had videotape of a horse race that nobody at sea and it was not a big race they don't allow the players to make friends leave that said why Andrews on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bats and battle ... starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer bats tell me it was going to win players go nuts making their choices tape resumes\nThat like check stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds has the final turn ... stops the tape but the horse racing again asks the players if they want to make an additional ... or get out of ones they've\nMade players do what they do that much ... resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known as the first term at the halfway point or at the final attorney who is gonna win yet look what you want to do what you were making beds you bring guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line\nIs finish you never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter half time or third quarter finish doing your job\nSame thing here posing January\nIn front of the ... election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything\nThey're interesting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not a contained any of the Kavanaugh\nNews so how relevant could have been answered none zilch zero not up\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot they've had\nThis in in in the in the camp has been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting the calendar play out\nNow all of a sudden house races are tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nBut wave red wave and the Republicans could come out I didn't know where at about final inning take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August we don't want anything\nAnd we don't know anything now and we won't know anything until the day

production of last week that if the Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything that production of mine went viral a drive by loved it\nThey love it when the

world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them they run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite\n\nIt's just the exact opposite why all this attention on Kevin on what the Republican is actually going to help on how can they live on just said they weren't going to lose\nThey are totally totally confused and as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that\nWe have to do was in order to win and the people that will lead Kevin I'll go down that really find them up that will fire buddy up no the way you can get on the bandwagon the

I remember my visiting Saturn a man life is shattered\nNow that is not marketing for word mocking would have been to impersonator he didn't do that see this is what's wrong Donald Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have these are the\nQuestions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her to be credible\nShe's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge her she is the accuser so the Republicans they they they they played right along in what I'd had Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time we were all kind of curious to know what what the purpose was\nUm all Trump is still just reminding everybody what she said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country an accuser comes forward and you can't poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story depending on the day she's telling it\nWhatever it is it is it is not mocking Kristin balls the Ford\nNow Trump has a lot of people saying but this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing Trump woman\nNecessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far as to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable but he does it to them every time it\nGives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and the step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able\nTo parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally\nWhy there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense we've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and I was taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique he uses he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out of a ... the Paris climate accord what did he say\nClimate change very serious thing to do with a look at it than we are looking at it that it will do the right\nTo own is on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has a ...\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on something that he can make fun of things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell\nYou how it irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane it has made the with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump has been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand eight this was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much\nHe doesn't care anymore it doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows\nHe's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski and Collins or shuttering cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked multi for Trump didn't\nHe just simply pushy kick back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any crop racial for what she said why you're not relevant\nWhy does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accusing any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined the can you imagine if there was something going on they can you imagine a man organized for the express purpose\nOf destroying women you can't even imagine it can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell rush or a million women are no there should we do well\n... yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even ban and set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female range\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed and Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and they've been ridiculed and made fun of the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not\nUh in numbers but it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what the everybody following this knows even the Democrats are Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed Trump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous for our country that's what this is\nThat's what the Democratic party isn't so and that's what Democrats senators have said that the accused has to prove he didn't do it that the accuser doesn't have to corroborate anything the accuser doesn't have to prove anything where in what civilized society is that real\nWash 'em must be I hurt radio\nBy that oh by the topic\nBye bye Bye bye bye And you'll be [noise]\nBy law you don't have to be that

worm convinced that a significant chunk a grassroots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years I have no\nProblem admitting that I was unable to put this together is one of the rare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics for the solution or the river\nBed is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that or the individual that did something can\nBe made to pay a price for it that's what the uh the ... ... ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with\nThis no idea whatsoever so we ended up in a debate about whether [laughter] boys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on a girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate [noise]\nI'd say it ... it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various uh gems\nAnd the target is America the target as America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right lousy Ford\nWill end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth\nOr not it doesn't matter because it didn't happen to them\nThese women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case will be capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think\nWith black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nA all cops are bad every white cop is a rape every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country as large as being responsible in unfairness in bias and discrimination it racism all of this [noise]\nThe Democrat Party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these\nComplaints Democrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it\nAnd they never do they never the

got to pay whether\nHe did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't\nMind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the fact\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... ... email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocked she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media
