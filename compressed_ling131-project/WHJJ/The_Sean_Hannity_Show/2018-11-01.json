I don't I don't think that's a\nI Am ... correct in that but still we're a country of laws were a sovereign nation that has all the right to protect our border and the president is one hundred percent right but it is it's his duty as the president\nTo make sure this doesn't happen\nI mean we're in an audio bite of of Obama back before he was president he was Senator Obama from Illinois and he was talking about you have to immigrate to this country legally\nYou can't just a bar John in Obama's said this and I I don't want to plug for the year I'm sick and tired of a double standard\nSo on this Trump\nThis one a hundred percent right and as far as you know it's a lot of this a caravan and don't be scared of them was again I'm not scared of the care of and I just want our laws and our borders protective that's all I'm asking for\nAnd the president was asked by reporters dizzy fear mongering\nAlison I Do I think that the caravan is rife with all kinds of bad actors and so I think the Volcker or there are many MS Thirteen gang members or Middle Eastern terrorists I don't think that's the case\nBut cast at a ... you don't if I can even use that as an argument it's just we we're a sovereign nation that should be able to protect our borders and you just can't bash in our back door and say I'm coming in\nThat's what I Would stick with it or not drum up you know some of the bad actors\nThat have infiltrated the allegedly other care of it so we have all the right to defend regardless of you know if they're all good people but just want to come to the United states well guess what you just can't snap your fingers and Sam coming in\nSo I don't think the president is really fear mongering I just don't think he needs to talk about the you know all of the bad element which I I think he's exaggerating a little bit\nI and as far as ah and I was talking about I see the phones were jammed up here again a eight hundred eight zero one eighty I still have give them a Halloween pile eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of the nation wide number eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine it's how you get on the program and then regarding his commentary and again I joined the press or a little late as we're coming on the air at six minutes past the hour as the syndicated radio shows do\nA and the president was was talking about the DACA apparently and that if President Obama could uh uh essentially a bring us DACA by executive order that the president can cancel birthright\nWhich the fourteenth amendment provides for via executive order I from from my standpoint I'm not a legal expert on not a lawyer my wife is a and I've got lots of lawyer pounds here I've done a lot of reading on this obviously in the last couple of days\nAnd I I just don't you can't compare the fourteenth amendment and taking what's in the fourteenth amendment and trying to issue an executive order I don't know I I don't think you you can't compare that\nTo dock I think you're dealing with two different types of produce here apples and oranges are however again I I agree I don't like the anchor baby situation I don't like illegals coming into this country\nA and a woman dropping a kid out of nowhere and suddenly that kids a U.S citizen I'm Sorry I don't think our founding fathers I had that in mind with that with that said\nWas that said let me be very clear I think that the president if he does the issue an executive order essentially you know turning the off switch on elements of provisions of the fourteenth amendment it's going to be ruled unconstitutional the constitution allows for it\nOr do I agree with it uh in all senses no ill illegals coming to the country and having a Ken I'm Sorry I don't think that kid ought to be a US citizen automatically but the way our constitution and the amendment the fourteenth amendment to the constitution is written it allows this I don't agree with it\nAnd if Trump does try to pull the executive order it's going to be shot down a in in the federal court system it's going to be shot down on the federal court level the appeals level and ultimately the Supreme Court level I'm just telling you the way it is an eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine a nationwide number Iran Schmidt\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine if you want to get on we'll go to phones coming up in a bit I've got the Halloween pile but of course Trump just breaking news with him making comments reporter so I wanted to jump in\nWith the caravan and the fourteenth amendment debate which are obviously we extend we handled extensively on yesterday's program\nThe Schmidt roles are momentarily and hang out for my Halloween ...
