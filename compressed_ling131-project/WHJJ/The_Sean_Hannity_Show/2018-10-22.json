[noise]\nYou notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this\nIf you want to predict and it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida he'll do a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida as important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe it's not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got infinite whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd you know run the sadness about it a great debate last night and he's now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax Gillum would support the elements use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views he's\nTrying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected\nBy being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe and what they really want to fight for we saw that with Brett is said and the project ... tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but you\nKnow for whatever reason Brennan said is out there trying to convince the people tend to see that it's something that he is not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water\nAs they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position I'm Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill\nYou know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony\nShe goes on to an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets hoops to Harvey tour\nWith with wings unbelievable but some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it isn't in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cos\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody is against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront\nAt the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry I mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texas alone\nVictims of crimes some very serious including murder\nI mean it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing him a throwing those out the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for inferior coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled or Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year a and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or a evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty eighth to an election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half hour we're going to we're going to take control of the house in the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away looks like it's going to be Republican pickup Martha ... going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha mix Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo now we have a top Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations new Fox\nA poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about quote the blue wave\nAnd sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions amid fresh signs at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom ... who still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi who has her eyes on this\nSpeaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Rhonda Santa's becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black ... Marshall mixed Martha ... wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller hold this seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly problem for the Republican Braun in the state of Indiana is well in his particular case she's got a libertarian in the race\nAnd that means that the libertarian is typing votes away from the Republican broad\nMike Braun is now claiming that\nYou know a Brett Kavanaugh surge citing internal polling is now as a leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this an app to all of this this was an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is that an all time high but you know crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday in an attempt to boost\nDemocratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people\nA hundred and thirty thousand people have signed up they want to go see the Trump cruise rally tonight\nMean amazing I was down in Houston in Beaumont, Texas this weekend and and doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and and we had four thousand people around there a moment\nAt a huge crowd and used it as well we're doing better than crazy uncle Joe Bernie Sanders is warning his party that there's no blue wave coming and he also says that you can't win elections by alienating half the population and I hate to say it but I agree with Bernie you're absolutely right\nAnd you've got to force the hypocrisy so we got the cabin on your shoe you got the caravan coming you got more mobs over the weekend confronting and and showing nothing but mean spirited hostility to people that are trying to serve their country\nYou've got now two years of magnificent success record breaking jobs and opportunities for Americans it's where you have more safety and security are stronger president versus eight years of failure so we have a choice in this election\nAnd that would mean building the wall that he wanted to build that we can get done\nOr the president just spoke out about this will play it when we come back we have a lot to get to more than ... much more straight ahead [noise]\n\nEventually every soon to be retiring must just

confrontation that is coming to the southern border of the usa I've been down to this border what twelve Thirteen so why why ever many times I have seen it it's wide open\nWhat are we gonna what's gonna happen if we have to send our troops to the border what kind of crisis is going to be precipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports is even helping\nThe caravan or as make their way to our southern border president has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally that is now but down the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give it to them\nBut the president's also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... ... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty\nThey're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies that allow even criminal aliens to come into this country illegally\nWe have one case this was a out there around you know it just I mean it's basically a national emergency\nIf you look at it you have a Spanish

detention the borders in Central America not as strong as the U.S which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily\nA said Anna on Univision they cross from Costa Rica way to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country and yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh\nCan you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly [noise] um so you've got the care of and continuing

I think we're going to be fine ah but yeah we're at a ... couple of days we've been here in South Carolina last friday there were all over the place\nYou only get interesting to watch the states like California Southern California six important house seats that could yeah the the ... the balance of power in the house Minnesota has important races Ohio does Michigan does Pennsylvania and New York and New Jersey do\nYeah no I think in the end a shot when you look at the radical positions the leftist take I Would argue the most extreme positions in American history where they you know they applied ... just respect the flag they care on\nGovernor Cuomo when he said America was never that great and they they embrace it Maxine Waters when she got harassed anybody support our president\nContracts that there's infer wherever they want to take the country\nAs we've talked about before with what the president has accomplished at Twenty one month with his leadership in this country taxes regulations down economy growing it for ... percent lower on employment forty years overseas and cabin on the court out of the Iran deal embassy in Jerusalem and on and on we could go\nSo those are the competing visions those are the kind that's the contrast I think when American step back and look they're going to pick Republicans or we're going to keep the majority in the house\nBetween no due process for Kavanaugh no presumption of innocence for Kavanaugh these are core values that have served as well as a country and then you've got this lawless caravan and I I don't hear a single Democrat saying we've got to stop\nWhat is it looks like an invasion fourteen thousand people just want to run across the border maybe more\nAnd if that happens what's gonna happen after that\nIt's like a party that is basically given up on the rule of law unconstitutional and the values that have served do so well over these many years\nExactly right or the most extreme positions ... got closer with this comment you got\nFormer Secretary Clinton said oh yeah we'll get civil again once we have power\nThat's not really supposed to be this great nation and like you said before it's sort of tough to avoid the immigration issue when you've got this caravan marching north thousands and thousands of people um I think the president's right when he's talking about you're not going to get your foreign aid if this if this is going to continue\nAnd talking about putting hooks on the border putting troops on the board of hoarding National Guard in order to make sure\nThat we saw what happened last friday in Mexico at their border and then the fence was busted and people come running across now a ... it's almost like we're headed towards a major human confrontation here people that don't affect our laws and sovereignty and the president saying you must respect our laws and sovereignty\nUm no I I think Democrats ally go in the back of their heads hoping this happens southern all maybe something bad will happen and Trump will look bad and we can blame him as someone gets hurt\nYeah you never know I Hope I Hope not I pray not yeah\nSame here but I Will tell you want on Saturday I had a a person from Honduras who came here legally and when that lady kind is it a Republican event Saturday morning in our home town in Urbana, Ohio she came up to me and she said\nI'm sick of this kind of stuff she did it the right way she came here legally came here because she loves this great nation wanted a choice for her goals and dreams in this great nation\nThat's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happen and the and the possible political implications\nAnd motivations behind these things\nThat's what bothers me the most and I think it is\nCommon sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming assign um aren't legitimate or asylum seekers that's a problem that we know that's probably what this this group is is mostly about as well\nWe also have this issue of the mob that no Democrat seems willing to confront on either I mean you know we saw what we watched Ted Cruz and his wife get out of a restaurant by an angry left wing mob we watch that happen a Pam Bondi at a movie theater we watch that happen a secretary Nielsen we watch that happen to Sarah Sanders\nA we saw Mitch McConnell go through this at the airport and then this weekend that happened a again a let me play a little of the McConnell confrontation and then you have the liberal media you know literally and then we have now Kissinger was shouted down listen to some of this\n\nHe was down like ten twelve point three weeks ago he's now that it was in one point that's what happening because\nOur guys are working hard good candidates working hard at the American people are waking up to the

fact fifty two percent of people say being middle aged just means someone is more likely to know what they want out of life\nSo what does some of the top signs that you have reached middle age well apparently the biggest sinus that you start to notice people at your job who aren't your age\nAnd they're young enough to be your kids will go on a positive note another sinus that you suffer fools less than when the or you were younger so here the top ten science that you approach theory of hit middle aged and pretend\nYou feel you know more about politics than ever before\nOur number nine is you'll love scouring the home and garden story I Walk on the floor is in a hardware store okay you accept your now address size bigger and there's nothing that can do about town man\nNever seven being happy to spend big money on things that you know we're going to last like a garden fence or maybe some new flooring in your home number six you start considering the cruise holiday\nNumber five you realize you're older than most of the authors actors and musicians that you laid up number for\nYou visit the up to visit who the I doctor after realizing you perhaps do need glasses after all okay\nOur number three you start checking your face and body for gray hairs and number two you suffer fools less than they did previously and like we said number one you start to notice that people at your work aren't to your age and could potentially be a kid I think the\nTime I recognized it for the very first time as when I went to a baseball game looked around and every player at every position was younger than I was oh now ... are not good not good no secret that women for the most part don't or in the same amount of money as men often when they are doing the very same job which is incredibly unfair\nThe gender pay gap is real turns out though there are some states where women are treated a bit more equally than\nThey are and others go banking rates come up Christine it with a list of the states with the biggest and the smallest gender big gaps in the results are a little surprising\nYeah you know what I gotta agree they are surprising ... the thing with the smallest gender pay gap is Florida with that gap at six thousand dollars say\nAnd although it may not be necessary uh necessarily for the best reason to say that the gap is small because the states it's the state where a male employees and the least in the nation [laughter] okay well that makes sense right so the median income for men is thirty three thousand seven hundred and forty five dollars well women earn about eighty percent of that\nWhich looks at twenty seven thousand\nTwo hundred right now some of these just surprising the top ten states with the smallest gender pay gap shoot can start with number tent alright number can is New York state again yeah OK number nine of Tennessee number eight is New Mexico number seven as Arkansas number six is Hawaii rounding up the top ten\nFive states for the smallest gender pay gap number five is North Carolina gotta say surprised by that number four is Vermont for three is Arizona number two is Nevada and\nFlorida came in at numerals now on the other end of the spectrum Wyoming has the worst gender pay gap which is about Nineteen thousand bucks while the median income for a man is forty five thousand six hundred for a woman twenty six thousand two hundred dollars a top ten states with the worst pay gender gap number\nTen Massachusetts wow I got it so surprised by that one number nine is Alaska is another one of surprises me New Jersey is number eight number seven is Connecticut uprising that began to Delaware Okay Number five is Washington state Washington state number four is Louisiana\nNumber three is North Dakota to as Utah and as we said number one the worst gender pay gap in the nation is Wyoming I think the thing that jumps off the page the most surprising for me as Massachusetts Gangnam pretend\nI'm with you and you know at Florida being number one a little bit surprising but I'm like a master has Rhode Island Rhode Island ranked number Eighteen ... not too bad the pay gap here being around roughly ten and a half thousand dollars and\nThat's where we ranked after Seventeen years in prison a former NFL player will walk out a free man today Fox is meant ... tunnel fills us in\nCarolina Panthers wide receiver rake her roof is scheduled to be released as early as eight am eastern time this morning from the Simpson correctional institution quitting North Carolina he's been there since two thousand

Adams his girlfriend who was eight months pregnant with their son at the time of her death streak\nAdams died four weeks after the shooting her recruits son chancellor Adams survived suffering from cerebral palsy as a result of complications when the shooting of his mother chancellor Adams is expected to be waiting outside the prison with his grandmother when Cruz is released from jail ... Fox News you would think\nSelfish people would end up with more money right but a new study finds\nThat's not the case scientists from Stockholm University the Institute of future studies and the University of South Carolina they conducted an experiment\nAnd a researcher there said that the result is clear in both the American and European data that most unselfish people have the most kids and the moderately unselfish received the highest salaries\nAnd they also found this result over time the people who are most generous at one point in time had the largest salary increases when researchers revisit them later in time study offers believe than improved social relationship\nMaybe the key to generous people success from an economic perspective but they know the research doesn't really prove all of that no details on that\nSocial media can seem pointless at times\nTurns out as we do a little bit earlier it's a useful tool that can reduce the risk of depression and senior citizens who suffer with pain University of Michigan researchers used data from a nationally representative surveying involving more than three thousand four hundred Medicare beneficiaries\nFrom the ages of sixty five an older in two thousand and eleven and they found that Seventeen percent that they had used a social networking site in the last month\nAnd that those who experienced pain were less likely to participate in social activities that require face to face interactions which offers mental benefits during job using social media can help with issues\nLack of real life social interaction brings were those older folks suffering with pain when researchers added that this is critical because the onset of pain can often lead to a downward spiral of social isolation and depression resulting an adverse outcome where the health of older adults so bottom line social media buffers\nDepression among older adults with pain so finally we have a positive story\nWhen it comes to the social media\nDaily rewind withdrawing we're our line crime or Meryl\nBecause this is the same old playbook with all were fleeing drug gangs were doing this we're doing I mean it's like they're reading off of a script\nI mean we've talked I use the same line mostly go with the the previous caravan because\nPeople getting interviewed and it's all the drug lords the drug gangs they've threatened my family they they threaten my Sundays he wouldn't joined the gang and I mean it's like they're like three different stories just like you want to pick one from column a pick one from column B I mean that's what it's like\nAnd then it is it is upon us and we are a ... supposed and when we're we're uh we're expected to\nOpen up the door because of a group of folks there parading toward the United states of America and it is incumbent upon all of us to let them\n[noise]\nAnd we don't then of course the United states we're heartless we are not sympathetic and it's really all at the hands of vis a vis Trump go oh speaking of trapeze speaking right now hang on a medical we get some audio just out\nThere right now they have a lot of different things happening with respect your friends gender right now you know that as well as I Do and we're looking at it very seriously [noise] president from everybody you know what I'm\nI'm protecting everybody I Want to protect our guy or transgender as your\nQuestions about turkey and show he gets going to be I think they wanted to see that our motors died and I am a hundred percent [noise] ah we have I mean you've been reporting over a hundred thousand people they lined up two days ago and it's very exciting\nI think that will be a big factor that I got to get up you're going to make a great speech I'm going to get up I'm going to make a great speech by ... votes you going you're not going I Can't believe it you're not going to be there because I Love 'em [laughter]\nI think\nBetter ... highly overrated [laughter] when I heard about him I figured you must be something a little ... not and I voted got beaten badly in the debate I think he's a highly overrated guy\nFriends I think that having ... won the White House lawn or something I'm very happy\nTo get along very well and I do worry about it as all the time was over when it was over ... I like to remember the last one I really had I mean I was talking\nAbout very badger be the helicopter noise very loud right now but talking about very natural with Ted Cruz\nHas got back from a very re re for them\nYou know politics folks in the audio is not right now he's moving closer to a helicopter and the the background noise is a kind of overwhelming you know the question was the last ... let me see if we can hear any better\nAt\nIt just to the microphone that we're listening to it's it's just that it's too far away I mean\nThe background noises grabbing the president out now I saw a number of questions there he talked about a turkey and the latest with a to show game will get into that obviously during the course of the program today\nAlso the last question just asked were about Ted Cruz and he was asked about lie and Ted Cruz of course the president's going all in for Cruz reelection over a barrel Rourke in\nTexas which you can imagine you know ten crows before we get back to the migrant caravan sponsored by dodge caravan for all of your caravan babies so ah regarding Ted Cruz has been taking\nOn some flak from uh from some angles on his coziness now with Trump when they had very heated words and some were attacked the attacking Ted Cruz or why are you ... with Trump now he attacked your wife he went after your wife's looks et cetera blah blah\nAnd listen politics folks to do I really need to explain this [laughter]\nThe enemy of my enemy is my friend come on I I don't need to do or you know explanation one on one and and go all remedial here on the show I'm not going to do it we know our politics are and ah\nThat's it folks weren't eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine apparently President Trump just said that\nAre in response to him calling a Ted Cruz line pit crews in the past that he's not lying Ted Cruz anymore he's now beautiful\nTad [laughter] at least\nI'll bring it up the audio from the leave the White House\nThe full video just out on this\nAnd I\nGet a deadly it's just it's just not clear it up to\n[noise] to discern I back to the caravan and we're going to grab your calls on this caravan and just a bit\nAgain this manufactured crisis or if you've been following the president's tweets I Want to go over a tweet from about a day go and then a couple of tweets this morning on the caravan I mentioned this story about this uh this woman\nRosalie Guillermo\nAnd you know CNN did a whole you know heart string hugging profile on this woman\nAnd like what's the matter with you hey hey mama what the hell is the matter with you you're in danger when your kids sweltering heat you've got the kids being dangled awful Loughner off a bridge trying to get them off the bridge on to a a makeshift\nA unsafe looking raft\nOn on this river\nAh which the bridges crossing from Guatemala into Mexico in his preposterous\nAnd ... again be entitlement tear the belief and all they have to say is we don't like our country or we don't feel safe in our country and what we were coming to the United states and just because the declaration is made and we've got a caravan\nOh we've got a con boy we got a great big convoy members saw [laughter]\nAnd then the United states has to let us him again it is a preposterous notion here and CNN you know this this emotional video piece on this woman Roseland Guillermo I also saw story at our website which I printed out\nA she climb through a hole in the fence of the bridge and took hold of the ladder\nThe solid hard concrete crossing held no promise of a future for her and said she decided it was better to be lowered down to the fast moving waters of the one of a river that is where people pulled her onto a raft of water in the inner tubes [noise]\nYeah I don't think it would pass cos guarding inspect should let me let me just be very clear here or there she watches her children want as young as three were gripped by strangers to follow them down you know there's just it's ridiculous [noise]\nBy the way the caravan is far away I you know is the caravan getting even make it to the United states I mean they're they're Fifteen hundred miles away but the president\nRightfully so is issuing statements he's issuing threats we talked about the military threat on friday logistically illegally there could be some issues there but again\nThe president is correct that the countries where these people are fleeing it's incumbent and it's their responsibility it's incumbent upon them and their responsibility to control the population as the president still speaking\nOn my back a little microphone er and I\nFind you shouldn't\nHave come up they want to get at is that you are as many places in California you want to get out of ... ah yeah it is right against them\n[noise]\nAh he answers questions about your show he and the Saudis\nOn a reporter's question but what I find that we can find out if I Know a lot of visitors about why\nSo again the basket ... answering a lot of the same question about the show him inside his situation and the president say we're going to learn a lot less I'm I've got some issues with the president ...
