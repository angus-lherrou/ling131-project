Fox News floor together to Rick Scott gives you an update on the damage from hurricane Michael ... has\nRule to not screw around with a elections sort of like a an unwritten sixteen day period prior to an election and here we have the midterms obviously coming up in less than a month but things that you'll understand and you'll you'll recognize have been kinda quiet\nOn the bottom ... a lot of ground to cover a lot of patient folks on hold if you want to get in on the program any aspect a hurricane Michael again\nOr if you're in the panhandle would love to hear from you eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine or if you've had contact\nWith anybody any relatives friends in the in the Florida Panhandle in the affected areas would love to grab recalls eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of course Kanye and Trump and the white has lots of ground to cover folks\nBack to the phones let's head fill is\nOn Long Island in New York Phyllis Iran Schmidt welcome to the program I\nThank you very much I just want to say that the optics of a Trump going to the rally may not have been good\nBut it is not as bad as about that going to play golf after Daniel heroin they had it and after James Foley was they had it and then he went and got the after four Americans were slaughtered\nSo that was not good\n[laughter] well listen I I Know that when an event happens with Trump we can go back and look at you know there's been any previous criticism\nAnd ... this the the tit for tat back and forth it's it's going to go on there'll be comparisons it always happens regardless of who the president was is whether it was Obama and comparing him to Bush or Clinton or whomever\nSo if it's always going to happen you know one of the things that has has given the Trump critics a little bit of animal here feel is is that back in November of twenty twelve\nTrump actually tweeted out or his displeasure\nBecause uh he tweeted that yesterday Obama campaign was Jay Z and ... and spring steam while Hurricane Sandy victims across New York and New Jersey are still decimated by Sandy wrong\nOr exclamation point so you know Trump even he tried to tag Obama for campaigning with Bruce Springsteen and rapper Jay Z or in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy and of course super sore storm Sandy which I did a lot of damage in New York and New Jersey\nYes so\nYou can see how it goes both ways so I went with Trump going to the rally you can understand that his critics criticize him when in fact he did something similar by criticizing Obama\nYes I say OK fine thank you very\nWell thank you very much for the call I appreciate Brian is next Brian is in a beautiful Tampa Bay Florida Brian you're on Smith hello [noise]\n... it's strange to me how the press treats meetings with Trump and tiny west like he's meeting with toting there's some world leader that's the only bizarre thing I think about all thing she's a friend a Trump whatever but why get so much press in tiny has got to understand that\nThey're just waiting for Trump to say something or him to the to slip up and say something that is that they don't really care what Conway has to say\nNo I don't think I I I think you're right I don't think they care what Kanye West has to say however uh what does the press or you know especially with the Trump presidency what what is the press waiting for what what uh what do they\nHave a good thing if they're way down from his town when\nI never listened to his music you're writing it I I never listen to music or anything but I did think is is statement on\nUh how did it go a ... they were talking about slavery and the slavery you know been on for ten years or something he says it sounds like a choice to me and I thought that was just\nFascinating and I never really thought about that but it's it's just like you know you're Jewish I mean you know there was times where there was five or ten thousand a Jewish folks there they could overcome the guards you know some sometimes you got to just make the move and break free and I think\nThat our Bryan Bryan Bryan as far as far as you know you're you're suggesting that that uh during the Holocaust city in the concentration camps that the Jews there could have overpowered the guards in in these concentration camps when that's\nNot not that don't get me wrong yeah you're you're my buddy I I'm just I'm thinking if I was there and you you and I see [laughter] we got something going\nYou know it's in part by by any means well wasn't as a hindsight\nIs always twenty twenty number one but also a lot of the Jews were deceived they they they didn't always know what they were in store for granted a last week we can talk about the Holocaust for a a week straight on the program but yeah the the fact that\nIt was all ... all ... us\nYou know you add a ss guards you know with machine guns I you know it's not it's a lot easier to say oh yeah they should have risen up and overthrown the guards or listen it's it's a lot easier said than done\nYeah I was in a bank robbery about Fifteen Years when I arrived buddies fan 'cause it turned\nOut the guy only had a a pellet gun you know one of those Crossman black guys yeah now what an average jumped all [laughter] this last I said you wrote you would have probably you know you're an aide in in your ... and I almost it also and there was an ex police officer and the bank to and then you get scared when there's a\nGuy so they'll get I get the spinning around on your your your criticizing Jews were not rising up and no and I'm actually on the other side\nI'm I'm just I'm just saying that that that I think that at some point you know slavery whatever becomes a light I think you spend it becomes a lifestyle and you just gotta always resisted\nConcept reason is I go on a you know going back\nAgain I don't subscribe to that the slaves or could have prevented their plight I mean there's a lot to discuss regarding slavery as well we don't have the time but one last thing before I let you go where was this bank robbery that you were in Fifteen Years ago that was\nThe Miami it used to be a you know a daily thing back in\nThe eighties so my question my question is this how many people were in the bank other than the bank robber\nUh probably three or four tell us about ten or eleven folks than are mainly five or six out in a you know on the other side of the\nThing okay so let's go with a dozen people against was one bank robbers why didn't you guys rise up have a nice day Brian

Bush caring about black people on up and then ... music he uses the N. word and all kinds of stuff in his music ... he was no good then\nBut now all of a sudden he's embraced and I just think that it's ridiculous and he is being treated as a token so that Donald Trump can say oh look I have\nThis guy this black guy who is supposed to be very popular in the black community which he's not as popular as it used to be because of these rent but he's been going on the strengthening thing um and so we can point to him\nSo so and that kind of name calling in and get both only participating in it\nI said you're saying it's sort of tantamount to or the white guy that says hey you know I've got a black friend is that what you're saying\nOkay a thousand percent I mean the president went on Fox and friends this morning and basically said you just wide and said that his popularity in the black community went up twenty five percent when Carney endorsed him\nAbsolutely not true but I Do that's not even measure of all and this is the guy that was on Saturday Night live a couple of weeks ago dressed in a Perrier outfit\nBesides on anything come on\nGuys on ice ... let me ask a question you as a conservative your entire adult life or a black female or working in geopolitics uh and you've been outspoken against the many policies of Trump for his behavior or it'll what we've seen\nHas has proper the White House have they ever reached out to you have a ever they would try to have a conversation with you and what's your issue what's your problem we try to bring you into the fold or have they ever tried to have a conversation\nNo but I Do know um I you know folks in the White House I mean like I said I I've been in Republican politics or twenty five years with more than twenty or I Do know a lot of people in the White House had friends that work there but they know repair the way that this White House ... thirty functional\nIt there is no room for any difference of opinion it's all about blind loyalty I mean my very good French or Michael single and moved to a young black Republicans aren't as a whip you went over to a hut with a with Ben Carson who needed that needed the help believe me\nAnd um they removed him from his position because they went back and discovers she wrote a critical article about Donald Trump during the during the campaign\nAide literally escorted him out with the security because of that despite the fact that he was confident smart and desert his position [laughter] this is not a this is not an administration that welcomes any kind of difference of opinion or even confidence necessarily in in in in there who they choose for a certain position [noise]\nTo just say one other thing really ... out this about that the attack\nThat I've been eating are people feeling uncomfortable with the word negro on\nI set a tongue in cheek to make a ... a strong point about kind of the hypocrisy of people and the way that they're treating ... versus other um in in the past I mean no one was upset with Rush Limbaugh when he for eight years\nDisrespectful this especially in my opinion used to play a parity called rock the Magic Negro\nAnd that was unacceptable now we're talking about the president the United states I wasn't a ... than I didn't vote for him I was against the policy that he did an awful thing for this country but you don't disrespect I don't care what the parity or not he called ... it was called ...\nThe Magic Negro where all these people who are attacking me for making the point I made about ... anything like that um\nWhen with with that I think that that's hip hop or see also the word negro in the black community is not like the N word it's different you have still have United negro college on the national council of negro women right and it looked colloquial term that's used in the black community a little bit differently\nNot like the N word I I don't justify that but\nSo everyone needs to really just take a step back\nAnd think about the point that I was making and and look at the way the economy the haves and hypocrisy and look at what he did today in the oval office\nThat was so disrespectful so demeaning and and and just not what the Oval Office she'd be I remember when Republicans\nFreaked out when Brock Obama invited common\nTo the White House who's actually an old guy may disagree with some of his rap lyrics yup but these are all very talented intellectual actually does do good work and his community and Republicans were excoriated the president for that but they're okay with this clown Kanye West\nClowning himself and disrespect ... at this way and the president inviting them to do it all to the\nSoldier you subscribe to the salt the Kanye West is only in it for Kanye West\nA hundred percent you know\nAnd I don't think you can help it I mean we're not looking if anyone is looking at this guy he clearly needs\nHelp and I was not by any means locking people with mental illness either that somehow that got thrown out there which is not the case at all I was simply pointing out um material back\nThat he had been hospitalized for emotional issues and that he's he claimed he was diagnosed bipolar but then he he himself today\nDismissed that and that you know he he just missed\nEven his own diagnosis and talk to them jumbled less about that so but this has nothing to do with that he's not actively seeking help to it you know to get better like a lot of people who do struggle with is do and they shouldn't be elevated than exploited if they're having an

despise the N. word and when I hear black people try to justify that no black people when they use the N word it ends in a a versus when white people use it it ends in ... or earlier and it's there for your thoughts\n[noise] though I agree with you I mean that that term is so violent wants associated with that\nTerm is beyond the pale and I agree there is a complete double standard when it comes to that and then you can and then when white people turn around and use the term thinking at that time of the\nGermans it's a little confusing so do I don't subscribe to that the issue with me grow where and the reason why I say it doesn't quite have that ... thing yes it's associated with Jim Crow and there were ... to ... with the e grow but there's\nAlso a like I said a historic um value to that word that different than the N. word that it's still use\nLike I said with organizations today in the black community like the United\n[noise]\n\nI\nTo go [noise]\nWhy don't we take pride in

I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you got a notice this week notice the market went down ... up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stop but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations have businesses with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again and that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations and\nWhat they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash of about the whole having a hearing it how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this week where I'm\nMcCaskill is losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I Know also Joe Donnelly is now down right and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want jobs\nAnd what's scary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nDo you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your poetry to raise taxes take what you've got and take away the jobs take away the pay raises and the vast majority of Americans don't want to go back to that I mean we had polls in September with\nWere Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfair will among all voters she has she has the fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country to these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play or Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats\nThey're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where you know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoug shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house\nBut I think the Senate you have to have been looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort but those as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice that won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average is gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively in the direction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the value of New York\nBut I've noticed which is a pretty hard core left wing said even in a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that I Know but if I got I got to tell you that you know he actually said those conservative\nThat it is not me it's\nA stem cell or are they really are\nRight now is it that there are actually are conservative set of notice that it's not a\nSimple number one Hans within a rifle no\nUh um right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nUm so but there's no place for me in the state of New York and he said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be a governor and everything you love and vote for one's me out of town\nSo I Am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to\nPromote Hannity whenever office would like to run for I think my friend John and I can\n... the ... ... well you disabuse our friend Doug the very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNow I I I think look you're still the kid from Franklin square you're still you're still in hand with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because we New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax may have jobs but by the way Doug fold than out on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\n... I heard it Oh yes I don't I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him 'cause he's moving so far left\nTed it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash but\nBut I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get for a Democrat primary these days because they're so radical and that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing and the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important in midterms in our lifetime because\nYou really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we are basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be garden govern have control of their own healthcare but\nBut if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker she will be the most powerful elected\n\nEventually every soon to be retiring must just I should I go it alone or get them out before you make a decision\nOr all Jess Massey invest an hour of your time with ... people listen internally he learned into a retirement strategy personal ... or whether that using investment or insurance or vote ... put it on paper or you can take it home kick the tires or talk it over\nYou might discover just what you were looking for you done this for more than Thirty years for hundreds of ... you are like anyone else in your retirement strategy will reflect\nFor your own personal retirement strategy on jet massing\nAll won three three three thousand four zero one three the three eight zero zero zero\nMandy and associate thing\nOr oh one C. three three three thousand\nFour zero one three three three thousand\nInvestment advisory services offered only my duty registered individuals to me well management of the uh\nRadio nine twenty four seven up and here's what's happening in\nProvidence College mourning the death of a student Augustus car Delaware Nineteen year old sophomore from Westport, Connecticut ... die during the ... will be available throughout the weekend that's off the barricade Michael now stands at Thirteen latest confirmed deaths include poor people killed and separate storm related incidents in Gadsden County Florida\nAnd tonight's mega millions jak are drawing an estimated five hundred forty eight million dollars to get news twenty four seven on demand at news radio R.

West\nYou know using that profanity in the oval office in and folks trying to hit me back with the moral equivalence you want to buy that will be drink water bug Nixon folks I brought that up yesterday I talked about that I even talked about the salty language of LBJ and Richard Nixon and others\nIn in the White House I've talked about it but to draw a moral equivalence of a president versus\nA ... an invited guest in time you ate who kept hounding on the resolute desk\nI was just off in every direction I mean he he just he doesn't look or seem well I don't think I'm telling you the guy's missing marbles when he talked about he was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder editor he really I sleep deprivation I'm Sorry I Know there is something that is wrong with Kanye West\nAnd I'm

mean there's there's something that's not right with Kanye West and what is what is this belief that just because President Trump invites Kanye West Kanye West goes off on this this crazy a rambling meander fast with profanity that\nJust because the president invited a tiny to the White House it technically it was really Jared Kushner are based on prison reform but there was not much prison reform talk yesterday why is it\nBack if I support the president in most of his policies and I give them plenty of praise in what he's accomplished so far why is it that if I criticize one thing or if I'm like whoa Kanye was just out of his mind that suddenly\nI'm part of the liberal media how dare you folks this is insane I mean we're living in ... in a crazy world we're living in this this ah this universe is time now where things just seemed topsy turvy\nAnd the the all out a Trump supporters who if you don't agree with everything\nThat I get attacked\nSo I called on Congress economy
