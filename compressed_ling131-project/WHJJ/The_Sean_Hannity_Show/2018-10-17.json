strategy she injured herself she took her bow and arrow [laughter]\nShe she unilaterally shot herself so that wasn't because the point is is that even many Democrats\nOr liberal sympathizers or mainstream media democratic sympathizers are calling her out and saying that oh she stepped in it so that really that wasn't a concerted a plan by Democrats with a a a target\nTactic none of that was her team that was her advisors or maybe hurt maybe she overall I'd love to know I'd love to have been a fly on the wall inside her political advisors her campaign folks\nYou know those itchy process

that type of an autocracy or you have\nThe ability to do whatever the hell you want without checks and balances and that's what they did here obviously but they've gotten caught which is a big problem

do you go to the embassy well he went into the embassy because he's getting married to his new fiance but apparently he needed new paperwork and documentation he needed Saudi Government approval to

Fox News President Trump warning of a rush to judgment when it comes to the disappearance of journalist Jim all cause she'll be at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul it's evidence now that the Saudis had something to do with it\nSoil I Know there's nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without NBS knowing it was ... he's the thirty three year old crown prince who jumped him over other people he's the son of the thinking\nThat's Mohammed bin style mom that's M. B.\nS. and I think he's on a on a bad track I can never do business with Saudi Arabia again until we get this behind the sprint and what does that mean I mean I'm not going back to Saudi Arabia is longest discuss in charge so you're selling the crown prince has to leave this up to them but I'm not going to I've been their biggest selling\nLindsey Graham is try to power play this that that they have to if it turns out that MBBS Mohammed bin ... month this cocky prints crown prince\nMost likely he ordered the hit but did his father did the king no that's the big question here\nLindsey Graham is essentially power playing saying that the Trump and better do something that this administration better\nDo something if it turns out that\nThey were responsible and they knew as you know they're trying to pass it lowered down the chain that they didn't know that this was an operation they weren't aware of which what are the initials for Mohammed bin Salman NBS yeah take them away it's just BS\nBecause of course they know everything and then one of the sound bite and then we'll move on to horse face this is Marco Rubio junior senator Florida on with CNN and Alison camera rotted this morning talking about\nA human rights that well the audio bite is very self explanatory on the show you murder is one\nJournalist gruesome murder enough to blow that up [noise]\nFar can tell you the human rights is worth borrowing and learning from one end to a conflict where they're thereby murdered dismembered and dispose of as a big deal\nAnd by the way this happens to be a green card holder the United states and uh who who have had been a journalist but he could have been you know a maintenance worker and at the Washington Post there wasn't a matter as a human being whose wife was taken\nBy the direct act of a foreign government by lowering them into a ... a diplomatic facility and a third country I mean any one of those factors is bad put them all together and it's catastrophic\nAnd as far as arms sales are concerned it's not the money you know there are other countries we can solve that too important and it's just not to my ... and an arms sales does give us leverage over country when they have our weapons systems they need our our maintenance they need our voice ... men and the like and it gives us leverage over their behavior you know that's why we're talking about arms sales now because it's leverage\nBy those weapons from someone else but I don't know I don't care how much money and is there isn't enough money in the world to purchase back\nOur credibility on human rights and uh and the the way nations to conduct themselves right\nSo you've got Lindsey Graham who is been a very close ally of the president especially of late with capital a Marco Rubio the sea of two Republicans here are speaking out and\nIf the Trump Administration doesn't do anything if it's proved that the Saudis more responsible and this was all just a horrific stupid plot gone bad or discovered\nOr does this put a whole bunch of Republican senators are Democrats or automatic but listen I mean both with writers right and if the Saudis did this I mean there has to be consequences\nAnd you can't just say oh I'm a I'm a I'm a ... a hat wearing from supporting a lump Trump everything Trump all Trump all the time you can't if the Trump the if the prophecy goes easy here I mean that's just it's the wrong thing to do from a humanitarian from what's right\nFrom a moral standpoint I there's got to be a a ton of bricks coming down on the ... and there's got to be punishment\nAnd the president has alluded to that it'll be very very bad again this interview that's coming up on Fox Business tonight alludes to that and I'm confident in this case the president will do the right thing now horse face\nAnybody want to comment anybody okay with the president calling Stormy Daniels horse face\nThat was a very important question ... this could be the most important question of the day you the Schmidt listener so Trump had a victory President Trump\nTweets warning in Lebanon for am eastern time federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump Trump is entitled to full legal fees\nAnd Fox News grapes now I can go after a horse face at her third rate lawyer and the great state of Texas she confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total\n... on my question for you the listeners nationwide is\nOn the president's tweet about the federal judge throwing out the suit the ... the the president can gloat about that if he wants but should the president of the United states call this woman horse face is that fair game\nIs a truck can say whatever he wants and he's shown that to be the case and that's what's made many aspects of is a political rising a successful but are there limits or is there decorum\nShould Trump have called the porn star Stormy Daniels horse face\nAnd ... and the number to call eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine I Love to hear from you on this horse things appropriate or not [noise] eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine is the nationwide number\nSo just a quick little recap here a federal district court judge in California yesterday ruled to dismiss the Stormy Daniels defamation lawsuit against the president and also ordered that Stormy Daniels pay his legal fees for the defense of the case up until\nNow she filed suit against Trump in response to his tweet which called into question her claim about a man threatening her in a\nParking lot remember that April Eighteenth\nA sketch years later about a nonexistent man a total con job playing the fake news media for fools but they know that was the Trump tweet\nThen of course Trump tweeted this morning the whole horse face steal a few minutes later Michael Avon body tweeted his response to Trump's tweet\nCold you are disgusting massage units and an embarrassment to the United states bring everything you have because we're going to demonstrate to the world what a complete shy there and lie or you are\nHow many other women did you cheat on your wife with wild you had

hate Trump they're not offering any plans for the forgotten men and women in this country what did they run on Obama's record which I've repeated over and over and over and over and over again of economic failure\nOr that they're going to run on what how to protect the country was open borders we already know what the results are the the impact or criminal justice system our educational system our healthcare system\nWe I've been to the drug warehouses and the human trafficking that happens every single day was open borders presidents building the wall he spent three and a half billion he wants to twenty five billion and asked you blow see of course that's not going to ever happen that okay well then you have a choice\nYou're going to have a choice\nIn twenty days you want you want to give you a crumbs back you want to pay higher taxes both for the Democrats you want to enlist investigations an impeachment vote for the Democrats open borders vote for the Democrats Obamacare you're

that once the hits and he's going to be who he really is\nWe say in Missouri and with Claire McCaskill now what a phony she is no admitted no difference between her and Obama\nAnd her anti Second Amendment positions Planned Parenthood support that they hide and everything in between and I can't imagine the Christian cinema is going to win and Arizona after she has been exposed to all the ways that she's been exposed\nTo see them when happening in their ways [laughter] I mean in the way we're going to make sense the low here and [laughter]\nLindsey are famous in Arizona ... when the low

organized anti war rally you know and then of course a she has no problem is if people want to join the Taliban\nI mean the people at Martha ... tally is a war hero\nI just I cannot imagine for a second that sentiment can win this race at this point\nSo the Senate is looking good you know my hope is is that three weeks from today when the results are in and we're looking at them I'll be able to say the Republicans have held on to the house because you got up and voted\nAnd you made sure that Nancy Pelosi didn't become the speaker to stop the progress that we have made which is significant\nIn the past two years we now have instead of Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps under Obama eight million more in poverty and no president never went\nOh I didn't attire presidents ... eight years without a single year three percent GDP Growth well I Hope you're going to support the for a million new jobs we've had since Trump selected eight million out of poverty and off for food stamps and these elected four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs the largest tax cut in history\nThe the greatest amount of deregulation we've ever seen in in five generations in this country including literally now putting in position in place an explosion of American energy independence\nYou know by allowing coal money to continue in West Virginia or Kentucky and allowing\nGas to be you know to fracking to take place in allowing add more to be open and pipelines to be built\nAnd putting up a let's see constitutional is on the Supreme Court in lower courts in the country\nI mean and then of course you know everyone that thought he would start you know little rocket man fire and fury my button is bigger than yours and works of World War three is coming no little rocket man stopped blinked\nCapitulate as hostages home remains have been sent home a we have nuclear test site shut down and now talk of denuclearization of the entire peninsula oh the president shouldn't challenge our allies in NATO even though they don't pay their fair share that benefits them\nTo have the the NATO alliance far more than us but we're paying Seventy two cents of every dollar and now they're the president say they need to step up and pay their fair share well now they're doing it\nAnd similarly Western European countries that have been unfair with us trade wise well if you don't say that you're going to have a tear up against them they're never going to negotiate\nAnd the fear of the tariffs has caused them all to negotiate that means more jobs at home look at you know look at the the the new deal with ah Canada Mexico\nThat helps American workers in Ohio and Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania you know bringing back manufacturing look what it's done to the steel industry which is seeing a revitalization thank God jobs that have never coming back four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs\nComing back why because the president negotiated you want to go backwards there's it that's what your choices\nSo we're either going to get together three weeks from today and talk about okay huge wins Republicans hold the house in the Senate or we could talk about huge losses it'll you know speaker elect below sea\nUh let's see majority elects Chuck Schumer and if we can either be talking about cinema losing in Arizona Heller winning in Nevada Joe Donnelly say Bye

British newspapers are saying circus official Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that that in fact happened on the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely the show he could have broadcast the signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi consulate had the ... wire dab transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll

James O'Keefe\nYou know you are hated by people because of what you're doing it there I'm ... I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive them nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just auditor discuss\nAnd I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most hating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen either Senate candidates one of them as a United States senator had been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage I mean it's\nIt's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri their their their local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journalists do not want to talk about this in fact I just got a bike all the Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about some of these position I said what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much hate me Sean for good reason\nWell listen when you expose fraud what this is now what's supposed is something that I've been pointing out for a while we have Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and every time they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five\nThen we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda why campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about that ... that is really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is polite and ... who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now on the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees that McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding\nHiding in masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us to take the money to ... indirect means\nIn order to I guess appealed to moderate to the front page New York times story today about how these pro life pro gun Democrats were shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we the American people had it when the Democratic party a band in any sense of\nDue process under the law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute capital was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then went all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so called corroborating stories fell apart\nThey still didn't care and I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you got these anarchist middle class of dangers attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nA name as state representative Sarah Anderson punched by an anarchist EPA trying to stop him from kicking her campaigns on\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but I think ... shining a light on truth I thought this was the stuff that's sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill's statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable I Know you play a little bit on your show last night and she had been quoted she says well it started with Josh Hawley us to her opponent would be part of ... betting someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay away from candidates I investigate candidates but she just went on TV on Claire McCaskill just falsely stated that Josh was involved in the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud\nWell we'll we'll buy what were courting the people being honest that's far\nIn their own their own their own with our son\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for staffers nixed a roast about how she's going to impeach Trump and she didn't tell the moderates to get over it\nAfter she gets elected that's their words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting to expose the truth and and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and then you wouldn't do an accusation\nJust glad that you were able to get all of this out and before the election um\nI Do I suspect that there's probably going to be more tape other candidates I have known you know what for a decade or more\nThat's right yeah I mean ... you know am I Am oh a pun intended Missouri now you know my ... next to release a candidate a bit of the time he gets to the United states senators\nAnd their candidates opposing them responding to our investigative work we're lying in their responses were sort of you to send me Lenski tactics against the Olympic ... was to get the reaction and use the reaction in the reaction to the reaction\nWe have two reactions now and we're going to the next day we'll be releasing another video early next week and a very very a battleground state [noise] same theme Sean ... they have to lie and then once they get elected do deal bait and switch through\nAnd do what they actually intend to do when it's interest on videotape stopped by words stopped my claims are not giving you unsubstantiated\nA hundred nine four one Sean is our number\nThose ads by Jeff deal was born while she does have to get re elected a senator or she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is\nNative American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she listed herself as a Native American and the director of the association of American law schools he identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the\nAverage white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career her political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThen tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics the worse than I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nNow the question is I I Know that Massachusetts slant solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but do you really want to let somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell do you have to deal is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and Mitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible Jeff that uh the people of Massachusetts can wake up how you doing\nToday showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm a ... round one when he ran again with\nA ... state that was the models were they on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston patrolman association has never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H.

B. S. that's a Mohammad bin ... he's the crown prince\nThat his goon squad and we even have names and faces attached to him and his top level of security that flew him\nI folks I I don't think trust me

would explode into this international come full of grace in this incident of humongous proportions\nIn which of the world is horrified and what appears to be an official state sanctioned hit\nA nasty when you hear the details and we've been talking about this for a couple of days but my question\nTo you is for radio and TV viewers and listeners the question is what should the Trump Administration
